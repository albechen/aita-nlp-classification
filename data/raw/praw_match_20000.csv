2,Asshole,"I like sex.  I've amassed a small bundle of fun sex toys to have sex with.  All of them were bought during my previous relationship, and all were used at one point or another with my former girlfriend.  

&#x200B;

After the 3rd or 4th time I had sex with my current girlfriend, I busted out my ""fuck box"" which contained my sex toys.  We've been having fun with them for a couple of weeks now.  We were browsing an online sex store earlier, and she noticed one of my toys had a newer model.  I said yeah, that makes sense.  The one I have was purchased a couple of years ago.  She asked, ""So its been just sitting around ever since?""  Of course I'm like no...I was in a relationship so we used it?  Who buys sex toys just to sit around?  

&#x200B;

Her face soured immediately.  I used a fucking sex toy on her that I also used with another girl?  Do I know how disgusting that is?  Do I know how disrespectful that is?  My honest answer, to both questions, was No?  I mean, I bought them.  Of course I'm going to use them.  I have also went above and beyond the cleaning recommendations by the factory.  If they have been sitting for awhile, they are completely re-cleaned again.  They're completely safe.  

&#x200B;

She disagrees.  How dare I use something on her that I used on another woman.  Sorry for being graphic, but my response was, ""I've used my dick on 20 other women, half of which I don't even remember their names.  The toys are way cleaner than me, but you're not complaining about that?""  She says thats different.  How am ITA here?",360,311,0.85
3,Not the A-hole,"My wife (29 F) and I (30 M) got married last week Saturday. Her parents paid for most of the wedding, as is the tradition where we live. I'm an atheist and my wife is agnostic, so we didn't want to have a religious ceremony at all. Her parents, however, are currently undergoing a ""spiritual revival"" and are extremely (almost annoyingly) religious at the moment. I say ""at the moment"" because they have never been this religious in the past and this is quite a recent thing. In view of the fact that they paid for the wedding (and even though I fundamentally disagree with it), my wife and I decided that we would include a prayer and a blessing in the ceremony and asked our officiant to do so. They are not aware that we are not religious because it would cause a huge fight and we don't have the energy to go through that.

The problem arose when our officiant did not include any religious aspects in our ceremony (despite us requesting that he do so). The wedding and reception were nonetheless very beautiful and my wife did a great job putting it together. My wife's parents seemed fine the whole night. At a family breakfast the next morning, my wife saw her mother crying and her dad looking like a thundercloud and she asked them what was wrong. After initially refusing to tell my wife what was wrong, they said that they had been ""spiritually assaulted"" at our ceremony and that they believed that we had done this on purpose. They wanted to wait until December to discuss it with us!! 

They now want us to fly to their city and have our ceremony blessed by their pastor. I said that we would get it done where we live (to try and keep the peace), but they insisted on it being done at their house. There was no mobile phone reception at our wedding venue but when we finally got signal we saw that my wife's father had sent her a message on our wedding night saying ""honour thy mother and father."" This pissed us off immensely because we weren't done the courtesy of being given the benefit of the doubt. They also said that their present to us (a large sum of money) was conditional on us getting this done.

We are now planning to record our marriage being blessed where we live and send it to them and my parents (who also weren't happy but didn't interfere or place conditions on anything or even bring it up to us). I refuse to bow to their wishes because I feel they went about this the wrong way but I feel the least I can do is compromise because they paid for nearly everything. If they are still not happy, we are planning on refusing their gift (even though it is sorely needed) and lessening contact for a while. AITA?",26,34,0.82

5,Not the A-hole,"My little brother (who's 5) and I (f13) were playing games online on the living room laptop. Our dad was watching TV near us. There was an ad for pride month beside one game, with something like ""gay is okay"" written in our language. So my brother read the first short word (gay) and asked me what it was. I explained to him it's when boys fall in love with boys or girls with girls.

Our dad heard that and he was sort of mad, saying my brother's too little for that talk. He closed the laptop and didn't let us use it anymore that afternoon. Then he probably told our mom because she also gave me a lesson on how I can't tell my brother such adult stuff.

6,Asshole,"This happened 2 days ago but I couldn’t post until now. 

I was in the meat section and you know how you queue and the meat person kind of calls you in the order you arrived. 

I arrived first. I had a large cart with me. The meat guy was busy. I left my cart there to go grab some crackers in a nearby aisle and I made a motion to the meat man that I would be right back. He gave me a understanding nod. 

I was gone for about 1 minute. When I came back, an old man of about 70 was standing there. The meat man finally finished the customer he had originally been serving and then he looked at me and asked how he could help

The old man yelled and said I was here first. He just got here. The meat man tried to explain that I had just stepped away but the man wasn’t having it. The man began yelling at me for being a line cutter etc. I just decided I didn’t want a confrontation and I ignored him and started ordering my meat. The man got in my face but I only see him in my peripheral vision, I am still not looking. Finally I had enough and I stepped directly in front of him and kind of bumped him back so he wouldn’t bother the meat man. He kept yelling and I bumped him again while my order was being processed. 

Finally my order was done and I got my meat. The man was still mumbling so while I was leaving I hit his cart with my cart hard so it knocked it about 5 inches and walked away. He kept yelling as I left. AITA for this?
I feel like I was justified but I don’t know too if I overreacted and just want honest opinions.",59,71,0.82
7,Asshole,"So a friend of mine had been in a couple bands over the years I saw and liked and I was excited about his new project. He told me one day that they had been booked for their first show opening for a more popular touring band and told me the date, venue and time. I congratulated him and said I could go. He then handed me a poster for it and asked if I would put any up. I looked at the lineup and told him I wouldn't because I had heard of last band before the headliner and knew they were Christian.

He got a little upset and said that yes they were ""spirit filled hardcore"" and he's not Christian either, but he had seen them before and met them, they were a good group of guys (and girl), they weren't particularly preachy or conservative, their lyrics aren't very blatantly Christian (most bands of this type don't have lyrics like in church or Christian contemporary like ""Jesus Jesus we love you Jesus"" over and over, they're contemplative and personal but from a very Christian perspective and that still makes me uncomfortable) and musically they're actually pretty good. And that this was a 21+ show in a bar I like and not some cheesy church owned youth venue. I told him that I was opposed to using the scene and hardcore/punk to promote religion at all and could not in good conscience financially support this show. He said ""Fine!"" and walked off in a huff.

I did see his band's next couple shows and supported him but he did seem pretty upset about that at the time. Was I being unreasonable?",420,764,0.85
8,Asshole,"It's a clickbaity title but hear me out.

The year I was born my dad had an affair with a woman named Catalina. It was an affair that lasted arround 3 months and almost broke up my parents marriage.
I wasn't aware of the fact till very recently.

I am pregnant and am expecting a girl. Last night when I was talking to my mom she asked me if we had thought of any names. I tell her that I have always wanted to name my daughter Catalina as I think the name is beautiful. My mom is very serious and insists that we can not name her that and to please think of something new.

I said no I love that name and so does bf. My mom breaks down and tells me the story.

Now I am conflicted. Because I love that name and I dont want to resign... But I would inflicting emotional damage on my mom.

Bf tells me mom has to get over it. Because it is our daughter but my aunt tells me that I should think about her and her feelings.

I am leaning towards naming my daughter Catalina.

AITA???

Edit : some people are saying I am not consistent because I called a person Character. It's just the Translation that popped up when I searched it.

The name is so important to us because Catalina was the woman that took me in overseas and Introduced me to bf and died a couple of moths ago.

Edit2:I think I am ta here. I will talk to both my mom and bf and see if we can settle for Catalina as a middle name

Edit3: a commet pointed out that my Catalina would not want this. I think they are completely right. I will talk to bf and rather than the middle name we can find like a short name like cat to give her the essence of the name but not the name that would hurt my mom. Thanks for your help even if some comments were mean spirited.

Update : I had lunch with my mom and showed her this post and your responses. She was horrified by some things you guys said (some of the meaner things like I don't care about my mom and that I am a horrible human being and even one saying my mom will tell my daughter someday the meaning behind her name because she is vindictive.)
It was a nice conclusion to the topic. My mom herself liked the idea of the middle name very much and insisted we keep it as she doenst want to deprive my boyfriend from that choice. And yesterday evening we decided we are going to use my mom's second name as the first name for my daughter (a thing wich brought her to tears). All in all she doenst want my father's ex affair to have a grip on her life any longer and did indeed decide to take up therapy after her breakdown. So our life's are better than ever. She got the big secret off her shoulders, I will not be attempting to make amends with my father and my mom is giving her happiness a shot.

9,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because privacy is nice. I’m a little dyslexic so apologies if it’s a little messy in places. 

Edit: in the UK

I am 27, GF is 25. We’ve been officially together for about 2 months and at the 2-3 week mark she moved 3 ish hours drive away temporarily for work - it sucked as its a new relationship but it was only temporary so we tried the long distance thing. It was unfortunate timing. She hated it there and had awful accommodation. We would video chat every day - multiple times a day - but the connection wasn’t great so it still sucked. 

She had 3 days off in a row so we decided it would be a good time for her to come visit and get away from the terrible accommodation and get some good food (as she wasn’t really able to prepare proper food where she was at). The options were bus two hours to then connect to another bus 2 hours to my town where I’d pick her up, or I drive 3 hours to hers and then immediately 3 hours back (guests were not allowed in her accommodation due to it being work accommodation). I knew she was incredibly upset with the situation so I decided to try to be the hero and drive up and get her. 7 hours later we arrive back at mine and I am exhausted from the drive. 3 days later, I take her back to work with another 7 hour round trip. 

We discuss that it’s a bit crazy to do all that driving when it’s not that much more expensive to get a bus which she can sleep on/watch movies etc. Instead of me getting exhausted from 7 hours continuous concentration. I’m not even sure what the legal time is that truckers are allowed to drive for in one go but I’m pretty sure it’s less than 7 hours. edit: I’m wrong about this time, damn truckers are solid and do long hours. 

Some time passes and obviously we’re missing each other. She manages to get 6 days in a row off. Score! So I thought. She asked me to come pick her up again, which I said I couldn’t because it was so draining last time that it made me unwell for the week (on-going health issues in the background) and it would be better if she got public transport so we could enjoy the time together more. I said I would help with the money and go halves with her (considering I paid for all of the petrol for the last visit I think halves the second time is fair).  She refused and then said she would come for only 4 days as a friend would go and get her instead on the later day. Then that friend suddenly can’t do it either so she says she won’t come at all. 

This all happened over the course of 2 days. I was incredibly excited that I get to spend 6 whole days, and then 4 whole days with my lady. And then she just doesn’t want to come at all because she has to take a bus. She couldn’t be bothered to sleep/watch movies for 4 hours while it’s perfectly acceptable for me to drive for 6-7 hours straight. I called her out on it saying it was selfish and she didn’t think of me. 

She ended the relationship there and then. 

I asked if she only liked me when I was doing things for her, obviously she got super offended and now I’m the asshole in her opinion.

10,No A-holes here,"My wife(27F) and I(28M) have been married 2 years together for 6. We have been planning to have a baby for a few months and finally she has gotten pregnant. We were both happy, or so I thought. About a month after finding out she sits me down and tells me she wants to abort the baby,

I’m shocked. She says “I don’t think I can support a child right now.” I told her we both agreed to it and if you didn’t want to have a child you should’ve told me you wanted one. She responsed “I did want one then but not now after I’ve thought about.” We continue to argue some more then I tell her “ if you abort the child I’m going to divorce you.” I walked out and drove to my parents house.

She texts me telling me to Come back but I’ve ignored her. I would’ve been fine about it if she didn’t agree to it beforehand but her changing her mind on something this big doesn’t go well with me.

AITA for telling my wife I’m going to divorce here if she has an abortion.

TLDR; Wife agrees to have child one month after finding out she pregnant she tells me she wants to abort it. I tell here I will divorce her if she does.",1112,1929,0.91

12,Not the A-hole,"I've (17F) had issues with my toenails since childhood. Recently I had to have two of them extracted again because of a bad infection. So right now, I don't have any nails on my great toes, but the wounds are cleared up and there's basically just smooth skin. Nothing special.

My friends (a group of 17-18F/M) are being way too dramatic about this. They think my nail problems are extremely gross and play up their disgust for laughs. It was funny at first but it's annoying at this point.

When I told them I was going to get my bandages taken off for good, they asked me how I would mask the lack of nails. So I said I wouldn't and probably shouldn't at the moment because they have to grow back on.

They said I shouldn't be a jerk and make other people uncomfortable by wearing open toe shoes. It's really not that gross at all, I think they're being too dramatic. Besides it's summer and suffocatingly hot in here, no sane person's wearing sneakers and socks anymore.

AITA for not accommodating my friends?",65,192,0.95
13,Asshole,"So my two longtime friends, one for 20 years, sent out their wedding invites which I got yesterday. Simple invites, addressed envelope with a simple single card inside. I happen to have a gf of almost two years. Both of my friends know her, have hung out with her, been to parties, dinners, ski trips, etc. My gf does not live with me. So I get the invite and its addressed to ""My Full Name and Guest"". The inside card was not addressed. This seemed odd to me, so I checked a bunch of wedding sites and they all said that couples invites should have both names, whether they live together or not. Or you send and invite to each person if you know both of them well.

So I text my two soon to be married friends, I thank them for the invite, tell them how excited I am, and then say that I was disheartened that they didn't include my gf's name on the invite. They are not apologetic. At all. They say that they meant no disrespect but that was the way they were told to do it by their wedding planner, that it makes perfect sense to them, and they see nothing wrong with it.

Fair enough, I respond that based on what I read I still think it should have both our names. The whole time I'm just picturing what would have happened had my gf come over the day I got the invite and seen that she was ""and guest"". I mean would anyone NOT be a bit bothered by that?

So my one friend responds again that it was so rude for me to even bring this up, and shes so upset that she's shaking. They also say a couple times that I was the only person that even got a +1 (we don't have any other single friends even dating anyone) and seem to imply that  I'm being ungrateful for the +1 by even bringing this up. Again, I just think of how my gf would feel being referred to as ""and guest"". I apologized to them again and say I meant to offense, and left it at that.

AITA for thinking my gf should be addressed by her name on a wedding invite?

&#x200B;

Update: After reading that I was universally determined to be the asshole, I sent my friends a long email and apologized fully. That being said I still don't agree with most of the comments (the spirit of the comments, not that I wasn't an asshole). I don't think this is friendship ruining, and I feel bad for you and your friends if you do. I think many people didn't read my entire post, or didn't read it well, based on many of the reactions and assumptions made. I don't see how this made me self centered or think that i'm the center of the universe. I also don't think that just because people are getting married they are exempt from ever doing anything wrong. At the end of the day I saw this as one friend trying to address being a little hurt, intentionally or not, by two other friends, and I don't agree with many of the characterizations suggesting otherwise.

But I appreciate all the feed back and it's given me a lot to think about, even over something that at the end of the day is fairly minor.

Also this was my first reddit post, so it was one to remember!

Update #2: Won't be replying anymore. I only meant to clarify and explain various aspects of what happened. Thanks for all the advice.

**Final Update: Well reddit may have been correct in calling me an asshole, but not much else. After writing my apologetic email, my friend wrote back and said they actually thought it was initially romantic that I stuck up for my gf, but then they got offended when it seemed like I didn't buy their reasoning, which is 100% valid. They then said that everything is totally fine, of course they still want us at the wedding (I had joked that I hope we were still invited), and that we should plan a double date soon.**

**So for those of you that jumped right to this being a friendship ruiner...y'all are some oversensitive, petty peeps. Talk to your friends. If you think this is the kind of thing that ends friendships, you've got some pretty weak friendships. PEACE!**",444,723,0.82
14,Not the A-hole,"So my BF and I have been together nearly three years at this point and he's planning on getting into the military at the end of the year.

Us and two other roommates are about to move into a larger rental home to accommodate all of our needs and give us more privacy from each other.

The BF and I usually take the master as our roommates are single, but we split everything evenly which roughly equates to the BF and I paying half of the bills with our combined portions.

The BF and I have been discussing practicalities and trying to plan for him to be away from home (and thus be unable to control most of his accounts while abroad) and we've got most everything ironed out except for this: I want him to continue paying his portion of rent while he's away.

His portion is just shy of $500 while he's expecting to make just shy of 2k per month to start with while away. I'm not asking him to pay utilities (he won't be using them obvs) or anything, but I feel that it's only fair he continue paying his portion of rent.

Why?

We're about to get a more expensive place and putting a double portion on me is incredibly unfair as my income could not reasonably support that. If he's going to stop paying when he's away then I don't want to move.

His stuff will be here. Safe and cared for. Including his car.

He'll be living here when back from deployment- to a home completely put together with all of his stuff just waiting for him.

To him- if he's not living here then he shouldn't have to pay anything. We discuss it often and I see his point but I really can't budge on this not only because it doesn't make sense financially but it also makes me feel taken advantage of.

If he wants to be totally removed from his responsibilities at home that's cool- but he can take his stuff to his parents house then and let me and the roommates find a place that suit our needs only. I can't help but feel he wants everything to be as easy as possible without contributing to it.

He's pretty staunch on his position and I'm starting to wonder if I'm the asshole here?",72,44,0.87
15,Not the A-hole,"My (28F) ex husband (31M) has been an addict for almost half of his life. When we first met, he was upfront about his past usage, but at that point, he was clean. We dated for two years before we had our daughter, got married shortly after that, and then ten months later, I was filing for divorce. 

During our relationship, he slipped into alcoholism. Around the time we got married, when our daughter was an infant, he relapsed on drugs. He hid his drug usage from me, though we would argue a lot about his drinking. After a night where I found myself wrestling his shotgun away from him, I fled with my daughter. It was a week before her first birthday. 

My intent when I left was to reconcile after he was clean and safe to be around. When he threatened both my and my daughter’s life, I filed for divorce and obtained a temporary protective order. Our divorce took 13 months, largely so that he could remain on my insurance to go to rehab, which I was more than happy to do. The divorce ended after two rounds of mediation, where it was agreed that I would have full custody, and he would have visitation at my discretion, provided he had clean drug tests. 

The divorce was finalized over two years ago. In that time, his drug addiction got much, much worse. The verbal and emotional abuse escalated as well. This past February, I received hundreds of angry, threatening texts and had dozens of incoherent voicemails. I attempted to obtain a no contact order of some sort from the court, but was denied. 

Throughout the entire divorce process and in the years following, only my parents knew what was happening. It changed in February. I posted screenshots of some of the texts I had received. Opening up about what was happening in my life was, admittedly, cathartic. It was nice to not feel alone and to receive support. 

In March, he went to rehab again. For the first time, he actually stayed the full 90 days and completed the program. I was able to unblock him from my phone, and we’ve had some good conversations since then. He asked me a few days ago if I had posted anything about his past behavior, and I told him that I had. 

Today, he called me and asked me to remove the post. He explained it was causing him extreme anxiety, and even asked if I actually wanted him to be sober. I told him that of course I want him to be clean and be able to actually be a father to our daughter (now almost 4), but I wasn’t going to take it down. 

It feels to me that he is trying to place the responsibility of his sobriety and success on me. It also feels like taking it down would be covering up for him, yet again. I spent years struggling with his abuse alone, and I just don’t want to do that again.

18,Asshole,"## Took my niece and nephew to the park today. There are only few people in the swing enclosure, me and the kids and another young couple with two kids playing in the sand pit area and a man by himself on one of the swings.

At first I didn't think any thing of the man on the swing. As im pushing my niece on the swing I start to take note of the man next to us on the swing by him self. He looked liked he was in his late 30's, white male, he is wearing black jeans, dark blue jacket, tinted glasses and a black hat, and he has his phone out. I start to notice, he is kind of pointing his phone in the direction of the sand pit area which is about 40 feet away, where there is couple facing away from us and their two kids. At this point im not sure but I think he was taking pictures of the kids in the sand pit area. I get closer and im standing few feet away from him with my body turned towards my niece's swing but my head directly at his phone. Suspicion confirmed, he is taking pictures of the kids in the sand pit. He wasn't taking pictures like you would normally, with the phone in front of your face so you can see the picture on the screen, it was at a weird angle, he had his phone down my his knees and taking pictures from there.

Thoughts are running through my head, should I tell the parents of the couple, should I call the police, should I confront him? By this time me and kids are moving to different part of the swing area and my thought is, if he points that phone at my kids direction, then im going to lay into him.

Anyway I couldn't help my self, to me this guy was a low life, scum of the earth, loner type, probably part of some online ring. It is out of character for me but just went up to the guy and im standing too close to him for comfort, right in his face and said ''what are you doing, your taking pictures of those kids''. I felt so ready to unleash all my wrath on this guy and he just said '' yeah, that is my kid''.

Tuned out one of the kids was his and his kid decided to go play in sand pit with another random kid. I apologised and kind of explained myself, he and I both had an awkward laugh and moved on. I felt bad because after I did that, he started calling out to his kid, just to prove that in fact was his kid some loner in a park taking picture of random kids . AITA?

Firstly I am happy I wrote this. I believe criticism to be a good thing and its proofed to be correct because in all honesty I didn't see my faults in this situation until reading some of your lots comments. I didn't think I was the AH before posting this but now I think I probably was. Controlling your emotions is not easy and I guess I let them get the better of me at that time. There was a better way to handle this. Now I regret what I said and could have approached it in a better manner.

After reading some of the comments, I think some people assumed I am a women and have a issue with dads taking kids to park, but im a uncle taking my kids to the park.

I am shocked at people thinking AITA for saying anything or approaching anyone (clear from the downvotes, this is one time I could not give a dame about downvotes. ). If i live that moment again and picture what I saw, I would do it again a million times. but in a better manner of course. 

&#x200B;

Lastly do I regret approaching said person, dame no, I am happy I was wrong but everyone should have the guts to stand up and say something if shit  don't look right, how would I have felt if I didn't say anything, would this title have read, AITA for not saying anything, when I saw a guy taking picture of kids at a park?",125,129,0.82

21,Not the A-hole,"So my husband and I switch off on who buys groceries each trip and it’s kind of agreed upon that the person buying gets to pick the snacks. Only every time we get ice cream, it’s always gone before I have the chance to buy any.

I’m currently about 20 weeks pregnant and when I want something to eat it’s nice to have it at the house.. So my husband is allergic to peaches. He doesn’t go into anaphylactic shock or anything, but he does break out in hives really bad if he eats them so we tend to just avoid the fruit altogether.

I am about to take my grocery shopping turn.. Will I be the asshole if I buy peaches and cream ice cream so that I can have it for just me?

22,Not the A-hole,"Earlier this year, I (F, late-20s) went to a wedding for a friend of my family. During the reception, one of my aunts (B) and uncles (D) started talking to a couple at our table. B, D, and the couple started to say disgusting things about diverse groups of people. They referred to transgender individuals as “he-shes” who are “a shame to their own gender,” choosing to “disfigure themselves.” They said that gay people were “just wrong” and that they were “grateful” that they did not touch a gay person’s water glass, because they would have contracted a disease. They also said that black people “can’t be trusted.” 

Their comments made my stomach turn. I interjected a few times, saying things along the lines of “that’s not right,” “this is not appropriate conversation for a wedding” and “you all are making me uncomfortable.” Not wanting to cause a fight at the wedding, these were attempts to de-escalate the situation, even though my blood was boiling. About 20 minutes in, my dad—who was sitting next to me—ended up yelling at B, D, and the couple, saying they disgust him and should never be talking so hatefully about others. B and D immediately got up and left the reception.

Most of my family doesn’t know this, but I am bisexual—meaning attracted to two or more genders—and one of my best friends was a male-to-female trans woman who was murdered a few years ago. Needless to say, these are HUGELY sensitive topics to me. Even though they don’t know about my sexuality, I’ve talked with B and D about controversial subjects like this in the past in a calm, collected way. Their receptiveness varies, but they’ve never been this openly hateful. I used to be very close to B and D since they helped raise me, but the hate they’ve displayed towards me and my people is intolerable. So, I am going low/no contact. **I feel confident that I am not the asshole for choosing this path. However, I am worried I might be an asshole for how I plan to go about it.**

I have not talked to B and D after this incident. They live several hours away, and I am not investing money in travel to travel for this. I would talk to them on the phone, but I doubt I would stay composed enough to articulate myself. So, I plan to write B and D a letter that shares how I feel about the incident, why it bothers me, who I am (super not straight), and what boundaries I am enforcing now. I want to convey that I will not put up with toxicity and hate aimed at me and those I love, but that I hope one day they will have the love and compassion in their hearts to reevaluate what they stand for. I feel like some type of communication is needed, because my extended family gets together about 15 times per year.

My brother told me I am a coward for writing a letter instead of talking face-to-face, and I've already gotten some flack from extended family for not just ignoring B & D. So, Reddit, would I be the asshole for going about things this way?",37,54,0.8
23,Asshole,"My husband is supper mad at me right now and honestly I think he's over reacting. Me and him have been planning to take the kids on a vacation in August before they start school again. We've been talking for almost a week with neither of us settling on any plans. The both of us couldn't seem to agree on anything and it was starting to get annoying. Anything I recommended he instantly would shoot down. I've always wanted to take my kids back to my home town in Illinois and so i've been pushing for us to go but my husband doesn't think that's a ""good vacation"" and wants to do something ""fun"" like Disneyland. Last night we were talking again and we were getting no where. I told him that we might as well not go cause we can't agree and he said he didn't want that and if we couldn't agree we would just go to Illinois. Well, after about 2 hours we didn't end anywhere and he wen't to bed. I wen't online after and just curiously looked into deals for vacations to my home and I hit the jackpot. I found a honestly insane deal for a 5 day vacation. I'm talking like a once in a lifetime deal. When My husband woke up I told him and he's really mad right now and we had a pretty bad fight this morning before he went to work. He hasn't come home yet and says he staying at his parents for now.

Was I wrong for doing this? We were getting no where with talking and it was obvious neither of us would ever agree on this. And since he said if we couldn't agree we would do this anyway so I don't see why he's so mad",192,557,0.89

26,Not the A-hole,"Tl:Dr at the end.

Btw my sister is 15 yo.

So basically we got this dog about three to four months back, at first it absolutely loved my sister. It would sleep in her room and stay with her most of the time during the first few days it had been here. The dog is five years old so it was pretty confused and nervous the first few days.

My sister then decides on a wim to just leave home for an entire week, during which I take care of the dog and it slowly starts to favor me.

During the first week it had severe abandonment issues, it would whine, bark and get anxious if left alone, which is understandable for a dog that's just gotten removed from its previous home.

When my sister returned home she immediately went to pick up the dog, being overall loud and looming over the tiny dachshund.

She cowered in fear with her tail tucked, but my sister still picked her up despite this.

My dog started to become more and more frightened of my sister, as she would be loud and too wild with handling the tiny dog.

My sister has started to run towards my dog threatenignly whenever it barks and even yells at it, because she finds its barking to be annoying.

I've tried to explain to her why she shouldn't behave like this, but both her and my mom think that the dog is just overreacting. Common phrases they would say is ""Well she's never physically harmed it, so it shouldn't be scared"", I've now started to prohibit my sister from even touching the dog, before it shows signs of relaxing.

AITA for not letting my sister touch my dog because of this (in my dogs mind) frightening behaviour?

29,Asshole,"My ex and I need to agree before we take the kids (12 and 14) out of the country. She wants to take them on a European vacation to celebrate her new marriage to her new husband, but I won't allow it. She has threatened to take me to court over it, and if she does, I'll fight her tooth and nail. Here's why:

1. The principle reason: my kids have called her new husband ""dad"" before they even got engaged. She refused to discourage it and let them get attached to him to the point where they seem to like him more than they like me. Which leads to my next reason.
2. Her new husband makes much more than I do and can spoil the kids more. This trip will probably be entirely on his dime, making him out to be the better ""dad"" than me.
3. This trip will conflict with my parenting time. I only get my kids one day a week, and this would take that day away from me and would ruin our schedule. My ex offered to give me a different day, but I only have time that one day per week to do a fun day. She and her new husband already get so much time with them that I think it's ridiculous to both ask for more time and to take them to do something I can never afford for them.

Am I an asshole for putting my foot down and refusing to let her take them?

Edit: I cannot make the day up because I already see my kids during my one day off per week and during al my vacation days. I don't get any other time off, so this is one less day I get to see them no matter which way you cut it. And the kids do not know about the trip.

Edit 2: for those of you saying to just schedule a day off, you are missing that I already spend ALL my days off and vacation days with my kids. There is no additional time off to schedule that I wouldn't be spending with my kids. If she takes them during one of my days off, there is no other time for me to make that up, because all my days off and vacation days are already being spent with my kids.",1317,3998,0.91
30,Not the A-hole,"So I boarded a 3 hour flight this morning that was completely full. I was in the last boarding group, so I unfortunately ended up being one of the very last people to get corralled into the last open seat. Window seat, great, but packed flight with more than usual crying and screaming kids - with one directly in front of me and an uncharacteristically enthusiastic seat kicker behind me. Early on in the flight I got a few kidney rattling kicks to the back of my seat - in response, I kind of turned my head to see what was going on. This happened a couple times, and each time I looked behind me like what is the deal here?  After we got in the air the Benadryl kicked in and I just put my music on and went to sleep. I have a LOT of anxiety over flying so I try to just get through it.  I slept like a baby through almost the entire flight.

I woke up shortly after landing as we were taxiing to the gate, to wet hands on my head. The kid was climbing over my seat, I guess having just washed his hands in the bathroom (good god at least I hope so). So I kind of recoiled and gave a look like “what in the fuck are you doing here?”

This lady, I’m assuming his mother, instantly calls me out and loudly yells “what’s the matter with you, never seen a person with disabilities before?”  And EVERYONE on the plane turned around and looked at me.  I’m not good at confrontations like this so I was just like “excuse me?” She quips back “you’ve been staring at him this whole flight.”  So at this point I probably strayed into asshole territory because I lost my cool and I just said “lady are you off your fucking meds or something? I’ve been asleep for the past 3 hours and I don’t give a shit about your kids.”  She didn’t say anything after that, and I didn’t bother to look. I got off the plane and went on my way.  Some people seemed to kind of look back at her and give her weird looks.

So maybe I was wrong for yelling at her but am I the asshole for looking around and did I possibly do something inappropriate to instigate this? I had no idea the kid had disabilities and quite frankly I’m not 100% sure he did. He just seemed to be acting like a poorly supervised hyperactive brat.",34,118,0.93

32,Not the A-hole,"My wife (27F) and I (27M) just had our first child and something that was important to us was that we didn't have pictures and videos of our daughter posted on social media. It's not because we are anti-social media (my wife has a FB but I don't), but we aren't overly open with sharing every part of our lives with the public like some choose to be (nothing wrong with that). 

At the hospital I made it clear to both of my parents that we didn't want them posting pictures on their Facebook profiles of our daughter. We explained our reasoning and they both agreed without any questions asked. We told them to text family and friends with pictures and to share the news with other posts, just no pictures of her. 

The day after she was born my dad replied to his own post of the good news with a whole bunch of pictures. My wife and I were not happy but didn't get into it and confront him because we were focusing on our daughter and my wife's recovery. Stress was not what we wanted at the time. When my mother brought it up to us I shrugged it off and said ""it's whatever"". Fast forward 3 more days and my mom has now posted an album of pictures of us and our daughter. 

My wife's parents also understood and haven't made any posts. We also haven't made any type of official post or announcement of the birth in my wife's Facebook and we likely won't for a while. Again, she doesn't share much like that. The people that we want to share our happy moments with all know and received phone calls and texts.

I just sent a group text to both of them (they have been divorced for almost my whole life) about it explaining that we know that they are excited and we love that, but that we asked not to post pictures and they both did. I asked that they don't post any more pictures and remove the ones they already did. 

AITA here for not letting my parents share pictures of their granddaughter (not their first) on social media? I know that they want to share their joy with their social media friends and I'm starting to feel guilty about it even though I'm still upset with them.

INFO: the ""it's whatever"" I said was in the tone of ""I don't want to get into it but I'm not happy"", not ""eh, it's not a big deal"". I wanted to clarify since that could have been confusing without the tone of the way I said it. She knew I was NOT happy about it and my wife was visibly upset which is why I didn't want to get into it at the time. She was recovering from a major surgery and all sorts of emotional.",125,407,0.94

34,Not the A-hole,"I bought a room through Airbnb abroad for a long weekend in Nice, France. The room was hosted by an 'Andrea' with a picture of a couple and I genuinely thought it was a woman. The reviews left on the host were great and all positive - from men and women.

On that first night there, after a nap in the evening I got up and found the host with a friend, we spoke briefly and discussed about all of us going out for wine. I said that would be great, but then I stayed in my room and fell asleep again. When I woke up it was 10pm and the host was by himself.

He said no restaurants or bar would be open at this time. Then asked me if I wanted to watch French Netflix with him. It happened to be in his bedroom. I thought he was just being friendly since all the reviews were positive. He spent half an hour making a Netflix account and we started to watch a cartoon.

At some point he asked me to lie down next to him which I said no to but he insisted. I did. Then he made me put my head on his chest, put his arms around me and kissed my head. He stroked my hair and my back. I kind of froze. I let the episode finish and then said I was tired and went to my bedroom. He texted me to say sorry straight after.

I didn't sleep the entire night because I was scared. In the morning I called airbnb and they supported me in leaving and finding another room. Although he didn't force me to do anything more, he made me uncomfortable and I don't think I could have stayed there for the rest of the time, sharing a shower etc. 

It turns out his account is now suspended and he has lost a source of income.
AITA and did I overreact? He was a man trying his luck but he didn't push me and he apologised.

UPDATE: thank you everyone for your responses. The overwhelming feedback seems that he was wrong to try it and it was right to report him. There were some comments that I was TA for leading him on. I'm 24, and I should have known better. I wish I was able to shut down situations like this quicker, I wish I was more assertive or aggressive in saying no.

36,Not the A-hole,"Let me give you a little background. A friend of my SO has an 8 year old son who has been going through a phase where he thinks he is grown and thinks it's funny to act out and disrespect his mom and other adults. For most of his life his father had been and out of jail and is one of those white guys that thinks he is ""hood"" (for lack of a better term, we all know the type) and the kid is starting to pick up the same mentality and attitude from his dad who now comes around him more. 

A couple of instances in which he acts:

Openly back talks and disrespectful of his mother, even after she physically and materially disciplines him, he tries to act like a badass and I've caught him flipping her off when she isn't looking etc.
(This issue I'm neutral on, its shitty behavior but I feel like most kids go through some kind of phase like this)

The actions that prompted me, a grown man, to say this to him is:

When he is just around my 5 year old step son, he plays normally and he and my SS are great friends, however if some of his same age friends are around he tries to be cool in front of them and tries to punk the younger kids, i.e. make fun of them or various assholery. 

I've also watched him be a dick to his own friends in which he repeatedly kept calling the other boy a different name after the boy repeatedly asked him to stop.

That is when in front of his friends and my SS and SO and the kids mom at the pool, I called him out and told him that if he keeps acting like an asshole to everyone he isn't going to have any friends and there will be kids that won't take that and will likely kick his ass as he gets older

He is just progressively becoming little A hole, and his mother had no problem with my comment to her son nor did my SO. Not looking for validation, just to you good people of Reddit for analysis

Edit for typos
*********************************************
Since you guys seem pretty split here on the issue let me add a follow up

Now I wasn't going to mention this occasion that happened at my house while they were over to play a week later but oh well.

Anyways, my SS, the 8 year old, and his 3 year old sister are all playing and he is trying to show out and back talk his mom and all the usual ""stunting"" 

My SO, his mom and myself are all pretty close and have a mutual agreement that we have permission to discipline each others kids if necessary for clarification.

Anyways, I didn't appreciate the way he was trying to act so I told him straight up that if he didn't stop that I would whoop his ass instead of his momma, to which he tried to buck up and say that he would just tell his dad. I laughed and told him that was fine, his dad can get some too. Not the response he expected,  and haven't had an issue with him since.

I'm no role model of the year but effective nonetheless

I've never laid a hand on the kid for anyone wanting to freak out about me saying that, I also don't think whipping your kids is very effective in terms of behavior correction but I certainly am not above it. Getting my ass spanked sure corrected some poor behavior as a kid.

I care about the kid and don't want him to grow up to be a punk.

38,Not enough info,"Throwaway, husband uses reddit.  
  
Backstory first. I (27f) work full time as does my husband (26m). I do make more than my husband and the dicotomy is only going to increase as time goes due to my line of work. We have two kids, a 2 and a half year old  and a 10 month old. We both love our kids endlessly and share equally in all parental duties.  
   
All that said, I do work earlier than my husband and pick both of our children up from their respective daycares and am home with them for a couple hours before my husband gets home. When he gets home, he is more often than not in a, for lack of a better word, shitty mood. He does not like his job, and that stress follows him home.  
   
We are not financially well off at the moment but in the future due to my job, we have spoken of the possibility of him being a stay at home dad. This is the future that I thought we were working towards.  
  
About a month ago, my husband informed me that he was in the process of applying for college. I was a little taken aback due to us both talking about our future with him at home. I am trying to be supportive of the idea, but, did mention that i had thought that he was looking forward to being a stay at home dad.  
  
That is where I left the conversation. I did not tell him of my other concerns which are more responsible for my disagreement with him going back to school. I mentioned that he is in a shitty mood sometimes when he gets back home, and that attitude can sometimes be taken out on our kids.  
   
Now, I do want to stress that he is a great and loving father, but, on some days, seeing the way he interacts with our children can be heartbreaking. He can be short with them and often will shout at our oldest. Every interruption the kids can cause is likely to upset him and cause him to be angry. Most nights I will take over caring for the kids to give him a break as I can see that he is in a bad mood.  
  
The financial aspect of college is also an issue I have. As I mentioned, we are not too financially well off and I do not know how well we could manage the prospect of student loans.   
     
   
**Edit:** Im adding info to maybe help clarify some things.  
   
My husband had decided himself he wanted to be a stay at home dad. He still hasnt said that isnt what he wants to do. If he were to have a change of heart I would not even mind, this is not an issue of me trying to stop hik from achieving his dreams or halt his happiness. This whole school thing was just dumped on me.  
   
About the school. Its a film school in our state that he will be attending through online classes while at home. He will be trying to get a degree in some form of entertainment management (i think). The reason this concerns me is how short he is with the children already. **this is my main concern**. I do not want his behavior at home to get worse due to the added stress of schoolwork and deadlines.  
    
Our financial situation currently demands us both to be working. In maybe 4 years or less it would be feesible for him to no longer work. At that time if he still wanted i would have no issue with him returning to school. Once he no longer has to work at a job he hates.  
  
In the meantime i more than encourage him to find other work that he might enjoy more. But i think adding to his plate while life as it stands seems to be too much for him to bear without snapping out our children at every turn is not wise for the family. 
  


AITA for not wanting him to go back to school? Should I voice my concerns more clearly? Thank you.",163,377,0.95
39,Not the A-hole,"My wife, Jane (29F), was raised in a very conservative and religious family and married Richard (34M) at a young age. They had a daughter, Sarah (12F), less than a year later but were divorced 2 years into the marriage after Jane came out. She was immediately disowned by her entire family and has struggled for years to coparent with Richard who has somehow become even more conservative than he was before.

Jane and I (28F) met about 5 years ago and Sarah and I were introduced a year later. Sarah and I immediately bonded over a love of horses and I got to be the one to take her on her first trail ride which she loved. After talking with her father, her mom and I signed her up for lessons and has recently started to work at the barn a few hours a week in exchange for additional time. 

However, she's at the point where if she wants to continue improving she needs to dedicate more time to riding. She's been saving every penny so she can afford to lease a horse and has about $500 saved up. Originally my wife and I told her we would pay for half of the year and Richard offered $300/year (leasing in our area is usually about $350/month or half the cost of boarding).

Jane and I have been thinking about buying a property large enough to move my horse on to for a while now and we recently found one that we love. However, since horses are herd animals and shouldn't be kept alone we decided it made the most sense logically and financially to buy Sarah her own horse for her birthday in August. Horses trained in her discipline and suitable for her riding ability are usually around $4-6k to buy or $800-1200 to adopt. I'm personally not a fan of using rescues for horses (they maintain ownership of the horse and are free to take it back whenever they see fit) but it would be Sarah's choice. 

We emailed Richard to let him know our plans and ask if he wanted to be involved in the process. He then called and left a voice mail screaming at us for ""throwing money at [his] daughter to convert her to a homosexual lifestyle"" and ""a blatant attempt for [me] to groom her.""

This isn't the first time he's accused us of this and he was reprimanded by the judge for it the last time they went to court. I know things are difficult on his end right now; money is tight, and Sarah started living primarily with us last fall but that has nothing to do with us and everything to do with his attitude and the choices he's made. 

If there were any other reasons for not wanting Sarah to have a horse he didn't express them. My opinion is that the issues he's raised are bullshit and that I need to make the decisions that are best for my family. 

TLDR: Step daughter's father thinks that buying her a horse will make her gay or make it easier for me to sexually abuse her. I think his reasoning is stupid and we should just do what's right for our family.",124,247,0.92

I matched with this girl (let's call her Jen) on Tinder a few weeks ago. We had been chatting for a while and I thought she was really charming. I decided to invite her for dinner and chose a good restaurant. We met up, exchanged pleasantries and started talking. When we got to ordering though, I noticed she got one of the more expensive seafood dishes and cocktail. I kind of wondered then if she might just be trying to get a free meal out of me. I was the one who did the inviting so I was intending to pay. But I was disappointed because she didn't strike me as that type.

After a while, she orders some dessert and later another cocktail. It set up some red flags again and at some point in the conversation, I brought up what we both do for a living. She told me she was an influencer. Said her page was about travel and wellness. At this point, I got a bit turned off because influencers don't make all that much and they have a reputation of begging for discounts and all that for a shoutout. Seems like I was just there to pay for the food she will post on her page. I kind of checked out of the date and didn't really enjoy.

Finally the bill came and she said she'll pay for her share. I was kind of surprised and offered to pay but she insisted. I started feeling bad about my attitude. I don't think I acted rude towards her, just not too interested. We part and she later texts me that it was a great date but perhaps we weren't compatible. I'm gutted because from our chats we really got along well and shared many interests. I later looked up her profile and she had a solid following. Like 500k+.

I told my sister about it and she thinks I was a major asshole for this. I feel bad but at the same time, I kind of think my reaction was normal given what I knew at the time.

I asked my mom what we are doing for wifi (need it for school) and that we need a router and modem. She said that we don't need it because (she and my mom) have activated phones (I do not). She then said if I need wifi I need to work and pay for my own router.  I said fine and I have saved up for one. It's a nice router too, a AC1750 for my PC so I can play games / homework without bad speeds.

Currently me and my sister use it for homework and I use it for games.  My sister did help to pay the cost (30 bucks) so I let her use it. My mom wanted the password so she could watch Netflix on my PS4. I told her no as she didn't pay a cent for it. She called me a asshole and demanded I give her the password or she would sell my PC ($1800) and my phone (s8+) so I gave her it, I can't loose my PC or phone over that.

My grandparents say I am the A-hole too because she is my mother and she made me and I shouldn't treat her like that

So, AITA


Sorry for format on mobile

EDIT: I am only 16. I paid completely for the router and pay 33% for the service. My mom pays for her and my sisters data",195,438,0.93

58,Not the A-hole,"I met my soon-to-be-wife (kindest person I know, sometimes a little naive, always sees the good side in people) 6 years ago at the age of 21. At that time we were both studying in the same place and grew closer. I had one girlfriend prior to her while I was her first boyfriend. 

The parents of my SO divorced when she was 11 years old, leaving her with her mother and younger sister. I was told that my SO had to take over as dad from time to time, doing the housework and so on at a rather young age. Her mother quit her job prior to the divorce and was at home 24/7. Money came from the dad and the state.

10 years later my SO still lived at home and her mother still was jobless.
My SO and I spent increasingly more time together. So far she only had the weekend for that and we split the days between me and home (e.g. MON-FRI: Study abroad, SAT: me, SUN: mother/sister). Suddenly my SO wanted to spent the whole weekend with me or wanted to go on a vacation for a few days and so on.

One day we visited a festival far from home and came back late in the evening. I was driving while my SO called her mother and asked if it was okay that she slept at my place and not visit mother like she usually does. I still remember my SO crying right next to me as mother shouted and screamed on the phone that that would be unfair and she has to come home at once. She didn't... We had these fallouts a couple more times and it summited in another massive outrage via phone a few months later. As my SO was crying again I just took the phone, shut it down and we spent the night at my place with me comforting her. Her mother then wrote messages to me, her and even my parents, calling us all fakes, me a pretending asshole and even worse, calling her own daughter a bitch, my bitch, multiple times. She told my SO that she will end up being my maid since I am too lazy and that I will cheat on her the moment I get tired of her. 
The next few days were hell for us. My SO basically crying nonstop, not being able to work.  I made the decision to block mother on her and my phone. My SO then moved in.
We kept this communication blockade for almost 4 years and plan to marry soon.

Through an old friend of my SO her mother was told about the marriage and initiated contact with us again, furious why she wasn't invited. She doesn't feel at fault. At some point in our wedding preparations we agreed that her mother may come to the wedding if she would apologize.

My SO would like everything to be normal again. I however fear that the best day of our life might get ruined if we invite a person who obviously hates me and our engagement.
So far my SO is fine with that explanation, but I know she would be way happier if we can all be ""friends"" again and her mother would come to the wedding. 
AITA for not allowing this until we/I get a proper apology and feel like this beautiful day won't get sabotaged?",22,51,0.94

62,No A-holes here,"I (m 18) work at a mall food court with several other employees. Since there’s a festival downtown and business at the mall has been slow in the afternoon there have only been 5  people working a day. 3 in the morning and then another 2 in the afternoon who come in and take over while the other 3 leave. An assistant manager opens while the general manager ( Kate) closes 

I usually open in the morning with the AM “Allison” (f 19) and my friend “Alex” . Allison  told the GM she couldn’t open anymore because  her brothers aren’t in school and she has to watch them. This meant that the GM opened with us instead.  The other guy in the afternoon “Frank” (m 30 something) would be closing with Allison.

Allison has worked with Frank before but never by herself. Frank is kind of weird but he’s not a bad person I guess.  The next morning everything is going the same as usual until we get a call from Allison asking if she can talk to Kate. They talk for a bit and Kate comes and talks to me

“ Are you willing to stay until close? Allie called and said she had some trouble with Frank last night and said she would feel better closing with you. “

I asked her what Frank did and apparently he kept staring at Allison and told her she was really pretty. Kate told me Frank stares at her too and that he’s just awkward but that Allison felt really uncomfortable. She called Frank and asked if he could start working mornings and he said he could but starting tomorrow because he was already doing something that morning. I told her she could move me to the afternoons from now on but that I’m not going to work the morning and afternoon shift in one day (11 hours). Kate was kind of annoyed I didn’t prioritize Allison’s comfort. Allison called again and asked me to please stay but I refused again.

64,Not the A-hole,"So recently HB (husband - sorry for the confusion!) upgraded to a new phone. The old one is a few years old but still works ok, so we decided to give it to my son (12). No data, but he can get wifi and “text” using Google hangouts and play games. We gave it to him with the understanding that (a) he look after it properly and not lose it, and (b) that he may have to share it with me on an upcoming out-of-country trip (I can’t take mine because it is work-issued and we aren’t allowed to take our cell phones internationally). Son is delighted. 

Fast forward a few weeks. HB seems to be creating all kinds of rules around son’s care of the phone. He must turn it off every night. He must charge it every day. And now he is characterizing it as a “loan” so the phone still belongs to him. Twice now he has confiscated it because son did not charge it at night. I think he is being a dick because the natural consequence of son not charging it is that he will have a dead phone the next day, and he will learn to plan accordingly. HB would rather take it away to have him learn the lesson, saying the phone is still technically his and he wants to make sure it stays in good working condition in case he ever needs it again (I guess keeping it charged has something to do with this?) Son is very disappointed and feels like the phone gift was a bait and switch. 

I am tempted to just buy another second-hand phone to give to son and avoid what feels like an unnecessary power trip. So who ITA here?",201,1452,0.95

Anyways I have two weeks off in March and my sister is having a baby in January supposed to anyways and she would like for me to spend the 2 whole weeks with her. I appreciate the fact that she wants me there for 2 whole weeks but she will be recovering from giving birth, breastfeeding and doing general mom duties. 

I’m not wanting to spend my entire 2 weeks with a newborn baby. I asked her if it would be ok if I can visit for 4 days then go to South America for 8 days and come back for another 3 days. You would have thought that I suggested that she get an abortion because of her reaction. 

She told me that it was unfair that I don’t want to spend quality time with the newborn and her.

72,Not the A-hole,"

First off, I'm on mobile and auto correct is out to get me.
Secondly, I'm sorry for writing a novel. TLDR at the bottom.
I have 4 sets of those magnetic balls. Neoballs? Neocube? 3 of the same size and one that was smaller in diameter. To put them back in the container you straighten them out and form them in a cube. My nephew (7yo) spent the night with me and ""squished"" all of the cubes into a multicolored lump. I didn’t really mind, and it was a bit my fault for leaving them at nephew height. My sister and I (who was visiting from out of state) were bored and decided to sort out the balls (haha) while watching a movie. We used to do that when we were younger and we both enjoyed the quiet monotony of it. 

We got them sorted and I started forming them into the cubes. I noticed the purple didn’t form the whole cube. Same story with the other two colors. I had a sneaking suspicion my nephew had something to do with it. Hes around 7 and has been known to take things that were not his. I sat him down and asked him if he know where the rest of the magnets were. He didn’t say anything, so I asked him if he took them. ""Yes, I took some. I'm sorry!"" He seems to think saying sorry will fix everything and make it ok with no consequences. I told him he hurt my feelings and lost my trust. I told him until he earned that trust back, I’m going to have to search his pockets every time he left my apartment. His mom was standing in the room when my nephew and I had the convo and she heard what I said about checking the pockets. She agreed. 
We went back to her apartment and I told him he needs to immediately go get the rest of the magnets and return them to me. I sat in his room and watched him for a bit (kid can hardly stay on task). Finally he came over and handed me two magnets. I was missing at least 30 to 40 magnets. I told him he better find the rest or he’s going to pay for them. I told him that they were around $20 each making them cost around 80 dollars. ""You’re going to pay for them if you can’t find them. Not your mom not Nana. You.” My nephew got a shocked look on his face and left to his room.
 A bit later I went to his room to say bye to him as I was heading home to find him crying on the floor. He jumped up and hugged me and told me he was sorry in between sobs. I told him it was ok, but he still needed to find them when he could. 
I feel really bad for making him cry like that, but I don’t want him to turn into a little klepto. I need to work on child proofing my place I know but that doesn’t excuse the theft. AITA?
Ps. I don’t really care about the magnets themselves. Like my heart isn’t breaking that their gone. But they were expensive ad one set was given to me by my sister about 7 years ago when I was going through a hard time giving them a bit of sentimental value.

TLDR. Nephew stole a handful of magnets from my apartment. I told him he would have to pay back the 80 bucks they cost if he couldn’t find them. Found him sobbing in his room.

Sure enough, she came home with a dog despite me saying no. And she came home with it the day she got fired from her job.
We've had the dog for a few months and he has been problematic to say the least. Whenever he was in his cage he would bark constantly, to the point where other people in the neighborhood were emailing the HOA about it. He chews everything. Pillows, garbage, garbage cans, our son's stuffed animals, remotes, etc. He terrorizes the cats. The worst is that he constantly goes to the bathroom in the house to the point where our house continually smells like it. I run a studio home and I have clients coming in a lot and it bothers me that the house continually smells and he always jumps on the clients.

Ive been hanging out with his sister since we were 8 y/o and naturally became close friends with him. My freshman year of high-school we went to homecoming together and kissed at the football game but it never progressed into anything more serious, as he is a brother to me. Years later he starts dating his future fiance, the bride who doesnt quite like me. Reason being is that sometime in the beginning of their relationship I invited the groom, to a party where he ended up sleeping with another girl/cheating on his girlfriend. I told my close friends about the cheating but I didnt tell his girlfriend myself which she later found out through mutual friends. Now they’re wedding is set for the end of the month and she says she doesnt trust me (because i allowed the cheating to happen) and doesn’t like her fiance and I to hang out together. The groom has specifically invited me to the wedding and says he wants me there but I feel weird about going knowing i might make the bride uncomfortable.

77,Not the A-hole,"Hello fellow assholes,

Every morning I take my kids to the bus stop for the oldest to hop on and go to Kindergarten. The bus stops on a busy one-lane-each-way road, and picks up 3 kids, 2 of whom cross the street when it stops. This stop is also at a T-intersection, with the bus taking a straight through path.

We've had troubles with people blowing through the school bus' stop sign, or racing past it with the lights on before the sign is out. People are just really impatient to get by. I think I get it, why wait an extra minute if you don't have to?

This morning, an impatient driver stopped at the butt end of the T to turn right, and I am standing at the corner he is taking. The bus is stopped and the kids and one parent are crossing. After the kids disappear from sight, this driver inches forward to start his right hand turn, right through the school bus's stop sign.

So I stepped out onto the street and stood there. Not even one metre ahead of him from where he is advancing, and I waited for my fellow parent to cross back to the curb and then some words were exchanged. The choice of my words were neutral and matter-of-fact, ""IT'S A SCHOOL BUS STOP"" but it was yelled pretty damn loud, and in front of my two younger children.

If there is a fire somewhere or an emergency this guy has to get to, he could just drop his window and say literally anything but there was no indication that he was anything more than opportunistic and impatient.

I blocked the traffic, intentionally. But I also don't take any punches when it comes to kids; that space is supposed to be safe for them to use.

So guys, am I the asshole here?

78,Asshole,"Hey everyone. Thanks for reading. 

My bf and I have been friends for over a year, sleeping together casually since 10/2018 and officially got serious/committed about 4 months ago. I love him a crazy amount and I’m serious about making it work long term with him. I should say that I’m 31 and he’s 29; I live in and own my own home, but due to some past health issues and general unfortunate life circumstances, he’s still at home with both parents. 

He’s been to my parents’ place many times for dinner, game nights etc. My parents never batted an eye when I told them he was staying with me in their guest room. And when he stays the night at my house, he always sleeps next to me in my bedroom. 

But according to him, if I were to attempt sleeping next to him at his place, his parents would, to quote him, “blow a head gasket.” 

This just feels really unfair and like a double standard to me. It makes me feel like his dirty little secret. 

Both his parents are very devout Christians (he is as well) and they didn’t have sex until marriage; they’ve been together ever since, so apparently they’re staunchly against unmarried couples sleeping together. Even though my bf willingly does so with me literally everywhere else but at his home. 

He doesn’t want to even attempt to open a constructive dialogue with them about this. I don’t think that’s right. It really bothers me, but he’s insisting it’s just best to leave it alone to keep the peace. 

Should I respect his parents’ boundaries or stick up for myself? Am I the asshole for asking that he stand up to them?

Pertinent edits:

—His parents do not know we have slept together and according to him, it would cause their opinion of both me and him to lower. Hence why I feel like a dirty secret. 

—I am under no illusions that I’ll change their minds. But I would hope a mature dialogue could be had about the premarital sex subject that wouldn’t result in name calling or disastrous behavior",106,32,0.77
79,Not the A-hole,"My father was born and raised in Pakistan and came to America in his 20's. Time and time again growing up, he would say something really hurtful reminding me of just how sexist really is (i.e. calling me a slut in 6th grade because a boy from my class called me to go over homework...) 

About a decade ago I joined the Air Force and like an idiot I married a guy I barely knew (the marriage lasted all of 6 months). When my father found out that I had eloped with a Black man (oh yeah, my dad is also racist), he called me and told me that he couldn't believe I married a n****r and that he was going to fly out to the base I was stationed at and kill me. Well, I immediately notified the authorities and didn't talk to my dad again.

A few years back, I arranged a visit to my Aunt and Uncle (on my father's side) for the first time in years. When I arrived at the airport, my Uncle was there to pick me up... With my dad. Obviously I was livid, but I know my Uncle probably invited him hoping we'd make amends. Well of course the very first conversation we had was about how he doesn't understand why I joined the Air Force instead of finishing my degree. For the first time ever I was firm with him and told him to cut the shit, that I was here on vacation and wanted to enjoy my time with family and if he mouthed off to me again I was going to leave and stay at a hotel. He wasn't happy about it, but he stopped. After that visit, he started emailing me with small talk on and off.

Last year, I married a wonderful man and was so unbelievably excited to introduce him to my family. I arranged another visit to my Aunt and Uncle... And told them I'd be bringing my husband by just to introduce him but that he'd be staying with his family separately since they live nearby. A week before the trip, my Aunt called me to tell me my dad was coming yet again and that she doesn't think it would be a good idea to bring my husband because it would upset my dad. I was of course upset about this, but I still wanted to visit and spend time with them and my cousins... So I respected her wishes. I told my Uncle that my dad surprising me like this wasn't ok, and he was caught off guard. My dad had made it sound to him like I knew he'd be there. 

After that visit, I emailed my dad telling him that trying to make things right with me was pointless and that it's too late. I told him about my husband and how it's because of him that I didn't bring him to meet my Aunt and Uncle. He emailed me back apologizing for everything he's done wrong and asked if I'd let him make it up to me. I told him absolutely not, that I've gone a decade of my life without a verbally abusive father and I've been doing really well without him. I told him that he's as good as dead to me. I then told him to never contact me again. I know those are really harsh words and I said them out of anger... But it was exactly how I felt and still feel.

My husband was sorting out his own personal bills and out of plain curiosity and interest I just looked at one of the slips and noticed that site was on the bill from a while back. It seemed weird that it was on there as we always use our joint account for that stuff. So I did a bit of snooping around the house looking for what it could have been and I found a silicone limp penis (almost like a dildo but limp). When I cross referenced this with the site it turns out to be a toy that guys can wear in their pants to make them seem ‘bigger’. So I confronted him about this and he was really embarrassed. He said he didn’t do it for anyone but himself because he wanted to feel more masculine and better about himself. Since then things have been a little awkward between us.

83,Not the A-hole,"One of my friends has been on a dry spell recently, let’s call him Mick. Mick has contracted both genital and oral herpes from an unfortunate drunk hook up years ago. 

He was upset afterwards that the girl didn’t warn him beforehand - which I believe is relevant for the story. 

He’s been wanting to get back into dating and told me that women tend to unmatch him immediately when he mentions his STDs. It’s understandably frustrating, but I felt it’s good on him for being upfront about it. 

That changed with his last tinder encounter. Mick told me she’s a great girl - pretty, funny, witty. He was *really* excited about going on a date with her and I assumed he had told her about his herpes situation (as he with other girls before). 

We arranged a double date, Mick and Tinder Girl, as well as my partner and I. Things went well in the beginning, we were having a great time and I could definitely feel the chemistry between the two. 

However, here’s where I might have been an asshole: Mick and my partner went outside for a cigarette, so Tinder Girl and I were the only ones at our table. We ended up talking about Mick, and I mentioned how excited he had been about the date, especially since he hadn’t exactly been lucky on tinder so far. She couldn’t see why, since he was great guy and she enjoyed the date so far. 

Mind you, we’ve had a few drinks at this point and I told her that he’s had a lot of girls unmatch him due to his ‘situation’. She was confused and asked me what I meant, so I told her that I meant his herpes. 

She got upset and told me that he hadn’t told her, despite her specifically asking about STDs. Apparently, Mick claimed to be entirely clean. 

She thanked me and stormed out, sending Mick an angry message and later blocking him.

Mick said I ruined his chances of scoring that night and is *really* upset with me. He said it was not my place to say anything and I should’ve given him the chance to tell her - but honestly I don’t think he would’ve (given that he specifically lied about it on tinder when she asked). I feel bad, at the same time I think she deserved to know beforehand. 

I genuinely wish for Mick to have successful dates, but not through being deceitful. It wasn’t on purpose, I assumed he had told her prior to this - but maybe I do suck for even bringing it up?

* She doesn't want to go shopping for her own dress (I'm paying for it) do I just keep sending her links to ask if she likes them. 
* She's a qualified florist but does not want to be involved with the bouquet or buttonholes (I did offer to pay her).

Everything so far hasn't really bothered me too much. I'm not particularly girly, I'm good at planning and someone else can do the flowers.

She doesn't want to do a speech at the reception because she's too nervous to speak in front of a crowd (it would be about 100 people.)

I asked her if instead she would like to do a short reading at my ceremony (about 50 people and she wouldn't have to prepare anything). She doesn't want to do that either.

Im now really upset because aside from walking down the aisle she literally has no involvement in my day at all. I also have a limited number of close friends and I don't feel like that side of my life is going to be represented at all.

I asked her what she had done with it and all she said was “soz b I chucked it because I didn’t think anyone used it”. I thought this was a pretty pathetic apology considering she’d thrown out my belongings without asking, so I asked her to send me money for a replacement. If her first apology had been genuine I probably wouldn’t have asked her to pay, but the insincerity had annoyed me. Instead of paying she offered to take it out of the bin and wash it. I really don’t feel comfortable using something from the bin to wash my face so I asked her again to pay for a new one. She got angry with me and claimed she had “done enough already”. I pointed out her poor apology and asked if she even knew she’d done anything wrong – I have to admit my tone was snappy because at this point I was really annoyed.

I am now going through that awkward period where I run into situations where I have to disclose friends that we are no longer together.

89,No A-holes here,"My wife and I (41m) have a 12 year old daughter are the parents of a 12 year old girl. My daughter and I are very alike, and we have a close relationship. Recently, my daughter came to us and told us that she had her period. My wife and I were happy, we all talked about life changes, how great it is to be growing up and have a bond that many women share, and also joked about the 40 year sentence of cramps and discomfort. My wife and daughter then talked privately about all the specifics and anything that my daughter would have been embarrassed about bringing up in front of me. All in all, my daughter seemed pretty happy about all of it. 

After a few days, and after my daughter had told her maternal grandmother and aunts, I asked her if she would mind if I told my mom and sisters, who live in a neighboring country. She said yes, she wanted them to know about her milestone.

Now, I grew up with two sisters and myself, along with a single mother. They (sisters) told me *everything*, all the time, so I'm pretty aware of all the ins and outs of women's health, even if I haven't experienced any of it myself. My mom, on the other hand, was more reserved and traditional, so she simply never brought it up. But I didn't believe it to be taboo. So I decided to text my mom and sisters and let them know the good news. My mom immediately responded to the group text with ""This is inappropriate."" One sister replied with ""Oh noo! haha"" and the other didn't reply at all. I told my mom that it's fine, I had permission to share, and that there's nothing shameful or weird about it. It's not like I was giving graphic details. She said ""Ok."" and nobody else responded to the text.

Individually, I sent a text to my sisters saying that I probably shouldn't have brought it up to mom and that, to me, my daughter's health and milestones shouldn't be treated as secrets or shamed.

91,Not the A-hole,"So a little back story, I'm currently living abroad with a volunteer program. With said program, you have to be with 2 other members of the group at all times when outside the city. (Any traveling must be done with at least three people) We have a group of about 30 people, but the last two weeks will be just two other volunteers and I.

Our current vacation plan is to go to Beijing for three days and then Shanghai for four, but I don't want to go to the Shanghai half. Frankly, neither of the volunteers I am with are kind to me whatsoever. One of the volunteers I am with is absolutely awful towards me. She actively has tried to convert me to her religion, chastised me for having beliefs contrary to hers, asked me lots of politically charged questions then sent me religious texts refuting anything I said, openly used homophobic slurs in front of me, invited people into our room whilst I was sleeping or changing or otherwise not presentable, woke me up repeatedly every morning/overnight because I snore, and on and on and on. Because of this, I requested to change rooms. Since I have moved, she ignores me at all times. If I speak to her, she won't look at me nor respond. When teaching, she won't collaborate or acknowledge that I am there. She has removed me from every group/social media she has. It's petty and frustrating. I've done everything in my power to be mindful of her beliefs and her space yet she still is incredibly hostile towards me.

This leads me to my dilemma. If I don't go to Shanghai with them, they don't have an opportunity to go and will have to return to the US without having gone. If I go with them, I will be going into debt and staying in our hostel the entire time while they vacation. (I can't afford to do anything while there. I can afford transportation costs, hostel costs, and will have to put any other expenses on my credit card.)

I'd like to note that they had the opportunity to go earlier in our semester when we had a larger group. We had a Shanghai vacation planned and booked, but they dropped out last second and we had to scramble to find another member of the group to come with (again, we have to have three members outside the city together at all times. The two girls and I are the only ones left.) So not only have I been to Shanghai on a vacation that they nearly had cancelled, but now they expect me to pay for a second one so they have the opportunity.

The good person in me wants to take one for the team and just go. I feel bad because they quite possibly won't have an opportunity like this again. However, they are both absolutely terrible and I can hardly afford to pay for this. I don't know what to do.

94,No A-holes here,"Literally my first post, and I am on mobile, I'll try to get the worst of the grammar.

Backstory and Cast (names changed / dropped for privacy) 

5 years ago I started dating M. M has 4 children, 2 girls, 2 boys. All between the ages of 23-28. The two girls have 3 children each. (We'll call one S)

The second girl, G, recently had a hard life lesson. Her husband has been since I've known him emotionally abusive, controlling, he liked to blame his bipolar and borderline personality disorder for his actions toward his wife, but he's a good father. It sounds strange I'm sure, he was a different person with the kids. 

So, on to the current scenario.

A few weeks ago, G called me one night telling me she didn't feel comfortable staying home. I immediately went and fetched her to stay the night with us. The whole night her husband is blowing up her phone, almost nonstop. The next morning, he's still going. She doesn't want to come home. 

Five minutes later he shows up on my doorstep and gives me their youngest (1 year, older two in school) no diaper bag. He wants in. I told him no. He was 6'4, 200 lbs. If he got in there was NO way I could get him out. G, goes out for 20 minutes to talk, and comes back in sobbing, he'd threatened his own life, we called 911 gave them the car info while I called in for supplies for the baby from a friend.

While speaking with the police the sheriff called in, they found the car wrapped around a tree, he was in the hospital, critical condition. 

I was there with G, through everything over the next few weeks.

Arrangement for the children to be picked up from school, to and from her job, getting his family in from out of state. Going through the trashed car to pull his tools. I had been taking her driving for months and she finally got her license. She told me she was going to leave him. That she deserved better. I was so proud of her, stepping into her new found roll so flawlessly. I was working on getting her a car to replace the one he'd totalled.

In that time, he was released from the hospital. Into the care of G's sister, S. Who lives two doors down. 

Last night I got a message. 

""He came home, it wasn't forced, he's different now"" 

I was done.

For months during our driving lessons I'd explained the cycle of abuse, how it waxes and wanes depending on what he wants. 

She knows.

But when I found out I told her I needed time. Because I Am upset. She almost had it. I explained to her that I didn't want to blow up and say things that might hurt her, that I wasn't mad, just disappointed. 

So the question is, AITA for pulling my assistance (driving her too and from work, she was also looking for me to take one child to daycare along with financial aid and favors) to take time to process? She has access to a car to borrow until we get the titles for the one she's buying. 

I just feel guilty, but I'm also hurt.
What do?",107,696,0.95
95,Asshole,"So I have been dating this Girl for awhile now. She's beautiful. She works as a professional model. Not like an Instagram wannabe but a real professional model with professional shoots and an agency and everything.

She also practices martial arts has a few black belts and works as an instructor in her school, gym, dojo whatever its called. She usually tells people shes a martial arts instructor and not a model. For some reason she doesn't like to tell people she's a model even though thats where she makes most of her money. She only makes like 12 dollars an hour and works part time as a martial arts instructor.

So the other day I was introducing her to some people and she told them she was a martial arts instructor when they asked her what she did. I said ""Thats not really how she makes her money though shes a model"" and she shot me this dirty look. Later she said I was an asshole for saying that that she doesn't like to tell people shes just met that shes a model and I had no right to correct her. That what she said is true, she does teach martial arts and she wasn't lying. That her passion is teaching martial arts but it doesn't pay that well so she models to pay the bills but that's not what shes passionate about.

I dont see what the big deal is so AITA here for telling people what she really does for money?

\*\*Edit just to clarify I she didnt tell me she preferred to not say she was a model specifically beforehand. I just noticed she never mentioned it but it was not something we talked about until after I did it. Also I was genuinely proud of her for being a model and when I introduced her to my friends.

\*\*Edit 2 Theres so many comments and I am trying to read them all. I do respect her. I do love her for more then her beauty. Shes a genuinely good and kind person, she loves kids (she teaches kids in her classes) animals, just a very big hearted and sweet woman. She's smart and fun and we share a lot of interests. Honestly I am blown away with how pretty she is and I've never dated a woman who is as pretty as she is. So that part does excite me.

I genuinely thought the modelling was the more prestigious of her accomplishments because while you may think I am the asshole for this I do value how much money a field brings in. When I chose my area in college I did choose between a few specialties because this one paid the most. I am going to talk to her about it and find out more about why she values the martial arts more and I am not going to judge based on how much money it makes. I'm going to respect whatever reasons she has.

I shot an apology text (We're both at workright now) and sent her flowers to her Dojo. She said we can talk after work and I offered to take her to her favorite restaurant.

&#x200B;

\*\*Final Edit

At this point I imagine no one is reading anymore I asked the mods if I should post this update and they said to edit it into the original post.

I was really bothered by the things people said. Not because I wanted to bury my head and refuse to accept them but because maybe there was some truth to it. I didn't want to be the guy everyone said I was. I really didn't.

&#x200B;

First I want to make it clear that she never told me before not to refer to her as a model. Yes I knew she usually didn't lead with it but it was never something we had discussed before. We have been dating for around 3-4 months.

&#x200B;

Next I want to say She was meeting some of my good friends. I was not trying to ""show her off"" in that she was a trophy for me. I was trying to point out her accomplishments. I thought it would make her look better for my friends to know she also made good money as a model. I can see where I was wrong. I did place more value on her career as a model because she made more money and I felt it was more glamorous. I am an asshole for that. I did interject that she was a model and undermine the image she wanted to project of herself and I'm also the asshole for that too. I wont deny it. But I DONT just see her as a trophy. I do see her as a complete and wonderful person and theres more on that later because I learned something really really important.

&#x200B;

After this thread blew up like it did and I had hundreds and later thousands of responses saying what a dick I was I knew I was dead wrong and had fucked up. I texted her with an apology and she said she was used to that bullshit. I asked her if we could talk about it and I could try and make it up to her. She agreed. I told her I wanted to learn more about what she did as a martial arts teacher and asked her if I could sit in on some of her classes. She said she would like that. I made it top priority. I left the office early to go and sit in and see what this was about.

&#x200B;

What I saw really opened my eyes to be honest. I watched two classes and took part in the second one. The first one was her with a kids after school class. She was kind, patient, and just really great with the kids. Someone said something  to the effect that she couldn't be that successful if she only taught kids. Thats dead wrong. It must be much harder to teach kids and I think it makes her a much better teacher that shes able to reach and teach these kids. I saw how she will be a great mother (and before you rip me a new one she DOES want to be a mom one day).

&#x200B;

The second class was a womens self defense class. I took part in this one as ""the bad guy"" and I was a practice dummy for her lessons on how to fend off assaults. I got manhandled by about 15 women. We had a a few short sparring sessions in between her classes and she worked me. For those of you who wanted her to beat me up she got the chance to (although she didn't hurt me she could have if she wanted to)

&#x200B;

I definitely saw the value beyond money in what she does. She taught 30 kids about discipline, confidence, courage, standing up to bullies, she taught 14 women how to defend themselves from an assault. Most importantly I saw the qualities beyond her appearance that I love most about her really shine. I realized the things I love most about her; Her courage, her compassion, her strength, her assertiveness, her kindness, and patience, her wisdom, her discipline this is where it comes from. This is really the part of her I love. It doesn't come from the modeling it comes from this. I also saw how much she loved what she was doing. I saw in her a light that shone in a way that never does when she talks about modeling. I'm honestly a little emotional about how wrong I was.

&#x200B;

I told her this when I went out to dinner and we talked about what it means to her and why its important. She also filled me on the modeling thing. She doesn't like to lead with it for a number of reasons that most of you pointed out

&#x200B;

First off its not as glamours as I thought it was

&#x200B;

She said many times she has to deal with negative stigmas as the result of saying shes a model

&#x200B;

She works as a model because of a few accidents. She was born pretty and she ran into an agent as a teenager. Thats all it took for her to be a model. It took her years of work and dedication to be where she is with martial arts. She started as a little girl and pushed through it all throughout both her childhood and her teenage years which is pretty impressive when you consider how transient interests usually are for kids and teens. She feels a greater sense of accomplishment and fulfillment doing this then having her pictures taken. She said being called a ""Model"" defines her by her appearance defines her by WHAT she is and not WHO she is. She doesn't want to be defined by the way she looks she wants to be defined by what she does. She doesn't feel that being a ""model"" is who she is its just something she does to make money but its not a core part of her identity.

&#x200B;

She doesn't feel the modeling industry encourages a healthy body image for other women and feels guilty that she is the image that many other women look to and are expected to look like. That she often has to deal with jealousy from other women or that she can make other women feel insecure about themselves and she doesn't like that. She doesn't want other women to feel bad about themselves because of her. She feels while its hypocritical of her to profit off of it she feels like it would be stupid to turn down the chance to make good money while she can. She wants to use this opportunity while she is still young enough to earn up the money to open her dojo or buy the ones she works at now and do that full time when she ages out of modelling.

&#x200B;

This is where I lit up and felt I had something to really offer her. I work in finance. Go ahead hate me but I DO like money. I like to have it, I like to make it, I like the freedom it affords and I like to watch it flow and grow. So I offered to help her come up with a financial plan to reach her goal of opening up her own dojo. I thought it was a great opportunity for me to use what I know and love to help her do what she knows and loves. We both win. She agreed and next week we are going to meet to go through her finances and I will put together a plan to help her hit her goal.

&#x200B;

Finally I asked her if it was ok to sign up for one of her classes and she lit up and said she would love that.

&#x200B;

I know a lot of you are probably going to be disappointed she didn't dump me on the spot. I learned a lot today, a lot about her, a lot about myself. In the end this turned out to be something that helped me learn a lot more about who she is and why I love her. So honestly thank you AITA yea you were mean, yea you were vitriolic, yea it hurt, but I needed it to show me how far up my own ass my head was. Is she the better person? Yes she is. Do I deserve her. No I dont, But I am going to do better. I really do love this woman, I wont ever do this again.",2561,15628,0.84

98,Not the A-hole,"This happened about a month ago, but some of my friends think I was the asshole here and I’d like an objective view. 

I decided to throw a joint birthday party for my brother/end of finals week party in my apartment. He and I go to the same college, are in the same major, and are involved in the same clubs, so we have a lot of overlap in our friend groups. Since the group of people was going to be relatively small (seeing as my brother really only wanted to invite one or two people I wouldn’t have invited), I offered to make brunch and mimosas for everyone. 

About a week before the party, one of my friends texted me and said something along the lines of “I invited a guy from Tinder, remember to make extra food for him!” I was kind of taken aback, since I hadn’t realized she was seeing someone. I asked her about him, and found out that this was going to be the first time she’d be meeting him. I was uncomfortable with that, and texted her “I wish you had asked me before you invited him - I’m not really comfortable with this, and I’d rather you didn’t bring him.” 

My friend lost it, and told me I was being ridiculous. She left the group chat for the party, ended up not coming to the party at all, and texted another friend of mine that I was being unfair. 

My other friends are split on this - some of them think I was in the right and that my friend was being rude and childish about the whole thing, and some of the think I was in the wrong and that it wouldn’t have been an issue for her to have a date in an apartment full of people.

She’s 65 and I’m 17, She has a preconceived notion that I would drop everything in my life and take 3 weeks to drive her to Texas to visit family. I told her that I’m not willing to drive her as I have a lot on my plate right now and she got very angry with me, because I am apparently selfish for not wanting to drop the summer classes I’m taking and other things for almost a month to go halfway across the country. 

The thing is, she is perfectly capable of driving. I absolutely hate car rides longer than 4 hours, even when driving. Add to the fact that I’ll most likely be listening to Christian talk show radio and her talking about Jesus the whole time, I’ll be in hell. If I was able to listen to my music it would be a little more tolerable, but not much. 

I already have been “needed” to go across town a lot just to do basic stuff for her like cook meals and stuff.

101,Everyone Sucks,"I'm currently unemployed. I've got wealthy parents, so I'm well off, but I've been trying to get a job since the semester ended. Things got pushed back for me regarding one opportunity because of reasons, so lately i've been applying to places I wouldn't mind working in.

I found a posting on indeed for an entry level lab tech position at a water analysis place. They're looking for someone with a background in bio and chem, perfect for me because i'm majoring in microbiology with a minor in chemistry. i applied and was actually super excited about it, because I'd absolutely rather work in a lab than at the starbucks in a barnes' and noble.

My friend and I are both undergrads, but he's a senior going into his last semester and I'm only about to be a junior. He's working in a research lab this summer, drives for uber/lyft and works a 9-5 in a kitchen. The dude has three jobs, n I was kinda uncomfortable when he immediately said ""yo where'd you see that job posting?"" when I told him how psyched I was to have applied there.

He said ""I need a chemistry job more than you do"" (he's a chem/math major). He tried to tell me that water analytics was a ""chem job, not a bio job"", b/c he drove an uber for some guy who worked there. He got resentful and accused me of thinking I was better than everybody else, acting like because I don't want to ""scrub floors"" I'm a dumb brat who wants everything handed to her.

I respect the hustle. I really do. I don't think he knew necessarily that I'm completely willing to work a service job, I just haven't heard back from the places I've applied to yet. I'm not a rich girl who thinks she's above people for anything, I just know that I have a real skillset now.

What I feel really hurt by was the fact that he said he needed this job more than I did. Maybe it's true, I don't know. But all I know is that I'm behind him in experience and this was a job that I could garner some serious resume beef with. I'm sure the same is true for him, but he's been working in research since last semester. That kind of thing is an incredible opportunity that i've been trying to get involved with for basically a year. Not only do I need this experience, but the fact that he has experience over me means he's more likely to land the position. Also, I hate being concerned about this, but he's a handsome, well-spoken 6'1 dude and I'm a 95lb fem with limbs that make people say "" I could snap this in half! ur so delicate and small!""

I told him if he applied for the job + got it I wouldn't talk to him again. He said he didn't care and he laughed because I don't think he was taking me seriously at all. Anyways tonight he sent me a snapchat of the Indeed posting (I told him where it was obvi) saying ""guess where I just applied?"". I didn't respond. I don't think I can talk to him even now.

Is this shitty of me? Should I just get over it? Is he right and should I just apply to McDonald's instead of searching for positions in my career? Ugh.

To clarify, like, I really did come to this subreddit to ask if I was being overdramatic. I know I can be sensitive sometimes. And it's not as if I've actually stopped talking to him--at this point, all I've done is not reply to a snapchat that he sent me tonight. All I am is genuinely hurt by his behavior and I don't know if I should bother continuing our friendship.

103,Asshole,"I put the important details that give context to why my sister loathes him enough to threaten him.

I’ve (32F) have known partner (34M) since high school. We dated on and off in college. After a few years apart, we reconnected and started a relationship.5 years in, things are going well. Partner proposes. Wedding plans are made, dress is purchased, deposits are put down on a venue, when my partner totally changes: he gives me the silent treatment, starts harping on my flaws and where we are more different, says we don’t fit but doesn’t break up with me. I’m very emotional throughout, trying to explain how badly I feel and how cold he’s being and what can I do to make things better.  I reach a breaking point after about 5 months of this and return the ring. I move out, devastated.

9 months later, we get back together, he mini re-proposes.  Thenhe falls back into the same pattern as before: silent treatment, cold, emotionally withdrawn, rude and dismissive of how I feel (I’d cry and try again to explain how I was feeling, there was some gaslighting as to nothing occurring like what I was talking about). Then I discovered after 2 months of this that he was cheating: I broke up with him, gave him back the ring and moved out again and started my grad program.

We have slowly been putting the relationship back together after a year (therapy and true horror/repentance on his part). Enter my family: they hate him. After years together they were close with my partner. The first time around they were sad for me and saw how devastated I was (I cried a lot and was pretty depressed during this period). They expressed concern when we got back together. After the second breakup and cheating, they basically think he’s a liar, used up years of my life and played with my love for him and threw it away, and that I am an idiot for trying to go to therapy or forgiving him. I don’t really try to change their views: enough things have occurred that a lot of their feelings are grounded in events and statements and truth.

So at home, my sister sees my partner at an event this evening (they work for the same large company but different buildings/departments).  She hasn’t seen him in probably a year and half. She tells him that if he is fucking with me again, she will destroy him. She texts me about this interaction, as does my partner (he doesn’t go into details).

I feel conflicted. As a partner, I should probably admonish my sister, and my instinct is to apologize to my man on her behalf. But there’s an equal part of me that’s like, my sister’s feelings aren’t invalid or wrong, and my partner made this mess and did lie and cheat, so while he doesn’t deserve threats, it’s reasonable that he would receive them

TLDR: AITA if I don’t check my sister and family generally for issuing threats to my partner in light of the fact he lied, cheated, and was emotionally abusive?",35,32,0.85
104,Not the A-hole,"Backstory. I own a company with someone else. We have used this lawyer before to make a contract for us and it went great but was a little spendy. 

Later on an ex employee decided to sue us for bogus reasons. I took the  notice straight to this lawyer. We worked it out and provided documentation required and from that point in never heard back from the other lawyer. We recieved the bill for all the work done and paid it in full. 

Flash forward to 4 months later where we have assumed it was all good and moved on. I get an unsolicited email, as in I have never reached out since then. ""Dear client, I just wanted to email you to say that since we still have not heard back I will consider this matter closed. They must have dropped it. They can reopen it if they want for this long of time. Thank you.""

I simply replied ""ok thank you."" 

Today, a week later, I got a letter in the mail due for $38 for them emailing me their message...

Would I be the asshole if I made a big deal about paying this? Its not about the dollar amount. I just dont feel like theh have any right to charge me for that. I knew it was closed by not hearing back and had paid in full and I feel its unethical to send me that bill.",18,34,0.93

106,Everyone Sucks,"So right now I'm struggling to find a job, and people are saying it ""serves me right"". Could use insight.

So at my college, we happened to have a private Facebook group for just men, ""gentlemen of ____"" (there was one for women too).

It was fun and chill when I first joined, enjoying the privacy of it and since it was independent and not official/monitored, it was fun to talk about things occasionally that normally wouldn't be all that appropriate. As well as randomly gossip about professors and stuff and others.

There would also be the occasional ""smash or pass"" posts (just random models from the internet), which were alright I guess, but then I noticed they started to talk about some of our female classmates like that, sharing their sexual fantasies and what they would like to do with them, in detail. Kinda made me a bit uncomfortable since I was good friends with some of them.

I mentioned it to a friend who was being talked about and what was being said, she freaked out and next thing I know, a few days later the group is shut down and several men from it are expelled, and I get a notice that I'm about to be. I had to fight them and explain that I wasn't a part of it and how it is because of me that they know about it so they don't see me as ""guilty by association"", which wasn't easy but I did eventually get my expulsion overturned and my degree.

Initially I wanted to be anonymous before I realized I'd be taking the fall for it, but eventually I realized it's nothing to be ashamed of considering what they did. Or is it? I have been struggling to find a job and now people who know what I did are saying I deserve to be jobless.

108,Not the A-hole,"IF YOU CARE ABOUT END CREDIT SCENES LIKE THESE PEOPLE DONT READ I GUESS

So, I have been working at a movie theater for a summer job, and my movie theater has ushers, but ushers at our theater don’t rip people’s tickets, they just clean the theaters. So that’s what I’ve been doing recently on my shifts and it’s pretty laid back and easy.

So ushers get a door sheet, and it has what theaters to go to in an order so you can clean each theater after everyone gets out efficiently. And I had Dark Phoenix and another movie to clean at the same time. It’s super slow on weekdays so it’s not a big deal. But I knew the other movie besides Dark Phoenix was pretty crowded so I wanted to be as efficient as possible. So when I walked into Dark Phoenix, and the credits were rolling, there was 4 sets of people still in the theater presumably waiting for the end credit scene like most super hero movies have these days. So, to help them out (in my mind I guess) and myself out to clean the theater faster, I told them “hey guys, you don’t have to wait around there’s no end credit scene.” I’ve done this many times with no issues but this couple in this showing had an issue. They got up from their seat and yelled at me for “ruining their movie going experience” and wanted to speak to a manager.

So I call a manger to the theater and they tell the manger that I was rude for spoiling that there was no end credit scene and they complained also that I was shining a flash light as well. I told my manager that last part was false but I didn’t see an issue with telling them as it saved them time. My manager told the couple we were sorry and he gave them a free movie pass. Once they left, my manager told me to just stop telling people about how there’s no end credit scene.

109,Not the A-hole,"Background: I am a 19m living and working at home for the summer in a factory. I go to university, and the factory job is temporary full time. 

I have a co-worker that is older than I by at least 20 years, and relatively new at the factory. Since I've returned for the summer, he has made a variety of comments about my appearance, some boarding on sexual. He is not married, no kids, and seems like a lonely guy. I have always tried to be a bit of a friend to him, and as a result he has become comfortable in joking with me. The comments started as general complements about my ""race"" (I am of German descent) saying things like ""you Germans are just a beautiful people,"" or ""I wish I looked more like you do, you must get with a ton of girls.""

He also is overly interested in my sex life, asking what races I prefer, how many women I've been with, etc. 

Today, out of the blue, he said ""I'll give you $20 if you let me touch your butt."" Now, this caught me off guard, and I just said ""not worth it."" He pulled out his wallet and showed me how much cash he had and said ""I've got more, $40, 50, 60?"" I laughed it off, as he said it in a joking tone, but I again, declined and got back to my work.

By “alone” I mean I am 10 minutes (at the most with traffic) away, they each have a device they can contact me directly on, the oldest has a non-password protected device that can call 911 if needed by any of them. But I can probably get their faster than 911 in our town. I can also leave my job at any time for any reason and be home with them as needed, or bring them to work with me. 

I work 6 hours a day, that schedule is extremely well flexible. If I go in at 6 am I am home by noon. I usually work 7 am to 1 pm during the summer. I also come home for a lunch break about half way through my day. We have a neighbor who lives 1 block away who does daycare out of her home, but doesn’t have room for my kids, if anything was going bad at home they can go there to calm down and get a new perspective. We also live 2 blocks from the elementary school where kids play in mass daily and my children are often invited. 

AITA for putting my kids back into the unsupervised 80-90’s?

I pay the kids: 12 gets $5 per day, 11 gets $3 per day and 7 gets $1 per day.

So I'll try to make the backstory as quick as possible. 

My mom died when I was a teenager and years later he remarried to a woman with a baby and they have since had a daughter together. 

From his previous marriage he has two adult offspring: myself and my younger brother (who has 3 kids of his own now) and she has 2 adult boys. So that's 6 kids in total. I have 1 blood brother, 3 step brothers and a half sister.

I love my blended family and my littlest siblings especially.

A few weekends ago my boyfriend and I are over at my dad's place and my dad announces that he's redone his will and life insurance so that it all will go to the two youngest because my brother and I are grown up and settled.

I didn't say anything because I was pretty surprised. My dad has a government job so his life insurance policy is worth an awful lot of money. Like definitely enough to split between 4 kids.

My boyfriend and I are by no means rich but we just bought a house recently and we are settled pretty comfortably. 

My brother has 3 kids and they are not well off in any capacity and regularly have to borrow money. So grown up yes, settled not so much. 

Am I an asshole if I'm offended that we (my blood brother and me) aren't included in his will or his life insurance policy?

116,Not the A-hole,"My (60 f) sister (69) has made bad financial decisions her entire life. Our mother has helped her a lot over the years. Mom died several years ago leaving each of us $75,000. 

Sis took years to be a counselor. She worked part time a few years before getting full time. She worked a few more years then decided to retire at 67 with virtually no savings, a tiny pension plus the govt pension. She still owes on a car bought before mom died taking up 2/3 of the govt pension. A friend offered her cheap rent so she thought she would be fine.

A year later, her friend is going sour. She hints she wants to move in with me. I hint no. I have a husband who likes to lounge in his underwear. We have had the house to ourselves only one year as our kids have each returned to save for their own houses. We are really enjoying it. And we need to do renos. I have just fixed up the rec room, got a new tv and finally have space for my hobbies.

She has a car accident and  borrows $2000 from me in September. I dont expect to see it again and tell her no more. She gets mad and insists she will pay it back but she has never paid me back before.

Mid November her friend tells her to leave. She begs to come to my house. I tell her ok but only until summer and she has to pay expenses. I am not mom and will not subsidize her life. She moves in mid December and within 2 weeks I blow up because she is avoiding helping out or paying anything and has made me unwelcome in my rec room.. She cries that she has no money but offers no reason why but she will do better.

We go away for 2 months. She does no cleaning while we are gone. My DIL cleans before we come home but sis stops her doing the fridge. Says she will do it but doesn't. It is gross.

She continues on as always. I cook and clean and work in our home office. She sleeps til noon and watches my tv. I get pissed. She makes 2 meals in 5 months and makes a big deal of paying $50 - like I am robbing her. She keeps snacks in her room. When I dont buy the cereal she likes, she does but keeps it in her room too. One evening, I am frantically lining up work for our crews as the weather has been brutal and we can't do as planned. She pouts in the dining room sighing because I haven't started dinner. She finally asks if she can make herself a sandwich as if I would refuse. But it would have been nice to offer to make one for each of us or start dinner. I tell her I will get to it when I can. As I serve dinner an hour later, I ask if she would like to contribute to groceries and she whines that she has no money or she would. I am fed up. I have told her she cant afford her car but she will not give it up and thinks mooching off me is ok. Mr. tells her he wants her out. She asks for the end of summer.  He says end of June.

118,Asshole,"Bit of background (sorry I suck at explaining things) , I (M21) was walking this girl (F22) home from our first date. We met each other 2 weeks ago on tinder and decided to meet irl. We were walking through this sketchy looking neighborhood (looked old and broken down) when all of us sudden I hear gunshots. My date screamed and I immediately go ""fuck this"" and run as fast and far away as I can. My date texted me an hour later, telling me it was just firecrackers (in my defense I've never heard a gunshot in real life before) and called me an asshole and a pussy for leaving her there alone for dead (she thought they were gunshots too until she saw for herself that they weren't). My view is that I just met her two weeks ago, I sure as hell ain't gonna risk her slowing me down by waiting for her at the cost of my life. I value my life way more than hers (sounds harsh but it's true). Also why the hell did she need to be with me to run away, couldn't she have just ran herself? Also I'd rather be an alive pussy then a dead one. I think its just survival instincts, but I might as well ask if I'm the asshole

She's blocked me, probably for the better since I was gonna dump her anyways (she was a lot snobbier irl than on tinder and was rude to the waiter) though I definitely didn't expect THAT to be the way it ended.

The thing is that she ALWAYS spends her money on dumb things. Anytime we go out to eat, she’s the one who orders a drink (besides water) and a appetizer. Anytime she comes at one of our places, she brings over bags from high-cost places like chipotle and Starbucks. I try to tell her she needs to budget to learn how to budget and stop unnecessary expenses, meal prep her meals, and actually start trying to save but she just brushes me off. 

Well we recently came from a group vacation (which she HAD to have spent at least $400 because that’s how much each individual share was, not including things like food). She called me freaking out this morning because her dog accidentally ate a chicken bone, and it got stuck in its throat. The vet said he’s going to need surgery, which will cost her over $500. She wants to borrow $350 from me and says she’ll pay me back in 2 weeks. 

I told her I’ll give her the money IF she promises to stop wasting her money on things she doesn’t need and actually start SAVING it.

I told them that spending mentality is exactly what’s going to perpetuate that cycle of poverty and she needs to be more conscience of her spending habits. 

I’m kinda fuming that everyone took her side and I needed to write this all out. I’m sitting here knowing I’m trying to help her. I don’t *think* that I’m an asshole here, but I’m willing to accept the fact that I am if I REALLY am..",698,1592,0.92
120,No A-holes here,"Preparing to be called the asshole but here goes...
My son is 24 and disabled so his job prospects are very limited. I give him some money (~60% of his total income) every month to pay his rent and buy essentials with. His mother (we’re divorced) also gives him a little bit of money. His disability payments are minuscule and would not even cover 1/3 of his rent. He’s been taking online classes hoping to get some kind of remote IT role, which could really work out for him one day.

But three months he had news that made my heart drop. He found a girlfriend for the first time but this woman is not only 8 years older than him, she’s also pregnant with someone else’s child. He says she’s an abuse victim escaping her violent ex and they met online but she’s already moved in with him AND she’s already changed her online profile name to his last name despite not being married (he said she did it for safety reasons. Now he’s excited to be the father of her baby and start their lives together. 

This meant taking a pause on his education, his goals, everything just to take care of her and her child. I told him I had to put my foot down and if he chooses this then I can’t support him financially. He was distraught and begged me but I said no. I can’t give him money to raise someone else’s child and waste his own life. 

My ex wife is furious because she says I’m sabotaging his happiness and trying to control him with money. I just don’t trust his girlfriend and her intentions and I don’t feel right funding this kind of lifestyle. At least before I knew that my money was helping him to become self-sustainable one day (I was also paying for his classes) but now I know any money I give him will be an indefinite thing since neither of them
can work. But on the other hand he really does seem happy despite all the alarm bells going off for me. AITA?

Edit: To everyone asking what he would do about rent, if I cut him off it wouldn’t be all at once. His 2 year lease is ending in October, so I would naturally end rent payments there and he’d have to find a place he can afford himself without me as co-signer. 

As for the other expenses, most of that went towards his schooling. I would also naturally end that since he’s no longer taking the courses. 

But the biggest thing is still rent. His mother and I had initially decided that it would be best if he could move out and get a nice apartment downtown so he could see his friends and have a better social life than being stuck in the burbs. But obviously rent there is far far more than what his disability would ever cover. I paid it thinking it would help him get a good job and be self-sufficient one day.

So he is mostly upset over the thought of moving. On his disability + my ex’s support he would only be able to afford either a tiny studio or a very rundown one bedroom apartment in much less desirable area.",249,1410,0.97

122,Not the A-hole,"My 21 year old step daughter is diagnosed with bipolar disorder. As of last night, she is in the hospital again after going off her meds. Again.

Back story: The last time this happened a year and a half ago, we got her set up on meds, helped her with her programs, and let her live with us, after previously running away from both our home and bio-moms house. She stole from us, she liked to us, and ultimately was asked to leave, so she stayed with her another family member, whom she also stole from and eventually was asked to leave. My step daughter then moved 20 hours away because she ""hated us"" and we ""made her life miserable."". After two months, she came back, to be with her boyfriend here. She moved in illegally with him into dorm housing, got caught, and got kicked out. She then moved about 3 hours away from all her family, and moved in with her boyfriend's mom, which brings us to now. She had been taking her meds, but went off them. She quit her job, torched her school (figuratively), and became manic. Last night she stole their family car to check herself into a hospital. BFs mom says she doesn't want her living there anymore.

I have 2 other step children, tween years. Part of why we wouldn't let her back is the drugs, people to fuck, and bullshit she brought into our house. She did this at bio-moms house too. I am also now pregnant, so we are concerned about her around that child as well. At one point, she drugged our dog (with melatonin) when we were sleeping so he would not alert us, when she snuck literal strangers into our home to fuck them and get high with them!! 

Here's where the AITA part comes in. Her boyfriend's mom is DESTROYING us, telling me, bio mom, and husband that we are pieces of shit, that we don't do anything for our daughter, and that we are ultimately killing her. In my heart, I know we have tried everything, from trying to help with rent in a city closer to supports, setting up therapy for her, offering to go to therapy together, and even getting her extra VA benefits thru her dad (dad is military).
It's hard to know because I feel we are too close to the situation, so Reddit, I ask: are we the assholes for denying stepdaughter to come move back in with us? It's hard not to snap at the bfs mom, but we are all so burnt out.

Edit: UPDATE

Thank you all for your responses. As I stated a few times, I needed the feedback and a reality check to make sure we weren't out of line. I was vulnerable, and you were (mostly) kind.

I had a long conversation with BFs mom and she broke down and cried. She said she's scared shitless because she is afraid her son will be with my SD forever, and that she can't handle her. I educated her on bipolar disorder, and she was like, ""omg, lightbulb! That's her to a T!"". Ultimately, the plan is for SD to go back to BFs mom house and take her meds, attend her programs, and then start up school again (it's still salvageable at this point, but only as long as she's in her MH programs). If SD quits school, she is no longer welcome at BFs house, and we, all three parents, will get her into a transitional house or halfway house. All of us, including BFs mom, agree. So, I'll never be friends with the mom, but at least she can understand our position now.

123,Asshole,"This is still extremely early stage so I’m just trying to get outsider opinions. 

Husband and I tried to conceive for nearly a year with no success. Turns out he has a genetic issue that could cause infertility after a certain age. Doctors say we could keep trying but I’m getting older (34) too and we don’t think it’s right to keep putting it off. 

We want to go with a sperm donor but this is where we disagree. I want to ask one of my best friends, because I’ve known him since we were kids and I trust his character 110%. Husband wants to go with a donor, which makes me uncomfortable because we’ll never get to meet this guy and know what kind of person he actually is. I don’t care about height or eye color or degrees or whatever. I just need to know that the ~~father~~ biological parent of my future children is a kind and upstanding person. 

My husband is freaking out over my suggestion because he thinks it implies I have feelings for my friend, which is so ridiculous I can’t even start. I told him my friend lives in another country halfway around the world and I see him as a brother, but I know and trust him which is the key difference between him and other donors. 

So now we’ve come to a standstill. Husband says 1000% no but I think he’s being extremely closed minded and negligent of my fears and anxieties. I know it’s a pride thing for him but I wish he could at least acknowledge my fears. I simply do not want to get pregnant then raise a child with the DNA of a stranger. Is that so unreasonable? AITA?

**EDIT** : To add a few more details, this friend of mine has been staunchly childfree since his teens. He would not be interested in being in our kid’s life as anything beyond a friendly distant family friend. 

But another reason I want to choose him is that I like the idea of the kid (after reaching adulthood) being given the choice of reaching out to his/her biological dad and knowing about him. My own father died when I was 6 and I’ve always felt like there was a hole in me even though I had very loving stepdads. There were aspects of my personality that I couldn’t explain that was dissimilar to all my halfsibs but everyone I met told me how similar I am to my dad, so I can’t help but feel like children should know the person who gave them half their DNA, even if they don’t call him “dad.”

**EDIT2**: Copying pasting a comment I wrote below:


Ok obviously everyone is getting really hung up over the word “father” which I should probably edit out. 

I DO NOT INTEND ON THIS FRIEND BEING A FATHER IN ANY CAPACITY. 

When I said father I probably should’ve said “DNA donor” because that’s what I meant. I don’t need this guy to be a dad because my husband would be all the dad our baby needs. All I’m saying is that it would be nice to know about our dna donor in a more personal sense, since our literal child will be half him genetically. And I will need to carry and give birth to this child on top of that.

I don’t feel comfortable with anonymous donors because I’ll never get to know them as people or as friends. I know that people are going to say “personality is how you raise them” and I agree to an extent but not completely. I think some traits are inheritable and there’s nothing that can change that. And I think it’s pretty naive to believe that personality traits somehow can’t be inherited but intelligence, physical attributes, illness, etc. can. 

Finally, with my first edit I only meant that it would be nice for our kid to eventually have the CHOICE of meeting his/her “dna donor.” I know there are some sperm banks that have this option but again, without knowing who the guy is very well, I wouldn’t feel comfortable letting my kid know a complete stranger.",498,814,0.87
124,Not the A-hole,"This happened years ago & I've always wondered if I did the right thing here. I will be fudging some details bc I have no idea if my friend or anyone connected Reddits.

 
Context: when my friend was single, she moved home for a bit to save some money after school and lived with her immediate family again. When she moved out, she left some boxes intending to get them later.

 

Fast forward some years & we're planning her wedding. We're 6 months out and I'm meeting with her family (mom, dad, & grandma) to finalize things. We get to talking about relationships and how lucky my friend is to have found her fiance and the mom & grandma drop the bomb. Apparently when my friend moved out and left her boxes, her mom and grandma took it upon themselves to rifle through everything. School items, personal papers, but (IMO) the most damaging was an ""ex"" box, full of correspondence from her last long distance relationship and they read every last detail. Extremely intimate things (graphic letters, etc) that they then begin talking about to me in detail, in front of her dad (!!). I am so uncomfortable I tune out and nope TF out as fast as I can but not before they swear me to secrecy bc ""my friend can never know"". I just wanted to get the heck out so I agreed and left.

 

After, I thought about it and I was pretty upset they did this. They put me in a horrible position telling me this and then making me keep it private. Hindsight, I should have told her right away but her wedding was mere months out and I didn't want to potentially be responsible for family turmoil. I decide to keep it to myself and move on. About 6ish months after the wedding, I'm chatting on the phone with my friend. She mentions that her and her husband were considering moving back in with her family to save money for a house. The whole thing comes flooding back to me and I'm agonizing over the fact that this would be a Very Big Deal to me if I were in my friend's shoes. After some thinking, I decided to tell her. I explained I never meant to mention this to anyone EVER bc I didn't think it would ever become an issue. This would be a huge piece of information I would want if I were making this decision, not just for me but for my spouse who is entrusting his belongs to the space too. She wasn't surprised and said it was mostly her fault for leaving the boxes there in the first place. She thanked me for telling her. I warned that her mom was likely going to be upset with me for speaking up but she's my friend and my allegiance was to her & it felt wrong to keep it from her any longer considering the circumstances. I apologized for not saying anything sooner and explained how I was worried about causing problems for her wedding. Overall, we ended up fine. Our relationship wasn't affected, however her mom is, as anticipated, noticeably much cooler to me than before.

 

A friend who knew the situation and is close to both of us said I am the TA and should have kept it to myself. AITA?",13,37,0.94
125,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because people close to the situation use Reddit and I don't want it getting around if it turns out I would be the asshole. 

&#x200B;

Would I be the asshole if I kept a dog I'm fostering even though the owner wants the dog back eventually, especially if they are a friend?

About a year ago my friend rescued this beautiful German Shepard but quickly found out he has some behavior problems. He has severe separation anxiety, can be fairly aggressive and tends to be a bit of a escape artist. My friend came to the conclusion that even though he loves this dog, he cant care for him due to living situation and not having enough time or even the knowledge of how to start training him. He was talking about bringing the dog to a shelter and surrendering him when as a last ditch effort I offered to take him in. We never set a time frame for how long I'd keep the dog because originally we planned to see how well he settled into my household and go from there. We expected it to be the same situation and eventually have to cave and take him in and surrender him anyways. 

I've now had this dog for about 6 months, where my friend had him for only 3 weeks, and hes striving here. He gets along with my other pets, I have more time for him and more ability and experience with larger and more aggressive dogs. He has come along way from the scared timid dog he use to be and is truly happy here. In all honesty I've fallen in love with this dog. My friend still believes that he will move out into his own house within the next year, honestly doubtful as he is still in school, and will be taking the dog with him. I know he truly loves this dog, I can see it when he comes over and how he talks about him and future plans for the two of them but I don't know if I can let him go.  I want to sit down with my friend and explain to him that since his dog is doing great here, gets along with my other pets and because of his separation anxiety I think it would be in his best interest if I adopted him. I know he wont take it well and no matter the answer it might ruin our friendship.

126,Not the A-hole,"The background: 
father in law has always played too rough with my kids, imo.  I, as well as my parents, husband, mother in law often have to tell him to take it down a notch. He does not intend to hurt them but I'm uncomfortable with very boisterous wrestling etc. And feel it leads to someone becoming hurt.
The incident: 
Father in law is visiting and gets kids too riled up, I suggest we take it outside to birm off extra energy as it's too much for the house (and me). I get the kids swinging on our backyard playset. Out comes father in law
 He sits in one swing, reaches for my son (4) on the side bar who he said was going to fall,  but just then my daughter (6) charges at him knocking him backward to the ground. Father in law injures his back and goes to dr for pain medicine. He returns home and misses some work, requires physical therapy and is worried he will need surgery or never recover. We, obviously, feel terrible an accident has occured and offer condolences and concern. He asks us to look onto our house insurance coverage. It is determined that a claim of assault would cost us $600 in losing our no claim insurance discount and we agree if needed he should use it, that's what its for. Luckily, he recovers fully with no surgery and he resumes physically helping brother in law with house renovations and attends ski trips etc
 We are happy hes fine.
The fall out:
We travel to spend Christmas with them about 8 months after the incident, gifts are exchanged, a good time is had. As we pack to leave, father in law asks husband for money to cover his initial dr visit etc and"" jokingly ""says otherwise he'll press to the insurance. We are surprised but pay him with a check. Then, he and mother in law both take the money but simultaneously insist they dont need the money, and it isn't about the money. They just wanted to issue a 'wake up call'. They reveal they blame my daughter and I for causing the accident because I failed to make it clear that the rough housing was over.
To me, the wake up call is that the inlaws have always been ""run of the mill"" judgemental of my parenting and out of touch with young kids
And the fact that they cannot stop playing immediately. (My kids get unsolicited compliments all the time for being sweet, well behaved etc)
Husband and I expressed that as a result of their taking money they didn't even need as a wake up call I will not spend time around  father in law without husband there. this will limit the potential for visits. And I think he should not be welcome back to property. I personally do not want to go visit their new house but husband wants to take kids and go. I think they should apologize first but won't stop husband from taking kids to the visit. AITA???",75,408,0.97

It's always a little weird when you have to buy items like these, and there's always that elephant in the room when you go up to the register. I appreciate when cashiers don't make comments and keep it professional in these situations.

so anyway, I go up to the register to buy these items, and the jovial black guy says something like ""well hello, looks like you'll be having a good time tonight!!""

He looks at me, I seem like a chill dude, and he expects me to laugh along with him. In the spur of the moment, I decided to give him a death stare and totally kill the mood for him.

I can tell that his failed attempt to make a joke really embarrassed him. He started to sulk and frown and stopped joking with his coworkers. Then I thought to myself, damn it wasn't really that big a deal. I didn't want to ruin his mood or anything. In reality I wasn't as offended as my death stare let on. Maybe a 2 out of 10 on the offended scale.

I always wait to pay until after delivery due to having in the past paid before delivery for items that never showed up. When that happens you have to go through a whole process with the company to get your money back. I usually tip between 15-20% based on how far the driver had to go, time of day, etc.

Well, after my delivery driver picked up our food he immediately texted me and said ""You can tip online before I get to the house""

This instantly pissed me off. Maybe it shouldn't have, but it made me feel really insulted. I get that they are working for tips and whatever they get paid by the app, but I find it extremely rude to basically beg for a tip on a service that has yet to be rendered.

Ok, so tiny bit if backstory...I mow lawns for a living as a one woman crew. As I'm sure you can imagine, it's very exhausting work. When I get home from work, I try to lay down for a little while to regain some energy to finish my day as a mom and wife. 

Well, we have this little neighbor girl that likes to play with my daughter. We have had issues in the past about her running to knock on our door without an adult with her. She's been told many times that this is not allowed. I've taken her home many times to her grandparents' surprise....they didn't give her permission and didn't know she was here. 

Today, after a particularly hard day/week for me.... there's a knock at the door. I ignore it because I'm not expecting anyone, and we are trying to rest. They knock again and then again and again for at least 5 minutes with short pauses in between. Like I said, we were trying to rest, so I am very upset by this point. I get out of bed and look out the window, it's the little girl from nextdoor! I open the front door and very sternly yelled at her ""If you knock on someone's door and they don't answer after the second time, you stop knocking! Banging on my door is very rude! Go home, now!""

133,Not the A-hole,"I work in a small office with just five people. Three are in their own offices, and the other I share a common area. My common area coworker is not a Reddit user, however it became clear to me that she had some information that she wouldn't know about me any other way. 

I do have a real life stalker, who've I've complained about at work mulitiple times. My coworker could have only gotten this information from someone who is stalking me. Then, last week my stalker gave my coworker my user name and my coworker spend the better part of two days reading every post and comment I ever made. While at work, mind you. 

First of all, I am in no way ashamed about my past, which is what the majority of my posts are about. However, before I realized that my coworker openly communicated with my stalker, I did post a comment on a rant post specifically about her. When I did not realize she would read it or know about it. Just an anonymous rant about a coworker posted on a site she doesn't use. It was after that I realized she did have access to rants about her, but not the rest of it. Just based on her snide comments. 

After I realized she was, in my opinion, invading my privacy and probably telling my stalker stuff about me, I started insulting her on Reddit. Today is my day off and I told a friend about it, also not a Reddit user, and the friend said it was kinda mean. However, my coworker isn't exactly the easiest person to deal with. She's extremely petty. Often complains about me to the manager about things that I didn't actually do, or sometimes tells me to do something a certain way, then reports me for doing it wrong. She's also makes it a point to call me out on a mistake, loudly, in front of guests or representatives from other companies. If confronted, she acts like a victim or denies it happened. So, I feel kinda justified insulting her knowing she'll maybe read it later and get her feelings hurt. I just feel like she shouldn't be reading what I post on anonymously on my off time. 

Am I the asshole for insulting my coworker, knowing she reads it. Maybe this, maybe not. She only seems to do it while we're at work, and we're closed for the day.

Update - I wasn't going to update this, but now there's more. I found out my coworker was in fact stealing. I gathered up the evidence of the theft and told our manager. Then, I was fired for being vindictive. No joke. Fine, whatever. I'll just look for another job, no big fucking deal - keep a thief. 

Then, today I was at the grocery store and ran into a vendor that sometimes came into the office. They informed me that coworker had told them that I quit. Just left them in the lurch and poor baby coworker was stuck doing my job. Told them I'd found another job and just left without a notice. Lies, just all lies to make herself look victimized. But, also it hurts my reputation. I still have to find a job. These ""vendors"" are very valuable contacts for me in that regard, and she seems to be intentionally hurting my chances at finding another job. And, this is not the first I've heard of this. She has also called other people who work in our industry and spread rumors about me. At this point, I think coworker has ventured from meer assholelyness to lawsuit territory.",145,398,0.92

137,Asshole,"So my boyfriend had some sort of sore on his penis the other week. He got really concerned about it and went to the campus doctor and they said that it wasn't anything serious (eliminated gonorrhea, chlamydia, HIV, etc). They said it might be an allergic reaction, it might be from irritation during sex or masturbation, or it might be a herpes sore. He asked them if they could test for herpes, and they said okay but because the sore had already scabbed over, the test might come back negative regardless. Edit: They also told him it wasn't a big deal regardless and unless he was in a bunch of pain, not to worry about it. 

Well he had the test, and it did come back negative. Now, he wants me to get a blood test for myself for herpes to see if I gave it to him, in case his test failed. However, he's had no other symptoms. I've had no symptoms either.

Basically, I've been doing research on it, and it seems like everything is being blown way out of proportion.

If neither of us have any symptoms except for one tiny sore (which went away in less than two days), then what are we supposed to do with that information? Even if we break up and see other people in the future, what are we supposed to say? ""Hey, before we kiss, I have herpes, but probably you do too, and so do 66% of the people in this bar, so let's make out?""

1. The test is expensive, painful, takes time, and isn't even that reliable.
2. In all likelihood he DOES have herpes already, before he even met me.

We loved buying them together, going to conventions together, and seeing all the movies opening weekend together. I have an older sister, but she has always hated them and ridiculed me for it saying it was embarrassing seeing pictures of my cosplay on Facebook knowing her friends would know that was her sister and I am such a nerd/loser. My mom would also tease me, but not as mean spirited.

At first, my dad said his collection (about 20,000 comics) would be split between my sister and I. I was totally fine with that, but my sister wasn't. She was adamant she wanted nothing to do with any of them- not even if I sold them and gave her the money. Dad even tried to find characters/covers that reminded him of her, and she would always reject them and throw them back in his face.

Dad died 3 years ago, and he had made it clear for years since my sister didn't want any, they would all go to me to take care of and love. He privately expressed relief they would go to someone who values them the way I do. However, my mom hit me out of nowhere last week saying, ""You know, if you die before you have kids, I am taking all the comic books and giving some to your sister."" I said absolutely not.

Also, fyi, I am totally healthy and not on the brink of death (although cancer in your late 20s is prevalent in my family). My husband, who lacked a father figure until he met my dad, also bonded with him over comics and the two of them were close and loved each other.

I reply: ""I might not be able to because I can't afford it right now, I'm trying to save""

""But you are earning \[X\], surely this is nothing to you. Start saving now \[Y amount\] every month""

I stay quiet because them using my payslip against me AND telling me how to spend my money has severely put me off.

Dad, noticing I've stopped talking: ""I have no words for you... You can't even do this for your family""

Classic. 'Asian guilt trip method'. I reply: ""It's not to do with family, I just don't have £700 to be throwing around""

Mum: ""But you have the money for you and your boyfriend to go on holiday""

I knew they would go for this. That holiday cost less than half of what they're getting me to pay.

I once again repeat that I cannot go and promptly leave after this to avoid further stress.

I might add that I'm not just being a cold-hearted brat, refusing to see relatives for Christmas. These relatives are ones I've not seen or talked to in almost 10 years, not very much in common, grew apart - thus you can see why I won't exactly be devastated. Second, if my parents hadn't gone down the ""let's mock/guilt trip her"" route I would've been far more inclined to go out of my own pocket. Who would want to spend Christmas away from family? However, their actions has just left a bad taste in my mouth and tbh, this is not the first time they've done something like this.

Am I actually being a greedy, spoiled asshole here? Or can anyone else see this from my POV????",47,140,0.93
146,Not the A-hole,"For a little bit of background, my roommate and I work at the same job. We work with children who are between the ages of 5 and 12. Some of the children at work act a lot older than their age, and I know for me personally, I sometimes forget how young a couple of the girls in particular actually are due to how mature they act. In addition, I work very well with children and I love my job a lot, my roommate on the other hand tends to be super short-tempered. A lot of the kids gravitate towards me rather than her, and I think she was beginning to feel slightly bothered that they often pick to hangout by me. 

One of the aforementioned girls that is very mature came up to me right before my shift ended today and says, “I heard you have your nipples pierced. Roommate told me.” This caught me off guard, and I was with a group of a lot younger girls and boys that all clearly heard her say it. I shut it down really quickly and told her that’s not something she should be talking about and asked her to stop bringing it up, but the damage was done and I had multiple of the children ask me what nipple piercings are. I’m genuinely worried one of these young kids is going to go home, start asking their parents about nipple piercings, and when asked where they heard that, their response will be “One of the teachers at work has them.” And I will look extremely creepy to a parent that has no idea how their kid actually found out about them. 

I pulled roommate aside and asked her why she told children I have my nipples pierced, told her it’s not okay to be talking about that with kids, wondered why that was even brought up, and told her I plan on taking them out (even though they would never be able to be seen through my shirt at work), and that I was upset she was talking about me to the children, because who knows what else she told them. She quickly got defensive and told me I was being overdramatic and that it’s not a big deal. She thinks I’m being petty for taking them out. 

My boyfriend agreed that she was an asshole for telling kids that, but I’m not sure if I’m being an asshole for taking them out to basically prove a point, but also to try and prevent a further situation if an angry parent learns their child knows about my indecent piercings.",44,76,0.84
147,Asshole,"My son is 3 and he’s a normal healthy happy child. I’m not going to lie and say I wasn’t a little disappointed that I wasn’t having a girl. Ive always wanted to dress a daughter up in cute outfits. It’s fine though, I love my son and wouldn’t change him for the world. 

Recently I saw a really cute dress and I asked my son if he liked it and he said yes so I bought it for him. When I put him in it he did look a bit like a girl because his hair is shoulder length and he had it in two little space buns. It looked really adorable though and he loved it. 

My parents are giving me a hard time for it though and suggesting that I’m trying to make him a girl. I personally see clothing as gender neutral. If he likes it he can have it. But they’ve said I’m forcing it on him?

149,Not enough info,"I work at a grocery store that sells sandwiches made fresh in the morning, then get put on sale 2 hours before closing to sell as much as possible by closing time. An unofficial rule we don't tell customers that if there are too many sandwiches or if the sales are slow, we can start it half an hour earlier (2 and a half hours before closing). This is the time we usually go by.

Now there was a customer none of us really liked, rude customer (RC) was a standoffish Asian woman that looks to be in her 40s. RC would just point to the sandwiches in the case and say ""this, this, and this"". She'll be sure to tell you that you didn't pick the exact one. If there are 2 sandwiches of the same kind and you didn't pick the one she was pointing at, RC would raise her voice a little and say ""No."" then taps on the glass again to point it out. It becomes a game to reach for each one and check her reactions.

RC would also try and demand that we start the half off sale early. Our closing time could be 9 pm and RC would come in at 6 or even 5:30, ask ""half price yet?"" then demand to see a manager when we tell her no and that we won't start early for her. We were polite to her everytime but she never showed the same kind of courtesy or respect back.

The tipping point for me was when RC actually snaps her fingers at one of my coworkers and waves her hand to come over like a servant. That ticked me off.

A few days ago, RC showed up early again and we do the whole routine again. She asks for the manager who tells her no and to wait for the 2-hour mark, which we complied to wait as well. After getting told off, RC hovers around the department a little until the 2-hour mark comes. I made sure to be the one to serve her.

I then proceed to move as slow as I reasonably can to tick RC off. Normally I'd grab all the sandwiches in one go to speed the process. This time I picked one up, place it on the table and go back for the next one. I did the same when cutting the sandwiches, one at a time with a leisurely pace. When other customers show up, I asked my coworkers to help so I could devote my time to RC. After cutting the sandwiches, RC told me she wanted them heated as well. We have panini presses but only one was working at the time. She just wasted even more time as I worked the panini press while humming to myself. I eventually got her sandwiches done the ways she wanted and she left in a huff.

My coworkers and I were laughing in the kitchen and the coworker with me even told me RC had an annoyed face on everytime my back was turned. It felt so good.

However, my family doesn't agree with what I did. They said that working in customer service means you have to deal with them and not stoop down to such petty action. They said I should be helping her more and that I was wrong and rude for doing that to RC.

I never acted this way towards a customer until RC and I don't think that what I did was that bad. AITA?",40,38,0.84
150,Not the A-hole,"This may be long. I apologize, hopefully this all makes sense.

So I am 25F and still live at home with my parents, along with my two brothers. 
Lately my mother had become increasingly more obsessed with knowing every detail of my life.

So the small stuff:
•She’s always texting me wanting to know where I am, with who. If I don’t answer her, I will keep getting texts.
•If I tell her I’m going into town(just for shopping, or date) she needs to know why, exactly where I’m going and with who, and if I don’t tell her before I leave, she grills me when I come home.

The big thing that started this:

So the other day I went to lunch with my brother and his girlfriend. We had a great time and that was it. We saw a friend of hers with her husband, and said Hi. 

Then this morning my brothers girlfriend(BGF) gets a text from my mother wondering who came with me to lunch. BGF then corrected her saying that it was only us 3 at lunch. 
Well mother’s friend has told her that she saw another man come and sit with me...which did not happen. 
So my mother starts grilling BGF thinking that she’s just lying and covering for me. 

So, at this point I’m furious because again she’s trying to figure out everything I’m doing, but this time she’s trying to get the info from others.

Then later on I get a text from her that went like this:
“My spy told me that she saw that same guy with you that was at (another location) last week”

Now, her friend, without going into too much detail had a medical episode earlier this year that has left her memory less than ideal, so I said:
“Your spy has memory issues. There was no one else there except me, (brother), and BGF”

Mom: “I’ll ask (friends husband) if he saw anyone”

Me: “There wasn’t. And even if there was it’s none of your business.”

Mom: “oh really? That’s pretty rude.”

—————
So there we have it, I’ve been pretty upset about her boundary issues for some time.
I also know that she’s going to blow this out of proportion and completely be pissed at me for wanting some freedom.

I have a friend though that says I’m being too harsh on her and just tell her where I am whenever she asks.

151,Not the A-hole,"I am a university student. We are currently trying to decide our accommodation for the next academic year (starting in September). There are enough rooms for all of us; however, some rooms are obviously better than others. There are a few basement rooms which aren't great and tbh, no one wants them. So, to make it fair for everyone, we decided to put all of our names in a hat (basically a ballot), and as names are drawn out at random, the person can choose the room of their liking.

&#x200B;

This became awkward when two of my coursemates (X and Y) said that they have claustrophobia and would therefore not be comfortable in a basement room. X then said (of her own accord) that she would be willing to provide a doctor's note to prove that she has claustrophobia. I agreed with this, and subsequently said that it would only be fair if X and Y provided doctor's notes. Y said that we should be able to appreciate that she has a phobia, implying that a doctor's note shouldn't be necessary. I replied saying anyone could claim to have a phobia, so some evidence would in fact be necessary. Y replied assuring us that she isn't lying. I replied saying that we need to be sure as we want to make this ballot fair for everyone. Y got pretty annoyed by this, basically saying that I was being mean. I replied saying that if she has genuine medical reasons as to why she should be exempt from this ballot, it shouldn't be that difficult to get a doctor's note.

EDIT: The prices for all the rooms are based on their size and independent of the floor on which they are located, so they are not in our control. Also, the accommodation is owned by the university, so they set the prices for each room.

154,Not the A-hole,"My immediate family (all married adults) is planning a big family trip to Disney and trying to figure out where we're going to stay. We want to stay on property for the convenience and full Disney experience. We go every 2-3 years and have done both on and off property hotels and prefer staying on.

Sis and BIL want to share a room with someone to cut costs, but their 1yo is a challenging sleeper who goes to bed pretty early. Whoever stayed with them would be pretty put out on a fun vacation by having to be super quiet in the room and potentially being woken up in the night if he's fussy, so no one is volunteering.

Sis and BIL are getting upset because they're saying they can't afford it if they have to pay for their own room on property. They're talking about not going because of it or at least staying at a different hotel off property. While we obviously want them to be able to go and would love for them to be able to stay with us, so we could spend more time together, if they can't make it work, they can't make it work.

Either way the problem is that they're already playing the guilt card. They don't want to feel isolated by either not going or not staying near everyone else, and it's our fault because we wouldn't share a room.

Are we the assholes for not going out of our way to accommodate them?

Edit: thanks everyone for the input so far! I want to clarify that we completely understand if they decide not come or to stay somewhere else.

155,Asshole,"I was 14 when my niece was born. We were always very close even though I always had a strained relationship with her mother, my older sister. I helped raise my niece until I moved across the country when she was a teen. We talked here and there and she visited me a few times but we're not as close as we used to be. I've gotten married and started a family of my own. 

She's 30 now. Last year she cut the whole family out of her life. I was very heartbroken. Before she did it, she sent me a long email bashing her parents, mostly her mother. She said that her mother ""severely"" neglected and abused her while doting on her son, my niece's younger brother. She shared a lot of personal and disturbing information with me and I was uncomfortable knowing all those things because i respect my sister's privacy. My niece said she tried to work it out with her mother many times but her mother either ignored her or verbally abused her. My niece decided to give up and say goodbye for good. 

My niece said that she wanted to give me the whole story to get me to understand why she cut ties with her immediate family. She said she still wanted a relationship with me. 

I called her and told her that I would not get in the middle of it. My sister had a rough upbringing and she has issues, but she loves my niece with all her heart. She has always talked about my niece with a lot of pride and joy. I think my niece may have exaggerated some things but I didn't tell her that. I told her that I would pray for her and I still wanted a relationship with her as long as she didn't bring up her issues with her mother again. She was silent for a few moments, and said ""OK"" then hung up. She never answered any of my calls or emails again. She cut me out, too.

For the longest time I've felt like my parents have given more to my brothers, who are both older and recently graduated from college. I'm still in college. I also feel like my parents give them more respect, as often feel like I'm being babied.

&#x200B;

My parents have spent a lot more money on my brothers than they have on me. They paid thousands of dollars towards my brothers' tuition. I'm sure they would have paid mine, but I got a full ride. My parents have also bought both of my brothers cars pretty early on. When I was 18, I got a job and several months later my parents bought a new family car, but they told me it was basically mine. I was very grateful, but I was never allowed to drive alone. After a year, I'm allowed to drive alone unless its on the interstate. I have been told I can only drive on the interstate when I'm with them. (I have a full license and everything, but it's my parents' car so I respect their wishes.) This rule never applied to my brothers though, which seemed unfair.

&#x200B;

Yesterday some friends wanted to hang out, and we decided to go out to a restaurant in the evening. I told my parents my plans in the morning. I asked to use the car, and was told that I could use it. An hour before I was going to go, my mom told me that my brother was going to go out with some friends, and he needed to use the car. (His isn't working properly.) She told me to ask some of my friends if they could pick me up, and fortunately one could. (I've had to ask several times before and I feel terrible about it.) The evening went well, but I didn't exactly feel right about that. I had basically reserved the car ahead of time, but I feel as though my brother's needs outweighed my own, and that kind of hurts.

While we were out, my friends mentioned that their lease is ending next year, and invited me to live with them when they find a new place. I told them I'd consider it. This morning I asked my mom if I could speak to her, and I basically told her how I felt. I told her that I feel like I'm getting unequal treatment, and I told her I was seriously considering out moving out next year. I then did something I'm not proud of. I asked if it would be a possibility for them to buy me a new car to use, since they have spent far more on my brothers. This got shut down immediately, and I was told that I needed to quit college and get a full time job if I wanted move out. Honestly, I think that's a fair point. My mother then told me that I ruined her already lousy day, and stormed out. Now I feel like an ungrateful, petty asshole, and I feel like I'm in the wrong. I'm am so thankful for everything that my parents have done for me, but I honestly feel like they care more about my brothers.

Some years ago I made a friend that got me a job with her in another country. Boss provided housing and some coworkers lived together there.

Some months after, my friend's boyfriend also came to work and live with us.

He keept making some mistakes, wasn't making a good job and was unfriendly.

My coworkers went and told the mistakes to the boss, but because the boss had a shortage of workers he stayed.

This evolve for some time and he started badmouthing everyone in his/my language. Almost no one understood what he was saying so he was keeping the job.

One day he and his girfriend started a fire in their room by throwing a cigarette butt in a waste basket. They left the room without noticing the fire until all of us started to smell the smoke.

They begged for us to not tell the boss, but some coworkers went and told the boss, who kicked them out of the house but kept them employed.

He got the idea that because I could understand everything he said I was the one snitching on him. And he started saying threats under his breath. He had a really aggressive tone that made me so nervous that I would be shaking while working. I should also mention that we worked on a kitchen where we handled kitchen knives with a foot long blade, that added to my fear that one day he would snap and hurt someone.

One day he starts talking with me about how good of his girlfriend to haven gotten me the job and that I was ungrateful, and accused me of trying to set them up and trying to make them look bad. He ended up saying something on the line that I was lucky to have the job but that came with me being away from my family (they were all in my original country) and that it would be a pity if something happened to them while I was away.

I went straight to the boss and said I wouldn't work anymore with this person, or he would be fired or I would pack my things and go. He ended up being fired.

Also the condition is pretty rare so there was no doctors available at the hospital in her town who could operate, she had to be brought into a big city hospital two hours away. A pretty awful situation and you could tell how stressed he was. I posted on there my sympathy and that his mother and his family would be in my prayers.

Later when we were messaging asked if I meant that literally or if it's just a general condolence message. I told him it's literal and I've already prayed for his mother.

He said he would never want people thinking talking to an ""imaginary friend"" would help and was starting to aggravate me.

166,Asshole,"My daughter Amy is... different. From a very early age she displayed behavioural issues such as stealing and violent behaviour and was completely defiant to me and my husband. We sought help for this and Amy has had help from specialists for many years which has made a world of difference. 

Unfortunately Amy is incapable of empathy or remorse and there's nothing we can do about that. She does not frighten easily and openly admits that she does not love or care about us which is heartbreaking. Nevertheless she is logical enough to understand that actions have consequences and that she will be punished if she acts out. Amy is very intelligent and is advanced for her age across the board. 

Amy is very charming however. She makes friends very easily and at home speaks in a very ''adult'' sort of way. She can easily hold her own in conversations with adult relatives and family friends but at the same time can act her age and when with her friends speaks like any other 13 year old girl. Her friends parents all find her delightful. In spite of her issues Amy is not that different from anyone else her age and even came up to me the other day asking for advice on a boy she had a crush on, which brought tears to my eyes since it was the first time I've seen that kind of vulnerability from her. 

We also have an 11 year old son, Ryan. Ryan often hangs out with a few boys and girls who live on our street. Amy has no interest in this sort of thing but recently a group of kids from another street have been coming to steal the ball that Ryan and his friends use. I asked Amy if she'd be willing to hang out outside with them and then call me if any trouble starts. 

Yesterday Ryan came running up to the door, saying that Amy was hurt and that I needed to come and see. I found Amy on the floor bleeding and crying in pain. She was severely injured, with the worst being a broken arm. I called an ambulance and she was taken to hospital. 

Ryan told me what happened. Apparently Amy started encouraging Ryan and his friends to go after the bullies and start a fight with them for the ball. They did this, unfortunately one of the bullies had an older sister who came and attacked Amy. Amy said this was all true. 

I feel so guilty. Amy's care plan makes clear that she is not to be left among younger children as she is a danger to them. I took my eye off the ball and thought no harm could happen, and she provoked a fight and got herself severely injured. 

I feel like I deliberately ignored Amy's needs out of convenience to myself.",171,471,0.92
167,Asshole,"I basically live on student loans and my parents help pay my bills. I am hoping to graduate in two years. 

My son is 7 and I divorced his mom 4 years ago but we separated when he was 1.

We are in our 30’s and I pay child support of $450 a month. I see my son every Saturday for 5 hours although the visitation schedule gives me a lot more time. I’d try to see him more but between school and his activities it is hard. He is also very close with his mother and doesn’t like to stay with me overnight.

She got remarried a little over 2 and a half years ago. I don’t really know the guy. He seems okay. Like he has never been an asshole to me or my son. 

My ex is generally okay a lot of times although she gets real defensive about our son and will swing from nice and accommodating to downright mean when she thinks I am doing well by him. 

It bothers her I don’t take more time and she will demand it sometimes saying he needs his father to see him. 

She recently decided that a way to incorporate me more would be to invite me along to their things. When they go to a fun thing, my son calls and “invites” me. I wouldn’t mind going with just him but it feels awkward and forced if she goes along or if she offers to pays for it. 

I decline when they invite me to special events at the school that they are also planning to go to. She always says “ we will be there but we won’t hover. You can spend time with him but I will be there to scoop him up when you are ready to go or if he needs anything.” 

Her husband keeps saying we should grab a beer sometime. 

She recently invited me along with them on a big trip to a very large and famous theme park that would involve a hotel stay. She said I’d have to feed myself and pay for my incidentals but she would cover the hotel room since my son would want to sleep on my room and park admissions and flight. 

Apparently she is making plans for the trip and asked my son if his dad (me) would be interested in maybe going along. He got real excited and she told me she told him I might be busy with school and unable to go but we could ask. 

She again said they wouldn’t hover and we could take turns taking him to things instead of us all doing the parks together. 

She put me in a bad spot. I’d rather we all just go separately but I can’t afford it right now on my own so I told him he and I would go maybe in a few years. 

They would be on the flight. They would be lurking around. I’d have to see them together when I drop him off. It just bothers me. Like it isn’t natural to be close to your exes. I just don’t want to be a part of their family. 

A part of me thinks they want me to go so they can have some alone time together. She was upset last year I wouldn’t watch him during the week so they could take a trip. I couldn’t.

168,Not the A-hole,"Posting from a throwaway. So my dad used not to live with us, he worked in a city a few hours from home and would come visit every fortnight or so. That all changed this year when he was diagnosed with cancer, and he had to move back home to be close to a larger hospital for regular treatments. So here's the situation. Obviously parents haven't slept in the same bed for a while, and basically my mum didn't want to start sharing now so as not to disturb my dad. So, what was originally her bedroom has now become his. We have a spare bed downstairs that for the first month or so she initially used, while I slept in my bedroom. However, what has recently started happening is that she has started sleeping in my bed because she ""can't be bothered to set the bed up"" downstairs. The first few days it was fine, but it's been several weeks like this now and I'm not sure whether I like this long-term. For reference, I'm a female in my 20s. She snores and steals my blankets and, hey, I just want some alone time for peace and quiet by myself. She also wakes up much earlier than me which just gets frustrating in the mornings.
Oftentimes, I have helped her to set up the bed but then she chooses to sleep in my room anyway. One time she asked and I said I'd rather just have my bed to myself that night, and she got so angry she slammed the door on me and didn't speak to me the next morning. I haven't refused since (well, she's never asked since then, just fallen asleep before I got to bed)

I know that this is such a small thing in the scheme of our family issues and my mum's had to carry a big load supporting my father, but this is really starting to bother me.

TLDR: My mum's given her bed to my recovering dad, and no longer sleeps on the spare bed but rather in mine and I want her out; AITA?

Edit: thanks for the responses so far. A few more tidbits of info I forgot: 
1. I'm 21, and Asian. Moving out is absolutely not an option (parents would never let me). I'm a full-time student so I wouldn't be able to afford it anyway! 
2. I pay for about 40% amenities  & food in my family of 4. I didn't pay for the bed (but I don't think the spending aspect matters in the situation consideration)
3. The spare bed's one of those ones that fold up into the wall (I've forgotten the name, is it a Murphy bed?) It doesn't take much time to set it up, you literally just need to pull it down and pull the legs out and then put the blankets/pillows on.",72,267,0.95
169,Not the A-hole,"Throw away because my family knows my reddit account and I don’t want to talk about this again with the wife until I have a game plan.

&#x200B;

So long story short my sister in law is a crazy toxic person. I could put in a litany of crazy things she's done, but frankly it's just not that important to the story and would take forever. She somehow convinced someone to marry her, we'll call him Bob. So they stay married for about 3 years and Bob and I start to hang out, BBQ's, video games, and the occasional beer.

&#x200B;

So of course the marriage falls apart and Toxic sister in law moves away. As the dust settles, one night I'm playing a steam game while wife is out having girls night, and Bob pops up. We start chatting and play some Borderlands for an hour or so. Over the course of a few weeks I start inviting Bob to guy’s night and other stuff. Honestly I just figured the guy was probably depressed or just out of sorts from being divorced.

&#x200B;

I mentioned this to my wife, that I was still hanging out with Bob and she got pretty upset. I wouldn’t say she went ballistic, but she's normally pretty calm and not the type to make a big deal out of small stuff. She said that ""I should be ""on her sisters side"" whatever that means. When I brought up the fact that she herself has told me on multiple occasions that she knows her sister clearly has some emotional problems and the times she has interacted with Bob he seemed like a cool guy. She said that didnt matter and her sisters needs come first. I didnt realize we we're taking care of her sisters needs but whatever.

170,Not the A-hole,"The grocery store near my office has a sandwich counter in the deli section, where I sometimes eat lunch.  The other day, I get into the line for the sandwich counter when I hear a voice saying “excuse me, there’s a line here.”  I turn around and I see a man standing behind me by himself in the bakery section, by a display, a good 4-5 feet away from me.

Now, I get not crowding the person in front.  I usually leave a gap big enough for an average sized person to comfortably walk through.  I think any more than about 2 people’s width is a bit excessive, and 4-5 feet behind me (which would make him about 7 feet behind the person in front of me), in another section of the store, is completely ridiculous.  If you’re that far away, you are not actually in the line any more.  But, whatever, it’s a grocery store sandwich line and not a hill worth dying on, so I step back and wave him forward.  He doesn’t move.

About 20 seconds later, the line moves and I step forward, still leaving enough space for him to step in to.  Then he says; “well?  I was waiting here before you.”  He still hasn’t moved and clearly expects me to move behind him.

At this point, I decide that I’m not going to give up the spot that I still consider rightfully mine  if he’s going to be a dick about it, so I say “yes, there is a line and I’m standing in it.  You’re not.  You were waiting before me but you weren’t waiting in the line.  This isn’t take a number, we’ll call you when it’s your turn, this is a line.  You need to stand directly behind the person in front of you, not some place kinda close by.”  Then I stepped forward to close the gap and not let him in.

He says, “well, I guess not everybody cares about personal space” but steps up so that he’s directly behind me.

So am I the asshole for finding a 7 feet gap between people in a line to be completely absurd and refusing to honor someone’s place in line if they’re that far away?",67,179,0.93
171,Not enough info,"So, some context, I’m in college, 21F, I live less than 5min walk from a large college campus, right on a main street, 5 other housemates (all good friends). We have drunk people on our porch a lot, people think it’s cool to park in our driveway, and we’ve had a bike or two get left next to our own bikes for a couple weeks then disappear. Not a huge deal. One-time issues, if we see the people responsible we talk, they apologize, no biggie. 

Then there’s bike guy. From what I’ve seen from the back of his head across the alley, he seems to be around my age, Asian, pretty scrawny, and has no respect for other people’s property. 3 days in a row now, I’ve come home from class to see his bike chained up next to mine on the back of my house. At first I assumed it was one of my housemates, but come to find out nobody knows where it came from. After about 3pm, it disappears, and then reappears the next morning. I’m pissed, y’all. Accidentally leaving your bike somewhere, in a rush one day, whatever, and then retrieving it later? Fine. Using my house a public bike rack? Not cool. 

So, I duct taped a sign to the bike today, which reads: “Do Not Park Here. This is not your house. Go away. If you park here again, I will cut your lock, and you won’t see your bike ever again.” 

Will update if anything comes of it, but am I overreacting?




*****Update*****

The bike is gone, and the note was folded/crumpled up and left in the middle of my driveway. Will update again if he returns!




*****Update and more info*****

For clarification, the “bike rack” is a railing attached directly to my house. He would have been less than 5ft from my back door to lock his bike there. 

I saw him today riding through the alleyway next to my house heading toward campus. I was going to try to flag him down (to say something along the lines of apologizing for how harsh the note was) and maybe work something out, but my cat tried to follow me out the door and chaos ensued and then he was long gone. 

For those saying I’m the AH for the note: yeah, the note I left was pretty harsh. I agree, I was being petty and should have said something nicer as a first contact. 

For those calling me a racist for using the word Asian: I’m sorry I got nasty with some of you. I stand by my defense that it’s just the way I write and I would have used white if that were the case. However I shouldn’t have reacted as I did. I understand where you all are coming from. I am a *student* in social psychology and have done a decent amount of research with my faculty regarding prejudice and discrimination, so yeah I got touchy and defensive being accused like that. Sorry. I won’t be responding to comments anymore regarding that aspect of my post.  


Lastly, thanks all for your insight. I have come to the conclusion that my frustration/anger here was due to having some control issues I need to work on. If he had asked, I would have been fine with it, which tells me this is more about me having control over the situation than it is about the situation itself.

He’s evidentially on campus for the summer, probably taking classes based on the regularity of his schedule that I’ve seen, so if I see him again and have the chance to strike up a conversation I will update y’all. Until then, ✌️",342,2540,0.96

175,Asshole,"Hi all. 

I have been with my fiancee Alesha for four years and have been engaged for six months. She is Sri Lankan and I am English. She was sent to the UK to study and then work and we met at our company. 

Alesha's parents are what some would describe as ''old money'' in their country. They are extremely well off with wealth going back generations. When both of her siblings got married, they were gifted a large sum of money, their currency's equivalent of around £20,000. Alesha said that amount is also coming her way when we marry. 

I'm conflicted. I've prided myself on earning everything I've got. I worked hard at school, went to university, built myself a career and earn a great salary, as Alesha does too. Obviously I don't want her parents to feel like I don't appreciate their generosity but I've always had a thing (which I recognise) as a problem about not accepting help from anyone. I know it's just a silly ''manly pride'' thing but it's hard to get out of that mentality. 

Alesha feels like her parents will be insulted if I refuse the gift. Should I just grin and take it?",35,40,0.92
176,Not the A-hole,"My fiance has a car in their grandfather's name. It is, as far as anyone is concerned, my fiance's car. That is, until something is wrong with it, in which case it is *suddenly* my fiance's grandpa's car and it needs to be serviced by grandpa's mechanic. Grandpa lives 50 miles away. (Until now this hasn't been an issue.)

My fiance and I each have a car. Without this car, they will have to take my car to work and I'll have to uber/cab. (Fiance works farther away.)

A couple of days ago, the car broke down again. It won't start because of an ignition issue. My neighbor who is a mechanic looked at it, and said it's a less-than-$100 fix.

Grandpa is out of town, so we ask fiance's mom and stepdad--""Hey, can we get this car fixed today? We have a mechanic we trust and we'll pay for the fix.""

They say no. Not only that, but they know I have 100 miles of free towing from AAA and they want me to tow the car 50 miles so it can sit in Grandpa's garage until he gets back from vacation so that, *then*, the mechanic can work on it. That'll be sometime next Wednesday.

I tell them that's not going to work. My fiance won't be able to get to work and might lose their job. I again offer to pay to fix the car myself, which will cost significantly less than the lost pay from my fiance's car.

They again say no, and demand that we tow it back to them.

Most recently, I told them that I will tow it back to them, but they really should compensate us for the uber/cab fare. My uber to and from work would be about $25/day. I figured, if they're going to be unreasonable about the mechanic, then I'll try to meet in the middle.

177,No A-holes here,"Hi guys! So a while back before we got engaged my fiancé and I had a bit of a spat. We don't really go for the jugular anymore because we're not like that, but it resulted in me buying a bonsai tree as a gift. I attached a quote that said ""Even if I knew that tomorrow the world would go to pieces, I would still plant my apple tree.""  The point of the quote was to say that even if I knew tomorrow our relationship would fall apart, I would still love him as hard as I could today. 

Anyway, my boyfriend is not one for gifts and he's not one for sentimentality. I am not at all offended to see that the bonsai tree has not left the box in his kitchen. He read the quote and got the message. 

HOWEVER I am starting a new job and can't stop thinking about how cute the bonsai would look in my new office. I would actually care for it too, and I suppose it was silly of me to assume that he'd care for it when he barely remembers to drink enough water each day (god I love him).

178,Not the A-hole,"I've been with my girlfriend for nearly two years. I'm 48, she's 49, and she has a 19 year old daughter. I began living with them all pretty early on, only six months in.

I learned relatively quickly it's a rough household. My girlfriend is exceedingly controlling of her daughter. Not allowed out, not allowed to have a job, not allowed a cellphone. She doesn't protest because she can't go anywhere else. It's either live by mommy's rules or be homeless to be frank. There's no abuse other than mental/emotional, just so I'm clear. She's all peachy keen when my son (17) comes over, it's like she's a different person. She's a good ""stepmom"" to my son but an abysmal mother to her own.

I kind of took a passive approach to this. I didn't interfere because she's not my child. She wasn't too friendly with me early on but she's grown to like me enough to open up about these things. At this point two years in, we're very close. She even calls me ""dad"" which struck me as odd but she never had any father in her life, at least not this long.

I think the turning point for me was when we decided to bring a puppy into the home. I grew up with lapdogs who roamed free throughout the house, but she decided this dog would stay in a cage for 18-20 hours a day and only let out to eat and mess outside. Despite my protests and attempts to let her roam free, my girlfriend eventually put a key lock on her cage. We became very distant after this.

The daughter proposed to me that we all leave this relationship. She's an adult and wants to make this decision to flee her mother. She wanted my help because she can't otherwise. I was going to leave my girlfriend anyways over the treatment of the dog. I can afford a good 3bdr apartment, easy, so a +1 I think could be a good idea. This could also be her only way of escape. My plan was to have an apartment with my son and dog, but the addition of stepdaughter wouldn't hurt.

182,Not the A-hole,"**Tl;dr**: I removed a single child's shirt from a washing machine and proceeded to put my own stuff in it when the owner of the shirt showed up with additional laundry and wanted me to remove my stuff so she could put more of their stuff in, and I refused. 

**Background**: 
I am working an internship out of town this summer and my friends offered to let me sleep on their pull-out couch for free (so I can then pocket the measly housing stipend I was given from my internship). There is a community laundry room on their floor with 2 sets of washers and dryers.

**The incident**: 
It was 8:30 PM on a Sunday and I didn't have clean underwear for the next day. I walked into the laundry room and saw both washers were running, and when I walked back to the apartment I remembered my friends mentioning they were doing laundry (I didnt know if they had both washers or just one). After the time was up, I reminded him to go switch it, and then I walked over like 2 minutes later so I could put some in. 

I walked in and there was no one there but there was a laundry basket sitting next to the washers and one of them had stuff in it. I went to the one that looked empty (the lid was up) and saw a single child's shirt at the bottom. I figured it got left behind when someone switched the machine and took it out and placed it on the table next to it. I then threw some laundry pods in the machine and started putting some clothes in when this woman walks in (for context, she seemed like a nice lady and it seemed like English was her second language) She was the owner of the laundry basket and started apologizing for taking up the machines.

It was then that both of our eyes went to the machine I was putting stuff into. It was super awkward and she started asserting that ""didnt she have clothes in there?"" And that she had just ran back to her apartment to grab some more clothes to fill up the machine. I super uncomfortablely explained how and why I had removed the child's shirt. 

At this point, it was awkward, but she was treating it as some silly misunderstanding and clearly expected me to remove my stuff from the machine and let her have it. I was shocked that she expected me to remove my stuff and figured we could both just use one. She seemed shocked that I didn't offer to remove my stuff. 

After like 30 seconds she seemed annoyed and she just said ""its fine"", took her laundry and went back to the apartment.  Turns out she is my friends next-door neighbor. Shit.

I feel bad about it for a few reasons. AITA?

Edit: Just to include relevant info/points mentioned in comments: 1. The shirt was dry. I was running on autopilot and didn't realize until afterwards that it was impossible for the shirt to have been dry and left behind like I initially thought since the machines had just ran a cycle. 2. I do not pay rent here, she (presumably) does.

Edit2: Just to add, not that I think it makes a difference, but the machines are not free. We pay per load.",129,384,0.95
183,Not the A-hole,"So i have a 2 month old daughter. My friends asked me and my partner to go out clubbing tomorrow for one of my friends 21st birthday. The town were going to is a 40 minute drive from where i live so instead of paying for a taxi we split an airbnb and decided to stay the night there and come back in the morning. Before agreeing to go or paying for the airbnb i made certain i had a babysitter for the night, the people taking care of her are my very capable and excited aunt and uncle who is also going to be my daughters godparents. This is the first time i will be away from her over night. The longest I’ve let her out for is 4 hours. 

Now, the problem is my in laws. My partners parents think Im wrong for only waiting 2 months before leaving my daughter for the night and they also had ago at me for not asking them to have her. They also said because my daughter wakes up through the night for a bottle im ‘selfish’ for expecting other people to deal with that. I explained that i did actually think of them but as it’ll be Friday going into Saturday and i know my partners dad works Saturdays and as they said themselves, she wakes up through the night, i asked my aunty and uncle to have her. They weren’t happy about this and still believe im being selfish for A) not asking them, B) going out after 2 months and C) ‘expecting’ someone else to deal with my baby. After i went home my partners mum text me to ask of they can have her next weekend, i said no because im not letting her out 2 weekends in a row plus ill be home so theres no need but the next time i do go out they’ll be the first people i ask. She asked when that will be and i said i dont know. She didnt reply and hasnt spoken to me in over a week, she usually texts every day to ask how baby is doing. 

I did explain to my aunty and uncle how she wakes up through the night and sometimes doesn’t go back to sleep for a few hours so obviously if they dont want to deal with that i wont go out, they told me not to be silly and to go and enjoy myself for once. They’ve also been texting me how excited they are and thanking me for trusting them with my little treasure. If needed i will be going home to look after her myself. 

I obviously felt a bit guilty about agreeing to leave my daughter for the night but i am really looking forward to be able to just let my hair down with my friends for the night. Im debating on just not going because of what my in laws said.",225,637,0.92
184,Everyone Sucks,"TLDR My husband didn’t wish me a happy Mother’s Day or birthday.  Should his day be overlooked as well?

For context:  on both Mother’s Day and my birthday, my husband was very aware of the events (we were going to brunch with his family on Mother’s Day; my 7 years old wished me a happy birthday in front of him).  I didn’t expect an extravagant gift and in the past it has varied between homemade to something bigger for both of us.  I didn’t get a card, gift, or verbal acknowledgement from him this year.  To be clear, the thing that hurts me is that he never said anything/recognized me on either days.  

I did say something to him after the fact that he didn’t wish a happy birthday or Mother’s Day to me and he replied that he was sick on my birthday (he had a cold) and was angry with me on Mother’s Day.  I was running late trying to get my oldest and the baby ready to go.  In my defense I started two hours before the agreed upon Mother’s Day brunch time but since it was our first time going out with the newborn baby, I just couldn’t get it together in time so told them to go without me because I didn’t want my daughter to miss out on seeing her grandma.  They did go without me btw.  

He did eventually get me a small birthday present, which he left on the kitchen counter but it was one of those “too little, too late” situations and I still feel hurt.  

So WIBTA if we “forgot” Father’s Day this year?  

I’m conflicted and honestly confused.  As I’ve said, I’m still.. hurt by what happened and have no desire to recognize him on Father’s Day.  At the same time, this isn’t for me; it’s for my daughter and I don’t want my feelings to impact her day with dad.  She did make him a homemade Father’s Day card for the day though so he will get something..  

Also when I take a step back to see what this would achieve, I don’t think it’d be productive..  but I’m still angry and I don’t think he should have a day this year.

Even if its just me and other friend arguing about if you should bake mac & Cheese  she'll tell us to stop fighting and start getting sensitive even though it was clearly just a joke.

I just didn't say anything and tried to just eat my lunch and ignore her but she kept going about how if she fails it'll ruin her life  and it just got to me and I just snapped at her telling her to get a grip on herself and her fear of failure and that everyone else is going through shit themselves and not everything is about her. I stood up and left and a few of my friends said i shouldn't have confronted her like that and i was an asshole but i didnt know how else i was meant to say anything because everytime i have a serious conversation about her emotional dependance on me with her she says she doesn't have anyone else and its always just a onesided conversation and i feel really terrible and just let it go midway. 

I talked to my mum( a nurse) about her multiple times and she suggested talking about therapy with her but every time i mention it she shoots it down and Im so tired of dealing with all of this emotional draining things especially when she's said some really insensitive things about me and my situation with my dad.

So am I the Asshole? I know i probably should have handled it better but idk what else i was meant to do :/


Update- I just want to make it very clear that her abuser is not in her life anymore, her dad is very controlling and strict but he has not abused her. Her mum and Dad don't care about her grades and her Dad doesn't bother going to her Parents meetings. I realise i never should've let it go this far my family is going on holiday for the whole Summer so im just going to put my phone away and enjoy it. Im planning on sitting down with both my parents and telling them everything thats going on and they can deal with it. Im been kinda avoiding her and I'm probably going to still do that till I've come back from holiday in a month I still want to keep being friends with her but for now Im giving her space and setting new boundaries when i come back. Thank you to everyone for letting me see this from a new perspective,I've realised this goes a whole lot deeper than me and my outbursts.",176,1188,0.95
187,Not the A-hole,"So my father said “peace out” when he found out my mother was pregnant with me. So much that so that he actually left the country to get as far away from responsibility as possible. My mom raised me and while she has some major issues and we don’t see eye to eye most days, she’s the only parent I know. 

My father didn’t bother reaching out to me till I was 13, when we communicated via texts and phone calls for all of 2-3 months before he ghosted me. He disappeared yet again from my life and didn’t show up again until I was 18. (No, he has never paid an ounce of child support.) I became independent very quickly and learned that the only person I could rely on to take care of me was ME. I’m now 26. 

The relationship my dad & I built is superficial at best- the guy doesn’t even remember my birthday every year and never calls me. He did have 2 more small children with his current wife & I can’t deny that he is a good father to them. And while a small part of me resents that he never tried to do that for me, I really love his kids and that keeps me around. Anyway- I was suckered into flying in (they live in another state) for this weekend under the pretense that I would be attending an event with my little sister. I had NO idea this was Father’s Day weekend until my step-mom mentioned it a few days ago, along with the little piece of information that we’re going to a brunch to celebrate my dad. 

Here’s the thing: my fathers a boastful man and only remembers he had me when someone sees how accomplished or attractive I am. That’s when he’s all “oh yeah (pounds chest*), I do make some pretty amazing kids, huh?” No- he didn’t. He’s got nothing to do with the woman I am today and he deserves zero credit for it. Because I know how much he likes to show off in front of people, I personally just don’t feel like actively participating in Father’s Day brunch. Sure, I’ll show up because my bf & I are in town and staying in their home- but I will NOT smile for a picture just so he can upload it to FB and have his friends comment what a stellar kid he’s got. I fucking refuse. I’ve NEVER celebrated Father’s Day & I’m not about to start now. Yes, I know it’s petty but I feel strongly about it. AITA here?

Edit: a couple of people in my personal life told me I should try to be agreeable and avoid a scene/making anyone feel bad, and that I should think about how the little kids will perceive my aversion to taking the pictures- hence why I’m asking here.

UPDATE: I wanted to post an update- I spoke to my stepmom and explained how I felt about the situation and that I could not force myself to fake something I didn’t feel. I told her he wasn’t a father to me and if I had no celebrated this holiday in my 26 years of existence I wasn’t about to start now. She actually saw my perspective and understood and told me I didn’t have to come along on Sunday. Thank you everyone for your advice!",63,229,0.94

189,Asshole,"She’s in her late 50s and she most of the time with these “friends” of hers and has skipped out on picking me up (I’m 17 and don’t have a car) from places a few times now. I just don’t understand why someone her age should be playing a game designed for kids. On a side note, her playing has ruined the game entirely for me because, trust me, when you engage in a raid battle with YOUR MOM of all people, you realize how much this game is NOT for middle-aged people. Now, from time to time, she complains about there not being any shiny Pokémon in the wild, which I take offense to because as an avid player of the original games, I know how hard it is to get a shiny Pokémon; however, Go players get all these stupid community events where everyone can get a shiny Pokémon, eliminating the challenge the original games had where you never really knew if a Pokémon you encountered was shiny until you knew. Anyways, AITA? Please let me know, I’m just trying to help my mom put away this child’s game.",120,31,0.61
190,Not the A-hole,"EDIT: I no longer live there or with this friend, I don't need to buy locks anymore people. Thanks for your concern though!

About eight years ago I was sharing a house with 3 other friends whom I knew prior to moving in. All 3 of my house mates B, D and S worked in a bar together whilst I worked in a retail store.

B didn't really see the value in spending money on trivial things like food, his money predominantly went on the essentials; clothing, alcohol and paying into clubs. Because of this I'd often wake up to find my eggs eaten or get home to find out that I didn't have that chicken I thought I'd eat for dinner. When pressed on this B would generally admit to having to steal the food but his replacements were *always* cheaper versions of what he had taken.

On top of food going missing so did my grooming products. The 3 of them would often work 'the keg shift' which meant getting up super early in the morning and every time this happened I'd wake up to B in my room and spraying like 8 sprays of my aftershave, using my deodorant and using my hair gel. I was usually half asleep so that I wouldn't really protest then and there but these were the only times that I was in my bedroom to see him. I never used much hair gel, at all. But I'd often see massive two finger scoops taken out and he liked his hair GELLED.

I had told B that it annoyed me and to stop doing it but it just never seemed to get through for long. We had an argument about it and I told him not to touch my stuff because I never touch his and he agreed not to anymore but I didn't exactly believe him.

I was still pretty annoyed from the argument a few days later and again some food had gone missing and so a night before a keg shift I placed a squirt of Nair in the gel.

The next morning I woke up to B who had crept into room and was using my aftershave and then proceeding to gel his hair with my new product. He left and after I heard him go down stairs I shouted down to him explaining his new reality to him and that he better was his hair quick if he wanted to keep his usual style. This resulted in him absolutely bounding up the stairs and running his head under the shower whilst shouting obscenities at me as small tufts of hair were coming out in his hands. I think the bottle said like keep it on for 4-5 minutes and this was 2 at most so it didn't exactly decimate his hair but it did get thinned out a bit and he couldn't really stick it up the same way as the nairgel had kinda cut some of the hairs in half. He basically had to go get it cut really short to make himself look like a normal person again.

Making someone's hair full out does seem like a bit of an assholey thing to do. But my argument has always been that A. I told him not to use my stuff, B. It was my stuff to Nair.

Him and most of our mutual friends are sure that I was in the wrong here as sharing products is what people do. It'd be good to get perspective.",454,1339,0.95

193,Not the A-hole,"I work at a small architect office with a dozen employees, one boss and his wife who does some administrative paperwork. Most valuable coworker: Mr. Coffee Machine. Yesterday, the boss' wife threw a tantrum because yet again someone had emptied the last drop of coffee without putting on a new pot. Boss called everyone together for an office-wide emergency meeting. Under threat of future caffeine deprivation (boss pays for coffee supplies) we all had to nod our collective heads in shame and promise to never ever treat Mr. Coffee Machine with such disrespect.

Personally, I thought the whole debate blew up hilariously, and I found it hard to not burst out in laughter but remain serious during this telling-off. Judging by the suppressed collective face-palming of my collegues I wasn't the only one. It happens to all of us all the time: You want to grab a cup of coffee, but the pot is empty. No big deal, make a new one, come back 2 minutes later and enjoy your steaming hot coffee. Murphys Law dictates that I usually get a phone call or some other distraction and forget I just made a new coffee, only to find the pot empty 5 minutes later. Such is life, mildly infuriating. In fact, the [first webcam ever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_Room_coffee_pot) was invented as a solution to exactly that problem, maybe I should set one up as well. Anyways: I thought it would be a helpful for everyone to put up a reminder in regard to the coffee, so I printed out a sign of Uncle Sam (you know, the famous Uncle Sam 'I want you' WW II draft sign) and dubbed it ""I want you - to make new coffee"" and put it up in the kitchenette.

Now one of my collegues approached me and said the sign was rather provocative and insulting towards our bosses wife - which I genuinely did not intend it to be. AITA here?",21,62,0.93
194,Not the A-hole,"I was raised in a religious household and have always been very innocent up until last year, when I became very close best friends with this guy and we exchanged sexual texts and I explored my sexual side. He was super sweet with me in the beginning of our friendship. I admit I developed some romantic feelings for him as time went on but knew it would never work out between us due to us wanting different things.

Later on in our friendship, there were times where he would call me a hoe or a slut as a joke and I would be very uncomfortable due to my nonexistent sexual history and since he was the only guy I had been like that with. I would have a sexual moment with him and then he would call me a hoe soon thereafter and I’d have all these feelings of doubt and insecurity. I’ve expressed how I was feeling with him many times and he’d get upset and say I was overreacting and I’m super insecure. My confidence was at an all time low. 

I had a fall out with him because of this earlier this year. I got a boyfriend during that time and he was always very respectful and sweet with me. It was so different with how we interacted compared to my friend. Everything was going good in my life and I felt like I should reconnect with my friend since I felt guilty about how things had ended. He was very weird about my boyfriend when he found out, immediately asking when I’d have sex with my boyfriend and calling me a hoe as a joke whenever I’d mention him. It was very awkward at first but then we started making jokes again and being friendly. My relationship with my boyfriend got complicated since he moved back home for the summer so we ended up breaking up.

So earlier this week, one thing led to another and my friend and I slipped back into flirting and ended up exchanging nudes, which was a very big step for me. So today he asked me how I liked my eggs. I replied over easy and he responded with “yep that’s you.” I was offended and told him that he had hurt my feelings to which he said “sorry didn’t mean to.”

I explain that I was hurt because I had just trusted him with my nudes and he’s making a joke about how I’m over easy. He goes on to say I’m insecure, I’m dramatic, I always do this, I need to stop taking everything so personally, and I need to get over myself. I ask him why he’s getting mad and he says he’s mad that I’m overreacting and he’s sick of it and leaves the conversation. 

I feel so confused at this point and just want to know if I’m the asshole and overreacting about a goddamn egg joke. 

TLDR: I got offended by an egg joke implying that I’m over easy by someone I shared nudes with and now I feel like a joke. AITA?",75,192,0.91
195,Not the A-hole,"Recently my wife has been having quite a few issues with mood swings and what I call overbearing behavior with our two children (3m & 1.5m). She will wake up or come home from work and be her normal self. Laughing, talking and playing with the kids but the tiniest thing will send her into a tailspin and she'll begin snapping at all three of us. She claims this is post-partum rage.

Recently it's gotten worse because her parents had to move in with us when her father got laid off. They're doing what they can to move out but haven't been very succesful. I think it's been great having them around because they are both very helpful around the house and are willing to babysit. 

However my wife hasn't been able to ""self-medicate"" with weed because her father disapproves. It came to ahead last night when I made mention my sister dropped by our oldest's school for a quick visit. Our son adores his aunt and had a blast ""touring"" her through his pre-k class. 

My wife thinks this was WAY over the line and has caused my family to believe they've done something wrong (my mom suggested my sister visit him). I don't think they have. So this caused a fight between us and I suggested my wife get professional help even suggesting we go together. This sent her into a fury because she believed I was siding with my family over her (I haven't said anything to my family).

Her mother is actually on my side and said to me that she is acting like she was when my wife was a child living with her and believes like me, that she needs therapy.

She bought two jackets to take home for my opinion and she did clarify with the cashier whether the jackets are returnable and they said yes.

197,Asshole,"Short background. Me and my GF come from the same country, but met each other in a different country where we currently study and work. We've been living together for the past 5 years and of Course my parents and her mother(father not in picture anymore) come to visit us once in a while. Usualy when they come to visit both our parents come at the same time and stay in our Apartment. Every time they come there is a lot of stress from everybody wanting different Things and just being very different characters.

So last month they came again to visit us. But this time I couldn't take time off from work so my gf was stuck alone with all of them. Five days go by and when I arrive home from work my gf takes me aside and tells me my mother started moving Things around the house telling my gf,  who told her to stop that, that ""when I'm here Things are going to be put where I want'. Also telling my gf that ""I'm cleaning your home because it doesn't look clean at all"", after we cleaned the whole Apartment before they came to visit. So I took that as usual stuff, nothing out of the ordinary, because I was used with our parents just doing what they like and just waited for them to go home and our life to resume as normal. Fast Forward two days and there is a huge fight between my parents and me my GF and her Mother. My parents started the fight, and it was just about us not respecting them and letting them do what they want. The fight ended with my gf and her mother packing their stuff and going to sleep somewhere else for the rest of the visit to get away from my parents.

After they're all gone we go home and my GF sits me down and tells me that she is very dissapointed in me that I didn' say anything to my mother when she told me after those 5 days how she talked to her. And she told me that she doesn't think our relationship can go on much longer because she doesn't want to seem my parents anylonger and even if she forgave them, they will never Change and there were always going to be fights when they visit. I told her that I didn't know I was supposed to tell my mother those Things, because I thought she was also used to my mothers behaviour and was also just waiting so they go back to their homes. We didn't break up on the spot after this conversation, we just said we will see what will happen in the future for the Moment.

Fast Forward two day ago. Was doing some Research at uni and we met at lunch to eat at home because she works very Close to our home. I ask her how's work and she says ""stressfull"", but immediatly continues ""but not as stressfull as remembering you didn't tell your mother all those Things I told you"". And she closed with ""I don't want to be together with someone who doesn't know what he wants from life, a pu\*\*y"". Yeah that hurt.

199,Not the A-hole,"I moved from Georgia to the Pacific Northwest last year for a dream job after I graduated college. It was a little bit of a culture shock, because I went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. There hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. For example, every white woman I meet mentions Beyonce to me within the first five minutes. When I was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'So... Beyonce.'

So the problem in the post title is that I am the only black woman at my office, and I am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and I'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. My name is Tina, short for Christina. Pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. For some reason, a handful of people at work call me Tiana, Tiara, or Tia, I think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. I am most often called Tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which I think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. The other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position I'm in) used to work there and I get called her name (Mary) sometimes too. Sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, ""How do you pronounce that?"" It's Tina!

I have tried politely correcting this and I correct it immediately every time. From polite, ""Just for the record, my name is Tina!"" to lighthearted, ""Tina, like Tina Belcher!"" In e-mails from me that say Tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, I still get, ""Thanks Tiana!"" Sooo... I'm considering doing the Twitter approach, where I just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. Like:

Chuck: Thanks, Tiana

Tina: No problem, Chad!

Jessica: Hi Tiara!

Tina: Good morning, Jennifer!

Would I be the asshole if I did this? I know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and I feel really disrespected by this, so I may as well have some fun with it.

EDIT: I am pretty overwhelmed by the responses so I just want to add a couple of things:

A lot of people have suggested that I gently and firmly remind people of my name. That's what I've been doing, and was my first line of defense!

A lot of people have suggested I go to HR. This is the kind of nebulous thing HR doesn't really help with, and it isn't as serious as it could be.

A lot of people who identify themselves as white have informed me that this isn't race-related. It is. I have been black for 25 years, and I have a lot of firsthand experience with racism, and I can identify it in my own life. It isn't overt racism, like a slur or an assault, but it is still race-related. I feel like a few people are ALMOST getting it. A lot of people are referencing that Key and Peele sketch with the substitute teacher, which is literally a joke about how white people do this to black people, turned on its head!

And finally, a few people have asked why I don't use Tina Turner as an example, since she's also a black Tina. First, I thought young-ish white people would be more familiar with Tina Belcher, but I used 'Tina Turner' as an example for our Dean and he then 'affectionately' nicknamed me Tina Turner, which took deprogramming from his EA to get over.

EDIT #2:

No, I don't have a southern accent. I'm from Atlanta, and black people from Atlanta don't really have an indecipherable country twang. Plus, my 'working in an office' voice is pretty practiced/neutral. More to the point, no accent makes the name 'Tina' sound like 'Tiana' or ""Tiara""

No, the people I work with aren't just 'idiots.' As annoying as this is, they are not stupid people.

No, I can't wear a 'Hi, my name is' sticker or a nametag. We have a business professional dress code!

Yes, I correct them every time.

No, it's not because I'm not 'memorable' or a bad employee!

Responding to this post saying, 'Okay Shaniqua' or some other racist caricature of a name truly misses the point, as this is already what my coworkers are doing ('Tiana' being the 'Shaniqua' in this instance). Several people have alarmingly said, 'Okay, Trayvon' and invoking the name of a dead black child at the idea of me calling a white guy 'Chad' is VERY WEIRD!",5529,30181,0.84

201,Everyone Sucks,"When I (M29) take my dog out for a walk, sometimes I see people. Sometimes I interact with them, especially other dog owners. This kind of interaction has perhaps lowered my inhibitions towards talking to strangers. 
So now, when I see things I disagree with, I speak my mind. 

I will share a few instances; 
* A couple in their late 20's early 30's were standing outside with a baby in a carriage. The man was smoking, and the wind very clearly blowing the smoke over the baby and towards the woman, myself and my dog. 
I turn to them, as I pass them, say in a light tone of voice ""there's nothing I enjoy quite as much as passive smoking"". The lady turns and looks me in the eyes, with a bit of shock and unease but also with a smile. And that's the end of the interaction, I can only hope she thinks of the baby and moves out of the smoke.. 

* I witnessed a lady in her 40's or 50's driving a service car (catering, cleaning company). She was trying to parallel park. The thing is, she had enough room for two full cars, and she was trying to park it level in the middle. So after she tried and failed 3 times, she got out and gauged the range she had, and tried two more times. 
At this point I told her, look, you have a full meter ahead of you, come closer to this other car and there will be enough room for another car behind you. I stood next to the spot where it would be safe for her to drive forward to, pointing and telling her to come closer. 
She got out of the car, angry at me, using weird justifications like ""make room for what car?? I don't see any other car?"".
I tried to explain, but she was foreign (language barrier), and possibly playing stupid or didn't want to understand. We went back and forth a little, keeping it civil, but she kept asking for the other car I was talking about. In the end I got frustrated, and instead of escalating I walked away. She ended up parking in the middle, taking up two spots. 

* A woman with a baby was inside her car on the side of the road. She was rummaging through her car, and spent good time doing it. What bothered me was how she left her baby carriage with her baby in it behind the car. Directly in the vehicles exhaust, and yes the vehicle was on. 
I asked her ""are you sure you want to leave your kid directly in the exhaust like that, you do know it's toxic right?"" 
Her response was ""there is nothing wrong with it, it's not toxic""

So, AITA for talking to adults like that? 
Should I have done more? 
Should I have minded my own business and ignored it? 
What if they were kids, and did something less offensive? At what point is it socially acceptable to jump in and parent some strange kids or adults for that matter? 

Side note: I live in a country where people usually don't talk or acknowledge each other. We are perceived as a cold people from outsiders. Talking to strangers is something you need an excuse for, like being drunk or walking your dogs.",49,26,0.85
202,Not the A-hole,"This is a throw away for self explanatory reason. We moved into new neighborhood .My wife became BFFs with one of the neighbors. That women has a son and he clearly has some   mental problems .He barely can muster more then few words has anger issues and just screams for no reasons. He is about 5 years old. He was held back a year in kindergarten and kicked out from another due to behavior issues and inability to learn anything. We had a get together recently .The kid started breaking my daughters toys ripping books apart and other stuff. I went towards my wife and told that she should tell her friend to get her kid under  control. Next thing I know he took one of those children chairs and started charging towards the tv. I managed  to intercept before he could damage it. Later I found out before he wrecked 3 tv's this way. Once the party was over told my wife that kid is no longer welcome at my home. My daughter has even complained that he is very aggressive sometimes towards her and other people. My wife was a bit more on forgiving side, he is young, he needs some positivity .Yes, he has problems and so on. After the party my wife told be her friend broke down and started crying. I feel like shit but I know her refusal to do anything about the kid getting him diagnosed and medicated is one of the bigger problems here.So am in the wrong here ?

EDIT:Her situation is very dire apparently. Now I feel even more like an asshole.

204,Not the A-hole,"In every single one of my friendships I have to be the one to initiate conversations and plan outings. Honestly I'm sick of it. It makes me feel uncared for because I have to do everything. For the past week I had plans with two friends to go see a movie today, we discussed the movie time and rides. 7 o'clock was the agreed upon time and they agreed to pick me up. Today however at 3:30 I texted the one who offered me a ride and asked what time she was going to arrive at my place. She didn't respond. I waited anout 10 minutes and then I called her, and it went straight to voicemail.

At 6:55 I decided they probably forget and tought they were supposed to meet me there. So I rush to the theater and purchase my ticket. I quickly look at the snack nd ticket queus to see neither of them. So I head to my movie and, while the lights are still on I look for them and once again I don't see either of them. I again text the one who was supposed to be my ride but to no avail. The movie starts so I turn off my phone and try to just enjoy the movie.

After the movie is finished I turn my phone back on to see no notifications. As of now it's been 6 hours and the only text I got was from one of them about an unrelated questions I had asked the day before. And honestly it's pretty tough. There were no excuses, warnings, or even apologies. For one thing it hurts but for another it got me thinking. No matter who it is I always have to start the conversation or plan things. Hell I have one friend who, when he doesn't flake out, always says that he never responds because I don't say anything that requires a response (even thought I ask him questions.) Quite frankly this is ridiculous.

So I plan on deleting all of my conversations, but not unfriending or blocking. This way all that happens is that I don't see the conversation and thus won't feel the need to try to initiate. But if someone texts me first and initiates I'll keep talking to them and initiate and not delete that conversation again. But for everyone who doesn't respond I won't try. 

On the one hand this feels like I'm trying to test my friends. But on the other hand it's not like I'm going to end my friendship but rather just not initiate. It doesn't seem like a punishment if no one tries anyways. Of course I'm not doing this with family or contacts that are work related it's strictly going to be friends.

205,Not the A-hole,"My dad was emotionally abusive to me growing up- intolerant of mistakes and intolerant of anyone else's opinion, and vocal about it. From teenage years on we clashed over politics too.
He and my mom divorced my senior year of high school, which partially led to mental health issues in college. I tried to have a good relationship with him after the divorce, with mixed results. Four years ago, there was an incident with me, him, and his new wife (who dislikes me) and I haven't seen or spoken to him (other than texts) since.
The past year or so, he has been trying to get me to see him. I gave him one condition: it has to be with my therapist and I need several months' notice to make the appointment. He keeps giving me a week or less notice, and I tell him no.
I just found out he's in town and wants to see me, and my mom is trying to push me into doing it. Everyone tells me I will regret not having my dad in my life, and he has provided for me (financially) a great deal. But if I do this alone, I know he will walk all over me because he's done it before.

206,Not the A-hole,"So for context, they have been in a long distance relationship because they go to different colleges for 3 years.  I do not care too much for him.  I honestly suspect she has cheated on him in the past.  From what she has said to me, I believe he could have cheated on her as well.

&#x200B;

My best friend and I studied abroad for 4 months, and in that time she had sex with 3 different guys and hooked up with many others.  The only reason I feel obligated to tell him is because she would constantly lie to me and say that they were ""on a break"" when I could see their texts.  I did not read them on purpose, but we were living in the same room, and I would see her phone and her laptop (which would have texts show up on as well).  By in his texts it was clear that he had a fear, he did specifically say ""please do not f\*ck other guys"" which is obvious to me but that's what they said.  He sent her money and flowers on Valentines Day, and she used that money to buy a dress and go on a date with another guy.  In multiple relationships with these men she met abroad, she told them she planned to have their kids, move in with them, and other various things that would have serious long term implications.  To be clear, she told me just about all of this all while claiming this guy back home was her boyfriend.

&#x200B;

To me it is pretty clear that they have an unhealthy relationship, but I don't know if I WBTA if I butted in their relationship to let him know what is going on/went on.  She is my best friend and I do not want to destroy that, and I don't know if it will/ if it's worth it.  This kid really loves her and it would break his heart but I feel guilty knowing this information, and letting the relationship continue without him knowing.

&#x200B;

She would say they were on a break yet they would still text and facetime every single day, and he would tell her how much her loved her, and she would say the same, yet she would do these things and go out and hook up with guys anyway.

207,Asshole,"This scenario is being posed from the cheater’s perspective.

I’m trying to understand if I’m really the asshole here, because that’s how he made me feel and I respect myself more than to be guilt tripped.

It happened after my ex and I had a falling out because there were three instances of infidelity on my part and he found out.

I apologized profusely and then confided in him that I have a sexual addiction and offered to go to therapy. He made me move out of his place back to my apartment but was still supporting me as a friend, and it was really hard on me. 

One day he came over because I was in bad shape and when I mentioned I’d been talking to one of the guys I was unfaithful with about what happened, he got up and walked out without saying a word.

Later he texted me that he needed time away from me and that I was a “not a good person” and “not a good friend” and was “throwing a pity party” for myself and he wouldn’t be part of it.

A month and a half later he emailed me and forgave me because he found out I’d been talking to his mother to cope. He wanted to know how I was doing and offered talk in person and let it all go.

I wasn’t willing to forgive the things he said to me when he needed space and told him as much in an email reply, then stopped contact for the past 8 months or so.

Am I really the asshole for not wanting to be talked to like that?

209,Not the A-hole,"Me (21M) and my girlfriend (21F) have dated for around 8 months.

&#x200B;

I used to be really fit before I met my girlfriend until a knee injury put me off from lifting seriously for many months. As time went on, I just kind of lost motivation and stopped going to the gym as much and started to focus on other things. Pretty soon, I started dating my girlfriend and things have been going great for the most part. I've shown my girlfriend pictures of myself back then and she really liked them and would sometimes jokingly ask me to please head back to the gym, which I'm fine with because they're just jokes.

&#x200B;

Well, today my girlfriend and I were talking and got onto the topic of working out. As the conversation progressed, she started joking about me going back to the gym and eventually ended up lecturing me briefly on why working out is good for health. The thing is, I'm not completely sedentary. I play basketball and golf and dabble in competitive ballroom dancing. The reason I don't go back to lifting and dieting is because it's simply not as fun as the things I'm in now and it was torture bulking and cutting and I've told her this. Compared to my old self, I only lost a couple kilos and some definition on my stomach so I'm by no means fat just lost some muscle. She knows that I participate in these activities and still ended up lecturing me. I found myself getting more and more irritated because I thought it was all jokes until I got her lecture. I then asked, ""are you saying this because you're afraid of me getting fat in the future""? She got upset and said how I could say that about her and that she's not that type of girl who judges people by their looks. I then apologized to her for asking that question.

212,Not the A-hole,"I don't use Reddit much and my friend I talked to referred me here so I'll keep this brief.

My daughter is 23 and I am 41, I am her father. Yes I had her young with my wife but that's not the point. My wife and I now live in a decent place and live on our own with our own stable jobs.

Recently(in the last couple of years) my daughter has been acting, for lack of a better term, completely shitty towards men that she dates. She will date a guy for a few weeks, wait til he can provide something major for her and then just break up with them. I'm all for her exploring herself and dating around and bringing guys over; honestly I could not care less.

One night about last week I was sitting with my wife on the couch at about midnight and we assumed our daughter had gone to bed at this point because she had 2 exams the next day. In confidence I voiced my concerns to my wife about my daughter's attitude towards the guys she dates and I wasn't very nice about it. I never called her names or anything but I said her behavior was deplorable and shitty and that I feel bad for any guy that wants to date her right now because of the things she does. My wife agreed with what I was saying and we left it at that but I guess my daughter was awake and heard what I said and now she won't talk to me. My wife is now backpedaling and saying I was an asshole for voicing these concerns because she's ""exploring her life"", which would be fair I suppose but it's the things she does that honestly set me off. I have a few examples.

1. She dated a guy for 3 weeks until she convinced him to co-sign a car for her then promptly dumped him within the week
2. She was having trouble with her computer so she ""dated a guy who knows that shit"" and then dumped him right after
3. She had a fight with us about something unrelated one night so she needed a place to stay. She proceeded to find some guy friend she knew and stayed at his place for about three weeks while claiming she wanted something serious with him and then dumped him when we hashed out our stuff and told her she could come home

This is only from the last 8 months.

I will agree the guys she dates are suckers for falling for that shit but she seeks these men out and takes advantage of their kindness in order to fuck them over and I'm just flabbergasted that the daughter I raised turned out to be such a horrible human being. My daughter hasn't talked to me in a week and is planning her next ""getaway"" I assume at this point but now that my wife and daughter had a talk my wife is starting to take her side in this.

I'm not saying she's skanky or *anything* like that, I just want her to be a decent human being and not mess with people's emotions like this. Am I the asshole for voicing my concerns to my wife and having my daughter accidentally overhear?

213,No A-holes here,"So, because I'm a minor, and my parents haven't gone grocery shopping yet, the most I can make out of an empty pantry and fridge is plain pasta.  That lasts me about two days. My dad doesn't really cook, and my mum gets home too late most nights to make a family dinner, so everyone kind of just eats what's around. It's Wednesday night, I've eaten pasta for two days, and I fell like literal shit because I have had nothing of nutritional value. So I call my mum. Since it's Wednesday, the grocery store near my mum's work has a 50% off deal on sushi, and it's pretty good, I ask if she can get some for me, she says yes and that she'll be home in two hours. I get pretty excited because, you know, food, and two hours later she comes home with a leftover's box. Inside is seafood fettuccine alfredo. AKA more pasta. She says that she thought I might like this better, because she know I like fettuccine alfredo, and she had some leftover from her lunch. I though, ok, no big deal, I'll just eat the seafood part, but there is no seafood part, it's all gone, now it's just pasta. I thank her and just put it in the fridge before trying to get back to my room.

She asks why I'm not eating it.

I told her that, since it's summer, and I've eaten pasta for my last three meals, I asked for sushi so I could have some semblance of nutrients (and something that's not steaming hot). She says, oh, I didn't think our leftover pasta from yesterday would go that far. She says sorry, and I just go back to my room, where I'm now writing this post. Am I the asshole for not eating what she brought me?

Edit: For those asking, I do in fact know how to cook, I'm actually quite good at it (I also enjoy baking), it's just the lack of ingredients that play a key, and my parents constant working which means we don't go shopping often :(

I told her that I didn't want to and that's its not my desicion to make, once my daughter is old enough she can decide for herself. She would bring it up every few months after that and eventually I got tired of it and told her that she could do it but that I wanted NOTHING to do with it.

I have to do a double take because it really caught me off guard. I know I shouldn't have but I snooped at the profile and it was just pictures of myself- my sister literally has a fake Facebook profile of me.

I'm livid at this point for many reasons. 1. I don't do social media. I'm a private person and I don't like pictures of me to be on profiles like that. 2. Some of the pictures she had were ones that she took without me knowing 3. Other pictures that she had were ones I had sent to friends which means she has gone onto my computer and taken pictures off.

I delete all of the pictures and I check her computer and find a folder filled with pictures that she has taken of me and ones that were on my computer- not even all of me per se, ones of my friends, group photos, food I had taken pictures of. I go through even more and find out that she has even stolen nudes that I had taken for my boyfriend.

I deleted the folder completely and went back to the fake facebook profile. I uploaded a single picture of her with the caption ""The real me"", changed her name(she was using my middle name and a fake last name) and then left her room. I've heard her sobbing from her room all day but I'm too angry and embarrassed to even confront her right now. AITA for messing with the profile and not just confronting her in the beginning?

Apparently she met a guy 1 or  2 years ago on another site and she was too nervous to give him a picture of herself so she sent one of me. He really liked the picture and from then on it just snowballed. She got deeper into it, made the profile and said that she enjoyed all the attention it got her. I brought up the nudes and she played dumb at first, and then said that she must've accidentally copied them over too. I told her that I didn't believe her but she's sticking with that. I asked her to delete the facebook and got the e-mail and information attached to it so that I can change it and make sure she doesn't try to reactivate it. She tried to make me feel bad and tell me that she was gonna lose a lot of her friends because of this and how that was the reason she did it in the first place. At that point I just felt like she only felt bad she was caught and didn't really care about my feelings. I told her that she was being selfish for only thinking about how this hurt her but never thought about how her lies hurt me. She got upset again and I left shortly after.

231,No A-holes here,"AITA? 

My husband loves collecting neat finds from yard sales and flea markets, and had just bought a huge (and I mean like 4 foot tall) antique bug zapper for our barn. He had taken it out the previous day to show friends, forgot about it, and left it sitting outside on a plastic chair. 

It rained that night, so by the morning the electric bug zapper was sitting in a pool of water in the chair’s seat. When I noticed, I moved it and placed it on a higher stack of chairs under the barn awning, so it would dry off and no one would get zapped trying to turn it back on. Also, dude.. water rusts metals. 

Today, my husband and I are outside with our dogs doing yard work, and the ball our Lab is playing with rolls under the stack of chairs where I moved the zapper. When he tries to retrieve it, like clumsy dogs will do, the neato bug zapper falls over and breaks. 

I naturally scold the dog, but my husband scolds me. 

He says: That I should have moved it somewhere better, not so high up. 
I says: That it was left out by him in the first place, and me moving it at all was trying to be helpful.

Who’s the asshole? 🙃 

Edit; this didn’t actually make us angry with each other. We’re just honestly curious whose frame of mind is “right.”

2nd Edit; I didn’t literally scold my dog, people. I yelled at him to get out of the way when I realized the zapper was falling. The bit about blaming the dog was mostly for a click-worthy title. Trust me, no puppers were harmed in the making of this Reddit post. 😝",37,257,0.88

I don't know why this specific girl deleted all her content but still has a NSFW user picture, but I feel like it would be an asshole thing to do to post something she deleted for whatever personal reason she had/has.

233,Not the A-hole,"So I live in a small apartment building with the laundry in the basement that has two washing machines. Today I go to do my laundry and notice that the washers are done their cycle but still occupied. Quite common, so I head back to my apartment and chill for 15 minute before checking again. I come back and they are still occupied. Their hamper is clearly next to the machine so I take their clothes out and carefully place them in the hamper making sure to not drop anything.

As I'm starting to do my own laundry the girl comes downstairs and immediately starts yelling at me about touching her stuff. I start apologizing as I don't want any trouble with my neighbors but she just keeps going on and on. She finishes with saying that if she sees me touching her stuff again she'll call the police, which I think is quite excessive.

She is a kind, warm-hearted woman who has held my hand through many awful things, such as my lack of sleep and skyrocketing anxiety and depression.

However, my mother recently blew up at me and told me that the dean told her that I need professional mental help. This woman knows that my mother is abusive, she knows everything that she's done to me (you can check my post history for a couple), and she knows that she's the reason I have such difficulty opening up to people about my mental health. My mother told me that she doesn't know who I am and that I'm a complete stranger to her.

I recently read a book about machine learning and Google / Facebook using image recognition to target ads. I can't even imagine what other heinous shit people are dreaming up right now for our future, and how our kids entire lives will be available for everyone to see and use in whatever twisted ways we haven't thought of yet.

241,Not the A-hole,"This post requires a little bit of backstory so bear with me.

Go back in time 8 years ago and I’m a freshman in high school with a terrible bully, same grade. Everyday I have to deal with his ridiculousness. He does your general bully things: I’m walking down the hallway and he’ll knock my books out of my hands, eating lunch and he’ll come up to me and steal my brownies, in the locker room after gym class he comes up to me and pushes me around, the works.

Probably the worst thing he ever did to me was when I was a sophomore. We ended up having an English class together with a “show and tell” the first week. Everybody brings in an object, introduces themselves to the class and talks about their object. Mine was a silver pocket watch my grandfather gave to me before he died two years earlier. After class, this kid comes up to me and asks to see it. I firmly say no and he pins me up against the wall and snatches it out of my hand. He looks at it mockingly, opens it and throws it on the ground cracking the glass covering the actual watch. The absolute jerk.

Fast forward to today. I’m an IT Manager with a small IT team (5 desktop techs, 1 network and 1 server engineer) for a company quickly expanding. I get approval to start hiring two more desktop techs.

I get a number of resumes and about 10 candidates stand out to me. One in particular catches my eye because it’s a name that I’m very familiar with. As I’m reading through this person’s education and work history, it becomes clear this is the same bully I had to deal with for four years of high school.

I cant ignore the fact that he has a good resume and is essentially what I’m looking for in a desktop tech. Not wanting to be biased I include him in the screening process for phone interviews because hey, this was 8 years ago and we’re both adults now.

Eventually we schedule him for an in-person interview. This is a panel interview that includes myself, one desktop tech and our network engineer. As soon as this guy walks into our little meeting room I recognize him despite not seeing him since graduating high school.

I shake his hand and state my name and he looks at me for a second and says,

“ShallowSquire? You graduated from (school) right?”
“Yes” I reply.
“I thought I recognized you! Good to see you again!”

I’m not really sure why but that immediately made me feel angry. During the interview all I could think of was the suffering he put me through in high school.

The interview ends. Admittedly he seems to be knowledgeable and my colleagues want to consider him for employment. I told them let’s finish interviewing the other candidates first before we decide.

We’ve since interviewed everyone else and he’s still be considered for hiring. He’s got the knowledge and skills to perform his job well, but I really don’t want to hire him. I don’t feel like I have a personal vendetta against him, but I surely don’t want to work with this guy.

WIBTA for not hiring this man for the sole reason he was my high school bully 8 years ago?

We all shared an Airbnb house and spent a few evenings of the week hanging out in the den, drinking and talking. For the most part, it was a good time and we all got to know each other well enough to have fun conversations and get to know one another well.

One evening the conversation goes into a discussion about race. One of the girls I knew previously was talking about how someone she knew was ""White mixed with Spanish"" and I respectfully explained that wasn't a thing, as you can be White and Spanish, and race and nationality are separate things. Ends up she meant Hispanic when she was saying Spanish, and the discussion evolved into me explaining the difference between race, ethnicity, and nationality - I genuinely just want my people to go out into the world knowing the difference. 

One couple was rolling their eyes at my explanations and said it wasn't that serious and that they're gonna stick to how they already say things. I just smiled and fell back. The conversation keeps going and the guy of the couple rolling their eyes - Chuck - is talking about how ""strong"" Black genes are and how if someone is mixed with Black they typically look mostly or fully Black because our DNA is ""dominant."" People are nodding their heads in agreement. I jumped in to say that wasn't how DNA works. Chuck replies with a sarcastic and dismissive comment like ""Yeah, yeah I bet"" and everyone laughs. I fell back for the rest of the evening. 

The next evening there was a conversation about educational systems by state since a few people there were originally from Mississippi and we all now lived in Texas. Before I chimed in with just general commentary, Chuck joked ""Go ahead, we know how much you like your statistics!"" It felt super malicious to me and I fell back in the conversation and went to bed early. 

Later on I asked my boyfriend if he would tell me if I was ever embarrassing myself or doing too much around other people. He assured me he would. I brought up the situation before and said I felt perhaps I was unintentionally being an asshole and failed to read the room. He said maybe I was being a bit of an asshole know it all, but it was fine and at least I didn't say anything actually wrong. I said there was a lot of ignorance I didn't bother commenting on during this vacation and it was unfair that the one conversation I spoke up, I was a know it all. We left the conversation at that. 

I've recanted this to close friends who weren't there and they all told me I did nothing wrong and that we should look to educate our own people at any given opportunity.

Out of my best friends group of friends I am the only one with a full time job (27M) the rest are unemployed (including my best friend) or still at uni. 

I had rescheduled a meeting with some co-workers so I could leave on time for the dinner as I was not able to go bowling seeing  I usually leave work by 8pm. So I was ready to leave work at 7.30 to make it by 8 to the restaurant (had to pick up my girlfriend first) and I get a text from him saying if we could move it to 8.30, I said that’s fine. I picked her up and went to the Japanese place, figured we could have a drink beforehand. When I got there the hostess informed me they were fully booked and he had not made a booking. I called him and he said that we should try a different place and to meet him and the others at that place in 15 minutes. 

So, I arrive at the other place and he’s not there. This other place was also fully booked and again no reservation, I was starting to get pissed off but seeing it was his birthday I decided to be more patient. I call him and tell him that place is fully booked as well. He suggests a third place, bear in mind it’s already 9pm and there is still no place to meet. He said that he’ll think of a place, I said, listen man, I have an early flight tomorrow so I can’t stay out that late.

We get to the third place at 9.15 and he’s not there, this place was empty so booking was not an issue. I waited 15 minutes and nothing, called him two times and he did not pick up. The GF and I decided to have a quick snack somewhere else and headed home. 

When I was packing my suitcase around 10.30 Another friend called and asked if I was coming. I said no I was not gonna make it, he then handed his phone to my best friend who claimed his phone died (not true bc calls don’t ring when the battery dies) I said sorry that I could not make it.

In fifth grade I was given assistant technology to type stuff and refused to use it because I thought I was not disabled and there didn’t use it as much as I should. I was kinda of a brat.

Around ninth grade I was looking around my mom’s room for a flash drive and found a document from 6th grade, that said I had a specific learning disability on it. A quick search on google brought up dysgraphia and I asked my mom if she knew anything about it. She told me about my diagnosis and that she kept it hidden from me to motivate me.

I was furious with her. I know I wasn’t best student, I had a tendency to slack off and procrastinate but I don’t think a learning disability diagnosis would have increased my chances of doing that.

267,Not the A-hole,"TLDR: I'm gay; friends jokingly call me a f\*g but I give as good as I get; BF saw a text referring to me as a f\*g and freaked out, telling me I enable homophobia

I (22M) have been in a relationship (my first proper relationship) with 'BF' (20M) for about 5 months now. Things have been going great, and he's pretty much my perfect guy aside from maybe being not as laid-back as I'd ideally prefer. But still, he's funny, compassionate, attractive, smart, all that jazz.

Virtually all my best friends are straight, with the ones I refer to in this post being male, 22-23 years old. 4 of us have been friends for \~10 years, & they're really the best sort of friends to have but we jokingly rip into each other a lot. For example, one is from the country and cops jokes about being inbred, poor, unsophisticated, etc. As for me, I cop a lot of gay jokes and get referred to as a f\*g. We have a fb groupchat we use for memes & plans, etc.

A few days ago I was with BF watching TV when my phone received messages from the groupchat, and as you'd expect BF glanced down at my phone homescreen to see a notification saying '@OP hey f\*g you free for next weekend'.

Well, he FLIPPED OUT. Started asking why tf I'm friends with the guy who said it, called him a homophobe, and said that no straight person should ever say it.

I told him I don't care because I give as good as I get, & I know they're not homophobic, especially considering how supportive they each were when I was coming out.

BF then turns on me and says I'm enabling their homophobic slurs. He then goes on a tangent about how I try too hard to be laid-back and difficult to offend because I'm trying to avoid being a stereotypical gay man (wtf?) and suggests I have internalised homophobia because I'm okay with being called a f\*g. BF then mentions that he was bullied in high school by being called a f\*g (I didn't know that happened to him) and so doesn't have the privilege I have in that I don't associate the word with bad experiences.

After that argument it was quite awkward. He asked me to tell them not to say it anymore regardless of whether or not anyone can hear/see it, and I muttered maybe. He called me an asshole (there it is) and left after about 5-10 minutes of silence. We've talked since but it's been stiff.

I've mentioned to my friends that BF saw it and to be more careful, and they seemed to understand. Aside from that homescreen leak we only use these slurs around each other knowing that no one takes it personally. I'm not going to tell them to stop saying it altogether - it would feel unnatural/forced if they stopped saying it.

IMO there's 0 tangible harm behind slurs that are used endearingly in private spaces, & I don't see why I should make my friends stop calling me something I interpret somewhat endearingly. I will, however, make sure no one else can hear/see it in future.

So AITA for not caring that my friends call me a f\*g?",433,631,0.9
268,Not the A-hole,"So my bridesmaid, we’ll call her birdie, was one of my best friends in high school, and while we’ve moved apart a little in college (we both attend different schools) I really want her to be a part of my wedding. She had my back in high school, and while she wasn’t always the best person she always had my back. 

So, just about all of my bridesmaids and I are all in college, so money is expectedly tight. Originally, I was going to just pick a color and let them have their pick of any dress they wanted. After all, I’m not exactly a picky person. I changed my mind, however, when I went shopping with my maid of honor and saw how random dresses could look really tacky. 

I tried really hard to find a few options that look good both together and on a variety of body types. I ended up settling for two dresses that were $200 each, but I thought looked really good together. Mind you, we were at David’s Bridal, so the dresses weren’t going to be super expensive, and they have a year to buy their dresses as well. I’m sure there would be a sale on them eventually. 

Anyways, my bridesmaid, who I’m going to call birdie, messaged me shortly after I had told all of them about which dresses to get specifically, and told me that she felt that 200 was a lot to spend on a dress. She continued to say that she would prefer it if I just let her shop through the clearance section to find a dress that worked for her. I offered to help her pay for it, since I’ve got a job for the summer, and I could make enough in less than a week, but she won’t take my offer, and insists that I should let her find a cheaper dress.

It’s gotten to the point where I’m really irritated with her, since I’m set on these dresses, and I’m not known for changing my mind a lot. If I’m paying for her dress then there shouldn’t be a problem, anyways. I’m really reconsidering my offer to pay, if she’s going to be so difficult about it, let alone having her in my wedding party.

I am going to spend a few hundred on mine (which I guess is typical for a man) and she has her heart set on a wedding band that costs about \~$4k and has diamonds around the whole thing. Now, we could afford this by dipping into our savings (which we are already dipping into for our wedding), but I have made it pretty clear that I'm not thrilled about that, and I think we should spend less. She has student debt and we want to buy a home in the near future, so having that extra money will be pretty important in achieving our future goals.

&#x200B;

I've told her I don't think spending $4k on a band is very smart for us right now and she is pretty pissed about that. After thinking about it for a little while, she has said I can choose something less expensive, but she has made it clear that it is not what she really wants and that eventually she would want to replace it with something more expensive.

Bob is an extremely eccentric older gentleman who is an avid farmer/gardener. He has tuned every inch of his property into a garden. Over the last couple years he has spread out into the yards of the surrounding rental properties( not his). He has an area for tomatoes in my next door neighbors yard. This is a vacant rental property that the owner has asked me to keep an eye on and has expressed his dislike for the garden in his yard but don’t care enough to stop it.  Anyway...


So yesterday I noticed a rabbit in one of his traps. We are pretty sure it’s the mother to the den in our yard.  I ignored it and went on with my business. I was heading to bed around midnight and decided to check to see if bob dealt with the rabbit yet. Nope, 12+ hours later the rabbit was still there.   I popped the latch and let him free... poor dude was freaking out 


So far there is no drama or anything but I started to feel bad that the rabbit might end up in the garden and obviously that’s the whole point of the  trap .... but then I start thinking how it’s not bobs yard and he’s not supposed to be there.

The problem is, my friend has another American friend that he’s actually never met who lives in San Diego (which is one of the places we’ll be staying for a few days). He’s asked in advance if it would be okay if he tags along with my group for a day or two, which I had no problem with, since he lives in the city and can go back home when we’re done for the day. 

Except now, a week before he flies here, my friend is now attempting to convince me to let his American friend (who none of us have ever met) to sleep on the floor in the AirBNB each of my friends paid for. Apparently, this guy is currently living in his car because the person he was living with kicked him out. My friend’s justification is that he “came over to see him too” and that it should not be a problem to have him stay over since he is a “great guy” and that they talk on the phone almost every day. 

My friend claims to know this guy well because they speak on the phone, but naturally I have a problem with that justification because people can be completely different in person (ex: had a LDR for a few years, flew to meet him, turned out to be emotionally abusive, etc). I personally feel that you can’t know someone completely without a decent amount of face-to-face connection, but my friend doesn’t seem to understand that. 

He keeps bringing up this situation to try to convince me, to which I’ve told him no multiple times, due to the facts that the airBNB is in my name, so I’m not allowed to have more people than stated originally stay over or I’ll risk a fine or cancellation, and the fact that I don’t know this man and I’m not comfortable with him being in the same room as myself (a young female) and my belongings, no matter how “cool” he seems.

Roommate's cat is afraid of new animals. Roommate was out of town, and I had some people over. DogeFriend brought his dog (without asking). DogeFriend has asked to bring doge over before, and it's normally ok.

I locked the cat in roommate's bedroom, where water/food/litter box is. But also where the bathroom is. Cat got out, so we start looking for it. Found it hiding, but it was really scared of the new people, noise, and probably smell of dog. Cat ran from behind bookcase to behind couch, while I'm trying to wrangle it. Dog sees cat, starts barking, and trying to chase the cat, while DogeFriend (ineffectively) trying to tell dog to chill out.

Cat is hiding behind couch, hissing at us. Everybody is yelling ""grab the cat"" ""put it in the room"". I'm trying to make my way over to the cat, but friend , we'll say Mr. Grabby Hands, is closer. Mr. GrabbyHands goes to scruff cat - but has no experience wrangling kitties, and grabs too far away from the neck, so cat turns around and sinks her teeth into his hand.

No blood from the wound, so we apply antiobiotic ointment and bandage the hand, give Mr. Grabby Hands some ibuprofen, all go to bed. Next morning it's swollen, GrabbyHands goes to urgent care and gets antiobiotics. We feel bad for GrabbyHands, offer to pay, but his insurance covered it all.

Mr. GrabbyHands drives home. Turns out, he wakes up the next day feeling really sick. Ends up going to the ER, stays overnight 3 days! Despite the antiobiotics, the wound became infected. He had to be put on an antiobiotic IV. 

GrabbyHands doesn't even tell me - I find out from someone else. Contact GrabbyHands and find out his hospital bill was $2000! I offer to pay half, splitting it with DogeFriend, and GrabbyHands left with the other half. AITA?

Friends saying I make significantly more money then GrabbyHands, the incident happened at my place, and it was my roommate's cat. But I think it's GrabbyHands' decision to grab the cat, whereas I was ready to grab the cat myself.

EDIT: worth mentioning Mr Grabby Hands lost 3 days of work, already paid $500 out-of-pocket for ER copay. His work is very physical, and is hourly (not my fault, or my choice, but food for thought). Also, DogeFriend backed out and isn’t helping pay.",66,32,0.9
274,Asshole,"I am an European citizen, who is about to graduate from a university in Asia next month. As such, i want both of my parents to visit me next month for a week, during the time i graduate so that they will be present in the ceremony.

&#x200B;

My parents are divorced, and it is the first time for my mom to come visit me and the second time for my father (and his girlfriend). Because it is a huge milestone for me and a special occasion, i wanted both of my parents to come alone without their SO's.

&#x200B;

Here is the problem: Both of my parents want to take their SO's while coming to visit me. They won't be present in the ceremony, but obviously I will have to take them around the city for the rest of time. I really don't want to deal with this hassle during a special occasion in my life, and have no issues if they want to come over at any other time. I made this explicit for them.

&#x200B;

I begged my father several times not to take her SO, however, he thinks that I have no right to decide anything for them since they are the ones that pay for my studies and well, everything else. He mentioned that by coming alone to visit me with his ex-wife (my mom), he will hurt his girlfriend and their relationship. As such, his girlfriend booked already two tickets for him and for herself, because she also wanted to tag along.

&#x200B;

My mom was a bit more understanding. She actually talked with her SO and he understood why he shouldn't come. However, after she heard that my father is also taking his girlfriend, my mom also wants to take her boyfriend over and is very hurt at me for not wanting her to do the same as my father.

Both of them are afraid that their SO will be hurt for not coming along, however, i feel the worst in this situation, because i feel that my parents don't care for me as much as they should. I think that, if they are really afraid that their SO will be hurt over visiting their only child for one week, then their relationship is weak without trust, and shouldn't be together in the first place.

&#x200B;

Personally, i don't understand why my parents don't see my position or don't prioritize my happiness over their personal relationships. It will be incredibly troublesome to take care of two separate groups during a whole week. Similarly, I also don't understand why their SO's cannot see how this is wrong and why would they want to tag along to an event which has nothing to do with them, nor they will be able to come to it? I really just wanted to have my IMMEDIATE and most important family with me, which are my parents so that we can have fun together. I made this very clear to them.

275,Not the A-hole,"I'm 25F, and live across the country from my family. I'm wrapping up a weeklong visit home now, and up until this point it had been really nice.

On Monday, I had a free morning and wanted to be helpful, so I did some laundry. As I was putting a load into the washing machine, my younger sister came in with some clothes she said she wanted cleaned ASAP. I had no problem with that so I took them to add to the current load.

While hanging everything up, I noticed that there was a battered Juul in the bottom of the washer. I pulled it out and brought it to my sister, figuring it was hers. As soon as I told her that it had gone through a wash cycle, she got really annoyed and asked if I'd gone through the pockets before I washed her stuff. I admitted I hadn't.

After that, she was even more annoyed & upset. She said since I ruined the Juul, it was on me to buy her a whole new one and a pack of new pods. Here's where I'm not sure if my position is right or not:

I said no, absolutely not. That not only was it on her to keep track of her possessions, but that it was illegal for her to even own one and that I wouldn't do something technically illegal to replace it for her.

At this point, she was crying and yelling really loudly, so our mom came in to ask what was up. We each related what had happened. Then, mom turned to me and told me that if it was going to cause issues between us, I needed to be the bigger person and replace the Juul. That a sisterly relationship is more important than a silly little toy. I told her what a Juul actually is and the legalities involved, but she cut me off to say that that didn't make a difference and it was the principle of the matter that dictated I should replace it. I said, well, what if I take her shopping and spend the equivalent amount? My sister cut in and said ""I don't want anything you're only spending $50 on"", and I said something snarky about definitely not buying her a Juul in that case cause that's what they cost. 

By then, my mom had about had it, and told me that it's on me to make this right. That I can choose to be a goody two-shoes and damage my relationship with my sister, or suck it up and fix this. I've refused, and as a result this vacation has become incredibly tense. My sister won't speak to me more than a word or two, and my mom is mysteriously super busy when we were supposed to have plans (she already took off work for them, so I know she's just being petty about this).

My GF does not have a Netflix account and she could not login to her friends account because she doesn’t know the password. She doesn’t want to ask friend for the password. 

After a few months of dating we where over at her place and she wants to watch a movie on Netflix that just came out. I was also excited to see the movie, but she wanted to watch in the bedroom. I was like let’s watch in the family room. She said let’s just watch in bed it’s so much more comfortable. 

So a little info here. I don’t have a TV in my bedroom I don’t like TV’s in the bedroom for multiple reasons, the biggest being I find it hard to sleep with the TV on. So back to the story. 

So I caved and signed into my Netflix account on her bedroom TV. We watched the movie then went to bed. 

A few weeks later I am trying to watch Netflix at home and I can’t (we don’t live together). Another device is using the account the error says. At the time I didn’t put it together that it was my GF watching I just figured I left my laptop signed in. Then it keeps happening can’t login every day. My GF calls me pretty much every night we aren’t together to chat before bed. This time I mention that my Netflix account says I can’t watch because another device is watching. She says oh yeah I’m watching Netflix in bed right now. 

Fast forward a few weeks and this is still happening every time I want to watch a show or movie. I would have call her and say hey are you watching Netflix she says yes and says she will get off.

So eventually I get tired of calling and asking her to get off so I signed out of all devices. I know she can just watch in the family room but she insists on the bedroom, this also bothered me when I was over at her place. Like I mentioned before I dont care for a TV in the bedroom. 

So the AITA part is just last night I was at her place and she asked me why she couldn’t watch Netflix I said it was because I signed her out. She asked me to sign her back in and I said I wouldn’t. She asked why and I explained I was tried of having to ask her to get off when I wanted to use it. She brushed it off as not a big deal and hands me the remote saying I’ll get off anytime you want please just sign me back in. I said no, she starts telling me I’m a jerk and if I didn’t want her on my Netflix why did I sign in in the first place. I said she needed to get her own account and to stop mooching off of me and her friend. She can afford an account she makes over six figures. She gets really upset and now we aren’t talking.

Unfortunately last week, my oldest aunt had to undergo an emergency surgery and it was discovered that she has second stage colon cancer. The entire family freaked out, myself included. My family members including my mum have been visiting the hospital every day and taking turns to sleep overnight at the hospital to be with my oldest aunt who is now recovering from the surgery. 

Ever since then, my third aunt has been pushing for us to cancel the party for my mum (who is the second oldest among her siblings) but we have refused to do so. We are going to proceed with the party and my mum, whom the party is for, is okay with it. 

Now, my third aunt is complaining to everyone in the family and saying that we should have cancelled the party in light of what happened with our oldest aunt. 

When I asked her why we should cancel, her excuse was that my oldest aunt will not be well enough to attend the party. 

My siblings and I are really upset about what happened with our oldest aunt, obviously, but we don’t think that should mean we cannot celebrate anything in the near future. And besides, if our oldest aunt can be discharged from the hospital before the party, we plan to have a separate menu specially for her, as per doctor’s orders or whatever.

Also worth saying, my third aunt holds a lot of sway in the family simply because she’s the richest by far among her siblings and she’s the successful one who got out of the hometown and moved to the big city. My siblings and I are concerned that she will convince our other aunts and uncles into asking us to cancel the party as well. 

Anyway, so are my siblings and I the assholes for going forward with the party despite what happened with our oldest aunt?? Should we have just cancelled the party?",14,34,0.96

285,Not the A-hole,"Hi all! I (19F) came home for the summer and am currently living with my family. Something that I have noticed has been that they tend to go into my room without permission. Like, my door is normally closed, and my parents will check on me. I also know that my mom will open the door while I am asleep, since my closed door will open at around 3:30am, and will be closed when I wake up that day.

Another thing to note is that I am one of two people in my house who can currently drive. My mom was recently injured and my dad works, so I have been driving her all over the place. I have no siblings that can drive currently, and my dad would probably need to take off from work if I did not drive her places.

Today, was the last straw for me. I am fine with being woken up, but only if it is an emergency. My mom decided to wake me up at 8:30am (I had an activity at 4pm today, but I have no reason to be up at 8:30am) because I forgot to put my retainers on last night. After telling her that it's too early and to get out of my room, she yelled at me at how ""just because my SO does not wear them does not mean that I don't need to,"" ""you know that SO and you probably will not last forever,"" ""your room needs to be cleaner because there is 'no path' (to clarify, my laptop which she moved was on the floor because I was using it),"" and to put the retainers in. Normally, I would ignore these comments, but I was tired and cranky so I yelled at her to get out of my room (she has made these sorts of comments when I am more awake). While I understand that she is concerned for me, I do not appreciate being woken up at 8:30am on a day when I do not need to because I am a light sleeper, which she knows. I would not be able to fall back asleep to wake up later unless I naturally woke up. Another factor is that I do wear the retainers 3-4 times a week, and just forgot that night.

&#x200B;

Being annoyed, I am considering implementing a policy of that I will not be driving anyone if I am woken up so needlessly early. This would partially be to prevent the unwarranted visits at random times, but also I kinda feel like she knows that I had a lot of relationship issues in the past and that I do not appreciate her comments of that nature, considering that she likes my SO.

Note related to my driving: I am not comfortable driving on highways, and have gone out of my way to route ways to get my mom where she needs to in a way where I would be comfortable driving. The car is the one that was not in the crash, and not mine.

So Reddit, WIBTA if I told her that I am not willing to drive her if I am woken up at a time that is too early (This would probably be quantified as an hour before a planned activity that has been known about for longer than 3 days)?

&#x200B;

Edit: I do want to clarify that I have said that I do not want people going in and out of my room at random intervals, and that I am annoyed mainly by the lack of respect towards my privacy that seems to be given. I do see that this is probably not the best solution, but the intention was more about the disrespecting of wanting people not coming into my room while I am sleeping and the door is closed instead of that I was woken up at 8:30am. Also, I currently have a coin lock on my door and noticed that every time the door was locked at night, it would be unlocked by the time I woke up.",52,30,0.96
286,Not the A-hole,"Hey guys.

I want to apologize in advance for my English and for formatting. I am on mobile and English is not my first language. Sorry for the long post. 

I (F25) still live with my mom, my stepfather and my little sister. 
I work since I am 17, and all my money used to go to my mom when she divorced my dad. I didn't get to spend anything on me. She was all alone supporting two kids back then, so I always understood. 
I managed to save a little bit and I managed to pay my college degree(almost everything) as well. 

Even with the money I was giving her, she was not able to pay for our food, accomodation, etc, so she put herself into debt and afterwards, she put me too when I was only 18. I was not aware, at 18, of the implications that this would have in my life and she always assured me it would be ok and I wouldn't have problems. I have not touched or used that money ever. 
Due to this, I am not able to move out yet, because I am saving to pay the debt first. I can't even have my own debit card and have to rely on others. I have a good job which I like, but I am still not paid much. 
We agreed that I would not give my Mother money and I would be staying in her house until I pay all of my debt, and she told me she would help me pay. 
I eat and sleep basically for Free in my house and I have been saving quite a bit until now.  
My Mother still struggles,even with my stepfather living there. I ocasionally lend them money and I pay for some of my sister stuff to help but that is it. I also lended her a big amount of money this year.

Last night, we were having dinner and my Mother started making remarks about me not helping her and that other kids help their parents. 
 I told her that other kids don't have the debts that I do. My Mother then proceeded telling me I prefer to spend money on other stuff, like eating in expensive restaurants (which I ocasionally do, with my boyfriend but only now and then). 
I feel i am entitled to spend some of my money on myself since I work very hard and  want to have quality of life too and be able to hang out with my friends.
She then told me she would not be helping paying for my debts because I earn more than her, so I should be able to pay them all for myself. 
 I screamed to her she was very toxic to me, and she was always messing with my head and manipulating me. 

She cried too and I know I hurt her deeply. She is heartbroken and she told me now she actually wants to help me pay, but she can't because she doesn't have money .
She also told me she feels very guilty and wishes she could do more for me. She is very overwhelmed by having to pay almost everything by herself. All she did was for us, and I know that, she always put us first in e very decision she made. She didn't do any of this with ill intention. 

Im feeling terrible for what I have said to her. 
AITA for telling her these horrible things?",13,26,0.84
287,No A-holes here,"I (20F) am a college student living in the dorms for the summer. I share a double room with one other girl, who we'll call N. N and I get along very well for the most part, except for one thing. Before I moved in, I received a doctor's note qualifying me for an A/C unit in my room. The building is not air conditioned and A/C units are only allowed when deemed medically necessary. Although we haven't hit the dead of summer, it's been pretty warm in the building so I tend to keep the A/C going all the time when I'm home. However, N consistently turns the A/C down or off when she gets home from work. The other day, I asked her to stop doing that when I am in the room. I explained that I have the unit for medical reasons, so if it is on that means that I need it. She got a bit defensive and said that it was too cold in the room, and that the noise from the unit was bothering her. I don't want her to be uncomfortable in the room, but I do have a legitimate need for the room to be cool and dry. AITA for telling her to stop messing with my A/C?

Edit: Thanks to everyone who has offered advice! I've texted my roommate and we're going to grab coffee during our lunch break and talk it out. Up until this issue things have been great, so I'm hoping we can work it out.

Edit2: We had a really productive conversation and have worked things out where we will both be comfortable. Just to be clear, she does NOT have a medical condition and does not mind the AC being on when she is sleeping, only when she is working on her summer coursework in our room and the fan is on high. We've agreed to keep it on the low fan setting and around 72-73 degrees when she is working, which she is perfectly comfortable with as the noise is pretty negligible at that level and it's cool enough for me to remain happy and healthy. The best of all worlds, as nobody has to pick up and find a new place to stay. Thank you to everyone who weighed in!",130,597,0.96

289,Not the A-hole,"Here is the story: My best friend's husband cheated on her. Not to get to into the details of the affair but he had a long term affair with a coworker who was his subordinate, never apologized to my friend, decided to walk out on her and the kid, manipulated her extensively, etc. To be fair to him the marriage had not been great. That's about as fair to him as I can be because I can't bring myself to think that's an excuse. My friend has been devastated and has been forced to become a single mother because he wanted little to do with her and their kid. She keeps hoping that, even though he treated her like shit (told her he hated her) that he will come back. I never thought he would come back but recently he has been showing interest in coming back (probably because his girlfriend left him). He's still not apologized. If they were to get back together WIBTA for telling her that I love and support her but that I won't be around him or let him be around my family? I want to give her support but at the same time his behavior IMO is equivalent to emotional abuse and I don't want to support that.

290,Not the A-hole,"Last Sunday, we celebrated my father in law’s birthday. My boyfriend (37), myself and my teenage daughter were invited, as was my Sister in Law (no kids), her husband (H), her boyfriend (BF) and her husband’s girlfriend (GF). They’ve been in this polyamorous relationship for about two years and they all get along fine. All fine with me.
 
SIL (PhD in neuropsychology) left the ‘rational’ world after a burn-out and became quite… spiritual. Into healings, yoga, gluten free, afraid of wifi radiation, miracle powders (‘it’s not a pyramid scheme, it’s a network approach’), that type. SIL believes in aliens, or ET’s, as she calls them. H, BF and GF are all utterly convinced of this as well. She thinks her ET-guide (let’s call him D, aliens have their privacy as well) uses her to heal people. We think they’re crazy as hell, but hey, live and let live. We only see them like twice or three times a year anyway. They do know we don’t believe in any of that shit and do not want to be involved.
 
Last Sunday at my PIL’s house, BF declared to my boyfriend that he’s an uncle. I was quite surprised, knowing SIL’s infertile, but BF explained that they had an invisible child together. About a year ago, SIL got ‘pregnant’, because the ET-doctors had said so. After a few months, she went to a (human) doctor, who told her she wasn’t (and had never been) pregnant. A lot of confusion, but she still believed she was pregnant (surely the ET’s wouldn’t lie). 6 months later, she ‘gave birth’ to an ‘energetic child’. The child then went to live with D on his starship.
 
All this while, we kept a straight face. The BF asked if we would like to ‘meet’ this imaginary alien baby. We weren’t too thrilled, but they kinda pushed it. Funny side note: the baby was with another alien, since D ‘was on holiday’. At this point, I couldn’t hold it back any longer and cried with laughter. No hard feelings from their side by the way. After I calmed down, my SIL started ‘channeling’: eyes fluttering, rapid arm movements, heavy breathing, talking in a strange tone of voice, and just taking A-Lot-of-Time. She let ‘the baby talk’ to us, wanting us to sing a song, making us all hold hands, etc. Later, BF said they were trying to bring the baby back to earth, where lizard people live would live who could transform into humans. If the baby would be there, then it could take a human form and they could all be reunited. We just sat it out.
 
The whole afternoon had just been about them: very little attention for my FIL. When we drove home, boyfriend was furious. He’s really fed up and doesn’t ever want to see his sister again, because they just can’t keep their craziness to themselves. I’m slightly more nuanced: I suggested not meeting them like this again, but occasionally meeting his sister on, for example, her own birthday – when the day really is about her. But he’s just really through with her/them. Would we be the assholes if we’d cut her out completely?",204,1120,0.96

293,Not the A-hole,"Ex (32M) & I (28F) dated last year for \~ 8 months. It was good at first, exclusive straight away. He talked about past mental health issues but insisted he was now well  
 It wasn’t a good relationship. I found out he was still on Tinder despite us being exclusive, he gaslit me regularly & was emotionally abusive, but blamed it all on his mental health

 5 months in was his birthday & I said I’d treat us to a weekend away. I wanted to book a b&b, but he was unhappy & said a hotel would be better. I told him I couldn't afford this, & he said he’d pay for half. When it came round, he'd forgotten something that weekend & couldn’t go. I moved the booking for a charge. He did this 4 times. Total cost went up from £200 to £240

 We had a rough break up, which included him having a breakdown and was admitted to a private clinic.

 Because of his mental state, I left it 4 months before contacting about the money. I sent a nice gentle message asking if he planned on paying me back sometime. He said he would, but his finances were unstable & didn't know when it would be. He’s not poor, but was in the middle of selling a house so I accepted this

 I texted every 2 months saying hey hope you’re ok, any update?. He’d say no, but soon. After my siblings said it was ridiculous & that I should put my foot down, I sent a more firm message. I asked for an update & he said at the end of the month. I sent a texted explaining that it was getting a bit silly now, and that instalments would be fine, but that we needed to make a plan, as he was being too vague. I said that if there was nothing more definite in the next few months, I’d have to think about small claims court.

 He got upset, told me he’d have an update for me at the end of the month & that was the best he could do. He got very defensive & said that he didn't have to pay me back, he could’ve blocked me, but didn't, & was going to pay me back not because he had to, but because he was choosing to & that I had to wait. I told him I had proof of him agreeing to pay, proof of him causing the booking to be moved & if he refused I would take him to court. I wasn't rude, I said it in the most neutral way I could. He got extremely upset & told me I was being aggressive, threatening & attacking. He eventually told me to check my bank account, & I saw that he'd sent me £20. I asked if this would be monthly & he said yes, but was very rude. I don't have much faith that he will stick to this.

 £140 may not seem like much, but I was made redundant last year, was unemployed for 5 months & have debts to pay off. I also know I'm at fault for ignoring all the red flags, I wish I hadn’t

 I don't want to make his life harder, that's why I've waited so long to do anything. But I just feel he's still taking advantage of me even now",49,32,0.85
294,Asshole,"I work in a store where, we provide a service and have to go up to a counter to greet customers to take their orders. It’s a small department (3/4 employees). There is one customer who always wanted (26/f)me to help him (70s/M). I’ve been at this store almost 6 years, and he’s requested me for atleast the last 3. Hes probably been a customer for 20 years.

I don’t think anything weird of this because we all have our “regular customers”. As the years go by we are friendly with each other. He has always bought gifts around holidays for the entire store to share. (Cookies at Christmas, candy at Halloween, etc). A year or 2 ago, he started adding little extra gifts just for me. He always talks to me for longer than most customer, about his life and things going on in the world and I don’t cut him off because it’s my job to be nice to our customers. It’s usually just me listening and reacting to what he says, not me telling personal stuff about myself.

Fast forward to last August, I got engaged. He comes in and sees the ring on my finger, and the usual 20 min conversation was a 2. I didn’t think much of it because there are times he’s been in a rush. 3 months go by and he hasn’t been back in. He finally comes in and asks to speak with me privately. He confesses his love for me and how he’s never met anyone like me in his life, and how he thought we had something and how he thought I was single. Overall very overwhelming conversation because it wasn’t on my radar AT ALL. I didn’t tell anyone at work about this because I didn’t want weird vibes and figured I could handle this myself by still helping him but occasionally avoiding him and letting others help him. His visits have been shorter, and obviously a little weird but he hasn’t stopped being a regular customer.

Yesterday he came in before I got to work and asked for me and my coworkers told him I would be in later. So he came back later, dropped off work to do and gave me a card and left. It made me anxious so I didn’t want to open it at work. I brought it home and told my fiancé about it and that I hadn’t opened it because I was anxious. So we open it together at home and there is a large sum of money in the envelope.

So that brings me to my current situation. I’m not sure what to do about this money, it would obviously help tremendously, weddings are EXPENSIVE. But I don’t know if I can rightly accept this, or if I should seek advice from someone higher up in the company (I’m manager of my department but there is a store manager over me).

TLDR: have regular customer who is friendly with me, over twice my age. Think he’s just nice old man. I get engaged to my boyfriend and the customer confesses their love for me. Customer still comes to store and right before my wedding gave me large sum of money. Thinking about keeping it because it would help, but I feel anxious about accepting something so large.",306,659,0.94
295,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend and I have been together for about 2 1/2 years. We live together as of recently (4 monthsish) and we get along pretty well. We have a lot of separate hobbies, and one of mine is hiking. I wouldn't call myself a ""peak bagger"" but I do like to add mountain summits to my hikes when I can. BF doesn't enjoy hiking more than occasionally so he rarely comes along. 

For reference, I am a 5'3"" 150lb woman. He is a 5'7 170lb guy. 

On Sunday I went for a long, strenuous hike with my friends. If you're familiar, it's 13er James Peak in CO. It was a 9 mile, 3,000ft elevation gain hike (from where we started). I had a fun time and went home and did my usual workout (short run, weights, some light yoga) after. Suffice to say, I was pretty hungry by dinner time. I made dinner, which was grilled chicken with lots of grilled veg, some pasta salad as a side. When it came time to eat, because of my big day, I grabbed the bigger piece of chicken. We're talking a 5oz piece versus a 7oz piece. 

BF got upset about this when he saw my plate versus hit place, and he made a pretty big deal out of it. He told me that there's no reason for me to serve myself such a big piece of meat, he's the guy and he should have it. I told him that I'd hiked and done my workout that day, and that he puttered around the house and went for a short (5 mile) run. 

He told me that growing up, he was always taught that the man got the biggest piece of meat because men need more to sustain themselves in general. I said that I agreed, but again, I'd climbed a mountain that day and burned much more than he did. He told me I should accept the good calorie deficit, or load up on the pasta salad and veggies instead. 

We've been arguing about this for days and he tagged some friends in and asked his parents (who said to keep them out of it, lol). So far people are split, some believe even if he didn't do much that day it's just weird for a woman to actively try to eat more than her boyfriend. I think that's stupid and outdated and comes from a time when men tended to do more physical labor in general.

296,Not the A-hole,"I realize this is a very first world problem, so maybe I’m just being petty.   

We use a cleaning service on a bi-weekly basis. They do an adequate job cleaning. They’ll do what you ask, but nothing above and beyond. The price is fine, a little on the cheaper end, which is why we keep them. The owner doesn’t do the cleaning - she has employees who do that. The owner handles the bookings. They day before your scheduled service, they send you an email with the time window.   

Yesterday I got the email with the time, but that time ended up not working for us. In the past, I’ve tried to reschedule, but they’re very rigid about the days so I just decided to cancel.   

The owner sent me a note back admonishing me for canceling so late. She said that because I cancelled late, they had other jobs they had to turn down. She also noted that in the past I tried to reschedule so why didn’t I do that now, and that people plan their day around the time they’re arriving (which is fair, but they frequently end up arriving an hour or more early with no notice).   

In all, it felt like I was getting a kind of rude email from someone I pay to do a service for me. This is only the second time I’ve canceled in a year.    

I understand that she is running a business, but if she doesn’t want people to cancel they day before, shouldn’t she send out the schedule farther in advance. I don’t see why it’s incumbent on me to provide more notice than she provides. It’s a schedule and service based business, so I think they need to have flexibility. It honestly kind of ticked me off, so I’m thinking about cancelling all together and finding a different cleaning service.   

I just don’t want to be overreacting. English is not this woman’s first language, so perhaps the tone was a little lost in translation?

300,Not the A-hole,"About once a week I run speed intervals for training. There aren't any running tracks near my house but about 1km away there is a quiet residential road which is flat, quiet, and almost exactly 400m long (the same length as a track). At the end of the road is a small local parish church. 

&#x200B;

When I'm training intervals I usually jog the 1km to the road to warm up, stop and do some dynamic stretching, and then start my intervals (normally 400 or 800m long). In-between intervals I have short recovery sessions, where I'll sometimes jog slowly, walk, or stretch.

&#x200B;

The other day I was doing some stretching between reps on the bench at the end of the road, which is opposite the church. The weather recently has been fairly warm, but very grey and wet, so I was wearing a lightweight long-sleeve top to keep the worst of the rain off, and spandex running shorts (something like [this](https://www.nike.com/gb/t/fast-running-shorts-2c26G6)) because I figured I would be too hot in leggings. An older woman came up to me and told me that I was being very disrespectful for lingering and stretching in such small shorts outside a church, especially as there were also a lot of primary schools in the area. I apologised and moved onto another street to finish my intervals and stretching, but it wasn't really an ideal place to do speed sets because it's a lot busier and I often end up having to stop for cars during the intervals. 

&#x200B;

So was I being disrespectful? I wasn't raised Christian and I don't want to upset people who are if what I was doing really was offensive. I would never do it on a Sunday morning when people are going into/coming out of a service, but this was around 3pm on a Monday afternoon and it seemed to be closed. Also as a Jew, I would feel perfectly comfortable doing the same outside a synagogue as long as it wasn't on a Saturday morning/holiday. I also wasn't deliberately trying to appear provocative at all, I was just doing some calf stretches ([like this](https://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/articles/322/322809/calf-wall-stretch.jpg)) because my calf/achilles were giving me a bit of bother.

I am giving the rights to the clinic he owned (I don’t need it, I am in IT) to my mother who still practices there with my dad’s wife/stepmom (they are both on good terms, by the way, despite the divorce). What happens to the two cars he owned is yet to be concluded (I don’t and won’t need to drive).

After the funeral my mom tells me my big sister came to the clinic and started claiming the place as her own lot to sell. She is also planning to sue the stepmom as a fraud that doesn’t have the rights to anything (she was a civil wife and never had a flashy wedding or anything, but we lived in harmony together for more than 10 years) as well as contesting the will my dad made in 1997 which stated that the apartment would go to either my mom or me, saying “it isn’t properly filed in the database” and “has poor print quality.” Both this and heritage proceedings are due to October.

This is so sickening for me to hear, might be fucking me even harder than my dad’s death. I want to talk to my big sister but my mom and our lawyer tell me not to speak to her at all at any cost. They tell me that she wants to take my apartment away from me too. We want to contest her heritage rights seeing as she was never living with my father (he told me a cautionary tale about not cheapening on contraceptives revealing that my big sister is literally a result of a drunk sex at a party with a random broad; mom revealed he was never in good terms with her mother and they both were guilt tripping him into giving their share of his paycheck for decades) and is acting like a complete cunt to my family.

304,Not the A-hole,"My (15m) little cousins (9 and 12) were visiting us last weekend, and they are hyper. Like, extremely hyper. They unfortunately are also seemingly addicted to Fortnite. They were here from Thursday of last week until yesterday.


On thursday, when my cousins and their parents came I was watching something, I can't even remember at this point, and literally within 10 minutes of arriving at our house, my cousins started jumping on me to stop watching TV so they could play Fortnite. Since it wasn't anything important I was like ""whatever"" and went away to read. However, last weekend being the Canadian Grand Prix (and me being a pretty involved Formula One fan) there were some times that I really wanted to watch. Because I live in Ohio, this is one of the only GP weekends where I can just watch regularly during the day instead of like changing my sleep schedule a bit (the other ones being Mexico USA and Brazil) So Thursday afternoon, I created a tv schedule of what times specifically I wanted for the TV plus a little bit of time on both ends for some commentary or whatever which is essentially an hour and a half Friday morning and afternoon, some time Saturday morning and Saturday afternoon, and of course the race on Sunday. 

I printed this schedule and my aunt goes absurd and starts complaining that I’m robbing her children of enjoyment. However, I know for a fact that if uncontrolled these crotch goblins will play fortnite for hours and hours on end, and besides, literally everything in f1 is either in the morning or around 2-3pm ish which isn’t exactly prime time for small children playing fortnite. Who plays fortnite at 10am?! Literally it’s just those times and I could care less who is watching what any other time

So anyways this boils down to my mom defending me against her sister, obv she knows I watch every race weekend if I can and that in the end it’s my TV (it’s in my room, I saved up and bought it myself) and that if they really wanted to play fortnite while im watching they could like take my Xbox downstairs or whatever

Aunt and cousins think we’re a bunch of idiots and assholes who support “global pollution” over children’s happiness (which honestly is kinda BS, the hybrid v6 on f1 cars are achieving somewhere between 50-60% thermal efficiency, most combustion cats get around 20 or so.)

AITA? (AWTA; are we the assholes? Is that a thing?)

TLDR: me watch fast car zoom zoom always. Small kid want play fortnite. Me no let play when me watch fast car zoom zoom. Small kid mom think me asshole.

EDIT (for clarification): there are two TVs in our house however the one in my room that I bought myself is a pretty significant upgrade over the one in the living room due to the fact that I’m pretty much the only one who watches anything on TV at all. My Xbox is connected to this TV with a pretty intricate system of zip ties and cable management. The downstairs tv is hooked up to satellite but mine is hooked up to cable because espn.

EDIT 2: my cousins took to the schedule just fine, if a bit complaining in the beginning, but they played for a bit and then got tired so they understood boundaries. The 12 year old actually watched some of the race with me and the small one read a book. This story is mainly just about the aunt who was complaining while the kids literally couldn’t care less.",374,4054,0.94

307,Asshole,"So last year my mom turned 60 and my sister asked my brother and I if we should not gift her a little family vacation with us three kids, our partners and our children (my niece from my sister and my son), since earlier that year our father died and my mom could do with a little family time. So we both agreed and planned the vacation more than half a year in advance (time and location-wise). The trip was planned to last four days. 

So one week before the trip I call my sister to make last arrangements and she tells me that she, her husband and my niece will leave one day early (saturday around 2 pm) instead of sunday around noon so that my niece could go to sleepover party. After the phone call I talked to my boyfriend about it, telling him that I felt disappointed that they want to leave early, especially since it was my sisters idea to do the trip in the first place and we planned it long in advance. 

I might add, at this point, that I was never a big ""family person"", my family is quite big and I never really enjoyed spending time with them. I don't hate them, but I don't really love them either. Although I get along ok with my siblings, we still get on each others nerves much more easily then with friends. This is why I was never super excited to do this vacation in the first place but agreed because it is a nice thing for my mom.

So to come back to the point, my boyfriend agreed that it was kind of disappointing that they wanted to leave early, especially for such a (seemingly) minor reason as a sleepover. So we formulated a text (trying to be as polite as possible), saying we found it regrettable that they leave early, that we did not understand why a sleepover is so important that you have to cut long made plans short and asked if it maybe would be a possibility to drive her to a trainstation where she could take a train for 40 minutes (she is 9 y/o) and be met at the trainstation by a friend to be picked up so that my sister and husband could stay for the whole trip. She replied that she could understand that we felt this way and it was within our rights to say so but they would still leave early. 

Fast forward to our trip, some other issues arose and we (my sister and I) had a fight the first day of the trip, where she disclosed that she was very mad at me for my ""passive agressive"" text and started crying that the party was very special to my niece because a recent session with the school counselor revealed that my niece had almost no friends and the sleepover was with her one very good from kindergarden that she did not see very often because they since moved to another part of town. All of this was total news to me. She then revealed that she told my mother, brother and his girlfriend the whole story and they therefore never had a problem with them leaving early. Had I known this beforehand, I might have reacted differently, but my sister and her husband insisted that IATA here. So what do you think?",99,125,0.92

He's rich, mostly from his business, and also from being a member of parliament in our country, so he's really popular among his peers, as well, known to building schools and stuff. Fuck, they call him the 'father of orphans' in the regional language, because of his unbridled philanthropy.

This isn't helping my case at all, lol.

My dad houses upwards to ten random people in our house. It's a two-story house with four bedrooms, and two living rooms, yet it feels so damned cramped. Every time I return from boarding school, I always have to share my room with two other grannies whom I have never, ever seen in my life. When I confront my mother about this, I'm shamed for daring to maintain that I have a right to my OWN living space. She called me 'westernized' because I don't appreciate my family (I do not know these people) enough.

Fuck, one time, they gave me a mattress and had me sleeping ON THE LIVING ROOM WITH NO MOSQUITO NET. I could barely even sleep because of all the whining, and my skin was infested with bites when I woke up. They don't give a single shit at all about that. It's not *his* room that's being invaded. It's mine and my siblings'. 

These also aren't homeless people. They all have houses of their own. They come in completely shamelessly and demand a space. My dad just accepts it and gives me a mattress and tell them to sleep on *my* bed. When my dad*doesn't* feel up for giving them space, he fucking *avoids* them because he's too spineless to confront them about this bullshit. They are rude as hell, too, and sometimes bring their *kids*, who always fuck with my stuff.

Edit: INFO: These are extended family members, in case the title wasn't clear enough. I just have absolutely *no* idea who they are.

This led to her getting mad and assuming I only meant America. I clarified no I agree other countries have done plenty of messed up stuff throughout time I’m just saying I never knew America did some of this stuff. 

I would then go on to say that I wish instead of teaching history at first like war was uncommon and far more peaceful sounding then switching to showing more brutal sides of history when people are older, that they would start out showing history is brutal, even if it is kid friendly.

312,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons as my wife uses Reddit but not this sub.

I know how that title sounds but please bear with me for a minute.

My wife(32f) and I(33m) have been together for 10 years in October and married for 6 of those years. She comes from a... broken home to say the least. Her mother was a drunken alcoholic and her dad was never there, she has one brother and he's a junkie as well. Her life growing up was not easy and I will always respect her for rising above all of that and persevering through it all.

Now onto my problem. My wife has an issue with *any* substance that can get you high or drunk and understandably so. She made this clear after about 2 years of us dating when she told me about her family. Now this I have no issue with, I asked her if me having a few beers socially would be an issue and she said no.

Cut to the last few years and her anger to booze has become *much* more apparent. She claims my drinking 2 beers after working a stressful day makes me an alcoholic. Now if I was drinking every day she may have a point but I have maybe 3 beers a week at most and *maybe* once a month I may go to my buddy's place and play overwatch and have a few more. I don't get drunk by any stretch at my friend's place but just a good buzz and uber home. I have only ever been legitimately drunk 3 times in our relationship, NONE of which she was around for and only ever heard second hand. I like to think I'm respectful about it; I keep my beer in the minifridge in the basement, I don't drink in front of her and at her request I don't talk to her at all when I have those few beers on a friday.

I have in the past quit drinking because she asked me to. Last time I quit for 2 years just because. Quitting is never an issue for me but her badgering me and claiming I'm an alcoholic *all the time* finally caused me to snap at her and tell her that just because her mother was an alcoholic doesn't mean I am. I told her that her extreme hatred for it is causing more issues for me than anything else in my life at this moment. She will literally go from the most sweet person to a completely passive aggresive person in one second when she realizes I bought a 6 pack for the next 2 weeks. The obvious answer is to just quit which would be fine but sometimes I just like to unwind after work you know? I don't get trashed on a regular and I don't let alcohol get in the way of my life so I'm at a loss. If she said ""it's me or the booze"" then I would 100% pick her but my issue is that her problem with alcohol isn't rational and it's not *me* she has an issue with but instead her issues with her mother.

We go out enough and we both hang around with people who drink and she has no issue with them so here I am wondering if I'm an asshole. I feel after a few years of her yelling at me I was justified in getting a bit upset but her friends are calling me an asshole.",1551,9679,0.95

Now i know for a fact this is all bullshit, if he really went 23-0 as a pro boxer surely something would show up when i google his name right. 

Anyway im 19 and have been training muay thai for 8 years (still am), and wrestled in high school, i am very fit and am very proud of my progress in martial arts and fitness considering i too was once a tub of lard. 

I rarely hang out with him outside of work becuase he never shuts up about this shit, and other lies including ""i could have graduated cullinary school with high honors but i got kicked out for fighting"" and ""i know high profile gangbangers who make millions a year, thats why i work in this resturant, for fun, not becuase i need too"". But for some reason we were hanging out, having a few beers watching UFC last weekend and he said ""i could KO both these bums, no challenge"" (he said this during the blagoy ivanov vs tai tuivasa fight).

So i snapped, and said back ""man i fucking doubt you could even kick my ass and im 19, and half your weight, stop lying about this boxing bullshit, nothing even shows up when you google your name, and if you really wanna take up that challenge come down to my muay thai gym and try, i would maul you""

He got all pissy and walked out, and i told all my coworkers about it. The majority of them think im an asshole, although a few agree with me.

315,Not the A-hole,"I’m new so I apologize if I’m doing this wrong but I need some outside perspective. My MIL (65) wants to move into my (33m) and my wife’s (34f) house with our two young children (6&1). I absolutely refuse to let this happen, basically giving my wife an ultimatum of “if she moves in, I’m moving out.”

Some background: my family (me, wife, daughter) rented a house with MIL for about a year, splitting rent mostly so my wife and I could try to save enough away for a down payment on a home of our own. This arrangement lasted roughly a year, and everyone, including MIL, was miserable. We didn’t “respect” her because we weren’t clean enough for her liking, she would constantly pick fights with my wife, manipulate her, and emotionally abuse her. And told my daughter some weird stuff that I felt like I was constantly doing damage control for. She largely ignored me.

More background on MIL: she’s been married and divorced 4 times, has no friends that any of us know of, and has alienated what little family she has left. She’s had approximately 30 jobs in her life, which is as close a guess as my wife could give me because she honestly can’t remember all of them. She’s currently unemployed, has exhausted her benefits, and seems to have no interest in doing jobs she deems “beneath” her. (She quit her last job at a clothing store because she “didn’t like it” and “had to be on my feet all day.”) Also, after my wife and I moved out and into our home, MIL insisted on getting a 2bd apt despite never having guests or even enough stuff to fill it.

One more illustration of what MIL is like: my wife’s aunt and uncle helped raise her and treat her like she’s their daughter. When my daughter was born I made the executive decision that our kids would call them Grandma and Grandpa. MIL HATES this, and recently told my daughter”you know, she isn’t REALLY your grandma...”

On the other side, we DO have room in the house. Not for all of her stuff, but we have an extra bedroom. I’d hoped to turn it into an office one day, but here we are. I’d be willing to let her stay for a short time while she “figures something out,” but we all know if she moves in, she’s never leaving. Laying claim to that basement room is her endgame/retirement plan.

But even after all of that, my wife loves her mother, and would be devastated if her mom ended up homeless. She (only child) doesn’t WANT her mom to move in but feels guilty and responsible and like she should be able to DO something. I’ve told her that her mother’s own actions and decisions over a lifetime have put her in her current position. But I know that’s still hard to hear.

tl;dr - my MIL is on the verge of eviction with absolutely no money, no family, and no resources to turn to besides my wife. MIL believes we are obligated to take her in indefinitely, despite the damage I am certain it will cause to everyone in my family to have her around 24/7.

So, my best friend. Let’s call her Mary. We’ve been friends for over a decade and we get along great. Like any friends, we have disagreements but we can tell each other anything. We’ve always been there for each other through painful breakups, bad grades on tests, big accomplishments, everything.

Mary recently got married and obviously I was thrilled for her. Now since high school at least, we’d always talk about getting married, being in each other’s bridal parties, etc. Obviously this is not a legally binding contract but things like that mean a lot to people, at least they did to me.

So several months before the wedding we’re hanging out and she breaks the news to me that they’ve decided to keep the bridal party family-only. Was I upset? Yeah, obviously, but hey, I can understand keeping things small. Then I find out that this family-only parry includes her fiancé’s brother’s girlfriend. Yeah, girlfriend. Not wife or even fiancée, girlfriend. I was blindsided and hurt, because to me, that’s NOT family. Mary and I might not share blood but in every other way we are sisters. I couldn’t believe she would do this to me. I know that being a bridesmaid might not be a big deal to everyone, but to me this felt like a complete betrayal of our friendship.

I told Mary I needed space and  she said she understood. We didn’t talk for a few months, the longest ever, but eventually I decided I didn’t want to lose our friendship over this. She knows more about me than probably anyone else in the world and I love her. So we made up and I went to the wedding. Honestly it was pretty painful for me to be there because I felt like an outsider rather than a best friend. But I made it through the night without bashing her husband’s brother’s girlfriend’s head in so hey, I’ll call that a win.

All was well, or not. I’ve noticed lately I’ve been rather petty in my stupid revenge. I’ll cancel plans last minute for no real reason, let the phone ring through to voicemail, leave texts on read, etc. We live quite far apart (as in several hours) so this can be a pretty big inconvenience as it’s no day trip. And yeah, like I said, I know this is all totally stupid, totally juvenile revenge. But it turns out I’m still hurt and angry and I don’t know what else to do. I tried talking to her about this before but I’ve always known she was someone who has “misters before sisters” priorities. I suspect it was his choice to do this for the bridal party for reasons I won’t get into, which is why I know if I talk to her about it she’ll just get defensive.

My wife has been vegetarian-ish as long as I've known her (ten years), but last fall she made the leap to full vegan. I was (and am) very supportive of her not eating meat before the change and have been very supportive of her since then.

We have three kids aged 7 to 1. My wife and I agreed that, while veganism is the right way for ethically conscious adults, it currently does not meet the nutritional needs of growing children in the same way an omnivorous diet does. We've seen the horror stories of children and pets starving and dying at the hands of vegan parents and are staying far from that. Our agreement means our kids eat a regular omni diet and my wife doesn't have to prepare any meat. Simple.

My middle kid will be five next week and my wife is spearheading the whole event. Today she started trying out cake recipes. I'm usually the taster and provide feedback as honestly as I can. Tonight there was a cake cooling and she told me she'd let me try it as soon as it cooled and she'd made frosting.

I tried the cake. It was off. I was confused for a moment, then it hit me.

Me - ""Did you adapt this recipe to make it vegan?"" 

Her - ""Yeah I figured I needed to start now if I wanted to have something workable by the party.""

I put the cake down. ""Why are you making a vegan cake? None of the children are vegan.""

She became defensive. ""I wanted to make sure there were options, I don't know what everybody's diet is like.""

Me - ""Are you making a non-vegan cake?"" 

Her - ""No I just wanted to make something everybody could eat."" 

Me - ""You're the only vegan who will be at the party."" 

Her - ""You don't know that, other parents could be too."" 

Me - ""But none of the kids are."" 

Her - ""So what? I'm going to be at the party too."" 

Me - ""Right, but it's not your party and you're not a guest. You forcing everybody to eat vegan when it's not your birthday is extremely selfish.""

This turned into a fight. I'm an asshole, she's disconnected and selfish. She refuses to see how her refusing to make anything not vegan for our child's birthday isn't insane. Finally she told me that I should make the fucking cake and stormed out of the room and refuses to talk to me. She's set up shop in the guest room and I'm sleeping alone tonight.

I'll admit to saying petty shit as she walked away. ""Can you even hear yourself? ""Hey kids, the only cake is vegan, there are no alternatives. I'm not forcing veganism on you, but if you don't choose the vegan option then you get nothing. Happy birthday son.""""

I will make the cake, I don't have a problem with that. I'm not half as talented but I've done it before and I'll do my best. My son is starting kindergarten in the fall, I know he's nervous and I want him to feel confident and excited with all his friends around him.

AITA for telling my wife she's selfish for refusing to make our son a non-vegan birthday cake?

Edit: Seeing all of the responses to this post has made me take a hard look at my position. I still think it's dumb that she is refusing to consider a non-vegan cake, but all year our kids have gone to birthday parties and she's had to stand quietly aside, eating nothing, having no cake. I understand how ostracized she has felt and she just wants to be included. I'm going to apologize to her and help her make the best vegan cake as best I can. I'll make a non-vegan to go with it, it won't be good but it'll be there. I love my wife and this isn't the hill I want to die on.

327,Not the A-hole,"I’m conflicted. A totally random dude from a different state requested me on insta. It was his personal page and a private profile. His picture was with his pregnant wife and his caption was #father #husband. I accepted his request out of curiosity and requested a follow back. He accepted right away so I checked out his profile. Normal dude - tons of pics celebrating his new son and loving tributes to his wife. Then this happens:

I get another request from a brand new account that looks EXACTLY LIKE this guy. He DMs me telling me I’m beautiful and sends topless pics. I refer back to the other Instagram to make sure it’s the same dude (cuz wtf?) and confirm the tattoos are the same. Apparently he’s really dumb bc I ask him if his wife would like him sending me crude pics and he plays dumb. I then proceed to send him a pic of HER insta account with a pic of him in it. He then begs me not to say anything to her. I’ll spare you the details but by that point he had already sent me dick pics (and a video with his face in it). I wanted to see how far he would go, and he went there.

I proceeded to block him but I really feel weird now. His wife probably has no idea that she has a shitty ass husband. Her instagram is allll about him and says how perfect he is. But I feel like it’s not my place to shake things up for them. If he keeps being dumb, which he seems awfully good at, she will find out soon enough. Right? Otherwise, I have plentiful screenshots to send her which should give her enough info to determine her husband is out to cheat on her (or already is).

This is my first time posting here, apologies if this belonged more in r/relationships.

My girlfriend was over hanging out Sunday night. I live in a predominantly black neighborhood, we're both white, and my neighbors were having a small cookout. We were having a lovely night, when she tells me she's going to say something ""off-color"" and proceeds to say ""there's nothing like a Sunday night N\*\*\*\*\* Party"" about their cookout. Uncensored, full N-word right out there on the porch.  I  was visibly upset. She seemed to understand she had crossed a line but tried to justify it that she's from the South. I told her I was mortified that she'd say something like that but attempted to put it aside until I could think about things. I probably should have had a conversation right there about it, but it was an otherwise lovely evening and I am not good with that sort of direct conflict without having time to think.

&#x200B;

The incident was definitely bothering me today and I could tell my distance was noticeable so I let her know as clearly as I could why I was upset, that I don't like that sort of talk or belief, that I don't think our living in the South makes that ok, and that I wanted to sit down and talk it over in person. She responded that it wasn't a tasteful joke but accused me of judging her too harshly for it; said I was unfairly accusing her of being a racist rather than accepting her sense of humor, but said she was genuinely regretting having said it.  She then told me I'm not the one who deserves the apology for the comment so she wasn't going to apologize to me.

&#x200B;

Further messages from her have been about how she's a caring person who loves everyone equally, that she's gotten validation from people who know her better than I do that she's not a racist, that I'm in the wrong for ""calling her a racist""(which I didn't directly do), that she doesn't know why I'm taking it so personally, and that it's up to me to do some soul-searching and figure out why this really has me so upset, because she doesn't know what more I want.

What I want is my girlfriend to understand why saying ""it's a joke"" doesn't make saying racial slurs okay. From my point of view this all seems very clear as to why I would be upset, not just the comment itself but the response I got. I'm feeling gaslit by someone I deeply care about, but we all have blind spots, and I want to make sure I'm NTA here.

At an award ceremony for my middle schoolers for things like grades, perfect attendance, orchestra, sports. This school is in a city just outside a large Army base. The school is made up of probably 50/50 civilian/military kids. This is a huge Army base. In addition to Army, we have a very small number Navy and Air Force here as well. I myself am military (19 years Army).

The awards ceremony was going well, kids were being called up, pictures taken, people clapping. There was commotion backstage, curtains moving, and some confusion on the stage itself. The ceremony paused and then another kids name was called. This particular kid was called onstage, and instead of the principal handing him his award, an Air Force Captain handed him his award. The kid and this captain hugged and it was announced that, his dad had returned from a 6 month deployment a few weeks early, so that he could surprise his kid at this ceremony. This dad then grabbed his sons hand, held it up like a prize fighter and ref in a boxing match win. Lots of cheering from the crowd, standing ovation. After a pause, the other kids just got their name called and kept the line moving, lots of kids, little time. Not me though, I didn't stand or clap. After the ceremony, this particular Captain stood with his son by the auditorium exit doors talking to his family. He stood close enough to the doors that he would be noticed and congratulated and thanked by just about everyone passing by, but far enough away from the door that he didn't look like he was waiting for it. My wife congratulated him, thanked him for his service and scorned at me when I declined to do the same.

In the I was asked why I didn't shake his hand and congratulate him and his son. My answer was:

We have been deployed multiple times since 2001, it's not a big deal anymore.

I can't watch CNN or Fox news or any other news source without seeing some dad or mom jumping out of a box at their kids school or throwing a baseball out at their sons little league game or some ridiculous ""look at me stunt"" trying to get attention and I am sick and tired of it.

It was a 6 month deployment, AND it ended early for them.

There were over 100 kids at this event, each with their own story, why feel the need to steal their thunder.

These reunions aren't about the kid, it the service member making it about themselves.

There is no draft, it's a job, he volunteered, got paid, knew what he was getting into, it was less than 6 months, and came home uninjured. No different than any other job out there.

My wife has deemed me an asshole, she won't argue with any of my points in particular, but has deemed me an asshole in general over this. She says her friends and coworkers agree with her, but I think she is just saying that, doubt she asked them. I returned with ""I guarantee everyone at my work would agree with me""

342,Not the A-hole,"I live in an apartment complex near my college campus mostly populated by students. Since I have a job in the same city as my college I live here year round. Across the hall from me is a woman who moved in at the beginning of last school year but doesn't appear to be a student, she's much older (mid-late 30s), at first I thought she might be a grad student but I've never seen her on campus or with a backpack, books or anything that implies she attends school. I once talked to her in the laundry room, and noticed her clothes were mostly lingerie and skimpy dresses. Not that I cared but eventually I noticed that she has guys over ALL THE TIME, often older than her but also some college age guys. At one point I left my apartment briefly to see her saying goodbye to a middle aged guy, and when I came back a guy I think is a student was hanging out in front of her door and I heard her later let him in. I eventually put it all together and realized what she's likely doing...

I didn't care about it, but mentioned it at a study group for a group project in one of my classes a few months ago, (we were just rambling and also drinking.) One girl there got pretty angry and said I should call the police or at least apartment complex, she lives in the same one (but different building) and noted prostitution violates the lease. I told her I didn't care, I think prostitution should be legal anyway, she lectured me about human trafficking (no idea how that ties into this woman working solo) and how she might try to pick up clients amongst apartment residents (never has to me, and it's not my business anyway) and that it's just not appropriate for her to be doing this in this area. I still don't care.

She still ""lives"" there (I suspect it's not her actual residence, just one she uses for ""business"") and I haven't reported her. Is this wrong or a problem I don't care about her living there?",43,60,0.78
343,Not the A-hole,"Ok, let me set this straight, I live in an apartment complex, it's a small complex, where all the neighbors' kid's come over to one kid's house because he has an inflatable pool. Now that it's summer, I figured that it would be a good time to start growing my Venus fly trap, my potted pink azaleas, and a few water plants that were given to me as a gift when the old owners (who we know cause the old owner is my sister-in-law and brother) and a cilantro plants. 

Over the course of two weeks, I would come home to either a mess on my side of the porch, my plants knocked over, or a mess of chalk or paint (sometimes they play paintball, which is a pain to scrub off my door) now, I've talked to the parents of these kids before, I think they're ok people, we don't talk as much, considering it's me and my mom who lives here, and of course they said they will handle it. 

A week later (last week) I found my entire porch plants knocked over, and kicked over with water bottles on the table and my plant label scribbled over and broken. I talked to the parents again, and they said they will punish them. still nothing. then this morning, I found dirt treaded all over my porch on inspection day, and my collected rain water, tipped over as if it were nothing.

344,Not the A-hole,"I live in an apartment building in a bad area of my city. My neighbours live on the ground floor and had a camera that recorded the entrance to the building. I (18F) smoke in this area. It is allowed and my landlord is fine with it. So no problem there. 

However, the neighbours (One male and one female around 25+) placed a camera in their window that recorded this area. I am fine with it as a safety measure. I do not like them filming me when I am out there for over 10 minutes at a time. I began covering the camera in these instances. Personally I dont want to be recorded as there are people who I do not want knowing where I live.

I would go out place a piece of card over the camera, have a cigarette or a phone call and then remove the card when I went inside. 

A few weeks later I get violent knocking on my flat door. I open it to see what the issue is. Maybe my TV is too loud. Maybe someone had an accident and needed some help. No the woman from the flat proceeds to scream in my face. Saying things like ""why are you covering the camera its shady"" ""we have it for our protection"" ""you must be selling drugs"" that kind of thing. I calmly respond explaining I do not wish to be filmed and when it is covered I am there so if someone tried anything to enter the building I would be a witness. She became exceedingly more aggressive and demanded to know why I dont want to be filmed. I replied that it made me feel (insert noise that represents being creeped out). She then mocked me whilst her boyfriend stood behind her. 

I told her I also smoke out there and would rather not be recorded doing the bad habit. The bf pipes up saying that they have issues with that. When I ask what the issues are he goes quiet. 

When I smoke I dont do it near windows and I clean up the cigarette butts. There should be no issue. 

The woman's mood suddenly flips and is okay with everything and then leaves. 

Personally I think the security reason is a lie as they once let an unknown man into the building who broke into my friends apartment and would not leave. My friend was pregnant at the time and it took hours for us to remove him. But that is a very confusing story for a different time. 

So am I the arsehole for covering my neighbours camera when I was outside. 

TL;DR I covered my neighbours camera when it would film me and they proceeded to confront me aggressively and accuse me of being a drug dealer

345,No A-holes here,"TLDR at the bottom.

&#x200B;

I am adopted. My biological mother passed away from brain cancer in 2011. I found out from my biological father via snail mail. This caused my biological father and I to begin keeping in touch.

&#x200B;

My biological father ended up finding another wonderful woman who unfortunately passed away in January this year also from cancer (different kind). They were together for several years, and she lived with him. He was obviously grief stricken from this loss and I can only imagine the way it must feel to go through that pain twice.

&#x200B;

Since then, communication with my biological father has slowed (understandably). However I haven't heard from him since April and we usually talk at least once a month.I've texted him a few times and haven't gotten any responses. I had my best friend try to call him (I was too scared that the phone would have been disconnected and i would have my answer. I didn't want to hear it myself.) and it went to voicemail. So the phone has not been disconnected.

&#x200B;

Also worth noting, my biological dad LOVES greeting cards, and sends me one for Christmas and my birthday, and has done this for YEARS. My birthday recently happened (end of May), and I did not receive a card.

&#x200B;

I am my biological father's only child and I fear the worst especially after he experienced such a loss earlier this year. He wasn't really in good health, and is in his 70's, and lives alone. He lives in another state, so simply checking in on him myself isn't an option. I have no idea about any of his friends or anyone else I could call to check in on him. I think I really might be the only person he has.

&#x200B;

However, I am really distraught as to whether or not calling the cops to do a wellness check would be overstepping any boundaries. But I also feel that this might be the only way for me to find out whether or not he is still alive.

&#x200B;

I have done some googling to see if I could find any obituaries or news stories that may lend some info into whether or not he's alive, but I was unable to find any such information. So if he has passed there's no obituary.

&#x200B;

TLDR: My biological father lives in a different state, isn't in very good health, lives alone, is in his 70's, and experienced a loss this year. Him and I are not very close, but keep in touch at least once a month. I haven't heard from him since April.

She said ""No, it's my car."" In a snarky tone. I decided after about 2 songs later it was a good time to mention I was going to give her 0 stars for semi-forcing me to listen to Christian music. and she said ""Really? You're going to rate me based off of my music taste?"". The rest of the FIFTEEN minute ride was silent (Well, aside from the fucking GOD IS GOOD SHOVE GOD DOWN YOUR THROAT OR GO TO HELL music playing in the background).

347,Not the A-hole,"TLDR: I didn’t want a 5 year old girl to push my dog’s patience and cause her to get bit. In response, my brother got angry with me.

I (17) have a toy poodle mix named Fluffy (4). She’s 13 pounds with her current amount of fluff. People always tend to comment that she looks like a teddy bear and she is indeed a very sweet girl. 

There’s a Little girl (LG). no older than 5 in my neighborhood that always rushes to me whenever I take Fluffy on a walk. She’s well intentioned but is always very pushy with Fluffy. Trying to grab her leash, pick her up no matter what she’s doing, and touching her paws, tummy, ears, etc. She usually complains if Fluffy has to go inside and doesn’t take no for an answer often. She’s not spoiled, just a kid that doesn’t know how to control her emotions yet. I always make sure to explain to her how to be safe around dogs because one day she may encounter one that may put her in danger. Of course she’s only 5 and I understand that it’s always my responsibility that my dog doesn’t hurt anyone.

Flash to just now and my younger (15) brother comes inside from playing outside, saying that he needs Fluffy. LG is outside crying and says that she needs Fluffy to console her. I advise my brother against this because she will most likely milk the situation and my brother just can’t say no. 

Fluffy is extremely patient with young kids but she doesn’t like them. Her reaction is usually to go hide somewhere but she does understand when to behave. Of course this is dangerous because kids tend to corner her and this would obviously cause any dog to freak out. My fear is that LG will push Fluffy too much and cause her to bite or in the least scare the girl by barking in her face.

I say “she’s my dog and if anything happens the responsibility is on me no matter what”.
In the end my brother gets his way because my mom allows it. He comes back inside with Fluffy and says “since she’s your dog i’m not doing anything for her”. Fluffy didn’t bite her (I don’t think) but it’s still something that could’ve happened.

I totally understand his reasoning but I don’t think it’s fair that he gets like that every time I try to put a boundary down about Fluffy. I do understand she is indeed my responsibility always.

AITA for not wanting the girl to potentially get too pushy, causing Fluffy to lose patience and potentially bite her?

edit: [Plup in question ](https://imgur.com/a/2L3GZKo)  yes that’s her full name. The V stands for my surname

He thinks this is an asshole move as my sister deserves to know what she is eating, I should apologise to her because I made her go against her own principles and values, and should promise to her to always check my ingredients better for her, so she'll know she can't fully trust the food I make and can do her own checks on everything.

I think it would be a bad idea to tell her even if it's just to apologise.

I don’t want kids, my partner does. It wasn’t a consideration when we both got together because we were super young. 16 to be exact. 

He always told me that “not having kids is no big deal with him,” and “he’s fine with that,” and “he never wanted kids anyway,” but I think I was kidding myself by believing that. 

He loves kids. When he was in high-school, he use to babysit for our entire neighborhood. He was awesome with them, and everyone trusted him. Even with the babies. When one of our friends got pregnant, he was happy and smiling for a full on week. He always wanted updates. Said he would help with anything. All our neighbors kids love him. He worked at daycares during college. He’s a cook now, but he said he would have loved to be a teacher. He was a huge help in raising his siblings. He has more of a parent-caretaker relationship with them than a sibling one. 

So, yeah, I’m kidding myself when I believed his nonsense about not wanting kids. So, we got drunk one night and I asked him why he always says he doesn’t want kids even though he seems to love them. He was basically like, “because I get to be with you. I’m fine with giving that up, even though it really sucks. I know you’ve never wanted kids.” 

And I don’t. I’ve never particular liked kids. At least not enough to put my job and life on hold. I definitely don’t want to be the host of one. But knowing that he’s giving up something he clearly wants a lot to be with me hurts. 

I’ll never want to be the host of a child, but something like a surrogate is an option. But I’d straight up not want to have to change diapers or wake up in the middle of the night. I’m about to be a doctor, and I definitely don’t want this to impact my career at all. I’m such a bad person. I just had other things I would rather do than have kids, but I feel BAD he clearly wants them so bad. I would love my kid so much. I didn’t want to have them because of all the effort involved so...

WIBTA if I said he could have a kid, but I don’t want to be involved in doing the heavy lifting? 

The thing is I like kids, I just don’t want to put in all the effort. If he’s willing to do that, fine. I don’t want it to impact my career. 

I like looking after kids for an evening, and I find it to be fun, but I also enjoy sending them home and not having to deal with the diapers, etc myself.... 

Is this a terrible idea? Am I being a total asshole right now? I thought I’d send this to reddit before bringing anything up with him. 

I sound like some of those shit dads that’s never cleaned a diaper and just gets their SO to do everything even though the kids is theirs too... Is that me? Yikes then I’m a total asshole, right?",167,181,0.81
366,Not the A-hole,"I was partying on Saturday night with my friends, when I bumped into my sister and her friends. I’m pretty cool with my sis, and a lot of her friend group bleeds into mine cuz we’re only a year apart. I met this absolutely gorgeous girl who was with them & who was immediately flirty, touchy, kept asking me to buy her drinks. We hit it off and spent A LOT of time dancing together, drinking, etc. 

As the night progressed I got drunker and drunker, but I guess my brain went into paranoid mode and I couldn’t really enjoy my time with this chick because I kept noticing she kept trying to ‘offer’ to buy our drinks by taking my wallet up to the bar, kept yelling ‘bro, pass me your phone I wanna take pictures outside’ and stuff like that. I kinda disconnected from her and went to sit with my bros and sober up. 

After around an hour she told me she was heading up to go home and asked if I’d walk her out to her Uber. I said hell no girl, you’re grown, go yourself. She started cussing me out and calling me a pussy, then left. My friends witnessed this and told me to stay where I was and not to engage with her cuz I was yelling stuff back but I really did get the vibe she was trying to either steal shit from me or set me up to be jumped. 

The next day my sister called me in the afternoon telling me the girl had left a SHIT TONNE of messages in their group chat saying there were some sketchy guys who were freaking her out and all she wanted was someone big to walk her to her Uber but I’m a waste of muscle and space apparently and a giant ass pussy. Some of her friends were basically shit talking me because allegedly she’s ‘a really sweet girl’ and my sister and her friends had to shut them down but the consensus is I should have at least walked her outside. 

I told my stepdad this story via text cuz I’m close with him and he also agrees it was an asshole move for me to not walk her out. He also called me a monk lmao.",85,81,0.92
367,Asshole,"In March, we moved ~20 miles from the school district our kids (M17, F12 and F10) have attended their entire school career. I knew it would take time for them to adjust, so we decided to let them finish out this school year (which ends Thursday) at their current schools.

We are spending a considerable amount of gas and time shuffling three kids back and forth every day, especially since they all have different start/release times (one is in elementary, one is in middle school, and one is in high school).

My son (understandably) balked at the thought of not graduating with the class of kids he'd gone through school with. I get that. I'd be upset too! So my husband and I made him a deal. If he got a part time job and his driver's license, we would provide him with a car he could use to get himself back and forth to his preferred school. We would pay insurance; all he'd be responsible for would be gas.

He has yet to get a job, even though our neighbor set him up with a shoo-in interview. (He blew it off to go camping.) Ditto on the driver's license -- he needs 100 hours of driving practice before he can take the test, and he hasn't even started. But every time I mention anything about making progress toward our deal, he just says he's ""working on it.""

I can put myself in his shoes and see just how much it would suck to have to change schools right before the finish line. But he's made no progress and the deadline to submit the application to allow him to stay at his current school is next Monday. He knows this. He's begging me to sign the application now and promises he'll have it figured out by September. WIBTA if I tell him ""too little, too late?""

Edit, since people are asking: This wasn't a planned move (landlord sold our rental of 8+ years and our area is in a housing crisis. We're paying $350/mo. more so the kids are semi-close to their friends.) Also, he did know that we expected him to have a job/a line on a job/put in SOME SORT of effort BEFORE the deadline to submit the app to stay at his current school.",209,304,0.94

He told me the move date. I checked with my wife. She said there was a festival that afternoon she wanted to attend. So I told my friend I could help in the morning but I needed to be back home in the afternoon.

Fast forward a few weeks. A week or 10 days before the move date. We get an invitation in the mail for my wife's cousin's kid's 1st birthday party. It's the same day as the move (party in the late morning/early afternoon). I tell my wife I can't make it. I already told my friend I'd help him move that day. There's no way I can be done in time to make the party, and even if I could, I'd be dirty and sweaty from moving.

Wife says I should cancel on my friend because family events are more important and we should all go together.

I said I'm not cancelling on my best friend and leaving him in a lurch. If we had known about the party in advance, I wouldn't have agreed to help my friend that morning. But we didn't know. And when I made plans to help, we had no conflicts. Now the Uhaul is booked and the move date is firm.

The day came and went. I helped my friend move. Wife went to the party alone with our son. We both came home and we went to the festival in the afternoon as planned.

373,Not the A-hole,"Tried to post this yesterday but apparently it was too long so I'll try to be more brief.

This happened last year but I am still dealing with the fallout and haven't spoken to my niece and her family since the incident.

Last year my nice invited me to her high school graduation and when I arrived at her home, I ran into my father who had I not seen for 3 years prior. No one had bothered to tell me he had been invited and I left in shock and dismay. I did not cause a scene, I simply bolted when I saw him. About an hour later, I texted one of my nieces to ask why no one had bothered to tell me he was coming and she claimed she did not know. Well, clearly someone invited him.

My backstory with my father is complicated to say the least. He was a class A asshole my entire life. Left my mom pregnant with me and one with a 2 year old to care for (my brother and father of my nieces). Told my mom to abort me and that he would never have anything to do with me if I were to be born. Treated me like I was invisible and worthless every time I was forced to see him growing up. Gave my mom half the amount of child support for me that he gave to my brother.  Told his whole extended family that I was not his kid and made up an elaborate lie about who my real father is (unfortunately it's just not true and this douche is my dad), causing them to treat me like a second class citizen my whole life.

As an adult, I have seen him 3 times in the last 20 years. None of these times was pleasant. In 2015, I called to let him know my mom had died and he proceeded to say horrible things about her and then repeat his same old lie about me not being his kid. In a text, I later told him off with a lifetime's worth of built up resentment. He never acknowledged a word I said and then sent me some bullshit group text that he sent various other people about wishing me a ""blessed"" holiday season because he's a ""Christian"". LOL

None of this is a secret in my family and my nieces and both their parents are all well aware of all of this history. The next day after the graduation, I texted my niece who had graduated and simply asked her to let me know if she planned to invite him to future events because it was really upsetting for me to have to be around him. She got super defensive and angry and told me I was making \*\*her\*\* day about myself and that she would rather I not come at all if I was going to cause ""drama"".

I spent all holidays alone in 2018 as a result. These people are the only family I have left and not one of them ever reached out to apologize to me or even just to see how I am.

I feel like I was making a reasonable request here. I didn't tell her not to invite him. I simply asked for her to let me know if he was going to be invited so that I could make the choice not to attend if I wanted to. When I told this story to a ""friend"" of mine, she agreed that I was making my niece's day about myself and shouldn't have said anything at all.

&#x200B;

On Friday, my non verbal/ASD/severely disabled son eloped from his school. I, as his mother, was handling it the best way I could at the time. My parents, who live 1.5 hours away, were PISSED at how I handled the matter. They threatened to come down to my sons school and get him, since I ""cared more about my job than my son"". The ONLY reason I knew about this elopment was because my son's aide broke protocol and told me before the principal did. I wanted to wait, since I knew my son was safe, and see how long it took for the school to call me. 

&#x200B;

My parents had to then find out, they are NOT on any list for pick up/emergency or non. And then it came up, they are NOT in my will and will not get my son if both my husband and I died.

AITA here? They say its ""blood"" but I hate that saying. They were verbally/emotionally/mentally abusive growing up and I do NOT let them have my son because, well duh. My mother and sister have not spoken to me in days and today, while I was going to catch up a show I watch (admittedly on their direct tv - they DID give me permission), I realized ALL the passwords had been changed. I asked my father about it who then confirmed, he didn't trust me and what he decides to do or not do is none of my concern.

382,Not the A-hole,"This is trivial, but for some reason it's plaguing my mind and making me feel bad. 

This happened in Dead By Daylight, a game heavily reliant on stealth.

In my lobby on the opposite team there was a guy whose username was literally twitch.tv/(name) . Curious, I searched him up and found out that he was indeed streaming at the time. To me, this made very little sense, as he was broadcasting to the killer (Enemy Team) exactly where he was, even though the whole point of the game was to be stealthy. After seeing that he was actually streaming, I closed the tab and continued the game.

After completely annihilating this streamer and his team, I talked to them on the chat that appears after the game is over. I basically told them that it's a bad idea telling everyone you're streaming in a stealth game, as I could easily have just watched his stream and went ""oh, he's there. "" and killed him. He immediately assumed that that was what I did and accused me of admitting to stream sniping and reported me for doing so. He also mentioned that he could name himself whatever he wants and that it was easy advertising, which yeah he can and obviously it's advertising as I literally found him in seconds.

Afterwards, I talked to him a bit on his stream and he still accused me of stream sniping and told me off about how that's against the rules and I shouldn't have done it.

TLDR: Guy advertises that he's streaming while playing a stealth game. I warn him after the game is over that people could easily watch his stream and win the game easily. He accused me of doing exactly that even though I told him I didn't and reported and insulted me. Was I the bad guy here? All I wanted to do was help...",38,84,0.86

So little backstory. I (19m) come from a poor immigrant Korean family who didn't have much growing up.  We lived in a bad part of town, but my parents worked their asses off to put me in to private school. I faced a lot of racism from entitled rich western people who knew I was poor, and would make fun of my asian complexion, I was called chink and all the other bad stuff like zipperhead and what-not. The area I grew up around didn't recognize any asian race besides China, so whenever people misplace me in the wrong ethnic group, it brings back flashbacks of the past, and I get a little upset.

A couple of days ago, I came across some young lady, maybe about 17-18 working in a trendy clothing store, and I was just looking around. She was nice enough, and struck up a conversation. She asked me a lot of questions about my ethnicity, which I thought was strange, but answered with nonchalant subject changers because I wasn't comfortable sharing.

She proceeded to ask me what New Years Holidays are like. She said to me:

""Wow you guys are lucky that you get to celebrate our New Years, and your own.""

I asked her what she meant by that, and she said ""obviously chinese new years..?"" and gave me a look like I should know better.

I told her that I wasn't Chinese, and that I was korean. She laughed and said ""haha, sorry but no big deal right? It's like the same thing...""

I got upset and said it wasnt the same, I didn't yell but I went out of my way to tell her the long history and differences of our races.

She looked at me strangely and opened her eyes real wide and said ""okayyy"" and walked away.

385,Asshole,"Title doesn't do justice, here goes the full story;

I work part time at a small local restaurant. Family owned, nice enough people, and co workers are tolerable. Birthday was coming and I gave 3 weeks advanced notice if I could work the morning rather than the evening/night shift I normally work so I could hang out with family and friends for dinner and such. Manager said sure. Sweet.

Day comes around and I'm working from 6 til around 1:30. It's about 1:15 and we are super busy slammed, but I'm looking forward to going home. Manager comes around to the kitchen and informs me that we are way too busy and needs me to stay later than planned. When asked how long, I got a measly ""We'll see."" 

Time goes by and orders get pushed through. Another 2 hours goes by. All of sudden we all hear a glass break out in the dining room. No biggie, things happen. Well apparently, a little bit of glass found its way into the foot of one of the young female waitresses. Now when I say little I mean, the thing was like a paper cut. Regardless, she completely overreacted and was going on about how she couldn't walk on her foot and she needed stitches and etc. Etc. Manager decides, well that's fine, you can go home and I'll just keep one of the cooks here later to balance it out. That cook ended up being me and I was asked to stay until our closing time of 10pm. 

Don't get me wrong, any other day I probably would have been a little upset but hey, its whatever. However, the fact that in 3 weeks advanced I asked for the shift switch, and to get off at 1:30pm only to be told I am staying the entire 6am-10pm shift, on my birthday when I had already made reservation plans with family and friends? I was livid. I exchanged a few heated words back and forward about how shes even able to go home due to a little paper cut. Things got more elevated and in a stupid fit of rage I knocked over a few things like a microwave and a toaster (both of them breaking) as well as boxes of bowls and lids in frustration. In the moment I didn't care, but 2 days later after things have settled I feel like a huge jerk for breaking that stuff. This morning I was told I had to pay to replace the things I broke, which I'm understanding about.

So, tell me Reddit, am I the asshole in that situation, did I overreact, or was my frustration at how things were handles justifiable?

TL;DR

Asked to go home early on my birthday 3 weeks in advance, was told yes, then the day came and then was told no. Other co worker due to very small injury was able to leave early and was told to balance it I had to stay even far later. Out of anger I knocked over a few things and broke them. AITA?",320,867,0.92
386,Everyone Sucks,"This story gets a bit complicated but I’ll try to be concise. 

My wedding is coming up in November and the whole process has been a bit of a ride. My parents are devout catholic people, who believe that they can’t even attend a non-catholic wedding. After voicing their opinions we have decided to get the marriage blessed by the church so my family can attend in good faith (grandparents, aunts/uncles, parents all catholic etc). 

About a year ago my oldest sister came out as gay and had been in a relationship for almost 2 years, now three. They get married in September, just a couple of months before ours.

When she told my parents, my dad equated it to her basically dying in his eyes and that she’s been stolen by this girl she’s now engaged to. Needless to say my parents are shocked/angry that their first born child has done this. My parents will still cordially see my sister on her own, but my dad has basically said that her fiancé will never be invited into their home/family events.

My sister came to our engagement party and opted to not bring her fiancé because she didn’t think the timing was right for everything. Her fiancé was invited to the engagement party.

My sister will be in the the bridal party. And if I invite her, I imagine she will bring her new wife to the wedding. 

My parents requested that I be the one to choose to not invite my sisters soon to be wife for my parents sake/comfort.

My fiancé was livid when I told her what was said, as it’s her opinion that a parent should be able to attend their own child’s wedding regardless of their feelings for a single guest. (This is now the second stipulation my parents have put on attending my wedding) That if they choose not to attend my wedding because my sisters wife will be there that it means they’re putting their feelings against her higher than their feelings of support towards me. 

Our wedding is about my fiancée and my happiness, and if we uninvited my sisters soon to be wife my fiancé would be pissed knowing that my parents are only there because my sisters wife wasn’t there. But itfmy parents aren’t there I’m gonna be upset obviously because I want my parents there.

If it was up to me and me alone, I would not invite my sisters fiancé simply because it’s the easiest thing to do to satisfy all parties involved. However, like I said before, if that were to happen my fiancé would then be livid.

Am I the asshole for basically telling my parents to suck it up for a night and put their ill feelings towards my sisters wife under their feelings of support towards me for my wedding day?

I’m not asking for judgment on what my parents believe, I’m simply asking if I’m being a bad son for ignoring my parents/families feelings for those of my fiancé.

He got really upset that I accused him and said no, and that I could give him a drug test if I was so worried, and that he doesn’t take hydrocodone in general because it makes him incredibly sick. I said I wasn’t necessarily accusing him, and asked if maybe he took some for his Mom, and he said he didn’t and that maybe the pharmacy didn’t fill it up all the way because he did not take them.

I said I’d get married if they bought me a house in London because I’m moving there for post grad but my dads response was “You’re a girl, you’re not getting one. I’m getting your brother a house because its a mans obligation to provide. Just date someone richer or work harder for your first house”. I was livid because it was quite discriminatory of him I accused him of being a pig and he said “I have debts to pay, if I don’t I’d buy all my kids 3 houses each. But you’re a girl so you’re not really a priority in this scenario since u can just marry a man who provides well”

I understand that its quite entitled and not a lot of people have my privilege but AITA for demanding equal treatment? Its not like I’m getting married anytime soon so he has time to resolve his debt.

Edit 1: I am not from China, I’m ethnically chinese but was raised in a much more conservative country. Though the concept of gender equality is not new to me as I went to an international school so it -somewhat- promotes free thinking rather than gender norms

My 2nd brother is not getting a house yet, he has demanded my dad pay for his & his wife’s rent until my dad can afford a house for him in LA

And lastly I understand how people might think this is a validation post as my dad is painted as a villain here, I just felt confused if i was TA or not because my parents have been treating me like I haven’t been grateful for all the privilege I grew up with. I completely understand a house is a huge request so i brought this to reddit",99,234,0.88
395,Not the A-hole,"So my partner (f) and I (m) are hoping to adopt two young cats from a rescue centre. We're looking at names at the moment and are floating a few options. We haven't met the cats yet (viewing this evening). The cats are 9 months and are both female.

I would like to name them something similar to Zelda (no issues) and Dave, because it's a funny name for a cat, and this would be the case whether they were boys or girls.

My partner has flagged that this may be offensive or insensitive to the LGBT community and I can sort of understand why but it could also be overthinking. So i wanted to ask for opinions. I hope that's ok. If anyone even finds it a little uncomfortable, it's no longer a funny name and it will of course not be named something insensitive :)

Am attempting to also ask within /LGBT but as this is a throwaway, can't seem to post there (waiting on mods - I'm new at this!)

Apologies for the potato quality, but there they are :) As mentioned in the post, if the names didn't fit the cats, we would name them differently. So say hello to Luna (smaller grey and white) and Barry (ginger and white). Both very timid at the moment but after an hour of play Barry was letting us stroke her, and Luna was starting to :) Bringing them home later in the week and we're very excited :)",70,32,0.82
396,Not the A-hole,"I  am a father to one boy (14) and one girl (9), and I play games with  only my son every so often. We play on his PS4 for a few hours, talk  about anything that comes to mind, and generally have a good father-son  bonding time over a hobby that we both enjoy. Recently my little girl  has been trying to join us whenever we have these impromptu ""sessions"",  and quite frankly I've been denying her from playing with us during  these times. This is because if his sister is around, my son finds it  hard to talk to me about anything private or embarrassing he's dealing  with that he wants help or advice with and he has told me that he finds  it more relaxing when we have some alone time together.

&#x200B;

For  some additional context: no, this is not the only time members of our  family play games together. We have a Nintendo Switch, and on a lot of weekends all of us play multiplayer games together and have a lot of fun. My son  freely gives his PS4 for the rest of us to use, so my daughter plays on  it sometimes, and I've played games with all of my kids or even just her  on multiple occasions if they ask me although I do not make it as much  of a priority as I do playing with my son. Of course, I feel a bit bad  when I tell her no, so I do go to her the  day after and ask if she wants to play some video games or do something  together, which we may or may not do depending on her mood.

&#x200B;

Before  you all call me sexist, I would just like to explain my reasoning. My  daughter currently has a great relationship with her mother, going out  together frequently and bonding a lot. Of course, I do a lot of things with my daughter as well, but I would say  that it is fairly clear that she has the greatest connection with her  mother. This is something that is to be expected, and she loves me a lot too. However, my boy, being the  moody teenager that he is, somewhat pushes his mother away and I can see myself in him. Growing up, I was raised by a single mother with two  sisters. I remember during my teenage years, my sisters got closer to my  mother while I got further. Due to this, I still can remember the sense  of isolation and longing for a close father figure. I want to give him what I didn't have, so I've been making a bigger effort to connect with him for the past few years.

&#x200B;

Recently  my wife has told me that excluding my daughter from our games can make her quite lonely, and that I should be including her next time. I  explained all of my reasoning detailed above, and that I since I do  spend a lot of time with her, I should at least be given some time  to bond with my son alone. She snapped at me, telling me that it was  irresponsible of me to give the extra attention to my son, and that I  should be treating them equally. I'm kind of at a loss as to what the  right or wrong is, so I would really appreciate a third opinion.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Hey all, thank you a lot for your opinions about this situation. After reading through a lot of the comments, I've realized that there's some key information and context that I either forgot to include, or deleted to keep it under 3000 words. I do, in fact, spend time with my daughter alone. I cut out a more detailed description to follow the word limit, but I do spend time with  my daughter when playing games, going shopping, and going on walks and  all sorts of other things. Some people interpreted it as I choose to only spend 1-1 time with my son, and that I am willfully neglecting quality time with my daughter. This is simply untrue.

&#x200B;

Additionally, I don't exclude my daughter purely out of my own biases or whatnot. This  is something that I do as a result of talking to my son about it,  wherein he explicitly expressed his desires to have some time with me  alone to talk about his problems. When I do things with my daughter 1 on  1, there is no reason to exclude my son as my son usually does not want  to go with us despite me trying to convince him, and my daughter is perfectly happy if her brother comes along. 

&#x200B;

When I tell her no to joining the conversation between my son and I (the game is just a vehicle which makes the conversation easier to carry on), I do explain to her very gently that this is the only  time where my son and I want some time to just ourselves, that we are discussing things that her brother wants to say to me privately and that she is welcome to come to me with things she wants to do any other time.  

&#x200B;

However, I did realize that my view on the nature of parent-child relationships was greatly skewed by my childhood experiences, and now I know how damaging it could potentially be. I will try my best that I build the foundation of an open, loving relationship with my daughter for when she enters her teenage years so that she can have honest dialogue with me as well, instead of simply relying on my wife to be her primary adult figure.",433,3192,0.94

398,Not the A-hole,"I’m in a high school that has to wear a uniform. The classroom i’m in for one of my classes is freezing, enough for me to be constantly shivering, and there is no way to turn on the heat. Because of that, I began bringing a non uniform sweater to school that i wore throughout the day, and no one had a problem with it except for my teacher in this class, which sucked because that was the only class i needed it in. When i wore it she told me to take it off. So i did because those are the rules, until i realized that she would only say it when i was wearing my sweater. She lets people wear their sweaters the whole period, and when i would put it on right before class ended, she told me to everyone to not wear them. But only when i had it on. Another time she told me to take it off and said she wouldn’t start the class until people had it off, and while the sweater was on my head in the middle of taking it off she raised her voice at me to take it off. Today i left my sweater in my locker so that she wouldn’t be mad, and people are wearing their sweaters and she hasn’t said anything. Sorry if this is so jumbled i’m writing this fast in class and i’m pretty annoyed, also on mobile.
So Aita if i talk to a vice principal about this? i understand the rule is that you’re not allowed to wear a sweater and i get it could be petty but it’s really annoying to watch her to blatantly let other people wear their sweaters and only get mad at me. I was talking to my friend about it and she got mad saying that she was nice, and that she’s a new teacher so she can potentially get fired, and since the years almost over i should forget about it. Not sure how true that is about the getting fired thing but Aita for planning to report her?",23,29,0.79
399,Not the A-hole,"My wife wants a boob job.  She has tried every over the counter pill / supplement to increase her breast size for a few years.  She has also purchased a variety of devices that claimed to increase  breast size but only reduced our bank account.  About 2 years ago she helped her good friend go thru her breast implant surgery.  Her friend was newly single and has a job where they both claimed having larger / fuller breast would result in making more money.  No they are not strippers or escorts or any sex worker crap.  Not even modeling.  Her friend just has a job working around wealthy clients who tend to invest more when distracted, I guess.

So now that her friend's surgery is done and she's happy with the results.  My wife wants to do the same.  I can not control her or anything, but when she asked if I would help pay for it I said no.  She makes her own money and could save up for it if she wants it that bad.  I married her because I like her they way she is.  Her boobs are perfect to me already.  Firm, Perky, still defying gravity after years of married life.  I love it when she puts them in face and they are just the right size the way God made them.  She tried to convince me I subconsciously like bigger breast because of how I reacted to the increased size of her boobs when she breast fed our kids when they were babies.  To me that was natural.  I just don't like the idea of her going under the knife for something I think is unnecessary.

401,Asshole,"I am currently in summer school and we are approaching the final week of the summer semester. So there’s one assignment at the end of the semester that’s fairly easy and I remember our professor talked about it at the beginning of the semester which was like a month ago(these are 5-week classes) but not until yesterday was I reminded of it. Now this in itself wouldn’t be a problem except for the fact that this assignment, if we didn’t turn it in, would drop us a letter grade in the class. 

I was looking for the assignment on my class syllabus and I found that it was under class participation and it wasn’t put in bold that we had to turn in this assignment or else it would drop us a letter grade. This bothered me because I feel like anyone taking this class could’ve forgotten about this assignment since it wasn’t really talked about in class all semester except at the beginning and also it wasn’t in bold on the syllabus despite the consequences of it are being dropped a letter grade. So I told my professor that in the future he should put this in bold so students won’t forget. He said that since it was a summer course he had to write the syllabus fast. Looking back, I felt like I was kind of being petty and nit picky. So AITA for criticizing my professors syllabus?

402,Asshole," *edited for attempt at formatting*
  First, a little backstory... My new wife comes from a very upper-middle class family (Her dad started with nothing and is worth a few million, I assume, from construction business he started) and never wanted for anything, so her son (22 yr old) was raised the same way. I, on the other hand, come from the lower end of the middle class spectrum and was taught the value of things and their potential value to others.

  We live in an upper-middle class suburb where nearly all of the children are the epitome of the ""self-entitled milennial"" variety. An extremely well-to-do family friend that views cars as disposable objects overheard the 16yo stepson and his best friend discussing his lack of car and said ""I just bought a new Mercedes last week, you can have my old car."" So he acquired a 10 year old Audi for zero cost.

  Over the last 6 years, he's paid for gas. Grandma has paid for maintanence, repairs, tires, etc. He's wrecked this car 2-3 times. He managed to somehow bust a power steering line, as well as headlights and a taillight, etc. although the car was still technically driveable. Because it looked like garbage, though, he just stopped driving it. (He's very focused on appearances vs. practicality) 

  After it having been sitting in front of the house for the last 4 months, the wife wanted it gone and they approached me with selling it, the wife asking me if I would ""help him"" sell it. I asked him what the lowest offer was that he would accept for the car and he stated ""$200 for it, I don't want to deal with it, just want it gone"". I plainly asked ""So anything over $200, I get as a commission?"". Both he and the wife, almost in unison, said ""NO! It's not your car, if you sell it then the money goes to stepson, regardless of what it brings!"" So, I'll admit, I wasn't trying my hardest to move this car given that the selfish attitude from the pair of them soured me on ""helping him"".

  I let it sit for another week and then asked him last night ""You said $200 for the car, right?"" He responded ""yes"" I said ""I'll have a check for you when you get home and I need you to sign the title."" So, 45 minutes later he comes home and collects his check and signs the title to me. I post it online and have a guy in the driveway within an hour and end up selling it for $950

  The boy gets salty about it, as well as his mother when she gets home, saying that ""It's not about the money, it feels like you deceived me"". I explained that it was a life lesson, you shouldn't expect to be rewarded without putting in the hustle. He felt just because it was ""his car"" he should have gotten the full amount of money,I pointed out that I did literally all the work.

  To settle the dispute, I ended up giving him an additional $275, bringing his total to $475 (half of the total sale) and I was ""forced"" to apologize for ""deceiving him"".

AITA here or am I ok in being a little secretly salty that I had to give up half my profits?",613,1040,0.91
403,Not enough info,"So this is a touch complicated. My son, four, has been sick off and on most of his life. All respiratory issues of one sort or another. Mainly, pneumonia. He only just got out of the hospital a week ago for pneumonia and next week, his father (who I've divorced) is going to be traveling some 12 hours away and wants to take our son with him. I've refused because we don't even know what's making our son sick. He's been hospitalized twice for pneumonia now and we've caught it early enough twice so he could be on meds instead of needing to go into the hospital. His father is pissed off, as is his entire family. 

I'm feeling really bad about not letting him go. It's to meet family that can't travel due to old age and I had originally said months ago he could go. But he's had pneumonia three times since then and the doctors don't know why he keeps getting sick or what's causing it. They've set us up for an appointment with an allergist, but that's not happening for three more months because he's booked out. 

So am I the asshole for not letting my son go because I'm worried about his health?

Editing to add: Every time he's gotten so sick he wound up with pneumonia he was at his fathers house. I've been the one dealing with the fallout. I don't think, however, it's anything his father is doing, I think there's an allergen out there that's making him this sick. I also want to add that I do NOT think his father is an asshole, I understand why he's upset at my decision and if my son was healthy I'd agree to let him go happily. I want him to meet his great grandparents. But they're in their mid 80s and not exactly in high health themselves, and could possibly catch something from my son as well as he could from them.

Editing again: His doctor wants to see him for an appointment before he decides if he could go on this trip. So depending on what the doctor tells me on Friday, I'll let that influence my knee-jerk ""No he can't go"" reaction. If the doctor says it's safe, I'm going to let him go.

406,Not the A-hole,"So hear me out,

About 6 or 7 years ago my mother was diagnosed with cancer, was quite a stressful time seeing my mother that poorly after chemo. So i had a couple of days of work to go and visit her, she lives a distance away and i took it as annual leave. When i returned i wasnt quite on the ball in work and my then manager was quite vicious with me (she had that sort of reputation). I explained my situation but she showed no sympathy or empathy and suggested iu should leave my troubles at the door before is start work. TBH she's not a very nice person and since she's not my manager anymore ( I am now more senior than her and she never speaks to me, which lets be honest, i'm happy about)

&#x200B;

fast forward to the start of this year, the manager was diagnosed herself. She is arranging a charity event to raise money and has asked people to help out. I've refused as i've got no sympathy for someone who has no sympathy (i'm not the only one).

So AITA for refusing to help with an event of someone is ill who has shown no sympathy for anyone else in the past.

410,Everyone Sucks,"I exited a highway which was late at night, nobody else seen on the road except 1 car, the guy sat in my blind spot while i needed to merge. He slowed down and sped up as i did. Preventing me from moving to the next lane always matching my speed. Until i was running out of road. I noticed a dent in the front left panel which was made in a previous accident or scrape while backing out of a carpark.

I floored it and got in front of him and made some distance between, but the lights turned red ahead. He pulled up beside me and i could see him taunting me out of my peripheral vision. finger up, waving at me. Which i just ignored him.

The lights turn green, i let him go. I go slowly to let him leave my vision.

I turned another corner and left him far behind. I reach the next set of lights which have a speed camera on them, i slowed down so he could catch up. They change, i make it through before red, but he didn't, got flashed by the camera. At this point i am laughing. but he is angry and swerving all over the road. I then touch my brakes to flash my red lights to piss him off even further. Slow down and speed up each time he gets close to hitting my car.

413,Asshole,"I was hanging out with two of my best friends(I'll call them T and J) recently for the first time in a decent bit and we were just having fun like always. We haven't been able to hang out quite as much since we graduated highschool last year, but we still try to find as much time as possible to get together and do stuff.

The problem happened at T's place. J needed to leave a bit early(by our standards) because he had an early shift the next morning. So it was just T and I after that, and we just went about our thing playing some video games, and BSing around.

I noticed tucked into the side of her bed there was an eevee plush toy. I picked it up out of curiosity, because it was a pretty odd thing to find in her room of all places. We all loved pokemon growing up, but keeping plush toys or stuff like that was usually something we all thought was kinda silly. It then actually hit me that I'd seen this thing before. It was from a few years ago during freshman or sophomore year. T, J, another friend and I were at an arcade and I had won it from one of those stupid crane games. I was planning on throwing it out because I didn't care about keeping it, but on a whim I decided to ask T if she wanted it since I knew eevee was one of her favorites, and she ended up taking it. I figured she probrably ended up throwing it out, so I was pretty amazed to see it again after so long.

I acted surprised and joked around with her that I couldn't believe she kept this thing for so long. She confided in me that she actually sleeps with it most nights, and I just sorta burst out laughing hearing that. I feel kinda bad for that looking back, but that's just so hilariously out of character for her. I wasn't laughing AT her, I just thought it was entertaining.

She told me that it's just because its special and holds sentimental value to her, and that it makes her feel less lonely at night since we haven't been hanging out much lately. Honestly it was kind of heartwarming, but I couldn't help but keep the joke going just a little and I said something about how I couldn't believe how sappy she's gotten. My mistake was probably when I mentioned offhand that I gave it to her because I was gonna throw it out anyway.

She out of nowhere just kinda blew up on me. She told me to go f**k myself, threw the thing at me and yelled that if it's just trash to me(which I never said) that I could have it back. I ended up being thrown out by her and before she closed the door in my face she threw the plush at me again.

I do feel really bad about teasing her so much for it, and she seemed pretty upset, but she just acted so utterly crazy in response. I've never seen her act like this before(she's normally really chill) and I don't really know where to go from here.

She explained that it would mean a lot to her if I would just meet with him. I asked why and her response was that it will keep his mind at ease knowing that she is with someone good.

I took her on a date last week and we had a great time and kissed at the end of it. 

Earlier this week I met up with my best friend Harriet who I have known since I was a kid. I told her about my date but when I showed her Alicia's picture she was very angry. 

Harriet is a nurse and the two of them work in the same department at the same hospital. Harriet does not like Alicia. She claims that she is a snob who is constantly rude to her and humiliates her at every opportunity. She told me that Alicia saw her on a video call to me on a lunch break, and after she was done said I was cute and tried to pester her for my details. 

Harriet refused but Alicia didn't give up, even said she would stop tormenting her at work if she convinced me to go out with her. 

At one point I was chatting to Harriet over text and she left her phone for a minute or so. According to Harriet this is when Alicia took her chance. Harriet has my number saved as my full name so that was all Alicia needed to look me up on social media. 

Harriet was annoyed with me but understood that I didn't know and we're OK. I phoned up Alicia later and demanded the truth, and she started crying admitting that she did look on Harriet's phone, but it was only on impulse and she didn't plan to do it. She said how sorry she was and begged me to please not dump her over this. I took some time to think about it but in the end we started talking again and met up yesterday. Alicia said she didn't understand why anyone would want to be friends with Harriet but we had a great time again and she invited me to come back home with her. 

We had a great night and by the morning she asked if I'd like to be ''exclusive'' with her. I said I needed time which upset her. I would like to be but I feel like that would really damage my friendship with Harriet. She was fuming when I told her how Alicia found me and I don't think she'd be happy if she became my girlfriend. 

Alicia is a gorgeous, funny, bubbly and lovely person who I really want to see more of but I have a gut feeling that I am betraying my friendship with Harriet.

**UPDATE**: I'm the asshole no doubt about that. My friendship with Harriet should come first, and as you guys have said it's wrong to date someone who is cruel to your friends. I texted Alicia saying I won't risk my friendship with Harriet by dating her, but she hasn't responded so I will update when she does.

**UPDATE 2**: Sooo, after watching my phone all evening I got a call from Alicia and answered to her screaming down the phone. She called me every swear word under the sun. From her voice she sounded wasted drunk. She called me a ''snake'' and said that Harriet was a ''tramp'' and an ''ugly c*nt'' and told me that I'd never get a girl as good as her again. I let her rant at me for a few more seconds before cutting the call. I called Harriet and warned her that there may be more problems at work because of how angry Alicia was and that she should consider involving HR. Thanks for the guidance guys. It was a blunder to consider involving myself with her further but I see the error of my ways.",508,3120,0.95
417,Asshole,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for 5 years. In that time span, I’ve said maybe two sentences to his sister. She’s anti social, hates her own family, selfish, and surprised everyone when she told us she was 6 months pregnant. 

The parents were very hurt she didn’t tell them sooner and very concerned that she hasn’t been to a doctor or done any kind of planning for a baby. 

I’ve never spoken to the baby’s daddy (seen him around bfs parents’ house a few times). I’ve tried to make conversation around the holidays but neither of them want to participate in anything. 

She’s working at some shoe store and I don’t think the baby daddy has a job. She’s even had to ask her family for money because this guy obviously can’t support her or the baby. 

I love my boyfriend and his family very dearly. His sister? Not so much. I have no relationship with her. I was invited to the baby shower this week (by their Mom not the sister).  Needless to say I have no interest in her or going to this shower. 

I feel bad because their Mom is trying to include me in family matters. But I don’t want to give her a gift or pretend I care. Haven’t RSVPd yet. 

So Reddit, AITA for having zero interest? Advice if I should go or not is welcome.

Edit: My boyfriend has no relationship with her. His Dad doesn’t either. Only the mom has some sort of relationship with her.  No males are going to shower. The sister would literally not give a single shit if I was there or not. 

Edit: I might just send the gift and not attend.",248,1119,0.96

422,Not the A-hole,"Please hear me out.

I have been ill for over a year. Since a bad food poisoning, I've been nauseous every day since May last year. I am barely able to eat anything, I'm on dietary restrictions where I can't eat vegetables (because of the acidity) and I've just been eating carbs and protein for months on end now. Everything is manageable if I don't vomit. If I start to vomit I will be insanely sick for a three day period until it settles down again. The slightest smell will set me off. Strong smells of urine in a public bathroom, for example, means I have to leave and go to the toilet elsewhere or else I'll vomit and be bedridden for days.

I just started a summer job, where I'm working for my University. I'm working with other students and we all live together in the same flat. Work is going well, I'm able to manage my health problems mostly except for one thing. My new housemate/workmate has the worst personal hygiene I've ever come across. I am physically unable to stand within 3 feet of him or else my health issues will start to flare up and I will begin to vomit. The smell of sweat is intense, the smell of grease is overwhelming and the smell of *dirt* is everpresent. It's gotten so bad that I got into a lift that he had left 4/5 minutes prior and I could still smell him. You can smell him through our corridor door and even from outside the apartment door. A customer of ours even made a public review on our website where it referenced a ""male with dark hair"" smelling bad. The guy read it and laughed about it saying it ""could be any of us "" because we all have dark hair. Everyone in the office knows what's up with him but nobody has a health condition similar to mine so I don't think he'll be reported.

I grew up on a farm and this is the worst smell I've ever dealt with. It has made my health problems so unbelievably worse to the point I'm on the verge of gagging daily. If I vomit because of him I will be sick for days on end and will likely be blamed for it. There is a public guest comments box in my workplace. I want to write an anonymous comment detailing his hygiene issues so the management can address it. Failing that I want to bring it up with management directly. On one hand I'll feel guilty and I don't want awkwardness between us, on the other hand there is NO REASON for a grown adult with all capabilities to have hygiene this bad and I feel your right to be smelly ends where it starts affecting someone else in a serious manner.

EDIT: I should mention, he makes no effort to mask this at all. He doesn't wash his hair, he wears no deodorant and comes out of the shower smelling as bad as he went in

425,Asshole,"Hello judgementals.

Throwaway account.

A few month ago, my then girlfriend bought us both tickets for a concert, as a birthday present for me.  It wasn't a wrapped up gift and I never received a physical ticket, but I do clearly remember the circumstances...she was very excited to be able to buy me this gift as a belated birthday present (she didn't get me anything on the actual day).

Fast forward about 3 months, we've been separated for a couple of months and I'm curious about how this will play out, since we haven't really been in contact since the breakup. On the day before the big gig, I see I facebook post from her about the going to the concert and inviting some other random to join her with the 'spare' ticket.

I understand that she might not be comfortable going to a social event with me, but I feel like she should have checked in with me about the ticket that had been promised to me.

Here's where I do behave like a bit of an asshole, I reply to the FB post with a somewhat sarcastic question about how I can pick up my birthday present ticket. She was not impressed, and sent me several messages telling my that I have been hostile, things have changed, the ticket is none of my business now, etc...and then blocking me from all communication.

I'm embarassed about my unconstructive FB reply and now I feel like I've branded myself as the jerk in the whole breakup (which until now had been reasonably amicable).

Am I the asshole for expecting her to talk to me about the ticket?

426,Not the A-hole,"So here’s a little background about my childhood that will be important later:

I grew up in Utah. My mother and father were probably narcissists from what I can remember from my childhood. They were never wrong. Their issues always went before mine. They did anything they could to manipulate me just for their own joy.

I moved out as soon as I could. It was easy seeing how I didn’t have much of my own belongings. I enlisted in the Army at 18. While stationed in Washington, I risked it and sent a few letters to my parents asking for some clothes and snacks. To my surprise, they did, (This will also be important later.)

4 years later and I’m in the civilian life, though in the reserves. After going to trade school, I start up my own cannabis business in Nevada a while after legislation legalized it. I smoked pot behind my parents’ backs all the time when I was a teenager, and I’ve been into the lifestyle ever since

Now, I’m not gonna say the name of my company or who I am, making this a throwaway account, but my company became very successful within months. I made about $2 Million in almost a year.  My parents got wind of this through my Instagram account, apparently. I made the god awful mistake of bragging my company’s success on my personal page and I guess they found it.

They ask me for money because they’re in some kind of situation where they need something big paid off. They said I should pay it off because they were my parents and they “raised” me. Nope. I remember their narcissistic ways. I call them out on it, and they act like they’re innocent. They then mention when they sent me stuff while I was in the army. I didn’t care. That couldn’t make up for their shitty parenting on any day. 

I cut them off and haven’t spoken to them since",25,37,0.87

My father gives in to him all the time, and when this happened, he decided to bring him out for dinner. I texted him and told him that wasn’t happening and that he was rewarding my brother’s bad behaviour. 

He told me that I’m being melodramatic and he just wants to talk to my brother. Not wanting to start a fight with my father, I relented.

434,Not the A-hole,"So last year on December 11th I found out that my mom had ran out on me and my dad. The way she did it though wasn't correct, in my opinion. She had rented a house that was a city over and while my dad was at a doctors appointment (more on that in a bit) she had came home, packed her clothes and anything valuable, and left. Then, to put the icing on the cake, she got my older sister (who always swayed her way) to move in with her. This totally fucked my sisters future because she had just gotten off probation and was on the track to college if she had been in our house with my dad for another week. Shes extremely smart and it pains me to see her fail. So, our Christmas got fucked right into oblivion. Spirit was crushed. Then my mom sets up dates for me to go over there. I didnt want to see her on Christmas, so the day after I went. I was livid with her, exploding on her and telling her how bad she fucked up. I stormed out of her house and had my dad pick me up as I couldn't be in there much longer. By now, she got the court shit set up and my dad had his lawyer and vice versa. My mom had the court set up for me to go there every other week. I said no and tried everything I could to not go there but nothing worked. I'm solid on what I stand for, but I had to go because my dad made me just to please her. Now it's probably a good time to say that my dad has had lyme disease multiple times and is now suffering from crazy bad fibromyalgia (arthritis but for muscles is how I'd put it) so she left right before it hit the fan, and she knew it would. She always said she didnt want to take care of him if he got sick, but I mean dont make wedding vows if you cant keep them am I right? So me and my dad are dirt poor, but at least we keep the house because she left and all this shit. I always tell her I dont like living with her because my friends, family, school, sports and everything is here. She crys, but I dont care for it because she shouldn't have done this. Me and my dad have suspected her of cheating because I found a way into her phone records and found how long shes called numbers for, searched one up and it was a guy she worked with. Went to the gym the week before I did this, called him 1 minute at 9, and came home at 12. Multiple calls to his number in the past. Now, I despise my mom but I dont hate her. I dont love her enough to say it. So I've said to the court that I'd like to be in full custody of my dad, showing my mom a little respect and saying I'll visit. I'm not going to change my view on this, and I dont feel sorry for my mom. I do for my sister. My dad is going to keep me out of trouble, keep me smart in school, working all the time, and wants me to be the greatest person ever because he was horrible in his younger days with stuff like drugs and thievery. That is why I choose to live with him. 
So, AITA for not wanting to live with my mom? Is this too harsh on my mom or does she deserve it?

437,Asshole,"My wife is five months pregnant with our first child. Recently, she has felt some small kicks from the baby. I tried to feel for a few nights, but no kicking. Then on Saturday, my best friend was over playing games with the two of us. We started talking baby stuff, and my wife mentioned that the baby has started kicking. My friend, who was very happy and excited, asked if he could feel her belly, and she said, ""No, but I appreciate you asking."" My friend was visibly upset/discouraged, but we moved on. My friend slept over after having a few drinks, but after he left the next morning, my wife and I talked about it and I told her that I was upset that she didn't let my friend feel her belly. She said that it was her body and she didn't want anyone but her mom or me touching her belly. So I told her that I will not be touching her belly and that that was my choice and I thought she was being unfair to not let my friend (30 and single) experience that life growing inside of her. She cried a lot and we talked a lot more, but it just seems selfish to me. Am I the asshole here?
TLDR: Wife didn't let my friend feel her pregnant belly, so I decided that I would not be feeling her pregnant belly.

Update : Looks like I am an asshole. I'm at work and texted her that I'm excited to feel our baby and that I'm sorry for being an asshole.

Update 2: While I completely do understand that I was being immature and petty, many people are calling my friend a perv. I think it's a very normal desire to want to feel a baby kick in the womb? Also, all clothes were on. At no point did he ask to feel her bare belly. 
I now understand that I have no say in who is allowed to touch her belly and who is not allowed.

Update 3: Not sure if it is at all relevant, but my wife went back home for the week (before any of this happened) and my sister was the first person to feel baby's kicks, after my wife invited her to feel. My wife and I hadn't had the conversation of who is allowed to feel and who is not allowed to feel, so I figured if my sister was allowed, then our friend would be allowed. I shouldn't have assumed, but that was my line of thinking.

Update 4: just got home from work, got her a big bouquet of flowers and sat down and hugged her and tried to feel baby. We talked about it and I texted her the link to the post. I told her I was stupid and that I fucked up big time and that I was very sorry. She accepted my apology and she's getting ready for work while I make her breakfast.

Final update : I did hear you all loud and clear. Fuck me, yes I'm the asshole here. To be honest, I was very excited that our friend was excited for us. I was then just discouraged that it seemed like he was being stifled. But my wife felt uncomfortable. That's that. End of story. I should've been fully supportive of her wishes in this situation and I wasn't. We're 4 years into a very young relationship (I'm 22, she's 21). I know that I have a ton of growing to do and I get that I fucked up here. I'm trying my best and sometimes my best sucks ass. I'm trying to be excited for this baby (I'm mainly terrified), and I fucked up. Thank you for showing me what needed to change.",1186,10377,0.88

Basically when me and my girlfriend go out late at night I usually will not drive and we take Uber’s. I pay 90% of the time, but my girlfriend was expressing how she would rather not go out unless I’m driving, as it’s easier for her money wise (she pays maybe a $25 trip every 3 weeks, while I pay for all of them whenever we go out multiple times a week). 

The reason behind me not wanting to drive is that I got a new car that I literally love and have had really bad experiences at night in the city I live in. Like we usually go downtown and the traffic is always so fucking bad and it kinda stresses me out less to just call Uber’s.

I ask the waiter to please fix the issues but he refused.  He claims that although the drink special says “2-4-1,” the bartender was supposedly pouring doubles and therefore I had gotten my monies worth.  I tell the waiter that the drinks seemed very weak.  In fact, they seemed weaker than single shots.  I kindly ask that he apply the discount to the discount to the bill.

The waiter refuses to apply the discount.  I decide not to argue about the issue and simply not to leave any tip.  I think it was fair not to tip since I was overcharged by 40 dollars.  My girlfriend agrees that I was overcharged, but thinks I’m the asshole here for not tipping.  She thinks it’s unfair that I didn’t tip because waiters generally rely on tips to make money.

They are the happy fun couple everyone loves, and who love each other a lot. He lives off her, and has since the beginning, tho he's not a deadbeat. He does creative work, and is reasonably good at it, but it doesn't pay the bills. In the past she called it a good balance -- he connects her to a lot of exciting events and people she'd otherwise miss out on, she finances it all.

Over the last few years tho he's gotten increasingly off -- (Not sure whether he's changed or I'm seeing him more clearly.) He's arrogant and pushy in conversation, bossy to her, never listens to anyone, interrupts at random, and gets touchy with anything resembling criticism. (He gets *really* insecure if anyone complains about work.). A few times it was so bad -- like him barking orders at her, or holding forth for ten minutes talking over everyone condescendingly on a topic he knows nothing about -- that I've considered reaching out to her.

Then recently he started sleeping with a young woman (20ish). He presents it like it's a mutual open relationship thing -- they're experimenting with ""polyamory,"" etc -- and tho his wife is trying to go along with it, she's clearly a mess. She's having breakdowns, crying suddenly, reaching out to me upset, etc, but he's acting like this is just some aberration -- like she's having difficulty managing her emotions but is basically on board. (Or even like she's being unfair to him because she keeps saying one thing and doing another.)

The other day she called me and was such a mess it was like textbook battered spouse syndrome.

444,Asshole,"I struggled with mental health issues for most of my childhood and adolescence, and almost all of my friends growing up were ""problem kids.""  I don't think any of us were bad people, but all of our problems combined to create an incredibly dysfunctional friend group.  I'd like to write a memoir about our experiences, but I know that at least one ex-friend would be extremely hurt by this.

""Kayla"" was my childhood best friend and would be a major character in my book.  I believe that in what I've written so far, I've presented her fairly: she could be arrogant and abrasive, but this was because she was struggling with several mental illnesses (borderline, PTSD, and others) and trauma from an abusive childhood.  (And obviously, I am changing names and details to protect her identity.)

Still, I know that if I publish this and she ever finds out about it, she will be very upset.  A lot of what I discuss is deeply personal (for instance, the abuse and neglect she suffered).  I'm sure that having any of this published, even with her identity obscured, would leave her feeling violated.  I also think that she would be angry at the negative light in which her family is portrayed.  For most of her childhood, she was in denial that her parents were abusive, and I think that even now, she would feel defensive of them.  Also, she expressed a desire in the past to write her own memoir about her life, and would probably feel hurt by me ""stealing"" her story.

I have not been in contact with Kayla for several years.  I'd like to interview some of my other childhood friends if they're willing, but I'm scared even to contact Kayla and tell her I'm writing about her, because I know that conversation would not go well.

I feel like I'm the asshole because I want to write about another person's problems in a way that I know would hurt them.  At the same time, I feel like that's unreasonable: if writers had to respect everyone's wishes, almost no biographical writing could be published.  I've been going back and forth on this for several years and can't decide whether what I'm thinking of doing is okay or not.  I think I have a right to write about events that I witnessed, but I also can't shake the feeling that I'm doing something really wrong.

&#x200B;

Edit: A lot of people are asking why I want to share this information to begin with and whether I need to disclose Kayla's abuse to tell my story.  So, what I'm struggling with is that as a result of abuse, Kayla acted out in ways that negatively affected me.  For instance, I had depression that became a lot worse when she consistently told me I was ugly/stupid/etc.  Obviously I can discuss that without going into her backstory.  The reason why I wanted to delve into her backstory is that without that context, she comes off badly, and that isn't really a fair portrayal.  She did a lot of inappropriate things, and they were pretty much all motivated by trauma.",89,143,0.88

447,Not enough info,"Hi reddit, 

I have a friend who I like to throw work to from time to time to help him with his financials.  Just small odd jobs I need help with. We’ve never really had an argument before today. 

He has a power washer so he cleaned my deck for me, and we agreed to a set price.  No problems there.   While he was doing the deck I asked him if he was interested in helping me sell some hydroponic equipment since he had a truck and is usually a good guy to work with.  I told him I would give him 30% of the final sale (an expected $7-900 for maybe 4 hours of work).    My expectation was that he was going to prepare the equipment for sale, make sure it was cleaned and take some photos.  He was happy for the opportunity I thought and agreed to do it the next day (today).  

Today he shows up at 1 and I buy him lunch.  We get to my house at around 3 and I am in the basement where the equipment is working alongside of him.  Eventually I have other things to do, so I go upstairs and he continues to work for another 2 hours or so. 

When he’s all done he shows me his phone which has an invoice on it basically stating that he wanted $700 for the laborious part of the job today, in addition to 35% of the sale.   It adds up to about $1500, well over $120 an hour. Obviously I’m not paying this, I had no intention of paying him beyond the 30%, I would have even done 35 if he had asked me first before presenting me with an outrageous bill.   He then gets really defensive and I told him to just get out of my house.  I would like to pay him for the time he helped me for, but I thought his request of $700 for half a days work of moving stuff around and not even doing what I asked of him was ridiculous. 

Is there some scenario in which I’m the ass hole here?  I think I was pretty clear with him, and he was not with me.",16,69,0.95

451,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend cooked dinner for us, and we sat and ate together. As we finished eating, he said “okay, can you clean up now?” I told him I’d rather wait a few minutes, chill out and digest; I don’t like cleaning up the whole kitchen the moment I’ve finished eating. (And before anyone jumps to conclusions, this is true, not just an excuse to not clean. I always clean up when it’s my turn.) 

He says he wants it clean now because the mess makes him uncomfortable, and he’ll help me if we do it now. But I say that it’s okay, I’m happy to do all the cleaning by myself, I just want to relax for a minute beforehand. 

So, he sighs dramatically and goes “fine, I’ll just do it by myself” and starts cleaning. I shrug and go to the bathroom, and when I come back he gives me a glare and pointedly ignores me, so I say “I don’t appreciate you being passive aggressive just because I didn’t clean everything the exact moment you wanted me to.” It felt like being a teenager, where my mother would pull things just like this. So we got into a small fight. 

Anyway things were resolved, but he still insists it’s just better to clean right after we finish eating and I’m being lazy and gross by not doing that. Is that true, AITA?",58,158,0.96

453,Not the A-hole,"I’m 19, female, and live with my mum and younger sister. I come from an area where there have been lots of attacks on women, and murders have been increasing lately. I was stopped on my street while walking my dog and a man patted her, said he’d seen me a few times and thought he knew which house I lived in.

That freaked me out so I didn’t go inside my house because he’d stopped at the corner of the street and could still see me/could see where I lived if I went inside. I called a friend to come help me figure out what to do and eventually called my dad as well. By this time the man had been there 40 minutes and hadn’t gone inside a house, he was just walking up and down the street.

My dad told me to call the cops or he’d do it for me. I never normally trust cops and hated that I had to call them, but did.

The man told the cops that he’d moved in recently and was waiting for a friend to help move his stuff. I find that a little hard to believe but I’m not following it up with the cops.

454,Not the A-hole,"I've known my stepdad for about 8/9 years now, and while he is a pretty okay guy, there is some stuff that I just cannot stand about him. For example, when I was younger, often times when he would walk into a room and see me, he would say something along the lines of; ""Ohhh you still got that face?? It's so ugly, you should try getting some plastic surgery!!""

I always hated when he did it, because despite the fact he was 'joking', I took it to heart. I don't want to pin the blame on him for everything, but something tells me that him doing this could have contributed to my severe lack of a self esteem now that I am older 

I currently go to therapy, and during one session, my mom was there, and I explained to my therapist about what used to happen with my stepdad and I, and my mom got upset. She said that my stepdad was just joking, and that it was our little joke. I disagreed with her statement, as even back then, I clearly showed that I didn't appreciate what my stepdad was saying about me

Today, just about half an hour ago, my stepdad walked past my room, saying something similar to what he used to tell me, but instead he 'jokingly' said it to my stepsister's best friend. My mom thought that he was talking to me, and so she said that my stepdad couldn't say that anymore because I didn't like it. That doesn't sound bad, right?

456,Not the A-hole,"I'm 19F. I work part-time (currently applying to schools) and live with my parents and pay admittedly cheap rent ($300 for my room). Market value for a room in a house is about 500 including utilities/internet etc. Me and my dad are atheist but my mom is Christian. 


I started dating this guy M19. We didn't have much of anywhere to go to spend time together so often we went to my place. We would say hi to my parents if they were home and go do our own thing. I wanted to get to know him more before really hanging out as a family with him.


He slept over one night and my mom walked into my room in the morning (seeing his shoes at the front door still) and yelled at me for having him stay the night. I tried to explain that the buses had all stopped running and I didn't get what the problem was anyways. We had never talked about boyfriends staying the night before but I never had to ask or warn if friends were staying over. 

Anyways it ended up happening again. We stayed up too late watching a movie and I felt bad making him walk an hour home so late. 

My mom freaked out at me that I was disrespecting her boundaries for her house (my dad refused to comment or take sides). 


I know her issue is us having sex due to being Christian, but I'm not Christian and she knows I don't share her values. We also never had sex during these nights, and honestly could have sex during the day with even more ease than the night so i really dont get how it matters. I'm paying rent (admittedly not much) for my bedroom space but feel I should be able to use it or have people over within reason. 

I really do feel it is about her Christian values. My family always had an open door policy for my friends - I never had to ask or warn them if someone was staying the night (Including a platonic male friend who twice slept over - was completely ok with them). The only difference in this situation to my platonic male friend is her fear me and my boyfriend will have sex. Which makes me feel it is more about her trying to control what I do with my body because she sees it as a sin.

Am I the asshole for feeling like she is forcing her morals onto me and that I should be able to have a boyfriend stay the night?

Edit:
My parents had met him multiple times at this point.

My dad doesn't care if I have a boyfriend stay the night but isn't willing to intervene. 

My parents go to bed rather early and would say goodnight to us and my boyfriend would often stay till 1-2am on Sat when there's a night bus and they never minded how late he stayed. Again making me confused about what the difference is whether we are awake or asleep.

The four who are now in college each got $100 from me.  I received lovely, prompt thank you notes.  Their parents don’t have a ton of money, they’ve all worked through HS and saved for college, took out loans, and 2 of them started at community college to save money.  We’ve always done a little cousin gift exchange at the holidays, and they’re always genuinely, vocally grateful and always write thank you notes.

We have three graduations this year - a nephew and twin nieces.  The nephew is like his older siblings/cousins, but the twins are the polar opposite.  They are bratty and entitled, have never worked a day in their lives, have been given cars, expensive clothes, etc.  Their parents will be paying for all of their college expenses at private 4 year schools.  One year, my parents (their grandparents) splurged a bit and got all of the cousins Kindle Fire tablets.  These two opened them, took one look and said, “We already have iPads and MacBook Airs, so...no.”  And then handed them back.  Not only do they never write thank you notes, they never say thank you.  

I told DH that I was planning on giving my nephew $100, as I’ve done in the past, but will probably get the twins nice cards and $25 Starbucks GCs.  He said I shouldn’t give different gifts, and I said that I wasn’t obligated to give equal gifts - I believe this is fair, if it equal.  He needs the money more, they don’t need it and won’t appreciate it.

459,Not the A-hole,"Earlier this month my dad and my step-mom went to California for a vacation. My step-mom has a daughter who is a year older than me (for reference, me and my step-sister are both teenagers). I stayed with my mom during their trip and my step-sister stayed with her aunt. Last Wednesday (6/5) I got a call from my step-mom. She put the phone on speaker and her and my dad said that they got married earlier that day and I was the first one they called. She said that my dad surprised her with the wedding. I felt like the world was crashing around me and I started sobbing, they only heard a little bit but I told them congrats and they hung up to tell my step-sister. 

The four of us are really close. My dad and my step-mom have been dating for 4 years and engaged for 2. My step-mom is like a second mom to me and I love having a sister since I’ve been an only-child for most of my life. My dad and step-mom asked us for the past two years whether my sister and I would be upset if they went to a courthouse and got married without us there and every single time we told them that we would be incredibly upset and angry if they did that to us. 

Today I saw my dad for the first time since the marriage and in the car to his house it was pretty quiet and we didn’t talk about what happened. When we were about 30 minutes from his house we started talking and I pretty much freaked out and started raising my voice and getting hysterical about how hurt I am. He said that he wasn’t thinking about what the family would think, they just didn’t want to wait any longer and the thought of just getting married in our home state never crossed their mind. I told him that he could’ve called beforehand or gotten my step-sister and I a plane ticket to be there to see the wedding. He thought that the happiness of them getting married and me and my step-sister becoming legally sisters would outweigh the sadness of not being there. I told him that it doesn’t even come close. 
At dinner today, all four of us talked and my step-mom said that when her and my dad heard me cry on the phone it broke their heart and it took them a while to get over. I said “Aww, you guys have had it so rough, haven’t you?” It was rude of me but I felt that it was condescending of her to say something like that. 

I’m not mad that they got married, I’m mad that they didn’t consider telling any of the family beforehand or thinking about how hurt and betrayed my step-sister and I would feel.

He knows that due to my history I don't open the door to men I don't know/am not expecting. He asked the neighbour to go over and see what was up. 

Neighbour wasn't quite home so it took a bit. Turns out the guy had misread the house number. Guy asked our neighbour if we were likely to pay him. He was given a diplomatic answer. 

Later Thai evening as I was getting the kids ready for baseball he walks up to me and asks if I can pay him for the work. He said that he had to re-assembke our plastic play structure (he's the one that moved it) I said that unfortunately I don't have the budget for that and I tanked him. He tried a few other tactics but I actually don't have money to give him. He eventually left. (He then, I later learnt that he went and complained about me to my neighbour, because he did a job and we should have paid him)

If my father in law had it his way, I would be waiting on my husband and kids hand and foot at all times. 

His recent tactic of snarky comments has been to say that everything we own or pay for is done with my husband's money. If I buy my husband a gift, FIL says, ""Is it really a gift if you're spending his money?"" If I pay for my FIL's coffee, he says, ""well, really your husband is paying for this."" It's annoying and frustrating. I tried being snarky back, didn't work. I tried talking to him about it and he just pretended he didn't know what I was talking about.

The final straw was that my kids have started saying it. I mentioned to my husband that I was going to get my hair cut and my son pipes up with, ""so you're going to go waste dad's money on yourself?"" and both kids start laughing. My husband told them that they were being rude and they defended themselves by saying that grandpa says it all the time!

29F no kids for reference. I was at the pool at my apartment complex today, enjoying a rare weekday afternoon off. I was laying on a chair about 15 feet from the pool reading a book. I am aware that the apartment complex is a shared space and can be noisy, and I’m ok with that. I’m also aware that if you sit by the edge of the pool or in the pool you will be splashed and I’m fine with that too.

A family with 4 kids, probably all 8-10 years old, came to the pool area and started filling up squirt guns to squirt each other. At first they were in the pool and that was fine. But a little after that they got out and started chasing each other around and squirting each other, and kept getting me and other people around me. They were aiming at times over my chair. The first couple times it happened I let go figuring it was an accident and they are just kids. I also assumed the parents would notice. But when it kept happening I started getting annoyed, especially  because they kept hitting my book and were screaming right in front of my chair.

I could tell the other people around me were annoyed, and the parents were watching and just didn’t care. I am a pretty direct person, and am usually willing to say things other people won’t,so the next time it happened I stood up, walked over to them and in a stern (not yelling) voice said: “can you please stop screaming and squirting each other over here? You are being incredibly rude and you need to watch the people around you. If you want to squirt each other, that’s fine but for the love of god will you do it in the pool?” About 3 seconds later the soccer mom came storming over and started yelling at me “how dare you talk to my kids! They will do whatever they want and you have no right to talk to my kids.” Then she yelled at her kids “do whatever you want you don’t have to listen to this “Barbie” (I’m brunette so technically I’d be Kelly, just saying.)

That made me mad so I said “listen lady, if you can’t control your kids maybe you shouldn’t take them out in public.” Not probably the most mature response but I didn’t appreciate her yelling at me so aggressively or making fun of how I look.

Afterword, the girl next to me thanked me for saying something, but I got a bunch of dirty looks from other parents. In hindsight I should have talked to the mom instead.

Update 1: On hindsight I could have talked to the mom, but I decided to address the kids because they were the ones misbehaving.  Plus, mom didn’t seem too concerned about it. I now feel like an asshole for yelling at the kids, but still think it was ultimately justified. Was that wrong of me?

Update 2: for those asking, I didn’t go to the office because you can get written up or fined for not following the pool rules (screaming, running, horseplay) and I didn’t think incident this warranted that response at the time.

Update 3: I stand corrected. I wouldn’t be “Kelly” I would be “Skipper.”",92,203,0.93
467,Not the A-hole,"Firstly, yes this is America 🙄

I'm a trainer for a big telecom company. I train engineers and I'm very respected and qualified in my field.

Now, since I was 14 or 15, I've been body shammed for having big boobs. By 16 I was a DD. Now at 31 I'm a triple D. Not to humble brag (this detail is important), but my waist is naturally pretty tiny. My measurements are, 33DDD-24-37 at 5'2"" 125lbs.

Now my job has me teaching groups of mainly male engineers at least for 1-3 weeks of the month. I travel a lot too.

Anyway, we aren't requested to dress to formally, in fact our company has a very lax dress code, especially during training. Lots of the guys wear t shirts. Most of the instructors wear polos, shirts and maybe a t-shirt on Fridays. We're casual too but not as casual as the guys we train.

Anyway, I don't dress casual. I wear mainly form fitting shirts and polos.

A problem I've had anyways with clothes is that because my boobs are so big, even though I'm technically a small or extra small in top, I'm forced to buy a medium or large. This means I'm forced to alter almost all my tops by taking them in additions around my waist.

If I don't, sure to my petite size, I look like a fat blocky person. It's not flattering and it really affects my confidence.

So apparently, I've got at least 3 complaints to HR that I'm accentuating my breasts to much and that I need to dress more conservatively by wearing less form fitting clothes.

This is so hypocritical of them. Firstly there are several other equally attractive (some far prettier than me) female  trainers who wear even tighter tops than I do. They just get away with it because they've got smaller breasts.

Secondly, a few of the make trainers here are into fitness and wear very very tight slim fit t-shirts and polos.

My clothes isn't even that tight honestlty, there's like 4-6 inches of room in my tops around my waist.

I wasn't told to comply, but they director of HR in my office said he STRONGLY recommends I try to dress more modestly.

I was 100% against it and told him I'd think about it, but that would require an entirely new wardrobe and it's not going to happen anytime soon. He said, he can give me some company t-shirts to help my transition.

I left the meeting really really upset. It reminds me so much of how as a teen my highschool teachers would single me out to wear less tight tops to school. It made me feel so ashamed of my large breasts.

Yesterday I read the opinions of many on that 15 year-old girl wearing a cheeky bathing suit to a communal pool at her grandparents. I fully thought OP was an asshole, but do many of you agreed that the circumstance and venue mattered.

It's been 3 weeks since I was warned and HR called me in 2 days ago to ask me why I'm not complying. I told them that I think it was stupid and body shaming I told them politely that I wouldn't be obeying.

470,Not the A-hole,"Well, step-sister. I[20F] have fostered some kittens and they’re currently six weeks old, so I’ve searching for potential owners that will provide the kitties with a good home. My step-sister[20] has taken interest in adoption.

The problem is, I believe she’s irresponsible. Her mum bought her a puppy a few years back and my sister really loved that puppy, up until she had to be responsible for it. Whenever her puppy peed indoors, she’d refuse to clean it up. She’d have her mum take the puppy out. She really only liked the puppy so she had something to put on Snapchat or Instagram. Beyond that, she didn’t really acknowledge that puppies are living creatures with needs of their own, and are more than a few cute pictures for social media. When the puppy had grown up, she become more irresponsible. It was almost as if the poor thing had lost its ‘baby’ charm, now being a dog. But when the dog died, my step-sister really went in on this emotional breakdown until everybody sympathised with her, vowing she could have another pet when she had recovered from the loss and was ready.

I’m guessing she has recovered from the loss, because she was all over me once she found out I was searching for kitty parents. She went so far as to schedule coming over to meet the kittens. So, I was teaching her how to syringe feed kittens (not that it would be relevant once they’re old enough to be adopted, but I thought it would be sweet to show her the process), she lost her patience and had to pass the kitten back. Then I told her about mashing up kitten food into a soft sludge so they don’t risk choking, and she began squealing when she got wet kitten food on her finger. The rest of the time she spent with the kittens was of course, instagramming and taking snapchats of them. 

When she left, she seemed upbeat and told me to let her know which kittens would be available once I’d began to find owners because she’d be happy to take a pair off my hands. The problem is... I don’t want them to go with her. When I told her this, her face crinkled into complete rage. She began angrily flailing and barking at me, drawing attention from the neighbours with her comically exaggerated rage. Some of her points regarding her puppy were that ‘cats aren’t as high maintenance’ and ‘don’t need as much attention’. I was so annoyed, I told her flat out I think she’s too irresponsible, and she stormed off. She has been ignoring me since.

I genuinely do not believe any of these kittens would be in a good home if they go with her. My step-dad (especially) and mum are trying to convince me otherwise and keep telling me, ‘she’s changed’, and if she hasn’t, ‘just take the kittens back and find another owner’. One kitten could be very high maintenance as they develop, and absolute nightmares when adopted as a pair. Take it from somebody who raises them in their spare time.

473,Not the A-hole,"Backstory: Growing up, my mom (37F) would often tell me(21F) to wear longer shorts in the house when my brother or step dad were home and things of the like- this always made me hyper aware of my body in a negative way. I explained to her to that her comments grossed me out, and that if she thought I needed to cover myself because my male relatives were in the house, she probably had a few things she needed to sort out with herself. She always defended her argument with “I own you until you are 18.” This always ended in arguments. Ultimately, I would comply, but it left me feeling uncomfortable in my body for years. 

Last week, I visited my parents across the country. We were getting ready to head out for dinner together, and I wore a long sleeved shirt without a bra. I have a small chest, and bras have never been comfortable. The top I had on wasn’t sheer, and caused nothing other than a pronounced outline of my chest. When I stepped out to leave, my mother sees me and goes “NO.” She then yells at me that I wouldn’t be leaving the house dressed like a whore, and that I needed to realize the world doesn’t revolve around me. She said there might be families there and I shouldn’t go around children like that. 

I got emotional and told her there was nothing wrong with my outfit or body, and that I felt she was sexualizing me in a weird way. I don’t feel like the fact that I’m not wearing a bra is offensive or disrespectful to children and families. I also pointed out that I have been independent for years now, I pay all of my own bills and provide for myself. I reminded her that I am no longer her “property” and that she shouldn’t project her own opinions on body image onto me. She told me I made my sibling (17F) cry and that I ruined our limited time together. Sister later told me she cried because Mom was screaming. 

Ultimately I didn’t go to dinner because I was crying and I knew my mother would be hell to be around no matter what I wore. Step dad (36M) told me he understood my point of view but that I should just comply with my mom to make things easier. Mom is still mad at me and being very abrasive in her responses to me. 

Is he right? It does sound simple but after so many years of her messing with my body image and “owning” me, I don’t feel like I should cave. At the same time I love my parents dearly and I feel awful that one of the limited days I have with them a year was ruined.

475,No A-holes here,"My brother is on the verge of cps removing his children. He has 2 boys and a girl. My wife and I live in a house with seven other people and we have two big dogs. If cps takes the kids they will either go to foster care or come to us. However, for us to even be able to take them we would have to move and prove that we could give the kids everything they needed. The things is I'm not sure we can. These kids are in desperate need of therapy and just general medical care. My wife and I have no money saved because we've been focused on paying off debt/student loans and would only be able to afford a 2 bedroom apartment and with big dogs apartments are hard to find. Because we can only afford a 2 bedroom we wouldn't be able to take all the kids. It would be the boys OR the girl. We would barely be able to cover their basic needs and can't afford the therapy at all. If they go into foster care they get free therapy, free medical care, and all their basic needs would be met. We would be allowed regular visitation and depending on how long they stay in foster care the state will pay for their college. I feel horrible even thinking about not taking them.

476,Not the A-hole,"I’m (17F) and out for the summer. I’m kind of an introvert and it’s known in my family. But I’ve wanted to make the summer going into my senior year count and make good memories. 

I also wanted to relax and spend time alone. Recently my older sister has gotten divorced and she’s switched from a part time job to a full time so she works during the morning. 

Every day.. Monday through Friday I have to wake up around 6ish am to start my day of caring for her child (2M). I take care of him from 6ish am to around 5 pm. Sometimes 6 pm.. depending on who come gets him and when. 

I think this is pretty unfair. I also wanted to get a job this summer to get some job experience but that plan was nipped in the bud. I love my nephew. And I don’t mind watching him occasionally. But I’m so tired of this. I’ve been doing this since I got out for the summer in May. 

I don’t want to do this anymore. And I’ve expressed it plenty of times but I get shut down every time by my parents because they say there’s no one else to do it. 

Apparently I’m an asshole for complaining and I get hit with the life isn’t fair. 

I’m not trying to be insensitive towards her and I know she’s having a hard time adjusting but fuck! 

I think I’m going to go crazy soon. My daily schedule consists of waking up at 6. Taking his clothes off. If he cries when he gets here I deal with it. I make his food and I feed him. And then I attempt to get him to go back to sleep. I change his diapers during these times and play with him. I make sure he goes outside at least a few times during the week. At some point he goes down for a nap and I continue to feed him. 

He can only eat finger food by himself. I’m not patient so I get frustrated having to feed him by hand. It takes so long. 

I also brush his teeth, wash his face, and do his hair. 

It sucks so much to be trapped with a toddler 5 days a week. At this point he’s seeing me more than he sees anyone else. I don’t have a child. I didn’t sign up for this. 

I just want to be irresponsible and sleep until 11 AM and play video games all day and chill with my friends. Maybe even work and make some money. I don’t want to be a mom. 

I’m a passive person. So dealing with tantrums and the crying is so hard. I keep getting told by the adults around me to be more sympathetic toward her and that this will pass. But no one has made any plans to send him to a daycare. 

So I’ve started complaining a lot and talking about how I want to do this in hopes of another arrangement being made but I get told to suck it up. 

Even before she got a divorce I’d get tricked into watching my nephew for hours. 

A lot of my friends work and the time that they have free is the time that I usually have to watch my nephew. 

A close friend of mine I’ve been missing only works on weekends so our schedules are the complete opposite.",81,34,0.93
477,Not the A-hole,"I am a 15 year old Indian girl, and one of my best friends is Italian-American, and the same age. We both go to an international school in a different country, so all my friends are of a different ethnicity- but we all have American accents and speak fluent English.

&#x200B;

She makes comments that rub me the wrong way- she is very patriotic and proud of her Italian heritage, which is fine with me. But she keeps putting down my Indian heritage, shuts me down everytime I want to talk about my own roots. During an overnight camping trip, neither of us could sleep so we began to talk about our futures. I said I want to give my future daughter an Indian name- she grimaced and said 'Don't give your kid an Indian name, Indian kids get bullied.'  Later, I mentioned that she should visit India sometime because the food is good. She told me 'I would never want to visit India... I would be attacked.' Now, I understand where she is coming from (the media portrays India as unsafe, and i Imagine is worse for white girls) but it was rude.

&#x200B;

Her parents are so sweet and love hearing about my heritage, and they always invite me over to their house, feed me delicious Italian food and ask me about my roots. I love talking to them. But when I invite my friend to my house, she asks me if we 'have toilet paper' or 'have cleaned the house recently'. My mom is a neat-freak. She goes on to comment on the food- 'I don't like the smell of Indian food. It's too spicy for me.' She can have preferences, but she  doesn't even try.

&#x200B;

Another time, this white guy was hitting on me. He kept asking if I wanted to kiss him, show him my breasts and have sex with him. I told her, and she said 'um... I think you're taking it the wrong way. I don't think (guy) is into Indians... he likes white girls.' Now, I'm not going to lie, but I got prettttyyyy mad. I'm honestly quite pretty. It took me a while to find confidence in my tan skin, dark hair, the fact that my cheeks aren't rosey. But my facial features and body are quite beautiful, and I put on makeup very well and make good fashion choices. A lot of guys have fallen for me. My friend is, honestly, not that conventionally attractive (overweight, doesn't brush her teeth/shower often) but I don't comment or treat her any differently. She always makes comments that insinuate that I'm not 'good enough' to date white guys.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My friends say she doesn't know better. But I think that's BS-we've both been to international schools our whole lives, and I've never once been racist. But she openly disses my country. I spoke to her, saying her comments hurt me, but she started to cry and told me that she 'is only 15, she faces racism too.' I don't want to be presumptuous, but she has blonde hair, white skin, green eyes... she probably faces a lot of racism but not to the same extent I do. People literally call me 'Apu' in front of her. I'm just really scared because no one seems to understand. It's making me lose my self-esteem and hate my nationality.",55,182,0.94

Fast forward to this weekend my girlfriend is at her best friends bachelorette party and everyone is coming in from out of town. They rented a cottage for a few nights starting Saturday, so friday when they got into town i offered to let them all stay at my apartment for the night.

They start getting ready to go out to the bars and i just finished a 12 hour shift so i told them i was going to bed, have fun, and to try and keep it down when they got back as i was getting up early saturday to go out to my mom's.

While they were getting ready i could hear them chit chatting and my girlfriend mentions how i cook and clean for my mom and how i even do her laundry. Instantly they all start calling me a creep and a pervert for wanting to touch my moms underwear and how inappropriate that is, how she should be so lazy and shouldnt rely on her adult son to do that for her.

I'm super close with my sister M. When she found out she was pregnant, she invited me and my mom (and her husband J of course) to the ultrasound. I was obviously incredibly excited. But, when we were there, the doctor pulled M and J aside to speak privately. Later, M told me that the doctor had noted atypical sex characteristics and that there was a good possibility of the baby being intersex. She also told me that the doctor could use tests to help see which gender the baby was more likely to identify with as they got older, and she was planning to raise the baby as that gender and was maybe even considering surgery. However, because it's still pretty early on, they weren't 100% sure and needed more tests.

I was supportive, and I told her in the end it was her prerogative, but she should absolutely not do that. I'm not intersex, but I'm a very active member of the LGBTQIA+ community (bi, if anyone's curious), and I've met one or two individuals who very strongly identify as intersex and are extremely glad they did not have surgery when they were younger. I told M she should not ever do surgery (unless her grown kid wants it) and raise her child in a way that allows THEM to decide the binary gender they wish to identify with (if any).

M got super angry and basically stormed out of the room. I guess M must have told J, because after he called me and yelled at me, telling me I wasn't a doctor or therapist, and anyway, it wasn't any of my business.

482,Not the A-hole,"A couple years ago I made friends with a guy and a girl who we'll call Sarah and Dan. We grew to be fairly good friends. We're all adults in our mid 20s and when we get together we get really into talking about our relationships.

It just so happens that Dan is gay, and he liked to actively participate in giving out advice when Sarah and I had relationship issues, and we could do the same for him. But after a while I noticed that he never actually gave me any advice when I had problems with my romantic relationships. When Sarah wanted to talk about her problems he was helpful and gave sound advice, but whenever I was seeking the same, his advice began and ended with ""you should dump your boyfriend and switch to girls.""

I thought it was a joke the first time but he kept saying it every time I went looking for advice from my friends. He never gave that advice to Sarah when she was having guy problems (even though she's bisexual and that advice would be more applicable to her, although I personally think it's a rude thing to say to anyone). I'm straight, and I have never implied otherwise. I've never even been bi-curious. For me, personally, the idea of myself being with a woman romantically makes me uncomfortable and I told that to Dan several times and asked him to stop. He said he would try. 

He didn't stop.  I started skipping meeting up with Dan and Sarah because his comments continued to make me uncomfortable, but several days ago I decided to meet them for brunch and we started talking romantic relationships. I was supportive as he described a few problems with his current boyfriend and Sarah and I offered a few suggestions to how he could solve those problems; overall it was a good chat.

I'm finally in a committed relationship with a man I adore and I was very excited to share my excitement about it. Along the way I mentioned just a couple pet peeves I had with my boyfriend (that aren't even a big issue) and Dan said it again. ""Well, time for you to dump him and switch to girls!""

I just snapped. I raised my voice (not quite a yell, but louder than usual) and asked, ""Dan, why don't *you* switch to girls?""

He acted like I slapped him. Started crying and demanding to know why I'd ever say something so horrible to him, then he grabbed his stuff and stormed out. Sarah told me how disgusted she was by me and also stormed out. (Side note: that left me to pay the entire bill for brunch when we agreed beforehand we were all only paying for ourselves, so that was awesome /s.)

A few days ago I got a text from Sarah that said she talked to Dan and both of them are disgusted by my behavior and have decided they can't interact with such a ""hateful, homophobic bitch"" anymore and both will be blocking my number and blocking me on all forms of social media.

I still feel pretty justified in what I said but it's started eating at me, especially because it made two different people decide I'm horrible enough to cease contact with altogether. AITA here?",781,4375,0.94
483,Not the A-hole,"A little background: my father had always been middle of the road, and he was never racist, at least as far as we ever saw growing up.

However, 6 years ago or so he married this woman who has to be one of the most racist people I have ever met. My sister has a mixed-race daughter, and that has always bothered her. My other sister's stepdaughter is dating an African-American, and she doesnt acknowledge him at family gatherings. If we watch MMA, she invariably roots for the white guy and mumbles slurs. She has choice names for the NBA. When we visit, we invariably have to tell our children after we leave that she is ignorant and that isn't how a person should act. 

I would understand people saying we should confront her about it, but it's been done. A few years ago, there was a commercial in the Super Bowl where they sang 'America The Beautiful' in a lot of different languages, and she freaked out. Absolutely freaked out. It was the final straw for me, and I blasted her about what I thought of her as a person, her intelligence, her propensity to post inspirational memes, how she acted as my father's wife, all of it. It nearly destroyed my father's and my relationship. He's 65, he comes from a family with heart problems and things that bring about a reduced life expectancy,  so I dont want to not speak to him for years and then miss that time. He's my Dad, I love him, and he knows she pisses all of us off.

Fast-forward to now: my 17 year old son has started talking to a girl he works with, and they're going on a date. She has a name that sounds ethnic, and possibly Latino. We wouldn't care what her background is, because my son always has good taste, and as long as she is a good person, we dont care. She is white, though, which is important to the story.

Yesterday, at a family gathering, my Dad asked her name, and when my son told him, his wife immediately asked what her last name was. I knew what she was getting at, and I dont like her motives, so I said 'Rodriguez, I think. Or Fernandez.' My whole intention, mature or not, was to irritate her, because i cant stand bigotry. 

My wife shot me a look, and immediately stopped me from going any further. Later, she asked again what her last name was, and I said ""It might be Hernandez or something.""

484,Not the A-hole,"I'm gonna start this with two disclaimers: I've never used reddit before but I've heard this one is a good place to get opinions from strangers, so I figured what the hell. Also, I honestly feel like I'm going crazy with this situation because I really can't see how I'm in the wrong but so many people are telling me that I am that I feel like I must be somehow. 

Recently I  (21M) was introduced to a friend of a friend (19M). I'm gay and so is he. He's pretty cute I guess but in a very traditional blonde hair blue eyes clean cut kind of way, whereas I tend to prefer the more rough around the edges kinda gothy metalhead type. Still, when this guy told our mutual friend he was interested in me I was flattered and agreed to a date. 

On the date it became clear to me pretty quickly that we just weren't compatible. He's very ~~flamboyant, for want of a better word~~ since apparently the word flamboyant is inherently bad, I'll edit this to say dramatic. Just super loud, almost obnoxiously so, refers to everyone as ""queen"" or ""girlfriend"" or ""sister"", that kind of thing. He also went on a lengthy rant about how homophobic his old manager was and saying that he got fired ""basically just for being gay"", when I later found out he actually got fired for turning up baked to work too many times. He also kept calling me daddy, which made me a bit uncomfortable but he did stop when I asked him to. Overall, he seemed a nice enough person and he was certainly very sweet and complimentary to me all evening, we just have totally different personalities and I know from past experiences that dating guys like him doesn't work out for me.

The day after the date, I sent him a text thanking him for a nice time but saying I didn't see a future for us as a couple but I could definitely see us being friends. He immediately got upset and kept asking me why. I originally tried to shrug it off with the usual ""I'm just not ready for a relationship rn"" but he wasn't having it and kept asking. Eventually I told him basically what I said above. He got really shirty then, saying that he's sorry that he's ""too gay"" or ""the wrong kind of gay"" for me and that he hopes that I can work through my ""internalised homophobia"". A bunch of our mutual friends are telling me I'm a tosser for not letting him down gently, and also accusing me of internalised homophobia. I'm just baffled at what I did wrong here tbh. Am I a colossal dickhead and just too dumb to see it or have my friends just lost their goddamn minds??

EDIT: since a lot of people are asking here's the text about our personalities not working out copy and pasted: 

Honestly, i just dont feel like we'd work personality wise. you seem really nice and you're fit, I'm sure there's some lucky lad out there for you but tbh i just don't think he's me. as i said i think we could be really good mates, but your personality is just so big and full on and i just dk if i can forsee myself being in a relationship with a personality like yours long term, as I've more of a toned down vibe (sure you noticed haha). have you ever met (friends name omitted for privacy)? you might have more luck with him.",274,942,0.95

486,Asshole,"Amidst significant family drama, my husband and I decided to elope and then host a 35 person garden-party wedding reception at our home. The reception was on the same date as our original wedding had been planned and tbh it cost just as much as a small wedding reception (approx 7k), had great food, black-tie servers/bartenders and an open bar. We noticed, though, that the majority of our guests did not bring a gift or card. Particularly, a few of my lifelong friends did not bring a gift or card. I get that it’s technically a guest’s discretion to bring a gift or not but come on! So I mentioned it I passing a few times that only one item was purchased off our registry and our card box was virtually empty. I also thanked “the few” who brought gifts for their generosity in my toast. My husband thinks that me mentioning this, and being upset about this was in poor taste (although he acknowledges that we spent the equivalent of $200/pp on the party). AITA for thinking ppl should bring a wedding gift to our wedding reception?

Edit: 
wow, apparently the internet feels very strongly about this lol. I guess IATA. 

Just to clarify a couple of things: 
our invitations were very clear it was a wedding reception. People did not know at the time we had eloped. 

Lots of you asked what the family drama was and suggested I was to blame for it. There was drama on both mine and my husband’s side actually. My husband’s dad and brother are alcoholics who have been sending him really abusive swear word-filled emails/texts for just over a year now after he stuck up for me at a family gathering.  They are both the type to do something ridiculous and cause a scene so we didn’t want them present when we said our vows.

My parents are split up and there was all sorts of unnecessary drama about me inviting my dad’s wife of 15 years as well as my mom. We just didn’t want anybody doing anything to ruin the ceremony so we opted to have it by ourselves without them.

487,Not the A-hole,"To give a little background me and my partner travel the country and sell their product at craft shows. We had a show this past weekend that we had been to a few times before and knew that parking could be a real problem. We decided we would wake up at 5:30am to get to the our site around 6:30 which is a whole hour earlier than we normally would just so we could make sure we got a spot directly behind where our booth would be set up. The problem is if you dont get a spot right next to where you set up your booth you may potentially have to park multiple blocks away and carry all of your stuff to your assigned spots which is a real pain especially for what we sell. One other issue is the weather can be very unpredictable at this site because you are right along the water and you could have to pack up unexpectedly. 

     We got to our site around 6:30 as planned and started setting up our booth.  About an hour before the show is supposed to start I am getting the last few things out of our car when a lady approaches me. I have seen her at a few shows in the past and I know that she has a deformed arm (not sure of the proper term but it's where your arm is short and almost looks like a flipper). She starts off by saying ""can you help me."" I figured she wanted help carrying things to her booth which I gladly would do. She instead says she needs my parking spot which I reply ""I am sorry but I can't give you my spot, but I would gladly assist you in unloading your car and then watching your things while you go find a spot."" I explained how I got up early specifically so I could get a good spot etc. At this time in the morning all of the other spots in the area where taken so it wasn't like I could just move across the street. I would have been searching for a new spot for a good while.

  She proceeded to start getting angry with me saying how she is handicapped and how she couldn't believe that I could be so selfish etc. At this point I walked away but still left the offer on the table to help her unload her things if she wanted. 3 other people saw what happened and two agreed with my point of view and one did not agree with me and said that I was being rude. I really believe I was in the right with this situation but I would like your input.

AITA for not giving up my parking spot to a handicapped person?


***Edit***: Thank you everyone for the fast responses. I truly was torn over this situation. It was one of those things where it kept playing over and over again in my head and was making me feel like crap and I was second guessing my decision.

Basically, a friend and I ordered some stuff internationally and it arrived today. My friend ordered stuff worth about £370 with the intent to resell while I ordered stuff worth about £60. The main reason i ordered with her was because there was free shipping for stuff over £100 and she was completely okay with me joining her order. It arrived today and apparently we have to pay a customs fee worth £63 which we had no clue about. She said we should split it evenly. I told her there is no way in hell I’m shelling out £30 unplanned when my stuff was a tiny fraction of the overall cost. 

I told her i could pay £10 which i think is fair enough and the way she reacted you’d think I fucking murdered her dog. She then brought up the fact that i’d have paid shipping of £20 if i ordered on my own (which is true but i wouldn’t have fucking ordered shite if i was gonna pay shipping) so i should just add the £20 to the £10 i was offering and give her £30.

I've been begging her to quit for years - offering to pay for nicotine patches, helping find a support, even hiding or destroying her cigarettes. She keeps saying she'd like to, and keeps making no effort for it. I've tried to reason with her about it, saying things like I want her to quit so she'll be around to be with her grandchildren. Asked her to do it to save money. Asked for it as a birthday or Christmas gift.

The cigarettes she smokes smell awful - they cling to everything. Clothing, furniture, cars. If she gets into my car, it'll smell for a while afterwards. If she's in my house, I have to air it out. If I go to her house, my clothes smell like smoke until I wash them.

My wife [30F] and I [31M] are expecting our first baby in a couple months. It will be the first on her family's side, and the second on mine. Naturally, there's a lot of excitement. My mother loves babies and was over the moon when she found out she would have another grandkid.

About a year ago, I mentioned to her I didn't want her holding my kids if she was still smoking. I reminded her of it when I got married (""you know, Wife and I will be having a kid soon, so you should work on quitting""). I reminded her again when we got pregnant (""7 months to go. How are you with quitting?""). We're in the home stretch now, counting the weeks. She's made no progress towards quitting.

I know it will crush her to not hold her grandkid. I know she's addicted to smoking. I know she's had trouble quitting. But I can't stand the thought of picking up my baby and having him smell like smoke. What will that do to an infant? She won't smoke around the baby, but she's certainly going to bring some of that toxic shit to him. I can't shield him from everything, but that doesn't mean everything should get a free pass.

My mother and grandmother are very conservative but in the good way,they have always taught us to put family first.

My grandmother broke her hip and at such age she needed a lot of help, from taking her med to wipe her ass until the hip fixes... one night when my sister had to take care of a 86 years Senile lady she went out with her friends instead. and that night she fell and broke her hip again.

&#x200B;

My sister at that time told us that she had a life and cant do whatever we told her to do.. here is when the conflict started.. like that old lady raised you while her daughter (out mother) had 3 jobs and studied at night and received as a lawyer in 3 years while providing the family. Our mother effort made our grandmother a second mom since 80% of our childhood memories are ""mom working, raised by grandma"". I CANT JUST CANT accept such behavior on my sister, she did not wanted to do it OK but tell something so we can plan ahead.

3 months passed from that incident, my sister stopped helping our family or interacting at all. Barely stayed in our house and talked to us. My grand mother condition grew bigger, at that age and with those interventions the doctors said that its normal.

&#x200B;

One day my grandmother falls again and the only person near to help her or do something was my sister. She not only did nothing, but told me that we were not more family anymore, that if she ever needs she wont be seeking it from US (not me, the problem was the family now). So my grandmother stayed in the ground with a broken hip for 4 hours until my mother could go back home. 

&#x200B;

I have closed a door to my sister. I gave her opportunities to amend her mistakes, but still she wont change her mindset where she only cares for what she cares and fuck everything else.

&#x200B;

In 7 days is my birthday and i told my mother and grandmother that i would love to take such awesome ladies to dinner while they invited my sister and current boyfriend where i said to them to DO NOT. We argued a lot and they told me that my sister is suffering from depression, she has financial problems, she ""miss me"", she wants to change but cant and yada yada.. so i told my lovely ladies that they have to tell her that SHE is not invited after all and they expect ME to do so.

&#x200B;

And told my family that like i stopped loving my sister, they would get the same if they dont stop taking me for granted and start taking in account what i want, past my sisters needs.

495,Not the A-hole,"This morning I was rushing to get out of the house because I had to get an Uber to the express bus to work since I left my (30F) live in boyfriend (31M) use my car because he was working overnight and his car is in the shop.

Over the weekend we had a wedding and I wore a very beautiful pair of expensive shoes (700$) that he had gotten for me this past Christmas, and to be transparent, I never said I wanted these but it was a very thoughtful gift and I love them and wear them any chance I get, even when it kills my feet!

In my haste to get myself ready for work, feed and walk our 4 month old puppy and manage to get out of the house without him following, I left the shoes in a bag on our kitchen table (I was not aware I had left them at this point). I was commuting into work and got a very nasty text from my BF with more than a few choice words because our puppy had somehow gotten to the shoes, and in his words, destroyed them. I am very upset about this and of course understand why he is upset, but it was an accident. I feel terrible but don't think cussing me out on my way into work was a warranted reaction or needed to be quite that aggressive or harsh, AITA?",63,43,0.9
496,Not the A-hole,"""Jenny"" and I met in 5th grade. We're both 30 now. And as life goes, friends go down different paths and grow apart. I get that. 

&#x200B;

So Jenny and I were quite close in high school and college. Then during grad school, she basically ghosted me. Which, hey, I get it -- you're busy, life's busy, you don't have much time to hang out. No judgement there. 

&#x200B;

But it reached a point where I would reach out, try to get together, try to invite her to things, etc and she'd just....ignore me. So finally I called her out on her bullshit and got a woe-is-me story about how she'd just been so busy and gotten so depressed that answering a text here or acknowledging an invite there was too much to handle. And honestly, I understand depression makes these kinds of things tough (and idk if she was ever actually diagnosed with depression or if that was just an excuse) but all the while, I'd watch her post on social media and spend time with other friends, so I felt her failing to simply acknowledge me, even if it was to decline my invitations, was pretty a-holish on her part. So I stopped trying.

&#x200B;

And four years or so went by. No contact, occasionally she'd tag me in something but no real conversations, no hanging out, no nothing and my life was fine for it. 

&#x200B;

So then out of the blue a month or so ago, she texted me asking if I'd be her maid of honor. The wedding's next fall. And I accepted, partially after my SO and mine and Jenny's mutual friend said it'd be the right thing to do, I could repair our friendship that way, clearly I'm important to her if she's asking me to be her maid of honor. So I accepted, and I was kind of excited about it, and I even said she should come see my new place and meet my new dog sometime. She said she'd get back to me and to this day, hasn't. 

&#x200B;

And now I find myself dreading the wedding. I thought I'd get excited for it but I really just can't. It's not till the fall and it's gonna be a commitment -- 3 hrs away, gotta stay over/board the dog/spend money etc and I kinda feel like dropping that kind of cash on a wedding I don't care about isn't a good idea. But I told her I would be her maid of honor.  


So thanks for bearing with me. AITA for dropping out of maid of honor duties now? I don't know if I'd drop down to just regular guest level or not go at all, tbh I kinda don't wanna go, my job makes weekends off rare and the thought of wasting a free weekend on a long-ass drive for a wedding I'm not into is making me cringe.",40,27,0.97

502,Not the A-hole,"My ex-wife and I divorced almost two years ago and don't co-parent great-mostly just try to ignore one another unless necessary for us to interact (not mature, I know, but my attempts to change that were not met kindly). We have three children together and the youngest, Evan (8), has been struggling the most with the divorce. The past few months he’s been having meltdowns when he doesn't get his way- if we go to a restaurant he likes but that one of his brothers picked, or if he is made to clean his room instead of playing video games. He will yell that we're all mean, he doesn't like us and call his mom to come get him. She does, and then an hour or so later he gets dropped back off. I've asked her to not come get him, that it’s my parenting time and he has to learn that he can't run away whenever he doesn't get his way, but she basically told me to f- off.

So I picked the kids up Friday and told Evan that if he called his mom to come get him that he had to stay with her all weekend and I would see him again the next day I had custody (I have him two days a week and three weekends a month). He got mad Saturday morning over multiple things and called his mom to come get him. When she showed up, I reiterated the new rule to him and told her that if she took him she was keeping him all weekend. She basically blew me off and they left. A couple hours later when I was out with the other two, she called to see where I was because Evan had cooled down and was ready to come back and she had ""things to do."" I reminded her that I told both of them if he left that he was with her all weekend. She blew up my phone all day angry because she had plans and couldn't find a sitter, Evan called upset a couple times but I held my ground. He called Sunday and was apologetic and asked if he could come to church with us and I told him yes and kept him the rest of the day and he was much better behaved. My ex says I am an asshole, which I’m used to, but then when I told my mom and sister, they also said I was too harsh and should've let him come back Saturday and I find a different way to handle the behavior issues. I was feeling pretty proud of myself until I talked to them. Should I drop this new rule or just ignore their opinion?

&#x200B;

Update: Wow, thanks for all the responses. I got a lot of really good advise and things to think about. I have made an appointment with my attorney to discuss getting Evan into therapy that she can not interfere with and also to find out my best course of action for when/if she shows up in the future. Wanted to jump on and answer a couple questions, though. A lot of people asked how Evan was contacting his mom- she got him a phone for Christmas. He is not supposed to bring it to my house bc I once took it away when he and his brothers were bickering all day (they all go their phones taken away). Evan told his mom and she told me I had no right to take his phone away since she paid for it. So I told her that the phone stays at her house when he is with me but half the time he hides it and I don't know he has it. He will also call/text her by getting one of his brother's phones. Once he even went in my office and Facetimed her on my iPad. I usually don't know he's doing this because the things he decides he is going to call her about are random and often benign. Once, he called her because he didn't want to go to Lowes. He whined about going, I told him he couldn't stay home by  himself so he had to go and proceeded to finish cleaning up the kitchen. Less than 10 minutes later and his mom is at the door to get him. He hadn't thrown a tantrum or anything-just normal whining that my other boys did at that age. Later that afternoon when all the boring errands were done and I was about to take the older boys to a movie he got dropped back off. Mostly when he calls her he is not emotional and crying- he just isn't getting his way and is frustrated. The older two got the same way at his age (heck they get frustrated now if they are told no) but they didn't have the option at his age to have someone come get them so they go their way.",1192,9473,0.96
503,Not the A-hole,"Im 16M and my sister is 18F. Her ex is also 18M. 

They dated for a year and broke up last month. Before he started dating my sister he was my math tutor first and we became good friends because we liked the same sort of stuff. Then we were in the same clubs (science and math Olympiad) and he was kind of like a big brother to me and helped me a ton with figuring out the kind of subjects I want to go into one day.

They broke up because my sister wanted to go to the same university as him but didn’t get in, so she wanted him to go to her school instead and he said no. She said he broke her heart and she thinks he broke up with her. 

I still invite him and some of our other friends over when we’re getting ready for competitions or just hanging out. He doesn’t go through the main house and just slips in through a side door directly into the basement where we all hang. My sister never even sees him but gets really upset when she sees his car in the street. 

My mom is also really upset and says I’m putting this guy over my own sister. She says I’m nothing without family and I need to rethink my decisions. My dad is indifferent. AITA to keep bringing this guy over for hangouts and things?

**edit:**the reason I keep inviting him over recently is because we’re preparing for a state engineering competition. My dad is helping to sponsor the costs (materials and things) so all the stuff is at our house and no one else on our team has a large basement to work out of. 

But obviously since we’re all friends we still laugh and goof around now and then. My sister lurks around and if she hears us laugh she tells our mom that we’re not working and to kick us out.",109,297,0.96

I was annoyed at him and did not respond to his comments. I did not talk or acknowledge him the whole night unless he directly said something to me, and I would give 1 or 2 word responses. I wasn’t rude, but I wasn’t exactly welcoming him with open arms.

508,Not the A-hole,"Sorry if the title of this is wank, I didn't know how else to sunmarise. Also, new to reddit so sorry if I'm wank at that too. 

The ""girl"" in question here is my close friend's girlfriend of the past 18 months, let's call her Ruth. I've never particularly cared for Ruth; she's got a real superiority complex because her parents are ridiculously loaded and she treats anyone she deems lesser with this really condescending, snotty attitude and I honestly just have no time for people like that. 

Ruth is incredibly overbearing and jealous with my friend. Like, she won't allow him to follow other girls,  even lifelong friends, on Instagram and she routinely goes through his other social media to check he isn't friends with/following any girls she deems ""too pretty"" (which ends up being most girls) kindof jealous. She blames all of this on her bipolar, saying it causes her to be insecure, and if confronted about it, gets upset and tells people she can't help it and they're being insensitive to the mentally ill. 

Here's the thing. I'm bipolar too, quite severely so. I've been to hell and back with it, but have really gotten myself back on track in the past couple of years and am keeping myself relatively stable with meds and therapy. I get the insecurity thing, really I do, but I honestly think Ruth takes it too far and hate how she uses her disorder to deflect. A week or so ago, my car was due to go in for its MOT the same day I had therapy and my friend offered to give me a lift to my appointment. Ruth asked why I was in therapy and I told her it was for my bipolar. She commented that she didn't know I had bipolar too, and I said ""yeah some of us don't lean on it as a crutch to justify acting like a knobhead"". 

Ruth was quite upset with this. She told me I need to understand that everyone's experience is different and she can't help how jealous and insecure she is. I told her that's as may be, but it's on her to recognise that her actions aren't okay and to learn healthy outlets/fixes for her jealousy and insecurity and that trying to control my friend's social life isn't one of them. She's currently super pissed off at me, and is calling me an insensitive wanker and telling me to keep out of their relationship.

509,Asshole,"Ok this has been bugging me so I'd appreciate some outside opinions...My husband's best mate (Jason) has a gf (Cindy) who is known to be quite self absorbed and difficult but we try out best to get along with her for Jason's sake.

Last year Cindy moved into Jason's house and a few months later decided to quit her job and start a massage business (non sexual of course) from the front room of the house.  This caused some tension between them as she was not contributing financially and after a couple of months she had virtually no customers nor made any real effort to get any.

To try and ease the situation my husband purchased a $100 gift voucher from her so I could get a massage and help her out with her business. I was pregnant at the time though and had very bad morning sickness so I couldn't use it right away, then as I became heavily pregnant I didn't feel that comfortable getting a massage.

Fast forward to a couple of months after my baby is born (about 10 months after the voucher was purchased) I contact Cindy to ask if I could book the massage in. She said no problem but she is studying for her advanced massage therapy and could only do appointments on a Thursday. Unfortunately this didn't work for me as I had newborn and my MIL (my only babysitter at the time) was only available on Wednesdays and Fridays (husband worked during the day). So I said I'd leave it for now as I was still breast feeding and preferred to wait until that was over (for reasons other mums will get but probably TMI here).

I finally contact Cindy again 14 months after the voucher was purchased and she tells me that it had unfortunately expired (12 month validity apparently)... when I pointed out that I couldn't book the appointment as she was only available Thursdays she (very reluctantly) relented and said that since I was a friend she would be willing to allow me to use the voucher ""as a good will gesture this time"".

Now I know she did finally agree to still honour the voucher but she really made it feel like she was treating me like a random customer and doing me a massive favour. We would never have bought the voucher if it weren't to try and help her in the first place. So I told her to forget it and threw out the voucher... and now she isn't speaking to me as she thinks I threw her gesture in her face and was not supportive of her business and my husband is annoyed that I wasted $100.

So AITA here?  Should I have just said thanks and booked the massage?

&#x200B;

\*\*EDIT - sorry I forgot to add an important part to the post. There was NO expiry date on the voucher, it was typed up in Word and had about 2 lines on it.

I would have not had so much of an issue if this was a professionally run business but it was anything but. It has since closed and Jason tells us she had approx 6 customers (apart from her brother) in the 18 months since she started it.  They've had numerous arguments as he feels she set it up so she could quit working.

Edit 2:  Maybe I didn’t communicate this properly but I didn’t have a “tantrum” or were rude to her about it at all.  She was very reluctant to honour the voucher so I said just don’t worry about it and left it at that.  
Massage is a very personal service and I didn’t feel comfortable having her do this when she clearly thinks I’m “taking advantage” of her... I’m just annoyed that I was one of her only customers and she made a big deal out of it saying I was rude to even ask.

** I appreciate everyone’s comments, thank you. I think given the feedback that maybe I do have an underlying negative view of her from incidents before this which clouded things for me here too. To be honest I don’t care about the voucher, just wish we’d never bought it.  Live & learn I guess...",57,92,0.87

My understanding is that you do not have to show your boarding pass, and it is something that the companies use to avoid paying more tax. In the past when travelling alone, I have always politely declined to show my boarding pass without any trouble. 

Last week I was at the airport, and was with my partner was buying a bottle of water as I stood nearby. My partner was asked for their boarding card, and turned to me (because I had both of our boarding cards) and before going into my bag I said basically ""ah, you don't need to show it"". 

But the person on the till seemed kind of insistent, so my partner just wanted to show it to them. This wasn't a long drawn out thing, at second ask I immediately pulled out the boarding pass. Afterwards I said it's only so the company can pay less tax, and I personally would rather them pay that tax than keep it themselves. Whilst my partner agrees with that, they say it's kind of an asshole move because the people on the till aren't taking the money, they are just doing what they are told, and might even have quotas to meet. 

I don't care about it THAT much. When i'm on my own, I will politely refuse, but obviously would never make a big fuss about it (especially when my partner was paying, they can do what they want), the only reason I didn't initially hand it over was because I didn't want to rummage into my bag for our boarding passes when you don't need to show it, and also would broadly prefer not to.

On Saturday I went to a concert with a friend of mine. It was a big concert hall (20k people) and we had paid a lot for golden circle tickets (standing within 15m of the scene).  The venue had been generous with the amount of tickets in sale, and the area we were standing in was PACKED. 
We've been waiting for the warm up band to start for about 30 minutes when I notice that there's a rather large space completely empty to the left of it. It probably could fit around 5-6 people, so I grab my friend and go there to get a bit more space.
 When we get there there's a guy in a wheelchair with no concert staff/special marking whatsoever, so my friend and I stand in bit in front of him. He starts saying excuse me, and when I turn around, he asks me to move because I'm blocked his view. I'm a short girl, around 160cm (5'2), so usually not the biggest buzzkill for people around me when it comes to.
 I apologize but tell him that the area is packed and if he wants a better view, he should have booked tickets at the sitting areas. He starts yelling, telling me I'm discriminating him for being in a wheelchair. I've never been one for confrontation, so I turn around and ignore him.

So about 7 months ago I adopted the most ADORABLE kitten from my university’s local pet shelter rescue program. They were at capacity and had to get these kittens adopted ASAP, and since I have an apartment I share with dad, I thought, why not? 

My dad and I LOVE this kitten. He’s quite at home in the apartment and since he was feral, he only trusts us and a handful of other people. 

My parents are divorced, live in different states. Used to live w mom when I was young, currently crashing at dad’s because he’s close to my uni. my younger brother still lives with our mother. My dad and I “share” the cat, but it’s clear he’s mine because I feed him and clean up after him, etc.

Well, when my mother heard about the cat, she flipped. My brother occasionally comes to visit, but is highly allergic to cats, same as her. The thing is, before I adopted the cat, my brother made it explicitly clear that he never wanted to visit my father again. (We have a really rough and abusive past with him but that’s irrelevant here. I’m trying to patch things up because he’s helping pay for my college, my bro wants to cut him off completely.) she keeps telling me to get rid of my cat!

So when our mother freaked out, I explained what brother had said. She said that was no excuse and that he “had to see his father”. I told her he should be able to do what he wants, and that made her angrier. Several months later (now) he actually wants to come visit bc “daddy has money” so my mom is once again pressuring me to get rid of MY cat, so my brother can stay with us for a weekend. 

I’m telling her to just give him lots of Zyrtec or other allergy meds. We are planning on getting out of the house, a little camping trip or something, while my brother is in town so he’s exposed to the cat minimally. Since he doesn’t live here, I feel like that’s fair. He’s my cat, who’s very attached to me. If my brother were moving in, it would be a different situation. 

My mom is very angry, claiming I’m “choosing a cat over my brother”.

So, AITA for not wanting to get rid of my cat?

EDIT- so I saw a lot of stuff calling me TA for “using my father for money.” I actually don’t ask that much of him and he’s not fully paying for my school. I’m trying to be the “better person”, my mom’s words, not mine, and be nice to him even though he was horrible to me in the past. (He actually wants to spend time with me now. He happens to live close to my school. It is convenient) My brother is clearly using our dad for money but I can’t stop him. My mom constantly encourages us to patch things up with him, she never badmouths him. His behavior speaks for itself, unfortunately. Since we aren’t any serious physical danger, she can force my brother to visit since he’s young. Also, my brother’s “severe” allergies are like, a lot of sneezing, watery/itchy eyes, and at the absolute worst a minor cough. He’s never had trouble breathing or anything. He has a hypoallergenic cat at our mom’s place and it’s helping him build some tolerance to cats. I know allergies suck, but we can go elsewhere for the weekend, probably. Hopefully that clears things up.

520,,"Right, let me have it. My girlfriends think I am an asshole and I'm wondering whether it's just me that thinks I'm in the right.

&#x200B;

My husband loves music, plays in a band and is very passionate about what he does. He gigs every month or so in local bars and seems to be quite popular locally.

&#x200B;

I have not been going to his gigs for a while now and I cringe whenever I'm at them. Let me explain why.  


I am a woman in my 30s. My husband is in his 30s.. and the band that he plays in is full on screamo music. I get tossed around in the mosh pit, I spend 3 hours listening to grown men scream until veins pop in their foreheads and for some reason these people love throwing beer - resulting in me going home drenched in beer.  


I hate it. I get it - to each their own, but oh my god I want to drop kick throat punch whoever introduced my husband to this music.   


My girlfriends think I'm not supportive and I am the only one of the ""band wives"" that doesn't go. My husband has never said anything, but I'm feeling a bit bad.

Am I the asshole here?",68,84,0.93
521,Not the A-hole,"I posted this in a comment on another subreddit and people are flipping the freak out.

I recently switched jobs; I’m responsible for managing a lot of people. One of my employees was recently unreachable for six days straight. I was really concerned because he and I had gotten relatively close in my first few weeks of me being at the job and he was a top-performing employee, so I was texting and calling and emailing, but got no replies from him. 

Then, on the sixth day, he sent a text and apologized for being unreachable. He had gotten pulled over and arrested for a DUI (driving under the influence of alcohol). He crashed his car and seriously injured two people. He had been in jail for the past six days. His car was totaled and he lost his license as a result.

My company doesn’t have a policy for this sort of thing, and this employee doesn’t need to use a car to do his job. Nevertheless, I made the decision to let him go. He had missed five shifts. He has a family, so perhaps his SO could’ve called out for him? They didn’t need to explain the situation, just that he was dealing with an emergency and would be out for a week.

I really was feeling no remorse, but after posting a shorter comment sharing this on another subreddit, I’ve been labeled asshole by pretty much everyone who has replied. So, AITA?",106,172,0.96

523,Not the A-hole,"My husband (26M) and his sister (18F) have been very close since she was born. Being 8 years older than her, he basically helped raise her. They are the oldest and youngest of 4 children. Within the past 3 years all but his youngest sister have graduated and moved to different states for their careers. This has been very hard on his sister as his parents can be a bit high strong. They went from having 4 children to boss around to just one.

Recently his sister started dating what I classify as a control freak. He reads through all of her text messages and needs to know where she is at all times. He also convinced her to quit her part time job because it was causing them too much time apart. To my knowledge there is no physical abuse happening. However I am nervous for her. This is not normal behavior.

After a fight with her mother, his sister decided to take all of her things and move in with the boyfriend. She stopped going to school much, though I have been told she did graduate this past week. When my husband found out a few weeks ago, he was ready to jump on a plane home to beat the crap out of this guy and bring his sister to stay with us. The only thing holding him back was that I was due to have a baby any day. 

His parents came out to visit right after the baby was born and told us that they bought a one way ticket for his sister to visit us this summer. She thought it was just a vacation and didn't realize that this wouldn't be a round trip. His parents hoped she would enroll in school out here to be away from the boyfriend. The dad even planned on bribing her to stay by buying her a new car. They basically just decided she was going to move in with us. 

Now I love his sister. But now I have a newborn and I don't want some psycho boyfriend to show up at my house. The idea of an abusive man is very frightening to me and I am scared that he would take his anger out on me and my husband for ""taking"" the sister away from him. My husband is in the military and sometimes has to leave for months at a time. During those times it will only be me, my daughter, and his sister. 

Am I the asshole here? I don't want his sister in an abusive relationship but I also want to protect my daughter from being exposed to this. If I bring it up to my husband I know it would upset him as he's already very protective of his newborn daughter but also loves his sister.

524,Not the A-hole,"I come from a fairly well off family, and my husband and I do well  (although we both work high demand jobs for it). We’ve always been very generous to his side of the family. Gifts are very much both my husband and my “love language” and in my culture (Chinese), elaborate gifts to inlaws are very socially acceptable as a way to show they are held in high esteem. It also helps with some of our guilt for being super busy and not always around. Additionally, my side of the family exchanges generous gifts. One concern of mine originally was to treat my husband’s family the same as my family, i.e. by not spending way more on my family than his.

Last Christmas, we had some weirdness over Christmas day present opening. I had purchased a lovely cashmere throw for SIL (husband’s brother’s wife). She googled the brand and price then and there (which kind of annoyed me) and later I overheard her make some joke about how she could pay “half a mortgage payment.”  Several hours later during brunch, someone asked her what was wrong (she seemed upset) and she confessed that our presents always make her feel bad, she’s tired of us “throwing our money” in her and her husband’s face, and Christmas has become really stressful with pressure over gift giving. Husband and I apologized profusely, and did some self reflection afterwards on the unintentional effects of elaborate gift giving and decided to go more low key in the future. Although a little part of it has always sat poorly with me since. 

This past Saturday, I attended a baby shower for the same SIL. It’s the first gift giving occasion since Christmas and I really wanted to do it carefully. I asked a coworker who recently had a baby what range is typically appropriate (she said she mostly got gifts between $30-$50) and so I decided on three little things from the registry totaling just over $30. Anyways, at the shower it becomes clear that while certainly most gifts were in the $30-50 range, all attendees who were family members seemed to give more like $100 gifts. Near the end of the event, MIL pulled me aside and said that SIL felt like I was being spiteful to her for  Christmas. I again apologized and as a cover, said that husband and I had written a check for the little one’s college fund as well but didn’t feel it was appropriate to hand to her during the present opening. Then I scurried off to the bathroom and wrote a check for $100. When I found SIL by herself for a second I handed her the check and explained that we wanted to give her this earlier but present opening seemed like a bad time. She looked at the check and kind of bitchily said, “We don’t need your money.”

I kind of snapped and told her bluntly (and not like yelling, but not like in hushed tones either - people nearby apparently definitely overheard) that her that I was tired of her shit and if it made her feel better, we could just stop exchanging presents in the future. She started crying and I immediately left. I’ve been getting my texts from everyone in the family and her best friend about how I ruined the baby shower ever since.

(ETA for additional  context - My husband and his family are American and we live in the US. We are in our early/mid 30s, my BIL is 28 and SIL is 24 or 25.)

(ETA2 - I realized her comment might have made the xmas gift sound way more than it was. The throw was 320 pounds, which isn’t quite half a mortgage payment, but not cheap either. I purchased it for her during an business trip to Scotland last year. It is not fancy looking or flashy at all (light grey)  and not a obvious “ designer” brand, just an old Scottish maker. It was intended to be good quality and last many years. If she hadn’t looked it up I don’t think it would have been an obviously expensive gift.)",1776,15292,0.93

526,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account because.... Well, you can tell why.

I'm 26, male. The middle one from a big family. 3 brothers, 3 sisters. We're all ranging from the ages of 38-18, the youngest being my twin brothers.

We're a close family. I was very close with my mums brother (We will call him P). 

As i was growing up, i was more into computers and technology than the rest of my family. P is a software engineer, so naturally i was around him a lot as i found everything he did amazing and interesting. P would often take me to cyber events and computer exhibitions. P was married to a woman but with no children. 

When i was in my late teens, i would often go round to P's house 2-3 times a week to play games and learn how to build computers properly. Me and P would have in-jokes, play games together, watch tv shows, he became like a father figure to me. On my 17th birthday party, I came out to my family as gay. They were all shocked as i don't give off the ""gay vibe"", but they were all really supportive and respected me. P was even more ecstatic than my mum was (was strange at the time, but makes sense now) and we celebrated heavily.

\---

A few weeks ago on my 26th Birthday, i wanted a night out with my mates and i invited P to come as well. Unfortunately it didn't happen on my birthday, tried to reschedule it but everyone was busy, in the end it was just me and P, we decided to go out anyway. We had a very good time, i'd not seen my uncle this happy since before his divorce. We both got very very drunk. I ended up staying at P's house that night and i woke up the next morning to P spooning me. I was still clothed. I went for a shower, while i was in the shower, i heard the door unlock and P came into the bathroom naked. I asked him what he was doing and he asked if he could join me. I told him thats a bit weird. He just said ""please can i join you"". I told him no and asked him to leave. 

I hadn't seen him for a few weeks as it just got weird. It was my sisters birthday over the weekend and everyone was over, including P. I was civil and pretended nothing had happened between us and we were still very good close friends. At the end of the night, it was just me, P and my older sister playing the Xbox in the games room. My sister got bored of losing so she went away. P just started crying out of the blue. I asked him what was wrong and he just said he loved me and wants me. I was speechless, how are you meant to answer that? He then went to touch my crotch and i stopped him and said i think he should leave. He tried to grab my hand and put it on his. I just walked out the room.

The next morning, i told my older sister what had happened as i didn't know what to do. She was disgusted. I asked her not to tell anyone but to help me with it. She immediately went and told our mum. It has caused chaos and mum is exiling P from our family. I feel extremely bad for saying something, i should have just spoke to him about it when he was sober, hes clearly having problems. AITA????",42,82,0.93
527,Not the A-hole,"Basically, I am getting married this Saturday. It is an extremely small wedding, only 40 people, in my parents' country backyard. This girl, we'll call her Angela, was supposed to be one of my bridesmaids. I had asked her back in October and she was beyond excited to be a part of the wedding. We met working in the same company, we both worked at a gym. Fast forward to about two months ago. She quit her job at our gym, and she moved about 20 minutes away. After moving she COMPLETELY stops texting, Instagram messaging, etc. I texted her at LEAST four separate times throughout these two months asking if she was still interested in being a bridesmaid or even attending the wedding as a guest. Not a word. Throughout these two months I could see she was still posting on all of her social media accounts.

&#x200B;

About a week ago at nearly 11 pm, I got a text saying ""BABE! So sorry, my phone hasn't been working!"" That's it. No comment on the wedding or anything. I don't think she even remembers the date. I did not reply as at this point, the wedding was a week and a half away and I had heard absolutely nothing from her for months. Yesterday, she sent me a Snapchat of a selfie saying ""I fucking hate (\*insert Gym Company Name here\*)"" Again, I didn't reply. I haven't heard anything since.

530,Not the A-hole,"My son was baptized yesterday, and our families are in from out of town.

&#x200B;

The first grievance I made against my father was when I took my wife's name when we got married. It took my family some time to get over that and when they arrived for the weekend, they were all wearing custom ""Team Last Name"" t-shirts and hats. We were able to joke about that.

&#x200B;

The thorn of the issue is the baptism gown. My sister mailed me the gown her youngest was baptized in and it was made by our great aunt. This gown was supposed to replace the 100 yo gown her other kids were baptized in (I was oblivious to this fact up to this point, but I knew the dress was homemade). We also received a gown my SIL baptized her son in and a store bought one provided by MIL. I did a baby fashion show the morning of and sent everyone pictures of baby in their gown. The one my sister sent was a little too big and had big bows all over it, he honestly looked like a cute little girl in it. We chose a simple one without really giving it a second thought. I met my family out front and corralled them in and showed them where we were sitting while baby was having a snack with Mom in another pew.

&#x200B;

The sacrament of baptism is important to us and we chose my wife’s sister as Godmother because she is priest. My family sat in the third row, we sat with the Godparents in the second row, the rest of her family just filled in.

&#x200B;

I didn't notice when they left. I assumed they went out to smoke because the service can be long. I was heartbroken and tried to shrug it off when everyone asked me where they went. Nobody would take my calls or answer my texts.

&#x200B;

I come to learn my sister was upset about the gown and was making a big deal about it. She called me and I tore into her. It takes a lot to work me up and I was so angry they left without saying anything. I was angry and hurt. I told her she was petty, and I didn't know anything about the gown being important to her, and that I couldn't believe my parents condones her behavior.

&#x200B;

Hours of radio silence from my family follow. We had a BBQ planned with family and friends afterward and I did my best to keep a straight face. My mom finally texts me that she loves and misses me. She doesn't want my dad to know she's writing me and that she's going to turn her phone off and wait for my response. I did not respond. She finally texts that if I don't answer then it means they don't matter to me. I texted my mom back: I didn't know the gown was important to you and I'm sorry, I never meant to hurt anyone. 

&#x200B;

My mom is saying she hopes my Dad and I can have a one on one chat today. I'm so sick to my stomach I don't even want to see them today. They are all due to fly home in 12 hours and I don't know if I want to bother hashing it out. It seems like every time I'm with them there is some drummed up drama and I just don't want to be a part of it.

534,Not the A-hole,"About 5-6 months ago, I (18f) started having problems with my ears turning red and getting a lil warm. I scheduled an appointment with a dermatologist bc initially I thought it was allergies. Turns out it had to do with the cartilage in my ears rather than the skin. I was referred to a rheumatologist, for whom I had to go make another appointment for, but I couldn’t get in to see her for 3 weeks.

While I waited, my ears got worse. To the point where I can no longer leave my room anymore. I have to sit in my room all day, in the dark, in front of a fan, with ice packs strapped to my head because it’s that bad. The burning is excruciating and constant. I can numb it with ice packs, but only until they melt.

ALSO during this time, my sister (23f) began to experience lots of issues with cramps and pain in her abdomen. It turns out she has an ovarian cyst which is causing her pain whenever she has her period. I by no means discount that fact that she is in a lot of pain. She is very very vocal about how much it hurts. Here’s where I’m frustrated, however.

Once I finally get to the rheumatologist, she basically sits down and tells me that I have relapsing polychondritis. Which is a rare genetic autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the cartilage in the body. Since it’s so rare, they don’t know what triggers it, and treatment is mostly trial and error. They worry about long term because cartilage is everywhere in your body, including the heart and windpipe. If my body started to attack either of those, it could spell disaster. Basically, it could flare up in the wrong place at the wrong time and I could die at a young age because of it. The possibility of a flare up in my heart is a major concern, and I just learned all of this on Wednesday.

Meanwhile my sister is having issues with her cyst again, and is wailing and crying. For sure she is hurting, but also I just learned that I could die at any point. My parents have elected to skirt around that fact, and haven’t offered me a bit of comfort about it, instead focusing on my sister. I am forced (through pure necessity) to sit alone in my room all day long, every day, and have been for the last few weeks. I am extremely lonely. My parents make minimal effort to check on me. At most it’s a brief four sentence conversation and then they go right back upstairs to take care of my sister. Nobody comes to talk to me, nobody comes to see me, nobody sits with me.

Tonight I made it it upstairs to get some food, and I saw my mom in my sister’s room, lying on the bed with her, rubbing her back and comforting her. And seeing how much my mom was caring for my sister while also forgetting me made me feel jealous. I don’t doubt for a second that my sister is in a lot of pain. I’m just jealous that I’ve been forgotten about while I’ve learned that I could die young & that I have an autoimmune disorder that I’ll carry with me for the rest of my life.

I used to date/hookup with this girl and things ended civil but escalated and we are now not on friendly terms. 

We hadn’t been speaking for weeks since there was some hostility between us and she came into work one day and asked if we could talk (we work the same job on campus so she was allowed to be there). I didn’t really want to because she had been annoying me and I was glad that we hadn’t been speaking and her coming in as I was about to start my shift annoyed me again. Words were exchanged and things were said but she had to go start her shift (different place on campus) and she left heated/flustered? And I was just pissed off and now in a bad mood. I guess she got off work early because she came by again, and started saying how “it was unfair that I was placing all the blame on her” and not giving her a chance to hear her out. I asked if we could do this while I wasn’t working and she said okay, so she waited till I finished my shift.

I ended my shift, left the building, started walking, and said “if you want to talk, you better start walking” so I just started heading home. I think I threw her off because she started stuttering and grew flustered and was saying stuff about “how I lead her on, can we just sit down and talk about this” etc. but quite frankly, I was extremely irritated and didn’t want to listen or hear her talk and had told her before that I didn’t want to meet up and talk. In the middle of her talking, she said something I didn’t like so I just pulled out my AirPods and put them in and started playing music because I was fed up with her. She kept following me until we reached my house (5 min walk from where I work) trying to get me to listen, and at one point tried to take my AirPods out of my ears herself even after I told her to leave me alone after I put them in.

Some of my friends are saying I was an asshole but I see it as I don’t owe anything to her and didn’t want to talk to her but she kept trying to talk to me.

So, AITA?


Edit: More info-when she first approached me and asked if we could talk, I said that I had nothing to say to her which then led her to say that it was unfair that I “led her on” and blaming the hostility between us all on her (I still believe it is her fault and which is why I had nothing to say to her) to which I responded “I didn’t” and more negative things were exchanged between us which is why we were both left heated

Edit 2: I originally didn’t add what happened first between us because I thought it was too long to add to the story. I’ll just add the reason why it became hostile: I was uncomfortable with her because I ran into her twice over spring break while we were both visiting Hawaii separately and I felt creeped out because I don’t think it was a coincidence so I told her friend when we came back which is what prompted her to end our already nonexistent friendship with me. 
If you guys want more backstory then let me know.

Edit 3: posted in comments but - We used to date/talk (not official) and I ended it as winter break came. However when we got back, we still liked each other and continued as fwb? (With feelings I guess)  but I specifically told her I didn’t want a relationship. I found her looking through my texts between me and my ex that I still talk to, which of course made me angry and I lost feelings for her there. She did apologize and I decided to forgive her and we were just friends at that point. We would work on homework together still however, she grew more annoying and has a lot of mutual friends with me so I never said anything and just put up with it. Then the spring break thing happened 

I guess to be fair, I was talking to my ex romantically also but my business is my business and we weren’t exclusive just fwb. I told her I didn’t want to be in a relationship but she still acted as if how we used to be last semester",221,383,0.89
537,No A-holes here,"She and I met 8 months ago, during our first year at university. We ended up hanging out accidentally a few months after we met, and quickly developed a very close friendship. What I did not know at this time was that she had begun to fall in love with me.

&#x200B;

Our friendship has always been rooted in complete honesty (to the point of sharing pretty much every passing thought), and so she ended up writing a letter to me, telling me about how she felt and apologizing for it, because she knew that despite the fact that I am an intense LGBTQ+ ally and advocate, I am both Christian and straight. After reading the letter, we met up talked about it for hours. I essentially told her I considered being with her romantically, but at the moment, I genuinely couldn't see myself in a relationship with her, because 

1. I wouldn't want to ruin the friendship
2. I wasn't sure if I wanted to date a girl
3. the family/cultural/religious stuff would make it hard for me to not feel guilty in that relationship, which would be unfair to her. 

She was just genuinely shocked I'd thought about it in any capacity whatsoever—and even more so that I didn't give her an outright no. However, because I left it so open, that made it difficult (read: impossible) for her to get over me.

&#x200B;

We became closer after this, and we currently function almost more as a non-romantic couple than as friends. We went on a trip together and it was phenomenal. We text and talk and think about each other all the time, and I can say that we genuinely love each other. The problem is, I am happy just having her in my life this way, but for her, it's like getting so intensely close to something she desperately wants (which is essentially a life together), but just missing the mark. It's hard for both of us: It might be easier on her if I shut down the idea of a romantic relationship entirely so that she can move on, but I would be lying if I said I wasn't deeply considering an actual relationship. Meanwhile, me being confusing and indecisive hurts her, because she's hanging on to a thread of hope that may or may not come into fruition. She also has opportunities to date other people, but doesn't want to—she says that she can't imagine liking someone that isn't me (which I think will change because people always say their crush/bf/gf/so is ""the one"" and that they'll ""never love again"", but she disagrees). Fundamentally, I desperately don't want to lead her on in any way, but I also don't want to lie and say either yes or no if I'm not sure. I care about her more than anything and want to be the best friend for her that I can be until I manage to make up my mind one way or the other.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR: AITA for being unsure of my feelings towards my closest friend, and in that uncertainty, stringing her along for something that might or might not happen?

538,Not the A-hole,"Hello all! 

So I live in a house with a few roommates, and my space is relatively close to another roommate. The walls are unfortunately very thin.

I'm rustling about sometimes on weeknights, let's say around 11 or 12 o'clock. Perhaps just straightening things, watching videos on my laptop with laptop speakers not fully turned up, etc. Nothing serious. 

Many times, my roommate's girlfriend (who does not live here, mind) knocks on my door and asks me to be quiet. From my perspective, she is quite a noise sensitive person, because I am not playing music or doing anything particularly loud. 

Now my roommate has never once told me the noise was an issue for him. I asked him if he had noise issues and said ""no I don't have any issues, and I sleep like a rock, but my girlfriend has issues so I guess you should talk to her.""

Now I was fine with this for a while, but one time I am literally watching a video on my Macbook Pro speakers on half volume in my own room with the door closed at 11 PM, and she knocks on the door and asks me to be quiet. 

Usually, I've been cooperative with her, but this time, I didn't accept it. My roommate didn't mind any noise, my speakers were not loud nor had any bass, and I'm in my own room with the door closed so I feel I have the right to watch my video. 

I told her that I would continue to play the video at this volume in my own home because I didn't think it was unreasonable, and that if she has issues with it she should talk to my roommate about it. 

Well my roommate doesn't care about the noise. After she went back to his room, I could hear them having a mild argument about it, with it eventually ending (I think) inconclusively. 

If my roommate was really bothered, I would act differently. But I have talked to him and he is not bothered, and it's just his girlfriend, **a person who does not live in my house, only a frequent guest, and does not (in my opinion) really get a say on what happens in it.**

540,Not the A-hole,"Okay so not super long story. I work in a union shop that lets you choose shift by seniority. I have more than enough to go to first in my current area but I'm on third. I was trying to be nice to a girl on first. Her and her bf work first together and they have a small child and she has boys in high school. She asked me to wait to go to first til she can sign for a different area so she doesn't get bumped. I said I would and this was in February. Well she finially was awarded another spot but she declined it. Now she can't get a new spot for 6 months. I think I have waited more than long enough for her to get a new spot. It's summer and I want to get on first.



 I want to know if my bumping her would be an asshole move. She already has daycare for her youngest and with her boyfriend on first it seems that there would be someone home at night as well.

541,Asshole,"My brother met and fell in love with his longtime crush Sue (not her real name) five years ago and they decided to get married soon after. Three years before they met, Sue had divorced her abusive husband and they have a daughter together from their short marriage.

A few weeks before the wedding, one day my good friend Gemma (not her real name) rang me up and she told me that she needed to see me because there was something really important that she needed to tell me. So we met at a coffee shop and she told me the truth about Sue. Years before Sue and my brother met, Gemma’s brother was on a business trip in another city and there he ran into Sue, who was working as a prostitute at the time. They had sex and grew really close and Sue revealed to him that she went into prostitution because she had no choice. She just got divorced and was in a financial crisis and needed money to support her daughter. Gemma’s brother felt sorry for her and he continually supported her financially for a year until she finally got a job and was able to support herself and her daughter.

Gemma thought that I needed to know about Sue’s past since she was going to be a part of our big family. She said it was up to me what to do about it since it was my brother that Sue was going to marry. I felt really conflicted whether I should tell my brother or not. My family is a well-respected family in town and such a scandal would definitely ruin our good reputation. But after considering it for a while, I decided not to tell him about it. Because I believed everyone has a past they want to forget and leave behind. Who am I to judge her? I tried to justify her going into prostitution because she was going through a very difficult phase in her life and was ‘lost’ not knowing what to do.

Weeks ago, my brother finally figured it out on his own about his wife’s past, and he is now really hurt and devastated. He wants to divorce her but they have 3 little kids who would be greatly affected by it. What hurts him the most is the fact that she had kept her past a secret from him for many years. He does not know what to do now. He feels betrayed. He left their house and is currently staying at my parents’. To make things worse, after my brother told our parents about his wife, my father had a nervous breakdown and went into depression for days and had to be hospitalized for days.

I still haven’t told anyone that I have known about Sue’s past for years. And now I am feeling so guilty for this predicament that is going on in my family. I think if I had told them about it before the wedding years ago, this would have never happened. Am I The Asshole?

INFO :

My brother found out about her past from his co-worker who had ever been involved with her years ago. It's how he found out about it and that she had kept it from him that hurt him the most.

INFO 2 :

My brother did not leave their house as in abandoning her to take care of their kids on her own. He's just in a very bad place now and can't look at her. My dad is very old and weak and has had some serious complications in the past so it's all too much for him to digest. Thanks to everyone who calls him a drama queen. 

My brother on the other hand is more hurt because SIL has lied to him. She told him that after she divorced her first husband, she went back to live with a friend in another city and started working there for a while. I have asked him, if he had known the truth, would he have been okay with it still and married her anyway? 
He told me he doesn't know. He could have accepted her for who she really was or broken up with her immediately. Either, he loves her so much and it hurts him that she has lied to him.",610,2346,0.93
542,,"Title about sums it up.  I told her days ago that the cup was on the line tonight, and this was a game I cannot miss. She didn't accept my offer to watch together, which we do sometimes but she's not crazy about hockey, so she planned to stay home tonight and do her thing. This is very normal for us, sometimes she joins me for the game sometimes she passes.  This is the first time in our relationship I that I've made it clear I will not be willing to do other things during the game.  She was understanding, as hockey is by far my biggest hobby.  So just to get ahead of you reddit relationship experts, don't even start with the ""SHE HATES HOCKEY YOUR RELATIONSHIP IS BAD YOU ARE BAD"".

She calls me crying during the second period.  She took mushrooms that her shithead father gave her and was puking and tripping.  I immediately asked if she was okay, does she need an ambulance.  She said no she's just worried. I googled symptoms and she appeared to just be having a mild overdose.  

While I was furious, I didn't want her to die or anything. I don't know much about mushrooms but in any OD situation it's a concern, so I wanted to be sure she's okay while also trying to put aside the fact that she did some dumbass shit and was now expecting me to bail her out.

So I left her on speakerphone and just let her tell me her thoughts, which she requested, just stay on the line with her.  I honestly didn't listen to a word she said, i'd just check in with her if she stopped talking.  I finished the game, had dinner, called her back later.

She was mad at ME for not going over because she ""needed"" me.  I told her multiple times on the long phone conversation we just had that I didn't go because her plan, which she told me while ODing, was to never tell me that she even took the mushrooms.  She only told me because she was ODing.

I'm mad that she did it.  I'm mad that she wanted to break up with ME (she has since taken it back, admitted she was wrong) because I didn't go to her when she ""needed me"".  Fuck that.  I am 29, she is 25.  She wanted to do drugs, she did her drugs and got her side effect.  I saw the Blues blow game 6 and I didn't enjoy one second of it. But goddamn it as much as I love this woman I am not her on-call babysitter when she makes a dumbass decision.

544,Asshole,"When I was a lot younger, I had a great relationship with my mom, but the relationship has dwindled in recent years for many reasons (mainly me becoming a typical teenage boy). I feel our unsteady relationship and how she has to tell me multiple times to do something (like a teen and their mother do) is what affects her opinion of me.

This all started when we were driving home from the store, I like interesting facts and I read aloud a post from subreddit r/TodayILearned. The post said about a folklore tale explains autism by saying something along the lines of like the infant is switched out for the child of a fairy or demon which explains the child's mood or lack of social interaction. My nephew (her grandson) has autism, but I didn't make this connection in my mind because I knew how fucked up that would be. And then she says, ""You better not tell Emily [my sister] about that."" I love my mom, but some of the things she does can really piss me and my dad off, but this pushed me over the edge and I lit her up. ""I'm not going to do that. I would never do that. Why in the hell do you think I'd do that!? God damn it, mom! Why do you think I'd ever do such a horrible thing!? I never would and it really pisses me off you'd even get the thought in your mind that I would ever do such a thing!"" The only thing I regret was actually saying it out loud instead gritting my teeth and holding it in as I usually do. She was silent for the rest of the trip home and I was super uncomfortable because I thought I had upset her.

The same thing almost happened today at my graduation party, which she spun into a housewarming party at the last second (another one of those things that piss me off). We just recently moved into a new house and of course we have new neighbors, one are an older couple from Russia. I only know the husband's name is Aleksandr and his wife spends a lot of time at home because she doesn't know English. Well I was joking around with my friends saying I'm trying to learn Russian through video games and I said ""Brosay granatu"" and ""Prikroyte menya"", which translate out to ""Use your grenade"" and ""Cover me"". ""You better not say that to Alek."" I was wanting to call her out for it again, but we had guests and I didn't want to make a scene.

Before you say anything, I don't usually talk back to her like this. My dad taught me to pick my battles and I do; if I always talked back to her, she would have probably kicked me out a LONG time ago. I'm not posting this because I think she's an asshole and I'm in the right, she's my mother at the end of the day and I'll always love her, I've just felt bad for raising my voice at her like that even though I do feel like I had a valid point. Am I an asshole?",19,36,0.92
545,Asshole,"Well first, my girlfriend does not like my brother for a few incidents that have happened between them in the past. The most recent one was when her aunt died in April. She and her cousin went back to their hometown for a week for the funeral. During this time my brother's girlfriend broke up with him and he invited me to the strip club, it really isn't my scene but I felt like if it were to help him get over his girlfriend I should go. I never told my girlfriend about it thinking she would never find out and it would never be an issue. Fast forward to May, my girlfriend sets my brother up with a new friend that she met thinking they would get along well. He told the new girl that we went to a strip club with me, and the girl reports it to my girlfriend, who was furious with both of us. I've been trying to make up for it ever since, but I still don't think I did anything wrong because I was doing something that was therapeutic for my brother.

&#x200B;

So yesterday my brother asked me if he could use the laundry at our house. (My girlfriend and I live together.)  The laundry is in the garage, so he does not even need to go into the house so I thought that she wouldn't even know he was there. I asked her if it was okay, and she said no, she didn't want him there. Again, I thought there was a chance that she wouldn't even see him while he was there, so I gave him the key to the side door of the garage. This morning when I left for the day she told me she would be leaving to run errands and have lunch with a friend of hers. I asked her when she would be back home and she said around 3:00 PM. So I told my brother to leave before 3:00. My girlfriend ends up getting home early and my brother is still in the garage. She hears someone moving around in the garage and calls me asking me to come home right away. She goes outside and sees my brother's car and realizes what is going on. So being angry as hell she calls some friends and they help her move her stuff out, including our dog. She tells me she's angry that I keep going behind her back and she doesn't trust me. She breaks up with me and JUST leaves. I feel like she overreacted and everything I did was because I am trying to be a good brother.

&#x200B;

UPDATED: Okay I am REALLY confused now. I don't know if she was manipulative or if I'm the asshole or what. I need to think about this more...

&#x200B;

SECOND UPDATE: So apparently I am the asshole. Like always. I tried to text her earlier and realized she had blocked me on all social media, and my number. I figured she would be at her brother's house so I drove over there. I knocked on the door and asked him if I could talk to her. She came out, and in front of her brother, aired ALL OUR DIRTY LAUNDRY. (Sorry for the pun couldn't resist.) She told me that she was sick and tired of me lying to her throughout the course of the relationship. (she threw away three years over this btw.) She said she wasn't super mad about the strip club thing, but about the fact that I told her her friend was lying about it, and she cut off contact with her friend after that and that led to her losing other friends, and then I later admitted that we did go. She then proceeded to list all the times my brother had been shitty to her, and how she didn't feel safe around him and she didn't want him in the house because he's apparently disrespected her many times and she didn't want him coming in and using soap, electricity, etc. I told her she was being over dramatic and crazy like always and she broke down crying (like she does to win arguments.) I told her that she was being manipulative and controling, and that people on reddit had agreed with me about this, and that her crying was another way to manipulate me.  Her brother told me I needed to leave, and I tried to apologize to her, but he was insistent that I leave, he's also kind of a pain in the butt. She called me about 20 mins later, and told me she couldn't take it anymore, that I had caused her too much pain and was sorry, but didn't want to continue the relationship. I realize that THIS TIME, I did fuck up. I shouldn't have let my brother into the house without me being there when she said he gave her anxiety and made her uncomfortable.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

THIRD UPDATE: Okay, I guess I can see how people think I was being an asshole. After I made the last update I decided to call my sister, who was at work but ended up taking the rest of the day off to talk with me. I did not tell my brother what was happening because I did not want him to feel like the break up was his fault. I am very private and had not told her the extent of my relationship problems. She told me that she was ashamed of my behavior, and she felt like I needed mental health counseling. We spent the whole day talking. My sister is a little mad for having to take work off, but it was a crisis. She helped me set up an appointment for counseling, and I have decided to was best to break up because the relationship was toxic for both of us. That you for your input.",125,49,0.72
546,Not the A-hole,"So the other day I went to the movie theater and tried to sneak in a couple of mini bottles of wine and some candy into the movie theatre. 
My girlfriend wanted to put it in her purse instead of her pockets because they never check her purse. We go in and get movie tickets and popcorn and I  ended up holding her purse as she got a soda. 

As we walk through the entrance to the movie the attendant asks to check the purse I'm holding. I'm still holding the popcorn and some snacks so it takes me a minute to give him my girlfriends purse he opens it and removes the wine as I  expected and says we can get it back when the movie is over. My girlfriend got furious as we were walking into our movie saying he had no right to check her purse and how he was intentionally trying to embarrass her. I tried to just say he was doing his job but she wouldn't listen. She didn't want me to eat the popcorn because she said she was going to dump it at the attendants feet and make him clean it up. She wouldn't talk for the whole movie and got mad at me when I took the popcorn and tried to eat it as fast as possible. I told her there was no way she was throwing anything on the floor. She got even angrier at me for taking his side and being weak and giving him her purse. 
We've been fighting over this ever since. And I  yelled at her and told her she was being a bitch. Am I a asshole?

Edit: wow this blew up I only expected to get a few comments that being said, we usually whisper to each other during movies low enough that noone can hear us. 
My GF has worked retail before and usually is very nice to retail workers so it was just very strange for me. Also the place has a liquor license and serves alchohol at some veiwings. And to those saying they only care about alcohol not food they took my milk duds too.",614,2904,0.94
547,Not the A-hole,"Heres whats going on: My sister a couple years back got her license, so my parents made a deal with her that if they got her a car she would have to get a job and start paying for it monthly. I (f) was 13 at the time so I wanted nothing to do with it. 

2 years have gone by. Im now 15 and a half, have my permit, and already have a job set up when I turn 16 in August. My sister (22) still hasnt gotten a job, hasn't put a penny in for this car, and has no intention of getting a job before I turn 16. 

I go driving in this car a lot, and I really like it. Its pretty, it runs smoothly, it has a sun roof, and theres plenty of space. It has become my dream car. So I asked my mom if since my sister isnt paying for it, if I could take it off my dads hands when I get a job. Theyd both still have their own car (we have 3) and it would be 300 dollars less monthly my dad has to pay. I told her how excited I am to get my own money and hopefully the car and to go out with friends and go shopping etc.  

When my sister heard about this she immediately argued ""it was a gift from mom and dad"" and ""they never said id have to pay for it"" and ""it's my car. My names on the lease."" 1. No it wasn't. 2. Yes they did and 3. We can redo the lease. She even started crying and accusing me of ""taking over everything"" and saying ""You dont get the car its not up to you.""  Which I rollesd my eyes at because shes 22. 20 fricking 2.

Another thing: she doesnt even have anywhere to go. No job. No college. No friends. She doesnt go anywhere. Id have school, a job, friends houses, and going shopping once in a while. And she doesnt like driving. Whenever mom asks her to pick me up from school she says ""you know I hate driving"". And shes not registered to drive since we recently moved states. (Another edit: Shw hardly uses the car. She used it like once a week in our old state and hasnt driven it at all in the state weve now been living at for 4 months. My mom has mostly been using it. Like I said before she hates driving with a passion and wouldnt use it much)

There are so many reasons that I should have this car and not her, but I cant tell if I'm being selfish or greedy or a spoiled brat or whatever. I just really want this specific car. But anyway, AITA for trying to ""take"" my sisters car? 

Edit: Sorry I didnt mention this before but while I was napping my sister asked my dad about it and during dinner he said ""And another thing, grandpa has like 50000 cars in his driveway Im sure he'll give you on of them"" So I guess he's on my side?

Update:My parents said if I give them 300 a month I can have the car no matter what my sister says, so I guess Im getting the car.",33,50,0.91
548,Not the A-hole,"Title pretty much sums it up. 

My group of friends from high school had a reunion last night. After dinner, we went to a cafe because we're enjoying catching up with one another and gossiping abt what's up with people in our class. My HS best friend (let's call him A), whom I'm no longer that close to anymore because we drifted apart after college, said he wanted to share something sensitive. He blurted out that someone from our class was HIV positive. I froze since I know who this person was (let's call him C) and discreetly signalled him to stop talking. He changed the topic so I felt relieved. After a while, I bid my goodbyes since I had an early appointment this morning.

A while ago, I found out that A still revealed to the group after I left that the HIV positive classmate is C. I am so furious. I work in healthcare so I know how wrong this was and A is also a doctor so he obviously knew this was extremely inappropriate and a violation of C's rights.

549,Not the A-hole,"This has been driving me nuts and I want answers. 

I was at a gig a few weeks ago. It was at a medium sized bar, not hugely busy but a decent audience for a Thursday night.  During the break I went off to the ladies toilet to take a leak (nothing unusual there, I am both female and a keen consumer of water so peeing is necessary). While I was in the cubicle, someone tried to open the door.  

""Taken!"" I said, loudly enough to hear but not at all aggressively. A few seconds passed and someone tried to open the door again.

""TAKEN!"" I said again, louder. 

A few seconds passed and someone tried to open the door AGAIN. At this point I know for a fact it must be the same person or couple of people as there are only two cubicles in the bathroom and nobody had left the other one yet. At this point I had only been in the cubicle for just enough time to take a leak and clean up so it's not like I had been in there for ages and holding up the line. I just ignored it, but they kept trying to open the cubicle door and started banging on it.

So, I yelled ""OH MY GOD IT'S TAKEN! SOD OFF!!!""

I finished up and left the cubicle to wash my hands. As I emerged, there was a line of women waiting for the toilet, staring at me like I'd broken into their house at Christmas and shat on the Christmas tree. 

Am I losing my damn mind? I consider it to be polite to let people finish their business without banging on the door multiple times in a twenty second period, and being told to sod off when you won't leave them alone is perfectly reasonable.

so around 20 years ago I had a one night stand, it produced my amazing daughter kate. I was working below minimum wage at the time so for the first 8 years of her life money was incredibly tight. I managed to get a better job and have been able to save 5000$ for university. she moved out at 18 and   now has her own place. 

she decided last month that she wanted to do university, she just had to decide what she wanted to learn there. she decided on becoming a P.E teacher. 

she knew I had the money and so asked for it to go on fees, she also asked me how much it was. I told her (quite happily I might add) that I managed to save 5000, she was not impressed and complained that she would have to get a job or take out loans. I explained to her how I struggled with money when she was born and that I tried my best.
that was not good enough in her eyes. 
I was then called a bitch and she stormed off. 

she came over yesterday and asked for the money, I told her that because of her recent issues around the money I'm unsure if I want to give it to you, I worked hard to earn that money and you complained it was not enough. she then burst into tears and left.

551,Not the A-hole,"Okay so over the past few years my mom has changed quite a bit. She changed from being friendly and caring to vindictive and hostile. This change was catalyzed by the death of her abusive mother.
However, these last few months have especially been unbearable as her behavior has been extreme. She struggles with substance abuse and I suspect bipolar depression (I’m no doctor but all the signs and family history is there). I’ve been the only one of my small family of four to always comfort and support her during her adult temper tantrums and it’s very emotionally and mentally exhausting. I’ve had many talks with her and she just cries, say some bullshit about her past and my dad, and then stays clean for no more than a week before she’s back to being an asshole. I’ve pushed her to seek professional help (I helped find a doctor and set up her appointments but she stoped going, that’s if she ever went in the first place).
She has cheated on my dad, burned through thousands on coke binges, and started many verbal and physical fights with us. I am 1/3 her size and she has repeatedly try to “fight” me before someone steps in. I’m extremely worried for her health cause I know her body can’t keep up with these habits for much longer and she is putting others at risk when she’s driving drunk. I’m hoping a few months in prison for driving under the influence and/or possession of illegal substances will be a strong enough wake up call for her to heal over any past griefs before she ends up OD.
I don’t know if this would be the right thing to do. Will karma get me back for purposely trying to get her locked up over this and putting my dad through the legal and financial strain to defend her?

My girlfriend and I made our decision based on what we thought was best for us at the time. Everything really has been fine other than this

I made it VERY clear before I moved in the if we were to live together, her daughter could not be sleeping in the same bed as us. I have sleep apnea, and my sleep is very important as I have a fast paced job I need to be on top of things for. 

I told her if this is something that she didn’t want to do, PLEASE DONT FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO FOR ME. The last thing I want is for her to feel like I’m getting in between the relationship of her and her daughter. I would more than happily find my own place but she insisted she would make the transition. Cool. 

Recently she has been putting her to sleep in our bed then taking her into her room instead of laying with her in her room. It’s more comfortable and they go to bed a bit earlier than I do when she has her. No big deal but a bit annoying as I have to wake my gf up to
Move her kid, to which she’ll usually fall back asleep while I’m brushing my teeth then I’ll have to wait again. 

But tonight she had been coughing a bit all day and I wanted to get to bed a bit earlier because I had to be up earlier than usual. I just politely asked my gf if she could put her to sleep in her room because every time she coughs, I wake up. She has brought her in our bed at 3-4am in the past (against our agreement, because she doesn’t want to lay in there) and I was woken up every 15 minutes by her coughing. 

She got mad saying “it must be nice not having to worry about anyone but yourself. God forbid your sleep gets interrupted one night” and just totally went off after a calm request. Yes I get it, she’s her daughter. I respect that 100%. But we made an agreement and that’s why I’m frustrated here. I’m sitting awake right now because they’re in our bed. Am I an asshole for just not wanting her daughter to be in our bed during the hours we would be asleep?

Edit: her daughter will only fall asleep with her mom by her side at home. I have tried! I wouldn’t have moved in with her or even be in a relationship if I didn’t very much care for her daughter. She loves playing with me and we’ll have a great time but she is very clingy to her mom at bedtime when she’s tired.",88,30,0.79

My husband and I don't have or want kids, but we have nieces and nephews and friends with kids and we genuinely love the little fuckers. I do ask most of my coworkers with kids about them now and then and if one of them has a funny or cute story about one of them I eat it up. All this to establish that although I'm childfree, I am by no means a hater of children. I just don't find them to be the most interesting and fascinating topics of conversation most of the time. 

One co-worker, unfortunately, seems to have built her entire personality around being a mom and it is fucking OBNOXIOUS.

Even more unfortunately, she sits right by me in our open concept office. 

I'd basically already gotten to the point where I don't ask her how her weekend was or what's new or anything else since I already know it'll just be another 20 minute tale about her kid doing absolutely nothing worth hearing about. 

On Friday she somehow managed to squeeze a story about her kid trying on shoes (spoiler alert: it was literally just them going to the store and spending an hour picking out and trying on different shoes and then they got slurpees) and I just sort of had enough and when she finally finished her story I just deadeyed looked at her and said ""you know I don't give a shit about any of that right?"" 

She was pretty taken aback and didn't really know what to say. Finally she just said ""um.. ok... That's rude."" 

I probably should have just left it but I decided to tell her ""look, I get that your kid is the most interesting person in the world to you, but he isn't to me and I'm sick of hearing about every little thing he does. I don't care."" 

She was clearly pissed and just turned back to her own stuff and didn't talk or even look at me the rest of the day. 

I'm pretty sure Monday morning is gonna be awkward AF but I'm not sure whether I should apologize or not because I genuinely don't want to give the impression that I didn't mean what I said - I really, truly am sick of hearing about her kid all day every day - but I also want to smooth things over so it's not just s big ball of tension all day for god knows how long... 

Am I the asshole for saying what I said? And WIBTA if I don't apologize?

Edit: I should have been clearer in my OP that it's not just that she talks incessantly about her kid and none of the stories are remotely interesting, but that she interrupts whatever anyone else is talking about to insert a story about her kid and makes ever single conversation about him one way or another. It is literally impossible to talk to her about *anything* else.",65,126,0.91
554,Not the A-hole,"Let's start by explaining that I am American and my husband is Chinese. His parents still live in China and do not speak English. I don't really like them, even before the situation with our children, and that may be why I'm so against the Chinese name thing. I'm looking for some outside perspective.

 January 2018 I gave birth to our first child, a daughter, but she will stillborn at 39 weeks (umbilical cord wrapped around her neck). This absolutely destroyed me and is something I am still working to come to terms with. My husband's parents looked at one picture of her and that was it. My father-in-law thought his coworkers words were so comforting he would share with me a few days after, ""maybe you lost her so you could have a grandson."" This pissed me off to no end, but what hurts the most is that they never asked her name. They do not want to know their first grandchild's name. My husband said it is because it makes them sad so they don't want to think about it. She is never mentioned or acknowledged.

Now on Valentine's day of this year we were able to welcome our little rainbow, also a little girl. My in-laws love her and are absolutely thrilled when they video chat with her. Recently my husband has mentioned giving her a Chinese name so his parents have something they can call her because they don't speak English. I don't want to give her a Chinese name because they are not willing to put in the effort to learn her English name or the Chinese equivalent. I especially don't want to let them name her since they have so casually blown off her sister. 

The way I see it, I was only able to give my first daughter her name. It is all she has from us and the only way for others to remember her. They didn't want to give her a Chinese name so why would I let them give her little sister one. I know it may sound petty, but honestly really upsets me that they have never once asked about our first daughter's name.

So AITA?

Edit: I appreciate the input, except for the remarks that I'm somehow racist - completely out of line - and it has really given me a lot to think about. I never want my 2nd to feel she is less than my 1st and would never want to do anything to harm her. I think I will sit down with my husband and we come up with a Chinese name for her. My issues with her grandparents are my own and shouldn't be pushed onto her. Though I think they grieve in their own way, I think it is not outrageous for me to expect that they know our first daughter's name. I understand there are cultural differences, but I feel that does go both ways so they could be more understanding of me as well. I will work on things and pay more attention to how my actions may impact my living child. It never occurred to me that SHE may be impacted and that is the biggest asshole move. I'm not 100% sure how we will go about this, but I now see how I was being selfish.",288,684,0.94

So I'm a furry and I like to draw monster characters and fantasy stuff a lot. Nothing too weird, mostly cartoony animals with swords.

My friend designed a character for an adoptable (if you don't know what those are, essentially they're pre-designed characters you pay for, and then you can do what you want with the design).

The thing is, my friend made a character for sale that was essentially a COPY of my main fursona, except with a single color swapped out. Everything else was the same (same fur markings, species, eyes, hair, even same accessory...) the resemblance was uncanny.

The sold the design for $50. I was mad, but didn't say anything because whatever...it's not that big of a deal and i can always modify my character. Fast forward a few months, I get a message on furaffinity that the person who bought the character is essentially accusing me of stealing a character that THEY bought with money. The situation escalates and essentially I told them to ask my friend for a refund. The person responded by making a callout post and using screencaps of me telling them that the design wasn't fully made by the artist.

559,Not the A-hole,"   My best friend of 6 years visited me about a year ago for a week and brought her boyfriend that I had never met. They stayed with my and I gave them my bedroom and everything. A week before the trip I had to make the most difficult decision of my life and go through with an abortion after a conversation with my doctor about how great of a risk a pregnancy posed to my health. I was distraught, but I talked with her and we agreed it would be a good distraction for me and nice to have a friend close by at that time. 

Fast forward to the actual visit and she doesn’t leave her boyfriends side for one minute, (literally they even went to the bathroom together) I chauffeured them around and they sat in the back seat together while I drove, and I did not get a moment alone with her to talk about how I was feeling. 

I get that this was her vacation, but she knew I was struggling and it would have been nice if just once she pulled me aside just the two of us and asked how I was doing. Emotionally exhausted from having to play the gracious host when I was a mess, I broke into tears the final night and she apologized but it didn’t seem genuine at all. It was the hardest time in my life and I needed a friend and she wasn’t there for me. 

Since then, I haven’t bothered talking to her. It hurts and I do miss her, but she let me down so much. She messaged me recently and I just don’t know what to say anymore. AITA for not wanting to make time in my life for her anymore?

edit: That was also her first time meeting my boyfriend. Him, only caring about how I felt, disliked her already two days in. He and his friend cancelled plans to stay home and play board games with us to make sure I was included. He was completely attentive to me and me alone and was civil with them but otherwise didn’t bother. At the end of the week she told me she didn’t like him because he had friends over and didn’t make an effort to include her boyfriend.",178,1278,0.97

He used to be in the Air Force but was medically discharged for back issues.  I believe he was at 80% disability.  He currently works full time as a GS employee and makes great money between that and his Air Force pay. He recently sat down with me and said he wanted my help to find a better, nicer home for him as he was successfully able to get 100% disability and will no longer have to pay taxes on his property and where we are located, that's a significant amount.  Well, my friend and I are avid golfers. We play full 18 every couple of days and some days we walk the course. We hit the beach, fish, laser tag and work on his truck.  Just about anything normal guy friends do with family. Never does he complain of pain or show it in any way.  Yet he has also told me he likes to play the sick role when he gets to the Dr. Office and he did that a lot recently when he was trying to get 100%.

She ended up turning away and taking to her friend. I didn't interrupt their conversation or anything so I felt that she was being really rude.

563,Not the A-hole,"I am a 43F single mom of a 13M. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for the past 12 years. About two months ago, I was having a terrible period in my life, and made some changes all at once. I quit my job, moved back to my hometown, ended my relationship, and went off all my meds. It was a very hard couple of months for both myself and my son. We are both starting to feel better and things are getting back to a good place. I am on different meds and have started a new job. My son is doing pretty good at school and is happy to be back in our hometown. 

The issue is that my ex-fiancé got ahold of my mother when we first moved out to let her know what was happening and that I was not in a good place. My son also reached out to my mother when he was feeling particularly down and wanted someone to talk to. She basically blew him off and never bothered to check back on him again. She never contacted me to check in either.

Some backstory: she believes in “tough love” and “codependency” and believes this means that it’s ok to just basically ignore her children (all 3 of us are adults) if they are struggling, or unhappy, or even need to just talk. By ignore, I mean she has already cut my youngest brother (39 yrs) out of her life because he struggles with PTSD and alcoholism and will not check himself into a hospital which is what she thinks he should do. So she refuses to have anything to do with him and basically pretends he doesn’t exist.

In regards to me, she abandoned me at age 1 to be with the man she cheated on my father with and her two babies she had with him. She did eventually get visitation rights and I saw her on the weekends for years. She was physically and verbally abusive for most of my childhood towards me and my (half-) brothers as well. She smoked pot constantly and drank a lot too. 

Over the years I have done a lot of therapy and pretty much got over most of my issues with her, and have had what I thought was a pretty good relationship with her for about 15 years. It was always up and down, but I just went with the flow and up to now, she has been a decent grandmother. 

Fast forward to now. She hasn’t spoken one word to me since I told her I quit my job two months ago, and as I mentioned, she blew my son off when he tried contacting her when he was upset and worried about me. I honestly never expected her to help me in any way, but a check-in to see if we were ok would have been nice. Now that I know she blew off my son, I am furious and hurt. 

I want to cut her out of my life completely but my best friend thinks I should give her another chance. I think it’s bad enough that she deserts her own children but now that she has deserted mine, I am done. AITA for wanting to just cut the cord and be done with her for good?

My stepdaughter will come into the yard while we’re practicing and insist on participating. I asked her once to let us be, and my wife crucified me for it. I also let her participate once but didn’t slow down my throws, hits, and running at all because I’m trying to make my son better, not cater to my stepdaughter.

So basically: awhile ago my mother made the decision to cheat on my step dad (who I absolutely do not get along with most of the time) and has recently told him everything due to the man she was seeing suddenly breaking it off with her. She had told me (17 f) about it while it was going on btw, which added to a lot of stress I was already under. 

She had been lying almost constantly about where she was, even to me, and when she confessed I thought it was over and the lying would stop and I could start to trust her again.

Cut to this weekend, we had scheduled a camping trip with her, myself, my two younger siblings, my girlfriend, and our mutual friend. We got there last night and it was really fun, all were having a great time. Then this morning, I woke up and texted her about breakfast, and she said to just help ourselves to the yogurt and muffins we brought. She also said that she had left to go help my grandma with something and to occupy ourselves until she gets back, okay, fine, whatever, nbd.

She was gone for SIX FUCKING HOURS. She comes back later and I was understanding at first, then I asked what it was that my grandma needed help with and she said she wasn't at grandma's. She said ""I needed to go try and fix something, but it couldn't be fixed. I spent five hours driving there but it was for nothing."" 

And I was *furious*. Not only had she lied to me about where she was, but she had ruined the plans for the day as we had planned on going fishing at a nearby lake all day (and she had taken the only car). By the time we had left it was like five and I'm currently sitting here an hour later seething because of all that wasted time and potential. 

The reason I want to cancel all future trips with her (and probably eventually cut her out of my life once I move out) is because when I told her I cannot trust her anymore, she just said ""The feeling is mutual."" To which I don't even know what she was talking about. Later in the car when I was brooding, she told me ""I'm a big girl. I don't need your approval. I have needs and I went to take care of them."" And I told her I was mad she just left us there during what was supposed to be some much needed family time doing my favorite summer activity. 

I feel extremely betrayed and like she prioritized the person she went to see (the man she had only known for maybe a month, whom she was cheating with) over me and and the rest of her family.

When I got in the Uber, the driver (who I must stress was VERY friendly and personable) asked if it would be okay if he picked up another passenger on the way to my destination, “to kill two birds with one stone”. I tentatively obliged because I felt awkward, and I assumed he had the option to change the pricing from regular to pool in order to pick the other passenger up. Instead, he pulled up Lyft, and picked up two other passengers. They were also not told they would be sharing the ride, as they were both visibly surprised and had to have the situation explained to them. 
From there, the experience was fine. We were going the same way, the other passengers were no issue, and the driver truly was pleasant and attempted to make conversation amongst us. 
However, I checked, and I was still charged the full amount, as if I had ridden solo. The difference is almost $6, which isn’t a ton of money but it’s the principle more than anything. 
I am strongly considering reporting him, but am feeling super guilty. I know a lot of people who use Uber driving to work their asses off and who really need the money, the guy is just trying to make a living.

I recently moved into a new flat, in a very remote area. I'm on the 5th floor and surrounded by trees mostly, but there's one higher building across the road. And apparently, the people that live there have a really good view into my huge bedroom window from their balcony (only from their balcony).Now I have some sensory processing issues and prefer to be naked whenever possible (read: when I'm in my own private 4 walls, of course not anywhere public) because fabrics on my skin tend to get irritating. I've never had anyone complain about this before. Of course I don't flaunt my nudeness in front of the window and stand there waiting for someone to take a picture, and most of the time the curtains are drawn. I thought the chances of anybody catching a glimpse were slim to none.

Well, apparently the neighbours caught a glimpse anyhow, and not just once it seems. First, I had a note in my postbox, asking me to please not show myself naked anymore. I sent them a note back, saying I didn't have to cover up in my own flat, but would be more conscious of it from now on and that they were free not to stare at my window from their balcony. Fast forward a few weeks and my boyfriend visited me, I forgot to draw the curtains. It was night, we had no lights on, I did not think about nosy neighbours possibly being on their balcony at 2 am.

On Friday, I got another letter from them, more formal this time, saying they were going to have me charged with indecent public exposure for having sex ""right in front of them"". I maintain that my flat is not ""public"" in any way, and hence not their business at all. Are they out of line, or AITA?

580,Asshole,"I've been with my boyfriend for about 8 months now and things have been going really well. We live about 30 minutes apart and his house is bigger, nicer, and closer to downtown so we spend much more time at his place than we do at mine. My boyfriend has been living in his house for almost ten years and is in the process of purchasing it from the owners. They have always been very leniant about him painting/marking the walls so at some point my boyfriend thought it would be fun to start a height chart on one of the walls for him in his roommates (like parents do to keep track of their kids growing.) Over time, it became a tradition for friends and family to mark their heights and names on the wall. My boyfriend is really popular and therefore the wall is filled with friends and acquaintances. He loves it because it gives him a reminder of all the people who he cares about and is a fun thing for guests to do when they stay over. 

However, my boyfriend also has gathered a fairly large number of exes over the years and their names are on the wall too. Every time I walk by them I'm forced to think about their relationship. It makes me so uncomfortable. Yesterday, when he was at work and I was in a terrible mood so I went and erased his exes names from the wall. The pencil marks are old and one of them was written in pen I think and made big smudges on the wall. I tried to clean it up but it's pretty obvious they were erased. 

When he got home, my boyfriend noticed and asked me about it. I told him the truth and that it wasn't healthy to hold onto the past like that. I told him I didnt want to live in a museum of his past sexual history. He got really upset and told me I was being possessive and overreacting. He then said I was going to make it awkward the next time his exes came over (they are still friends and are dating other people in his friend group) because they will notice their names are gone and will think my boyfriend did it. 

I'm just upset he cares what they think and isn't respecting my comfort in his house. I've asked my friends and have gotten mixed answers. 

AITA here or should he be more accommodating to his girlfriend?",705,2917,0.93

584,Not the A-hole,"So a bit of background, one of my three roommates is extremely tidy, to the point of outright obsessiveness. Every week he sends a new complaint to our group chat... 'someone put a non recycling item in the recycling bin,' 'someone has left a plate in the sink for several hours,' 'please put more plastic wrap over item X in the fridge,' 'the tongs are just for salad nothing else' yada yada yada. I can see the look on his face twist whenever he's in the room and sees me make some small kitchen error, it terrifies him and he seems to restrain himself in the moment but it's obvious he gets really upset about every small thing. I'm not some slob, I always clean my dishes and put them away as soon as I'm done, and sweep the floor and wipe the counters etc. I've tried to be accommodating to him but the other day he sent me this text 'FYI' followed by a photograph of the three kitchen hand towels hanging in the positions he likes them to be in, each circled with a color coded list of individual uses, ie 'this one is for drying dishes,' 'this one is for wiping the counter,' 'this one is for drying cast iron pots' etc. I found this to be vaguely condescending and oddly obbsessive so I ignored him and went about my usual routine.  Later he brought it up again and I bluntly told him I do my best to be clean in the kitchen but I'm not consulting some diagram every time I need to use a hand towel, and that he should buy his own and do what he wants with them if it bothers him so much. I also told him not to text me anything like that again unless it was a matter of absolute urgency, like the kitchen is on fire. He doesn't seem thrilled with my response. Thoughts?",24,52,0.98

587,Not the A-hole,"Two years ago, my mom divorced my dad and immediately started seeing a guy she’d known for a while. It was pretty obvious what happened — but that’s not spoken of. 

The past year my mom started bringing him around a lot more. At first it was weird, but we’ve been nothing but nice to him and we make conversation to make him less uncomfortable and to let him know we don’t hate him. Just being nice and easing the tensions. 

Anyways, fast forward to this Mother’s Day. I made my mom a big roasted chicken with homemade gravy and all the fixin’s. My mom brought her boyfriend over, which I was fine with. I love cooking for people. I worked really hard on everything all day and finally, everything was done and all that was left was to carve the chicken. 

Now, since I was in the kitchen all day, I didn’t realize how drunk they were getting. 

My mom has her boyfriend carve the chicken and y’all, when I say he absolutely butchered it, it looked like a giant pile of chicken you’d tear up and put into your dogs bowl. There were NO slices. Just torn up chicken bits. I don’t even know how he fucked it up THAT bad. There were even tiny pieces of bones scattered. But I didn’t say anything, whatever maybe he’s just bad at carving. I should’ve done it. My fault. 

Then I notice he can’t even form a sentence or open his eyes at dinner. I finish eating as quickly as possible because I realize about to throw up over everything I worked all day on. I clean up the table and he stammers outside. Then he gets in his car and drives away. 

This man, who couldn’t form a sentence minutes ago, who ruined dinner and the main dish I cooked, who knows I almost died in a drunk driving accident when I was 16 and how against drunk driving I am, just got in his car and drove off. 

Ever since then, I haven’t talked to him while he’s over. I completely ignore him other than a “hi.” I feel like a cunt, but I just really cannot bear to look at him or make conversation. I know it’s hurting my mom, but I have so much hatred for him. AITA?

EDIT: he’s been aware this upset me since a week after this happened and has not apologized or showed any signs of remorse, nor any acknowledgement that this happened. He’s seen me several times. 

EDIT #2: for those telling me I should have called the cops, I understand completely. I’m awful with cars and didn’t know what kind he drove, his license, or his route home. I now know his car type and license. You’re completely right, and I wanted to, but I had no beneficial info to give at the time. I do now.

588,Not the A-hole,"I’ll just get right into it. My aunt had been staying with us for 4 months. We never saw her  often because she lives on the other side of the country but my mom took her in after a horrible divorce. I immediately noticed that she was acting a little weird/loony but I attributed that to having gone through so much with her husband. My brother (who’s 20) seemed to make a lot of effort to spend time with her but I didn’t think anything of it because why would I? 

I came back early from work one day and heard really loud noises. The more I listened, the more I realized someone was definitely having sex. I instantly thought that my brother brought a girl home or something because the noises came from his room. His door was somewhat open so I rushed past it to get to mine only to be stopped dead in my tracks when I saw the back of my aunt, clear as day. I instantly felt like throwing up and managed to get to my room without them seeing me. In there I pretty much collapsed, contemplated my existence and the utter fucked-up-ness of my family (I knew it was fucked up, but not like this) Then I just felt scared. I didn’t know what it meant. I knew it was wrong, very wrong, but not what to do about it. I was also honestly super scared for their well being, especially my brother who had already been abused by my cousin as a kid (my aunt and mother were also abused by my uncles. This what I meant by fucked up family). I just kind of panicked. 

So the next day, my aunt went to work and I knew she would be there late. When my mom came home, I instantly told her I needed to tell her something. I sat her down and told her exactly what I saw and heard and she went BALLISTIC. She stormed to her car and drove to my aunts job. My aunt never came back. 

My brother is now very upset with me. He told me that they’re two consenting adults and can do whatever they want and that they weren’t hurting anybody and that it was never my business. He has all of his stuff packed and he’s planning on driving across the country to be with her tonight. My mom is still livid about it and told every single one of my family members. They all HATE my aunt now and want nothing to do with her. This made me feel guilty because they used to absolutely adore her. 

Now I’m stuck wondering if I made an asshole move by “telling” on them. My family is a mess, my mom who already had issues has seemingly gone off the rails, my aunt is all on her own and my brother might never forgive me.

EDIT/UPDATE: My brother left late last night/early this morning to be with my aunt. I tried to stop him but he was adamant that none of this was her fault and that he was the one who started it and couldn’t let her deal with this on her own. He also said he’s been in love with her since he was a kid. Before he left, he told me that he isn’t angry with me and apologized for being upset before. I told my mom he left and she had no reaction.",1441,12305,0.93
589,Not the A-hole,"I am currently a male sophomore at university. During sophomore year of high school I met a girl, Sarah. We became good friends. She also introduced me to a guy a year below us named Adam. Adam quickly became one of my best friends and I enjoyed spending time with both of them.

Throughout sophomore year I began to develop feelings for Sarah. She was the first person I ever had a really big crush on in high school. But Sarah had a boyfriend at the time, so I backed off. 

Eventually however, she was single. In response I tried to get closer to her but I didn’t express my feelings. During these times she would occasionally be weirdly dismissive toward me.

For example, I would take her to a dance and she would agree, but she would completely ignore me the whole time. She would agree to go on a date-like hangout but ask me to not post anything about it. I tried to just give up and stop talking to her, but she would always assure me that she really enjoyed spending time with me.

This continued until Senior year of high school when she told me that she would never date me because she wouldn’t want to risk our friendship. I respected her decision and actually tried to leave her alone, but she didn’t want that.

After graduating high school and going to University, I decided to try to distance myself from Sarah and meet new people. However, Sarah would call me almost every night to inform me of her issues she was having with guys and that stuff.

This confused me as she knew I had feelings for her, but it felt like she was rubbing it in my face that I couldn’t date her by talking about relationship issues. But I tried to be understanding and explained to her that I wasn’t really over her and that talking to me about guys made me feel sad. I understand you should be able to talk to friends about that stuff, but I was ready to stop being friends with her since I couldn’t provide that service.

Sarah took it well and still wanted to be friends with me. I was okay with this until she asked me if I thought she should fuck a guy she was talking to. 

That was my limit, I went to a therapist and explained my situation to them, and they said I should cut off my relationship with Sarah and that she was keeping me around for affirmation, so I did. She was very understanding and told me to take all the time I need.

Now, Adam is graduating high school and is having a graduation party. He invited me... and Sarah. I would never make him choose between his friends so I politely declined the invitation and suggested that we could hang out some other time. But he called me a pussy for being “afraid” of Sarah and that I should just go. And he showed me that he was texting Sarah and she wants me to “get the fuck over it for a couple hours.”

So, I obviously could go and ignore her, but seeing her there would ruin the whole experience for me.",25,50,0.9

Context:  I'm in a friend group with a couple of people and one of them (I'll  call Cal) sometimes will stay up really late texting in the chat. I  don't do this because I like having a good sleep schedule.

So  I'm sitting at my computer watching youtube videos when I get a call  from Cal. I pick up the phone and I get an answer from somebody who  obviously isn't Cal because his voice is much deeper and threatening. He asks if I live with my grandma and I replied I don't and that I was  just staying with her at the time. He also said that I shouldn't text Cal at 3 in the morning and how would I like it if he texted my grandma that late. I realized that I probably shouldn't be giving out that kind  of information to a strange person who I've never met so I hung up on  them.

I got a text from Cal a little while later, he told me to take him off the group chat which was fine with me but also that it was disrespectful to hang up on him mid-conversation. I replied that I didn't have to talk with him and I don't want him calling me or my grandma. I also told him that it's not my fault he texts in the group chat that late and I've never texted in the chat that late, just him and my other friends.

I  told my other closer friend about all of this and he sided with me  saying that Cal's dad was definitely in the wrong and that's not cool  especially when I didn't do anything wrong.

I  agree with what my close friend said but I also understand that it is  disrespectful to hang up on people if they're still talking to you,  however he was being really aggressive and I didn't know who he was so I'm really confused. AITA?",15,36,0.97

My boyfriend has repeatedly told her about the dangers of this. We also know that the 12 year old step sister is charged with babysitting them while they are at work, which includes swimming.

I respect that parenting is difficult and messy along with the fact that the girls may exaggerate to their dad about some things. My real worry is that pool.

604,Not the A-hole,"I left on a weekend trip and asked my brother to house and dog sit for me. I left clear instructions for feeding, exercise, and temperature control for my dog along with very clear instructions that I was to be unavailable by phone and if an emergency happened to call my partner who had cell service (though he was with me 10 hours away). My dog is 12 years old and a large breed, so she is pretty old and I wanted to safeguard against potential issues like overheating.

I left cell service for a day and when I got back, there was a text from my brother. He had texted me 12 hours previously saying there was a problem with my dog, that she wasn’t doing well and couldn’t really walk. He did not text anyone else. He did not call anyone including a vet. He did not contact my partner at all, despite clear instructions. He texted me and went to bed. He did not take her into the vet until after I called him and told him to - 12 hours after he texted me. The symptoms he listed sounded serious (disorientation, difficulty walking, no appetite, sudden onset). 

My dog is fine. She has an inner ear issue that was throwing her off balance so she couldn’t walk and was too nauseated to eat. But we only learned she was fine after the vet. If it had been heat exhaustion or something more serious she could have died or needed a significant amount more treatment. I’m not convinced he would have taken her to the vet.

605,No A-holes here,"I'm getting a major surgery done in about three weeks and I was told there's a 60-80% chance it will kill me. It's 60% if I do all the things the surgeon told me to do to prepare for the surgery (take supplements, gain weight fast, lots of protein) and I'm following all the rules. So let's say my chances of dying are 60%. That's not great but not too horrible.

The thing is that I've had this exact surgery before and I came out just fine so my family has no reason to think this time will be any different (aside from the risk involved with any surgery). However for reasons involving My Medical Condition (TM), this time the surgery is riskier.

My family consists of my older brother (28M) who I (27M) live with and my mom (54F) who lives on the other side of the country. My brother is very protective of me and my mom still acts like I'm her little boy. The only reasons I could think of to tell them would be:

1. Give them time to prepare for the possibility of my death. BUT I don't think this is something they can prepare for. I'm sure they'd just be miserable for the time leading up to the surgery. I don't want that.
2. Give us all a chance to make happy memories before the surgery. Again I don't think that can happen when we'd only be doing it because I might die soon. It would feel forced and desperate and they would only be pretending to not be miserable and I'd be unhappy because I would know they're miserable.

I'm leaning towards ""ignorance is bliss"" for everyone involved. If I survive, no harm done and all that potential misery would be for nothing. If I die, well that's a risk of any surgery and their final moments with me wouldn't have had that misery. And with My Medical Condition (TM) it's unlikely I'd make it to retirement age anyway.

But is it right for me to hide something this big, even if it's to spare them pain? What are your thoughts?

EDIT: The surgery is 100% necessary. I WILL die without it, but it would take maybe a year or so and be very unpleasant.

Edit2: I've already gone over how I'd want my body dealt with the last time I had surgery (donated to science or cremated if science doesn't want it). I have no debts and my brother knows about all my bank accounts.

Edit3: I will write letters to them.

Edit4: Maybe I wasn't very clear about this because a few people have commented about it. I'm not hiding the surgery itself from my family, just how risky it is. They're going to come see me off and we'll say our I love yous and good lucks at the hospital.

Edit5: I already have an advanced medical directive from the last time I had this surgery.

And YES I promise to post an update if I survive! You're all very sweet for wishing me well. It turns out Reddit isn't as scary as I feared (I just joined and this is my first post).

Edit6: Thanks to everyone who responded with their thoughts! I honestly don't know what I want anymore. There seems to be no good answer and spending the last 4 hours reading what everyone has said and thinking about my upcoming surgery has left me feeling pretty drained. I'm going to take a break and recharge.

EDIT7: Okay I'm feeling very overwhelmed here. I was only expecting to get 10 comments, maybe 20 at the most. Now there's nearly 400 comments. I wrote this post feeling pretty confident of my decision but I wanted to see if anyone out there had a different perspective, another point of view that I hadn't considered. After reading over 100 of these comments I don't know what I should do anymore. I'm feeling guilty for hiding this but I can't see what the right thing to do is. There probably *isn't* a right thing to do.

So many of you have shared their stories and experiences with the death of a loved one. I'm truly sorry you had to go through that and I appreciate your perspectives. I'm going to revisit this in the morning and look at this with fresh eyes.

PS: To all the people who are setting reminders for three weeks (a bit morbid but I understand) you should make it for four weeks. If I survive, I'll need time to recover and get out of the ICU before I come back to Reddit.",2407,12800,0.98

This vacation is coming up within a month and I just found out my girlfriend is pregnant. She's super worried if I were to leave and now I'm so confused on what I should do.

My parents would lose out on a lot of money if I didn't go, but I feel terrible if I were to still go. I wasn't able to go on our last family vacation due to personal issues so I wanted to use this one to spend time with my family.

607,Asshole,"I'm 23 and recently bought my first home, choosing it specifically because it was close to my aunt. The area had a focus on being family friendly, which I was aware but thought no biggie it just means don't do anything obnoxious or dangerous and I got on fine with everyone for the first 6 months.

&#x200B;

Anyway I call prostitutes over quite a lot. At the start I requested they dressed in casual clothes and acted as if they were my friends, but honestly it's fairly obvious what they are. After doing this for a month the neighbours stopped talking to me or have short rude replies, which confused me for a while but assumed it was just cause of my age. A few months pass and I decide to have 5 round for my 23rd, unfortunately the area got very congested with cars. Next morning see them all off and taking the wheelie bin out, when someone 2 houses down  is shouting that it's disgusting and he's calling the police about it. I said he can, it's not illegal which just made him even more mad and he started going on about how I'm bringing the quality of the neighbourhood down. In the end I said it's not affecting anyone and went to my aunts house, she said it's really starting to piss everyone off and wants me to stop.

AITA for having prostitutes round in a family neighbourhood?

&#x200B;

A things to mention:

They are ""high end"", all from the same agency, extremely professional and work white collar jobs. e.g. They in no way could lead crime to the neighbourhood.

They've only blocked the street up once on my 23rd, every other time they've parked on my drive.

There are lots of young children/families, but nothing inappropriate happens outside.

There was nothing I had to sign restricting this sort of thing, and prostitution is 100% legal in my country.",84,40,0.64

609,Asshole,"Don’t want to make this too long, but need to provide a bit of context. My niece just finished her school year And is staying with my husband and I for much of the summer. It’s nice because own daughter is 13 and they’re very close. More importantly it gives my niece the chance to spend time with my parents (her grandparents) who are elderly. 

I don’t have a pool so when the girls want to swim, we go to my parents’. They live in a condo complex with a communal pool. I would say that the majority of the people in this complex are older/retired. And we live in a fairly reserved community overall. 

I have noticed that my niece has been getting a lot of..looks..from people when she wears her swim suits. It’s hard to describe the bottoms but most of her butt shows in them (I’m not sure if quite counts as a thong, but it sort of looks like that to me). And the bikini tops don’t leave much to the imagination. I don’t think people are looking at her in a pervy way. More like they’re a bit shocked. My mom hasn’t said much but every time my niece would get out of the pool, she’d practically tackle her with towels and this mesh cover up thing, which was almost comical. 

Anyway, I pulled my niece aside the other day and asked if she had any suits that showed a little...less. She said the suits she packed were all the same style, so I offered to go shopping and buy her something. I tried to explain my reasoning and approach the issue gently. But I think I offended her nonetheless. 

I was feeling a bit bad so I asked my husband if I went about this the wrong way.  The whole topic seemed to make him uncomfortable though so I just dropped it. Anyway, it would be nice to get some neutral perspectives over whether I was wrong here.",1358,4147,0.95
610,Not the A-hole,"My stepson is going through a typical teenage-attitude phase. He’s 14, and has decided that he no longer needs to follow the long-standing custody/visitation schedule. His mom lives near us, so making changes to the schedule isn’t all that difficult, but his capriciousness about it has made things VERY challenging. He’ll say he wants to be at our house then change his mind last minute (and vice versa), so making any real plans is next to impossible. 

I do all the shopping (I buy all the groceries). I’ve always made sure to keep a variety of things that everyone likes on hand (favorite fruits, preferred type of peanut butter, snacks, etc), but lately food has been going to waste because he changes plans so often. For instance, he likes a specific type of milk.  The last two times I’ve bought it, in anticipation of him
being with us, it’s spoiled because he flip-flopped the schedule last minute.  I estimate I’ve thrown away about $100 worth of groceries in the past month due to this.  So I stopped buying those one-person groceries.  

He came over (last minute change) last night.  We had to order in dinner, because I wasn’t planning on cooking (since I didn’t know he was going to be here, I didn’t take anything out to thaw or prep). This morning there was a huge row because we didn’t have milk or his usual bagels (we had the type his dad and I eat, but he doesn’t like those).  I told him I didn’t buy any because I had no idea if he was going to be here or not.  He got angry at that and texted his mom who then called his dad (my husband) and told him that I was making Son unwelcome by not “refusing to have the food he likes” in the house. 

To my shock, my husband seems to agree with her.  He said I should just plan on him being here, since this is his house also (yes, of course it is), and if the food goes bad then so be it.  I said that I’d be perfectly okay keeping the food for him stocked if I knew he was going to stick with the schedule he had and not constantly make last-minute changes.  I’m not a housekeeper or paid cook!  I love having him here, but the complete inability to make any plans at all is just too much.

I am terrified thinking this man abducted her as i have not seen the mother so i call mall security and they approach the man and point tasers at him and he freaks out. They tell him to get on the ground and threaten to call the police and then the little girl asks ""why are you doing this to daddy? what did daddy do?"" and from this point we found out that the kid is biracial, her father is black and that man is her father she just happened to look really white. I profusely apologize and the man is very patient and understanding saying that many people doubt he is the father as he looks nothing alike. As for the mother, apparently she left while the man was there and i somehow didn't see her leave and the man came to pick up the daughter to take her home.

I feel really guilty about the situation and my friends and coworkers have given me a lot of shit about it. They've told me that i should feel ashamed for doing that and making such bold assumptions and a couple people have even gone so far as to call me racist for belting that the man is kidnapping her because he's black or that he can't be affiliated with her because he's black.

My daughter (32/f)

My son (27/m)

I love my kids equally.  

My daughter lives at home rent free, which has allowed her to pursue her passion.  We don’t charge her rent and so she’s built up a good deal of savings (~50k).  

My son is a bit more aimless.  He has a college degree, but he and his girlfriend have chosen to pursue a more nomadic lifestyle.  He supports them (gf doesn’t work) and does odd jobs/gigs.  They have lived in Airbnbs for two years, until about a month ago.

Last week, my son came to me to speak in private.  Apparently, they have been living off of credit cards and now my son owes ~30k.  There’s no way he’ll be able to pay that off on his current job.  He has moved back in and is looking for more steady work, but it’s going slowly as he has little career history to speak of.  Meanwhile, the creditors are calling constantly.  The debt will inevitably grow with interest.  My wife is pushing hard for son to file for bankruptcy to manage this. 

I don’t want my son to file for bankruptcy.  It would be a huge stain on his credit and make some jobs impossible to get.  I believe my daughter should loan him the money out of her savings.  When I pass all my children will have is each other.  They should learn how to rely on each other more.  

I told my daughter I think she should loan son the money.  She got extremely angry and left to live with her mom.  Her mom, my wife, and my daughter are all angry at me now.

625,Not the A-hole,"A bit of context to establish a pattern of disrespectful behaviour.

I live in the basement apartment of a house, the main floor is a separate unit as well as the upper floor/loft. We all moved in at the same time about a year ago and the landlord does not live in the house. Early on it became clear that unless I did most of the maintenance (snow shoveling, yard work etc.) it would not get done by anybody. I honestly don't mind doing it as I would rather look at a nice neat home and it gives me an excuse to get outside. That being said I have never even had gotten so much as a ""thanks"" from anyone else in the house.

I wont deny that this has built up a fair bit of resentment. The main floor tenants are also very inconsiderate with noise. Stomping in the doors and walking around with boots and hard shoes at night, having parties mid week and leaving their yappy dogs home alone barking all night on a regular basis. I have never complained to the landlord or the city about the noise and always addressed them directly in a respectful way rather than trying to get them in trouble.

Clearly this is about more than just Tide pods.

We share a laundry room with the main floor tenants and the top floor tenant has their own. There is a row of cupboards and we each have our own to keep laundry and cleaning supplies in and to this point I just trusted that no one would steal things like that from their neighbour. Well I had noticed that we seemed to be going through our pods rather quickly so I took a peek in their cupboard and saw that they didn't have any of our own so I decided to do a little experiment. I simply counted how many were in the tub waited until they did laundry and then counted them again. Sure enough there were two pods less. So I took the remaining pods out of the laundry room and left the empty tub on the dryer with a note that said ""buy your own, thief.""

For what it's worth if they had asked I would have gladly given them whatever they needed.

Later on that day one of them texted my S/O apologizing and saying they were ""in a bind"" and would replace the pod later. They played it off as if it was a one time thing which I do not believe although admittedly o do not have any proof one way or the other. Either way later on that day there was a whole new tub of pods outside my door. 

I am satisfied with the outcome. They took something that wasn't theirs, I called them out and they apologized and replaced. End of story. My S/O thinks ITA for being rude and creating a hostile living space.

I had a crush on Kristi and she comes onto me strong. She sends me unsolicited nudes after a week of asking for my snap. Should have been a red flag.

634,Not the A-hole,"So yesterday I was walking up and down a public boardwalk playing Pokémon Go since it was Community Day. At one point I noticed there was a wedding congregation off to the side of the boardwalk in some grass since the boardwalk is very scenic in places being right next to the ocean.

The boardwalk runs east to west, so the wedding congregation was to the south of the boardwalk. I was walking by the congregation on the boardwalk looking at my phone catching Pokémon when suddenly some of the guests and venue staff (I guess they work for one of the buildings nearby) started yelling at me to get out of the way.

Initially I was extremely confused because I didn’t see anything to get out of the way of, so I gave the staff member a confused look and he pointed at something, which turned out to be the bride waiting off to the other side of the boardwalk (the north side to keep the geography consistent).

Now in my opinion there is no way I could have seen the bride off to the side unless I physically turned around because she was sort of hidden behind some plants. While I continued to walk I asked the staff member “where should I be walking?” and their response was again “get out of the way”. Again I asked “where should I walk?” and got the same response. 

At this point I decided the best way to get out of the way was just to continue walking until I was past the wedding but I was still getting shot dirty looks by the guests. 

So AITA here? I felt like a jackass for walking through but at the same time is it reasonable for them to block the whole boardwalk when it’s a public place and not give people an alternate route to walk around?",30,67,0.88
635,Not the A-hole,"10 years of details I'm skimming over, but here's the general gist:  


In my early 20s, a circle of friends and I loved this fun, albeit immature, guy we'll call LI. He's a hyper competitive guy but always seemed extra fixated on challenging me. Said maturity and competitiveness got worse with each passing year.    


By our mid 20s, he got caught on this loops where he would repeatedly say, ""I'm going to bang your sister,"" ad nauseum. After I called him out on it in front of a bunch of our friends and thoroughly embarrassed him by reminding everyone how a guy he hated in high school was currently dating my sister, his immaturity and general shitty behavior went into overdrive.   


He PMd me on every social media account I had with, surprise, ""I'm going to bang your sister."" Outside of her romantic interests treating her with proper respect and care, I don't care about my sister's love life in the least. Don't know why he thought that line would get to me. But the creepiness, disrespect and immaturity was wearing thin.   


He seemed to come to his senses and asked me to come meet him at a bar to hash things out. I agree. His apology started out okay enough, but ""... so sorry about all that. But I'm going to bang your sister someday. You know that, right? I will."" (Narrator: He did not.)  


Then I  completely cut him out of my life. Told circle of friends never to invite me anywhere there's a chance he'd come. They obliged. Circle and I slowly grew apart. I'll never know how much was because of LI vs natural life flow.   


Five years after that, we have a chance encounter where he says we need to ""bury the hatchet"" and asks for my phone number. I give it to him knowing full well it's blocked and had no interests in undoing it. The next day at the same music fest, I spot him standing by himself in the wings, watching my every move for about 3 minutes. Fucking creepy.   


By happenstance, a mutual friend of ours, let's call him SB, that I'm still fairly tight with gets engaged. SB informs me he wants me both me and LI to be groomsmen and might make me best man. I thought about it for a week and then informed him there was no way in hell I would be in the wedding party or go to a bachelor party with someone that disgusts me. Sure, it's their day, but it's also my life.   


Understandably, SB and his fiance', who I'm also friends with, are pissed. However, SB decided at the last minute he was not coming to my destination wedding last year due to a ""lack of funds."" Sure, it was pricey and inconvenient as hell. No offense taken. However, he seemed to have plenty of funds when he went to a Vegas bachelor party a month before our wedding.   


SB and fiance' asked me to reconsider a few times now. I'm sticking with my decision. They haven't made theirs.",58,312,0.96
636,Not the A-hole,"I recently took my 3 kids to a children's museum. It is a three story building filled with tons of activities for kids of all ages and a great way to let your kids explore freely. 

Third floor is solely an art exhibit. 

Second floor is a music center, innovation/building center, and a water center. Intended for older kids 5+

First floor is a mini city. This is where we spend most of our time. The older two (6 and 4) run off to play as I make my way to the toddler area. This is a small gated space intended for children 3 and younger to play without being trampled on or getting in the way of older kids. They have a wooden fence built around the play area that is waist height and a gate that is intended as the entrance so parents can enter and sit with their toddlers. Since I have a child who is not quite two this is the perfect place for him to play. 

When I get to the toddler area I see a child who looks about 10 and is playing with the styrofoam blocks. Her parents are blocking the entrance and when the girl sees us she closes the gate so we can't enter. Since the gate and surrounding fence are only waist height its not difficult for me to pick up my son and place him gently over it and let him play. She scowls at my son and tries to keep all the blocks to herself. I call my sons name and say ""look at the pretty flowers"" attracting his attention to them instead of the blocks. The girl quickly moves over to the flowers and tries to keep him from playing. 

Now I'm irritated. My first thought is that this child might be special needs and wants to play in an area less chaotic, totally fine. But her behavior is uncalled for. I ask her kindly if my son may play with her and she shouts ""no!"" I'm taken back and look at her parents for a little support. Nothing but blanks stares from them. Well, this is a designated area for toddlers and I then say to her parents ""my son has a right to play here whether she wants him to or not."" The girl stands up and kicks the blocks that she had been playing with and one hits my son. The parents give me nasty looks as they open the gate and walk off with their daughter. I'm livid. I call after them and say the least you can do is apologize on her behalf. She is absolutely out of of control and should not be around other children if she can't play nicely and share. They call me an asshole and leave the area. My son is not phased by any of this and is now stacking the blocks playing happily. 

I felt justified at first, but now I'm wondering if I overreacted. My son could have played in the other areas it just meant more work for me, chasing him and making sure he didn't get trampled by other kids. I'm wondering if I am the asshole for making a big deal over this?",279,3116,0.91
637,Asshole,"We own a small house, only 2 decent bedrooms and a small office that's about 15x10ft. We can't move as we own (or we could but it would be overkill). We have a 2yo who we usually play with in our living room but I tire of cleaning up that room every few hours because it can get a little chaotic.

My husband uses the office as a music room. He's got four guitars on the wall, a shelf of pedals, several speakers, a piano, etc. He takes is very seriously. So seriously it's his only real hobby. He likes to work on his car and gardening and stuff, but music is his first love.

I want to propose to him we use the office as a playroom but unfortunately this means the music stuff has to go. We have nowhere else to put this stuff as it does indeed take the room. This gives us our living room back and makes my life a little easier as we can sequester the mess in one spot which doesn't see much traffic. But this is the only thing my husband is truly passionate about. Maybe he can compromise and keep one acoustic guitar (because you don't need any of the other stuff for it).

Would I be the asshole? I want to ask /r/AITA before I make a sore mistake.

638,Not the A-hole,"One of my good friends (R) recently lost her beloved dog. He was thirteen and died due to age related illnesses. R was still pretty taken aback and fell into depression. She didn’t contact a lot of us for a long time and after trying to initiate contact for a bit ourselves, we decided to give her space for a bit. 

R held a funeral service shortly after his death, which was a couple of months ago. I live two hours away from where she does so by the time I made it (there was unexpected traffic) for the two hour service most of it had been over. I couldn’t have left earlier than that either because it was my dog’s birthday that day. FYI I had been there for his funeral, this was just his funeral service. 

My dad got hospitalised in the past month. It was pretty serious, and due to this I barely contacted any of my friends. We also had summer vacations going on so I had no reason to see them (we’re all in the same college). 

I recently contacted R again, and she blew up at me. She told me I was the worst friend ever for not ensuring she was okay and not asking her how she was. She also told me I was a shitty friend for not making it to her dog’s funeral service on time. I was pretty baffled because this wasn’t like her at all. She told me I was such a narcissist that I was always full of myself and I couldn’t ever be there for anyone else. Mind you, I hadn’t told any of my friends about my dad because I just didn’t want any of them to know yet. 

I told her how I was going through stuff too and she mellowed down and things seemed to go back to being okay. Until recently, when I started seeing her on a regular basis again. No matter what happens, she’ll bring her dog up. I’ll give you and example. 

“Hey R, guess what! I’m going for a show this Saturday!”

“Oh that’s nice. I can’t go because my dog just passed away”

I was like WTF! I understand she’s really upset about this but I don’t know why she keeps acting this way. I don’t even know if I’m justified to feel this way because she did go through a lot but I don’t know why she’s acting like it’s our fault he passed away. AITA?

Edit: I think I should’ve specified what exactly I meant by ‘birthday party’. We had an exam that day so I got home at around 3. I didn’t throw a party for my dog, we just cut a cake my mom baked. The cake cutting got delayed because my sister hadn’t reached home from work yet. So we waited for her and I left for the funeral service AFTER that. I’d notified my friend I’d be late beforehand but that I’d make it earlier than I actually did. There was unprecedented traffic so the 2 hour trip took 2.5 hours. By the time I reached only half an hour of the funeral service was left which was mainly people chit-chatting.",60,76,0.88
639,No A-holes here,"So, a little backstory: my son’s birthday is today. My friend’s daughter’s birthday was almost a month ago, in May. My friend also has a step-daughter whose birthday IS today, however, the birthday party is not for her. The birthday party is for a kid whose birthday was in the middle of May. 
We (husband and I) opted to have our son’s birthday party (with friends) next weekend because there’s an annual festival that’s here this weekend, but we are having family over this weekend. My friend knew this, but still wanted to have her daughter’s birthday party from 1-4 today, and stressed that her daughter really wants my son to come. She hasn’t had any plans (over the past few weekends) but still opted to wait almost a month to have her daughter’s birthday party.  Also, although she usually doesn’t take her kids to the festival, she knows I ALWAYS take mine and she knows we’re having family over today. So now, on top of having to do the “guests are coming” clean up of my house, pick up a cake and fruit trays, go to the festival, and then have family over for 3 o’clock,  we have to squeeze in a birthday party for a kid whose birthday party was a month ago. I’m feeling pretty overwhelmed. 
So, AITA for being annoyed that my friend chose THIS day to have her daughter’s birthday party when her daughter’s birthday was a month ago? (I haven’t said anything to her about it, and probably won’t unless she asks)",43,144,0.93
640,Not the A-hole,"My friend's father was dying of cancer and his family doesn't have a lot of money. They were struggling to pay hospital bills and also had to think about a funeral and headstone in the future as his dad was not getting better. These were the days before GoFundMe, so they had a spaghetti dinner benefit for him, where you paid for a plate, paid for a dessert, and they had a 50/50 and a Chinese auction. 

We spent money on everything. At the time, my husband and I were fresh out of grad school with shitty entry-level jobs, so we were really struggling financially. Loan payments were coming in on top of our living expenses, so we were incredibly aware of every dollar we spent. This was absolutely a no-brainer for us though and we didn't feel any anxiety about spending money here for our friends.

So as the night wore on, it came time to pull the names for the 50/50. I won. I can't actually remember how much money it was, but I think it was between $200-250. My husband and I were happy about winning obviously, because of our financial situation. Any little bit helped at that time. I was feeling a little guilty about winning since I knew it was a benefit and that their family really needed the money. I asked my husband if we should give the money back to them, or even donate some of the money back to them. We technically wouldn't miss the money since we didn't have it in the first place and the only reason we had it was luck. We kinda went back and forth but eventually settled on keeping it due to us being broke young adults. We did really struggle with the situation and only kept it because we were behind on bills at the moment.

After the raffles, people started to leave. We were sitting with our friends and heard a few family members say things like ""I was hoping to win the 50/50 because I was going to give you guys the money back,"" while giving us pointed looks. That made us feel even worse, but this money would really help us so we stayed put in our decision. When we left, I felt sick with guilt and called my mom for advice. She said that it was a 50/50 and if they didn't expect the winner to keep the money then they should have just had a donation bucket instead of a 50/50. She also knew our financial situation and said that we really needed the money also, and that we should keep it. That made me feel a little better, but I still felt guilty because I thought my friends might be mad at us. I don't know if they were or not, but we kept the money. AITA, Reddit?

TLDR: My friend's dad was dying of cancer and they needed money for hospital bills & funeral costs. They had a benefit with a 50/50 and I won the money. I didn't give it back even though some family members mentioned giving the money back if they won it because my husband and I were also struggling financially at the time.",85,345,0.95

Yesterday we were both working a festival event in different places. My shift was 7am to 8pm and hers was 10am to 5pm. Well she waited for me and even bought me a beer to enjoy after my shift. We were going to hang out at the festival afterwards and just enjoy it and each others company. At 9pm I get a text from a fellow female coworker saying she doesn’t have a ride and asking me. I begrudgingly say yes because I don’t want her to be stuck. GF gets angry, and leaves to go home. I drive the other girl, exhausted, 40 min out of the way, and finally get home at 1030.

643,Not the A-hole,"We are from the Philippines and my mom is extremely religious. I am a closeted atheist since I was about 13. My mom had quite a tough-ish life due to (mostly) her bad decisions like not being good with money, refusing every good opportunity that came her way because she believed in ""signs from God"" (e.g. someone offered her a substantial amount of money for something she wasn't selling, she prayed and asked God ""if this is a bad decision, let person x come by my house this week"" but person x comes by our house 2-3x a week. While I told her it's a very good decision to sell, since person x comes by ANYWAY she follows her ""sign""). She's a single mom and I am her only child. So I always dreamt of giving her a good life.

I learned to not follow her mistakes, and I suppose this is why I became an atheist. I worked extremely hard because I wanted a different life from that of my mom. 25 yrs later, I became quite successful. Bought her a house, a car and an allowance each month. 

She never once thanked me. Instead, she thanked God. I ignored this at first, but then she got quite extreme. I mentioned to her that I did work pretty hard to get here, and she says things like ""This is God's reward to me, all those years of following him. I deserve/earned this"" and ""It was through my prayers and faith that He listened and gave you the strength to push through. If you think this was purely because of you, you are sorely mistaken!""

I am going to Australia for a holiday, I wanted to take her and she said something like ""praise be to Him! He loves me so much, he knew I deserve to have a vacation!"" I don't know why, but it rubbed me the wrong way and told her ""nevermind, I'm going alone."" 

She's upset, asked why and I said that I am so sick and tired of hearing her praise some Being for my hard work and love. She said I am being ungrateful and delusional if I think my success was because of ""just me working hard""",1118,12601,0.95
644,No A-holes here,"I really lucked out and was hired to work mornings M-F, occasionally covering weekends. Usually that shit’s coveted and you have to work your way up, so I feel lucky, no doubt.

However, I don’t admittedly *need* mornings M-F as much as some- I’m childless, so I could really work whenever. 

It does greatly benefit my health, though. I have maintenance insomnia (early morning waking), and am just a early bird in general. 

Back when I did work evenings, I’d be grateful to sleep in until 5am, getting maybe 5 hours of sleep. Usually, I would wake more at 2 or 3am and be a zombie all day. 

Anyway, my bosses hired a new woman. She is a single mother of five, so she really needs mornings M-F, because that’s when her mom can watch her kids. She didn’t directly ask me to give up my shift, but strongly hinted at it repeatedly.

Usually, I would be like “sorry, find a new job,” but you can tell she’s on the slow side. My mother was also like that, too slow to find decent work (couldn’t learn much more than how to wipe tables), but not slow enough for disability. This woman doesn’t seem quite as slow, she can work a cash register, but I still know it must be difficult for her to find and keep work.

That said, I don’t know if she would be... responsible enough to open. I’m probably drawing way too many comparisons between my mother and her- but opening you’re by yourself a few hours until managers come in. If shit hits the fan before then, you have to be able to handle it yourself. I don’t know if she’d be able to, I know my mom wouldn’t have been.

I don’t know. I think I might just feel worse than I should from knowing my mother and her struggle. She was also single, just with me, but still. Coupled with mild mental disability... shit must suck for this woman like it did my mom. 

But in knowing that, if I was a truly good hearted person, I’d offer it up and let managers decide if she could handle it.

AITA?

Edit: I didn’t explain very well my worries of how she might not be able to handle opening. It’s more the potential stress level, not her mental ability. “Responsible” was a poor word choice- I couldn’t really think of a good way to phrase it while keeping text short.

I worry if certain things would be too stressful for her with opening, like I opened once with alarms malfunctioning and blaring. Couldn’t get ahold of any managers, a cop showed up, and I had to figure out how to reset the alarms myself. It was stressful, hard to maintain a cool head. 

Handling a normal check out by herself for the first time, she panicked when she hit a wrong button. I helped her out and she was fine, but if she was alone, I don’t know if she would have panicked further. 

I hope that explains my worries some. I’m really not trying to sound mean about it. But, yes, I accept I am drawing too many comparisons between my mom’s abilities and hers. I was very protective of my mother, I would never have put her in a situation as stressful as the alarm thing by herself- I would have been there immediately to help her out. But she is not my mom. She might have handled it fine, I don’t know.

I think I’ll ask managers first if they’d mind her covering a couple morning shifts for me. If they say that’s fine, I’ll train with her a couple, but also share with her some of the things I’ve had to deal with. She has a right to know that it can be stressful and decide herself if she wants that.

If I give her two M-F shifts, it would actually work out well. We need people to work weekends, I cover when we’re desperate, but don’t really like working 6-7 days a week. I could open weekends, still get two days off. She doesn’t want full time anyway, could do two days opening, the one or two mid-shifts (12pm-4pm.) It seems like a good compromise. If it ends up too stressful for her, we’ll go back to normal.

647,Asshole,"So to set the stage I am a principal in a fairly.... corrupt part of Pennsylvania. If you’ve seen the documentary “kids for cash” than just know it’s somewhere around that area. So six years ago we had this student that I’ll call John. This boy was to be completely honest one of the most brilliant people I’ve ever met. I wholeheartedly believe if he had chosen a different path in life he would have been valedictorian. But John just loved doing bad shit. Smoking in the bathroom, showing up to school baked, calling teachers ungodly names, fist fighting, you name he probably did it. 

But honestly John wasn’t a bad kid. His family was judged extremely harshly, all of them felons, each parent in and out of jail. So he was treated like white trash by students and teachers alike. It’s understandable why he would act the way he would.

So it was half way through Johns tenth grade year when the superintendents son told John that he had been “fucking his crackwhore mom all night long”. John was 5’ 10” and 140 pounds soaking wet at 16 years old. Despite that I have genuinely never seen a worse beat down in my life. It took less than an hour for me to get a call from the super telling me to get rid of him.

I went along with it at the time not paying much thought to it. John was sent to the neighborhood reform school and from there to juvenile detention. Somewhere along the way he graduated high school early and joined the army. He’s still a very active part of the community while on leave and I actually introduced him to a school assembly where he spoke of how he turned his life around. I thought at the time that my part in his life had been what had straightened him up. I noticed he was short with me before and after his speech but thought nothing of it, figuring he was a man of few words.

Yesterday I saw him eating lunch with an old teacher of his that I remember him being particularly close to. I went up to them asking if I could join and then John pulled me aside.

He gave me a speech about how I was a key piece in what was ultimately some pretty messed up experiences in his life. I don’t remember too much of it except the words “The way you guys did me may have been standard, but it wasn’t right. So sincerely Jake (my first name which I thought was incredibly rude), go fuck yourself”.

651,Asshole,"Firstly, let me start by saying that one of my big pet peeves in life is people walking (or driving) in public whilst not looking where they're going. 

So, a while ago, I was walking down the street with my friend. We noticed that, coming the other direction, was a professional looking woman in her late 40s/early 50s. We also noticed that she was engrossed in her phone and not, at any point, looking up to check her surroundings. We were fated to be on a collision course if we both kept going in a straight line.

As a matter of principle, I decided to hold my course. I was staring at her intently for about 10-12 seconds (whilst continuing to walk forward), waiting for her to look up and notice that we were there. I would have been happy to move a little if she had seen us but I chose not to. 

Inevitably, we collided. Only a brush of shoulders but it was enough to dislodge her phone from her hand. I didn't stick around to assess the damage but the sound of phone hitting floor and the mutterings of sadness I could hear from her were enough to assume the phone had some damage.

I could have easily taken a step to my left (she would have then cut through me and my friend) as it was a wide path but I didnt think I should have to move for someone who can't look where they're going.

I didn’t have a functional phone immediately upon returning from a deployment so I asked my wife to send a text to my family saying I arrived safely and would talk to them the following day so I could spend the evening alone with my spouse. My Mom sent my wife a text back saying “congratulations…you won. It’s not all about you”. I suppose my Mom thought it was a malicious attempt on behalf of my wife to keep me from contacting them (?). If anything, that’s on me I’m not sure why my Mom directed her anger at my spouse.

4. My wife is a germaphobe. It’s not easy, but she meets me halfway on this. My Mom believes this is a personality deficit I guess vs. an actual disorder and took offense at the answer when she asked my wife why she wasn’t eating a cookie from a communal tray in our own home while they were visiting.

5. My mom accused my spouse of being jealous of my sister for not liking/commenting on the FB posts of her child enough, believes she’s waging a war to keep me from seeing my family, and accuses me of doing nice things for my wife just so she doesn’t leave me (...incredibly offensive). Additionally, my mom has thinks my spouse had nothing before she met me, has everything now, and is ungrateful for it.

6. For reasons including but not limited to the above, my wife probably won’t join us on a family vacations this year. I don’t necessarily agree with her decision, but I understand why she feels that way and the bottom line is she’s an adult who can make her own vacation decisions. My Mom told me that I needed to do something about it. I don’t plan to. 

Bottom line is I told my Mom that my relationship with my spouse is none of her business, to keep her unsolicited advice to herself, and to stop saying negative things directly to my spouse.

I know deep down my Mom just wants the best for me, but she bottles up her emotions and creates fantasy scenarios end up exploding in an unhealthy way. It’s having a toxic effect on our family. At the end of the day I’m 100% content in my marriage. So I told her to stay out of it. Haven’t talked to her since (~ a week). AITA?",166,1033,0.97
653,No A-holes here,"So last night at 1 am I rocked up to the petrol station, it was quiet but the night pay kiosk was still open. I started to pump diesel into my car but straight away the pump just spluttered and gave a little spray of fuel before just spurting our air. It had registered £3.50 on the pump. I went to the kiosk and let the bloke know the pump wasn’t working and would it be okay to change to another pump, to which he said yeah, no problem. I filled up £25.00 diesel without issue on the other pump. When I went to pay, however the man presented the card machine with £28.50. I just laughed and politely said that I was only gonna pay the £25.00 as I didn’t believe I had got any kind of fuel out of the first pump. He proceeded to get very angry at me saying I was a thief ect. It didn’t really help that he couldn’t speak English so I was struggling to convey that I felt I was being ripped off and that the pump should have been made out of order. I gave him £25.

655,Not the A-hole,"So my 16th birthday is coming up and my parents are excited. They want to throw me a big party to celebrate. I normally don’t do parties because of my anxiety and I just don’t like big parties in general but I figure since it’s my sweet 16 there’s no harm in it.

So today my parents and I were leaving a party we had with their friends for their daughters birthday party.
Just some background info, my parents and all the other parents of the neighborhood love to throw parties in their driveways/backyards which is fine, but they ALWAYS drink alcoholic drinks. I don’t care what adults do but they hype it up so much. They will go on about how good whatever they are drinking is and start cheering about it. Then when I ask if I can try it they all say no and get quiet. Fast forward back to the car my parents were still talking about how good whatever they were drinking was and started talking about bringing it to my party and the people they were going to invite (which were people I don’t even know) and abunch of other party details. I said something along the lines of “woah what” because they were planning so fast and they said “oh nothing” like I was budding in on their private weekend plans. I said “I don’t want alcohol beverages at my party” and my dad went off about how not everything is about me and I can’t control what they do, he yelled about how he was throwing me a party and I should be grateful. I told him I never wanted a party in the first place and he called me selfish. 

He was gonna take me for ice cream on the way home but he said he wasn’t going to and my mom took me instead. She told me every parent looks forward to throwing a sweet sixteen party and it’s selfish of me to deny them that. I went off on her about how I didn’t care about the party, I just don’t want alcohol and people I don’t know at MY birthday party. My anxiety would build up and I would just end up locking myself in my room while no one even notices I’m gone. My mom said I can just take my three friends and stay in my room but is that even okay if it’s my party? I’m also mad because she said she would invite the family who’s party I was leaving from during the car ride previously mentioned (who I don’t know that well). She said “just eat your pizza, open your gifts, and hide in your room like you always do.” I told her I just want my friends and family there and I’d let them bring alcohol if it was just my family because I feel like they are all just looking for a reason to get together and drink some more. She told me she would just take me and my friends out to eat and my dad and his friends could stay at home. I’m extremely pissed that I can’t change one thing in a party that I didn’t even want to have and I’m being called selfish for that? If everyone is upset because they can’t have alcohol at a party then they have issues.

So am I in the wrong?

656,Not the A-hole,"The wife (30f) and I (32M) recently moved to a new city for work. We're attempting to make new friends, but it can be slow going when you don't have any social networks. Last night my wife got home around 2 hours later than she normally does, but I figured she was probably out doing some chore. When she got home she started telling me about a friend she made. ""Good for her"", I initially thought, until I asked for more details. Apparently she started talking to another passenger in an Uber (let's call him Tony""). They were stuck in traffic and had an sizable chunk of time to get to know each other. The uber driver goes to drop Tony off at his place, at which point he invites my up to his place to ""continue the conversation"". To my horror, my wife accepted and spent the last hour and a half at his place.  


She can tell I was annoyed as she recounted this and asked what was wrong. I was upset that she went into a strange mans house who was most likely trying to hit on her. She said I was being ridiculous and that she was just making a new friend. I brought up that if he did try something no one would know where she was at. She countered that she was a grown woman and could make her own choices.

658,Not the A-hole,"Hey Reddit.

I've always had a complicated relationship with my mother, who thinks that boundaries and privacy shouldn't apply to close family. Every time I set a boundary, she cries, and she pouts if I try to enforce them. A lot of my family looks down on me for setting them in the first place because they think I should be more grateful. For the record, I'm not doing anything I find unreasonable, for example, the last boundary I had to set was telling her never to rearrange any of my things. She knows that 3 strikes means she goes home.

On a recent visit, and with my father there, (they are still together) she started loudly talking about how annoying he was and about how he never listened. I cut her off and told her that it was inappropriate for her to talk about my father that way to me, and that if she was having issues, she needed to go to counselling or see a friend. 

Later on, she tried picking a fight with him in my living room over a movie to watch, and I told her that she was not to fight with my dad in my home. She pouted and said she couldn't help it, and I told her that wasn't reasonable, and that it was rude to fight in other people's homes. 

The next day, when we were out for a coffee, she started in on him again. I got up, told her I was going home, and that her visit was cut short, but that Dad was welcome to come with me. He did, and expressed gratitude for the break from the fighting. 

She called me when she got home and told me I was a nasty and ungrateful child and that I had no right to tell her what to do. I just told her we could have a conversation when she could be respectful, and hung up. Since then, other relatives have been texting me and telling me that I need to be more empathetic to her struggles wih my dad.

660,Not the A-hole,"Here’s a quick rundown..

Boss invited my girlfriend and I to stay in their cabin for the weekend, with him and his wife. 

(My boss) 
He parked his truck in the neighbors driveway. 
When he left with his wife for lunch, the neighbor came up to the cabin and caused a commotion about the truck being parked in his driveway. 

I told him I would move it, but I needed my bosses permission.  

I tried to call my boss, but had no signal. I texted him, 3 times. No response. (10 mins later.... neighbor is angry)

I decided to text his wife. She typically responds quick. 

“Hey, your neighbor is a little upset about the truck being in his driveway- can I move it for you? Just needed to ask you guys.” Is what I texted her. 


My boss calls me with a HUGE attitude and tells me that I NEVER text his wife regarding his business. And that this is my first and last warning. 

I was speechless. I apologized. He has NEVER acted like that before. ( I thought maybe the wife chewed him out?)

(I just wanted permission to move the truck)

When they got back- his wife was fine! She apologized to me for having to move the truck— and here’s the thing... she didn’t even yell at my boss or anything... she said she was just upset I had to do that.

Am I the asshole? I kinda felt like I undermined him at first but she was okay all in all....?

*Edit: sorry for the misleading title. This isn’t an affair related post, I apologize for my non-clarifications.

**edit: thank you all for your answers and advice. You’ve really helped me figure things out here. I’m gonna begin a job search (just in case things go south) and I’m gonna talk to my boss 1 on 1. Ask him why things went down the way they did, and try to separate my friendship from work with him. Wish me luck fiends. Keep on giving advice too! I could use it. And I’m thankful for you.


UPDATE:

I talked to my boss. Here’s how it went;

I asked him “I wanted to apologize for the truck issue this past weekend again. It’s been weighing on my mind a bit and I needed a little closure on something”

He says “Okay, on what?”

I reply “I’ll be honest, sir, I didn’t see this weekend as anything related to our professional relationship. I saw it as a friendship trip- unrelated to work. When approached by your neighbor, I felt it very necessary to contact you before he damaged or had the truck towed. Seeing as how I called a few times, and sent some texts... I thought the best way to get to you quickly may have been through (wife’s name). Again I didn’t mean to undermine you in any way.. I just needed permission to move the truck.. and I truly felt like there was a misunderstanding in the way both of us may have handled it.”

He says “I do not leave my ringer on, so I accept responsibility for that part. And I apologize to you. I was a little frustrated with the neighbor when I heard this news, and I also released some of that anger with you when you messaged my wife. I apologize for that as well. You did the only things that you could to help me out, and I completely disrespected you. It was a friendly-relationship Trip, and I acted as your boss... even more so, I was a bad one with unjust actions. I’m sorry, and I will improve my attitudes towards you.”


I feel as if he covered a good portion of my concerns, and he took ownership. It went really well. I’m still discreetly looking for work, but at a less serious pace. 

NOTE: I have learned my lesson and will not be attending a vacation with a boss ever again, and will keep it limited to a friendly dinner every now and then. 

Thank you all for your advice and support. Finding the words to say wouldn’t be possible without some of you. I’m grateful.",119,490,0.94

663,Asshole,"About 2 years ago I decided I would no longer eat at restaurants that didn't pay their employees a livable wage and made them rely on tips.  I'll still go to restaurants that pay the $2.50 per hour or whatever for social obligations, but I won't order any food.  I'll order a drink or two, and still tip accordingly.  No one has really ever noticed, and those that do have never cared.  I started dating Brenda 5 weeks ago, and we've been on 3 dates at restaurants (10 dates total).

&#x200B;

We have 2 restaurants in town that are ""tip-less"" or ""tip-free"" (lets call them BBQ and MEX).  They both have great food, great service, competitive prices, but most importantly they pay their employees good wages and offer their Full-Timers benefits.  I want to support restaurants (and really all businesses) that think like this, so thats where I choose to spend my money at.  

&#x200B;

On our first restaurant date, Brenda and I ate at MEX.  Our 2nd, we went to BBQ.  Our 3rd, back at MEX.  When she asked me last night if I wanted to go out to eat at a restaurant, I said sure.  We got in the car and I asked if she wanna hit up BBQ?  She said no, actually, she wanted to try out this Japanese restaurant.  One of my friends was a chef there a few years back and always complained about the shitty owners and the wait staff being stingy/lying with splitting the tips.  I said sure, but I asked if she would pay.  She said I guess, unenthusiastic.  She got quiet for a few seconds then said, ""So when I want to pick the restaurant I have to pay for the date?""  I explained thats not the case at all.  I don't like supporting restaurants that dont support their employees and force people to tip.  I went into a few of my reasons why.  I told her I'd be happy to pay at BBQ or MEX (note, I've paid for all 10 of our dates so far, so I don't feel bad asking her to pay for 1 dinner) or I'd go with her to Japanese restaurant, but wont order food.  I'll just order a drink and enjoy her company.  Those options were unacceptable, as she wanted to eat at Japanese and didn't wanna be the only one eating.  So we went and she paid, begrudgingly, then asked me to take her back home (usually she stays over my house when we go out).  

&#x200B;

Today, she calls me and tells me that she likes trying out new restaurants, and if she will always have to pay just because I don't want to tip?  I said if its an unavoidable situation then I would still pay, but if a tip-free option were available I will only spend my money there.  She said spoke to her friends about everything and they all agree that my position is a red flag.  I'm either cheap or controlling.  I didn't know how to respond.

I’ve been seeing a therapist that tells me to be consistent with our son in his discipline and support things my fiancé says she needs help with to reduce my anxiety. 

Today was all about playtime while mom has been at work til about 2pm. She gets home and I’m grateful so that she can play with our son so I can get some things done uninterrupted. Instead she just takes a nap... for three hours. Disappointed, I continued to entertain him. 

Our neighbors brought their kids over and they were playing well and I could finally focus on my to do list. NOPE. My fiancé comes out and says “we’re done playing kiddo, gotta go to the movies!” He started crying and then she states “We’re going inside no matter what. You can listen, go inside and go to the movies or...  throw a tantrum, go inside, and stay home.” 

At this point he’s hitting and in full 3 year old meltdown. This continues until the time we were supposed to leave has passed. I tell him that he lost the movies for hitting mom, the time has passed and you missed it, but he can continue playing with his friend. My fiancé then blamed me for ruining her night even though she told him staying home would be the punishment. I followed through and tried to support her by listening and staying consistent. Now I’m called the asshole. 

In that time, me and my son went on a walk, had bath time, and put him to sleep with Toy Story, all of which she could have accompanied us in. I don’t know what to think of this or of myself.

My kids also would say that dad never made them feed or clean up after the cat when they were with him, which was utterly frustrating because he was caring for the cat (and our kids) one weekend a month at most and I was doing the rest.

671,Not the A-hole,"Hey there reddit. I had to shorten this a ton and leave out a lot of things because of the character limit, but here's my situation.

I've got a few friends who we'll call Lilly and Max. We're an odd bunch, but we get along well. I also have a narcissistic mom who strictly controls what I do, where I go and who I see, so making plans is always difficult for me. I always make that clear to people and try my best despite this to be a decent friend. 

Not long ago, Lilly and her family invited me to come along on her trip to visit her aunt in California this summer. I was ecstatic. The best part is, my mom literally actually entertained the idea as well. I had the green light, so I figured she'd let me know when.

A short while later, I introduced Lilly and Max to each other and they INSTANTLY fell for each other. We were all cool and had a nice friend group. They've been dating a while now and they make each other very happy. We all hung out a few times when I was allowed, until what happened last time.

I came over and spent the day with them when Max started getting really touchy feely with not only Lilly, but also me. He kept touching me, putting his arm around me, making sexual remarks, insisting we cuddle and when I would shrug him off he'd get upset with me and make me feel bad. This kept happening, and I even told him to stop on multiple occasions to no avail. I felt powerless because I'm not very confrontational. I'm very sensitive to stuff like that and it really impacted me.

I talked about it to them both separately and worked things out- and I've been invited over since then- but Max always insists on being around when I come over, and gets upset if he's not there when I see her. I still don't feel comfortable yet and I don't want something like that to happen again, so I've been somewhat distant lately.

Apparently, too distant. The next thing I know, Max texted me and told me how excited he is because him and Lilly just bought the tickets to go to California together and they're leaving in a few days. You know, the trip I was invited to before they even met. I knew that Lilly invited him along and we were all excited to go together. I was upset. Only then did Max tell me that him and Lilly have been upset with me because I haven't been spending enough time with them, so they figured I ""didn't want to go anyways."" I never had any idea that either of them felt that way, I always try hard to ensure that I still value and care about them when I'm not around. This all really hurt me. I can't stop crying over it whenever I think about it, knowing they're leaving in three days and I won't be with them.

Am I the asshole for not spending a lot of time with them? I feel terrible for not being a reliable friend but I don't think I deserved this. What do you think, reddit?",32,77,0.93

673,Not the A-hole,"My cousin is getting married the Saturday of Labor Day weekend. I don't really want to go at all. Am I the bad guy?

Some background:

My mom's side of the family used to be super close. And she is one of 6, so it's a big family. When I was 8, my  grandpop passed, and things kind of slowly drifted apart since then.

I really don't feel much family connection with my cousin. A few years ago, I wrecked my motorcycle pretty badly. I sustained a TBI (tennis ball sized dent in the back of my helmet, so I'm legitimately amazed it wasn't worse) and needed a steel plate and 6 screws to put my shoulder back together. The only person on my mom's side of the family I heard from was my grandmom. Also, while I was in the Navy, I would try to make it back ""home,"" but unless I made the effort to buy a plane ticket, get a hotel, rent a car, and drive everywhere, nobody really made time to see me, even though I was flying from southern California back to PA. And even now, I don't hear from anyone on my mom's side of the family (despite loving within 20 minutes of 90% of them) unless they call my mom and she forwards the message.

Then there's the date of the wedding. She chose to have a wedding near the Jersey shore on Labor Day weekend. It's a two hour drive for me on a good day, probably 3 with holiday traffic. That also means $150+/night for a cheap hotel room. It also happens to be two days after my 31st birthday, and I doubt anyone will even notice with the wedding going on.

I know part of my unwillingness to go does stem from her picking a date the same weekend as my birthday. And I feel like that's a little petty of me. But considering I've maybe seen my cousin face to face a handful of times in the last 5 years, I also feel like I was invited more out of some sense of obligation than a desire to actually have me there. And with the cost of a room, wedding gift, and probably needing to buy a suit, the $$$ start adding up.

674,Not the A-hole,"throwaway just incase. 

me and my girlfriend have been dating for 2 years, I'm 25 and my girlfriend is 24. 

last week my brother shared a post from a weed lovers Facebook page and included a funny caption. he has 2 kids and almost never smokes weed, maeby once a month at the most, and the kids are never home when he does. he also has no weed paraphernalia at his house. 

my girlfriend saw the post and questioned me on it, I explained exactly what I just told you and reassured her that the kids are fine. 

I then get a call from my brother a few days later, telling me that someone called CPS on him as they just did a welfare check on his kids. I automatically knew it was my girlfriend and confronted her, she told me that weed is bad for you and she was only thinking in the kids best interests. 

I just started yelling at her. 

I told her that I had explained to her how little weed he uses and that it's never kept at the house, I was beyond mad and made sure she knew that, I explained that she called CPS on a man who smokes weed once a month and that she is the worst person I've ever met. this caused her to start crying and she sobbed In the shower for an hour, and then tried apologizing but I refused her apology i also told her to not even bother apologizing to my brother as he does not want to see her. 
I then broke up with her. 

now I've accepted that we have broken up but now that my brain has cleared up I think I went a step to far and really need outside judgment on this. 

I'm just a complete mess of emotions.

edit  

I want to add that I've stayed with my brother and I've been super close with him and he definitely only smokes once a month. even his friends have agreed with me on that. 
I trust my brother and the kids are perfectly healthy",1705,6774,0.95

She said traffic was backed up outside of the carpool lane, so I was being a dick by not merging in sooner. (Literally about a mile prior to the carpool lane ending)

677,Asshole,"Recently, my brother [16M] came out as gay to our family, at dinner. Notably, my parents were pretty shocked at first, asking him if he was sure he was gay, but quickly turned to telling him they were proud of him and would support any decision he makes.

My [12F] sister was amused by the preceding, and told everyone she had seen it coming.

Outwardly, I (jokingly) told my bro that he should set up a Grindr account, to which my parents yelled “No!” at me. I’ve told him that I’m proud too that he felt comfortable enough to come out to us.

Inwardly, I don’t think I’ll ever look at my brother the same. I’m not against him being gay, but I’m just not totally comfortable with this, especially if he starts bringing other guys home in bed and such.

I haven’t expressed any of my misgivings to him,  and I never will. Personally, I think that makes this all okay.

But, when I talked to my sister about this, she called me a homophobe and an asshole, saying that we’re family and that I should support him, which is what I think I’ve been doing. I’ve only had thoughts about this, but haven’t taken and action or words about it.

So, AITA for being uncomfortable with my brother being gay?

EDIT: So I got a bunch of responses. Most YTA comments were about me being homophobic, and how this isn’t any of my business. I disagree with the homophobic part, but the not my business part I do agree with. Thanks!

Most NTA/NAH’s are about how it is okay to be uncomfortable, but I should gradually make my way to accepting him. 

This I agree with. I disagree with the NTA/NAH’s that say I’m on 14. Sure, I’m ‘only’ fourteen, but this means I’ve have 14 years to built family bond that should be stronger than this, and which I hope will become in the future.

I told her that it was a no and that only she can go, she seemed annoyed and hung up. 

she then went crying to mum about it who kinda took her side, she also made a few cryptic posts that where clearly talking about me. and so I told my sister that if she was going to cry to people over not being able to bring her boyfriend of 2 weeks to my wedding, I would rather you not go.

680,No A-holes here,"Two friends and I made a plan to go to an amusement park tomorrow, which has a big water park we were planning to go to. We already bought our tickets, but our tickets are not restricted to a particular day, we can use our ticket for any day of the season. 

So my period just started, I've always used pads and I don't want to try a tampon. I know it's stupid, and I have no logical reason not to try it - but I just find it gross and I don't like the idea of the tampon staying inside my vagina for hours and collecting blood, it just seems really gross and I would not feel comfortable with it at all..it just seems so gross (again, it's not logical, my friend pointed out that pads are probably just as gross). 

My friend's trying to convince me to either use a tampon or wait in the side for the couple hours they spend in the water park. I frankly don't want to do either, I paid for this ticket and would rather spend it on another day that I can actually go to the water park and not waste up to 4-5 hours just doing nothing. One of the friend has a season pass, my other friend is only gonna go to the park tomorrow, she doesn't wanna pay for more visits, so tomorrow was the day we would all go and go to the water park and everything. 

But my friend is annoyed that I won't just use a tampon, she said ""it's not like you haven't had anything in your vagina before"" (I've had sex and my reason for not using a tampon is not really a religious one..my reasoning is just illogical and I agree that it's illogical but it's just something I don't want to try). 

AITA for probably bailing last minute on this plan and going another day instead? I know my friend is gonna be really upset if I bail...I know for sure she's going to be really annoyed and mad that I cancelled last minute.

Edit: thanks everyone for your insights, really appreciated them. I've talked to my friend and while she was, and still is, upset, we're okay now and she and I will just go another day. The other friend (without the season pass) will go tomorrow with my friend with the season pass.",59,53,0.87

As he was finishing his transaction and everyone else was getting drinks, he put his credit card into the chip reader. I tapped him on the shoulder and asked, ""May I please borrow your card?"" He laughed derisively and looked at me funny and said no. I clarified that I meant the discount card, not the credit card, and was met with another derisive laugh as he took his card out and walked away.

I held up my card to the cashier and told her that I had the card, I was just testing him to see if he would let me borrow it. I figured it would be harmless, since it literally costs him nothing to let me use it. Given his reaction, though, I might have been out of line.

688,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account. I’m a videographer in the entertainment industry working mainly with semi famous rappers on music videos and live shows. The people I work with for the most part aren’t rich but do well enough so they can afford rent and have some disposable income. I also have some clients who are flat broke and save for months just to hire me. 

This one rapper, a single mother who is gaining a following hired and paid me $500 to shoot a show. I had her sign a contract which clearly states my refund policy (must give a 72 hour notice for a full refund, 2 days for half refund and less than 48 hours is no refund and you must pay the entire amount agreed upon if not already paid upfront. This applies for any reason) 

This woman canceled on me the day of the show because something was wrong with the venue (I called and verified, they had an electrical problem).  She told me she wanted her money back. I was sympathetic and told her I wouldn’t refund her because I could have booked another event that day but I can give her a discount on the next show. 

She flipped out. Basically said “fuck the contract” and that I need to have sympathy and think of her child and that she could possibly be getting evicted from her apartment and has been eating ramen noodles for a month.  

Now I hate being guilt tripped. She signed the contract, knew what she was getting into and knew my refund policy. I don’t think I should have to forfeit $500 for the sake of a child that I have nothing to do with because of something that is not my fault. 

Now she’s saying she’s gonna take me to court (she won’t even have the time to try filing the suit) Her friends are spamming my Instagram with angry comments and I’ve even gotten some threats of violence. 2 other potential clients said they’re not gonna hire me anymore because I won’t sympathize with a single mother.  

I have lots of other people supporting me in this situation and I know it’s gonna blow over so I’m not worried. But AITA? If I am, I’ll change my refund policy going forward but I’m honoring this contract. 

TLDR: Single mother client cancelled on me. I won’t refund her because of my policy that she agreed to and now I’m getting hate on social media.",108,173,0.94
689,Asshole,"A couple hours ago my friend and I went to an Italian restaurant across town. I drove her there since we were going shopping after. While we’re waiting for our drinks, she shows me a picture of the pink mohawk guy with his boyfriends and their husbands. She called them a whores. Said they should just break up since they obviously have trust issues and can’t handle being in a committed relationship. 

I was appalled. We’re been friends for years and at most we’d laugh at how crazy tumblr bios. But she never showed this kind of behavior to real people/in person. Our friends are all types of LGBTQ people. She was the first person I came out to. 

I asked if she knew what a polysexual relationship was. She just said “yea it’s what Projared, Heidi, and Holly did.” I explained to her what it was and that it’s not open relationship or glorified cheating. She just said it was weird and the guy was obviously a player. I called her an ignorant asshole. 

I got so mad, I left her at the restaurant (I paid for my drink) and drove home. I felt that if I stayed and continued to listen I’d cause a scene. 

She recently texted me saying after I left, the tables next us started talking about her. An older woman called her a bigot on the way out. She had to take the train home. She said it was just her opinion and that I’m overreacting. That I’m a terrible friend for ditching her.

695,Not the A-hole,"  

I am in a local rock band with some of my really good friends, including a guy named Adam (not his real name) who has this really weird sense of humor. We’ve been friends for years because of our shared interest in music. Anyway, he got a knack for really crazy elaborate pranks and would occasionally embarrass us in public just for fun. Most of the time his pranks were harmless and I have to say, really creative and funny af, though sometimes he made me really embarrassed that I had to excuse myself immediately. One of his recurring jokes (and his favorite) whenever one of us was hanging out with him was the gay prank. He would say something really embarrassing casually, loud enough for everyone else to hear to give the impression that we’re a gay couple.

Like that one time we were standing in line at a department store, and he started telling me casually like “Hey baby, I went to that shop today and got you that cute pink butthole you like.” I was absolutely mortified and got really upset with him but of course when he told our friends about it later, everyone started laughing their asses off, to my dismay. I thought he needed to tone it down a little bit just in case it backfired or something. But he would not listen.

Last week, we were hanging out at our usual favorite coffee shop with some of our old friends that we had not seen for ages and Adam of course could always be counted upon. We were talking about our first masturbation attempt when suddenly he casually blurted out to me like “Hey, why don’t you tell them about that one time your uncle helped you polish the riffle?”. Some were laughing (including my bandmates) but the rest knew he had gone too far this time.

To say I was embarrassed was an understatement. I felt hurt and betrayed that he, as my friend, could have the heart to make fun of such a traumatizing experience I had to endure as a child. That’s when I decided that I’d had enough of his stupid jokes. I stood up from my seat, called him an asshole and told them I no longer wanted to be associated with the band for good.

Later the next day he tried to reach me through my phone several times but I ignored him so he sent me a long heartfelt text telling me that he felt bad and did not mean to humiliate me in front of so many people and that he would apologize to me in public if necessary. But I was so furious with him so I texted him back to tell him that I would not change my mind since I had a feeling he was not sincerely feeling sorry for his action, he only cared about the band falling apart since we have already submitted our band to participate in an upcoming rock festival we’d been practicing for for months. And I am still feeling hurt that he could be so insensitive and act like such an asshole.

My friends think I am overreacting and should not let it affect the rest of the band. Am I The Asshole?

696,Not the A-hole,"I just came home from a theme symphony concert playing popular movie/TV fantasy themes (Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, etc.).

During the first half the lady next to me had her phone out recording/taking pictures intermittently - no biggie, not what I would do, but it wasn't bothered initially. After the intermission she went into non-stop recording until I had enough and asked her to stop (I was waiting for a pause between performances, but they were performing a suite, so it might have been 15-20 minutes into the second half). For me that meant having someone waving their phone (on lowest light setting) just within my peripherial vision, focusing and zooming in/out non-stop - disturbing enough that my attention was now on her and her phone instead of the concert.

The conversation went something like this:

- Me: ""I'm sorry, could I ask you to put your phone down for the remainder of the concert?""
- Her: ""Why?""
- Me: ""Because it's sort of distrubing.""
- Her (holding her phone up at recording height): ""This is disturbing to you?""
- Me (trying to cut it short, because the orchestra started playing again - even though I wanted to explain that I don't want to be annoying or anything like that, she's just doing something diverts my attention away from something I paid a fair amount of money to enjoy): ""Well... Yes.""
- Her: ""But it's for my daughter!""

At that point I rolled my eyes at her and leaned back in my chair, because what could I possibly say to that without appearing to be a complete asshole? What I really wanted to say, though, was ""WHY DIDN'T YOU BUY A TICKET FOR HER THEN!!!??"". She paused recording for a couple minutes, but went back to it not long thereafter. I spent the rest of the concert torn between being annoyed, feeling a bit rude and failing at enjoying the concert.

Mind you, this is a symphony orchestra owned by Danish national television that records many of their concerts (including *every* theme concert I've attended) with multiple cameras and not only posts it to their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGtAoge4_OloSgbXMyoh5vw), but often also show the concerts in full length on one of the national TV channels (which are open to everyone as long as they access the site from within Denmark). Granted, they do have one of their cameras mounted on telescopic camera crane, which can be quite annoying, but it's always in the same spot, so you can get seats where it's not an issue.",16,40,0.95

Sarah's birthday was a few days ago and we all met up at a mutual friends house (let's call her Sam) and Sarah brought some of her work friends along.

Sam bought the alcohol ($23) but didn't get paid back, so she's been asking Sarah for the money for the past few days but Sarah just kept saying she would send it (she does this often). 

Today, Sarah is supposed to have a birthday dinner (organized by another mutual friend) where everybody has to pay for themselves. Sam asked her for the money back because otherwise she can't pay for her own dinner tonight. Sarah said ""I don't know how much money I'll have left, I still have to buy myself a dress for tonight."" After hassling her, Sam got her money back and Sarah said ""good luck eating with $23"". They picked a pretty expensive restaurant in downtown that would cost about $40 per person (this is expensive to 19 year olds who barely have jobs). Sarah isn't even paying for herself because she doesn't have money; her friend who organized the dinner is paying for her. They kept telling us to come dressed up nicely and ""not in jeans"".

To be fair, he’s only looking for the hook up as he has stated in his profile, so no emotional sabotage.

709,Not the A-hole,"This is from a few years back.

I was visiting my grandparents house. I had a mosquito bite on my leg that wasn’t going away, and my grandpa (who was a retired doctor) gave me an antibiotic pill.. from his own medication... medication that he says he “self prescribed” to himself, and seeing as they keep 30-year-old ingredients in filthy conditions all the time I didn’t want to know how old it was or where it’d been... My grandma even told me it ‘probably isn’t good for you’ behind his back with a happy wink then shuffled off. To a teenager who knows jack about meds.

I was obliviously trusting of them despite all of that and took the pill anyway. Grandpa tells me it’s a prescription and I’ll have to take more for like a month. Okay, fine, you’re the doctor person, you know more than me.

I mention this to my brother and he flips, tells me not to take any more, that it was from grandpa’s medication and really not for a bug bite, don’t trust grandpa, etc etc. I get scared and hide the second pill grandpa already gave me.

My dad asks me later if I took the pill, I decide to be honest and say no. He flips and tells me I’m being very disrespectful and that I’ll get really sick if I don’t take it. He and my grandparents (including my grandma??) all berate me to take the pill but I refuse and refuse. I decide to call my mom who basically says to me and my dad that I’ll start a prescription when I get back home. I’m on the verge of tears during all this because my dad never yells at me and his parents were right along with him saying I’ll get super sick and the bite will get infected if I don’t take grandpa’s pills.

I get home, my mom never gets me a prescription, the bug bite goes away like a week after (I’m pretty sure the only reason it was there so long was because I was scratching it). 

My dad made me feel awful about not trusting my grandpa, but on the other hand I feel like grandpa was genuinely trying to help me and I was rude to him by not trusting his judgement.

Let's pause for a bit. Our company owns about 40 nursing homes across England. It's an LTD, so the financial statements are not a secret. Last year, they reported a profit of over £2.5M. Yet about 80% of our staff, especially the carers, are making just a fraction above national minimum wage. If you're not a manager on a contract, there's no bonuses. The staff are charged for everything - from uniforms to lunches.

Being a resident of a nursing home isn't cheap either. It costs more per week than I make in a month.

And what is the Resident Support Fund? Sometimes we throw parties, sometimes we get a new telly for the lounge, sometimes we do some re-furbishing. Pretty much standard business costs in the care industry that should be covered with our Clients' hard-earned money. Yet apparently they aren't - and we need to supplement it. But she must've known all that. So instead of trying the reasonable approach, this is what came out of my mouth:

""That's nice. I wish Sainsbury's employees had a Shopper Support Fund. Why don't they all chip in? Don't they realise it would directly benefit us, the paying customers?"" - I realised how passive-aggressive and stand-offish it sounded the second I responded. Sarcasm is the default dialogue option for a Brit. Its how communicate, but I fully own the fact that it could've been perceived as uncalled for.

Suffice to say, Sarah wasn't pleased. Other people overheard my apparent insubordination. Monday week, I have a meeting with her, the deputy and the HR lady. I highly doubt the meeting is going to be about the ethical quandaries of pressuring low-paid staff into giving back the money to their employer. I have a feeling it's going to be about ""teamwork"", ""going the extra mile"", ""charity"", ""work spirit"" and ""we're all in this together"".

Obviously, that's just my point of view. I haven't got the faintest clue how it looked from the manager's perspective. She's the one that has to answer to the Regional Manager and the CEO, after all.

Feel free to ask anything. Don't know if it matters, but I'm 30, male, and I'm the Social Activities Conductor. Arts n Crafts, Bingo, quizzes, outings, booking entertainers, throwing b-day parties, doing the newsletter, that sort of thing (I have a separate budget for all that). It's not about the money. It's a matter of principle.

So. Is George the arsehole in this situation?",25,49,0.93
711,Not the A-hole,"The title probably sounds idiotic, but it is the simplest way to sum it up.

Quick information: 
1. I am hearing impaired, as the only one in my family, everyone including my sister is of normal hearing.

2. The acoustics of our living room caused the sound in the corner where my seat is to be objectively cleare/better. 

3. Wearing my hearing aids for long periods give me headaches, think unable to move or talk bad.

The situation:

My family and I had just come home from a long family gathering, meaning I, had been wearing my hearing aids for eight hours, we had agreed earlier to watch HP when we came home.

Everything was well good and well, until we had to sit down, and my younger sister sat in my spot, low-key annoyed I asked her if she could move, signalling to the mostly empty couch.

My mother heard this, and told me I could just move somewhere else, I turned around and explained to her that I had a minor headache honestly didn't feel like sitting somewhere else right now.

She had a whole monologue about how I couldn't just demand to always sit there, and was it really so terrible having to wear my hearing aids for another hour and a half.

Slightly pissed, I examined that I already had a minor headache and didn't feel like laying in my bed all day tomorrow, this resulted in a second, somehow longer monologue about family and if it was really worth it jepoardizing a family evening due to a headache.

My family, agreed with this, and that I should not demand that my sister moved for my own gain, what would I gain from sitting there? The ability to hear more than sixty percent of the movie, somehow they made it seem like I had some grand evil plan by making my sister move.

As the conversation was going nowhere, I decided to just go to my room to nurse my growing headache and dispose of my hearing aids. 


Personally, I don't think my request for my sister to move was out of the line, but, my family's reaction made me second guess my judgment of the situation, so, am I the asshole?",102,273,0.95
712,Not the A-hole,"Yesterday, I attended the wedding of my boyfriend’s former piano tutor as his plus one. The wedding was quite fancy and everyone was in formal wear for the ceremony and reception, which were held inside a chateau.

I am 21 and quite tall for a woman at 5’11. I am also a model. My boyfriend is also tall at 6’5. We usually get stares when we are together, I suppose mainly because of our height. 

For the wedding, I wore a long gown which was in accordance with the dress code. I also wore 3.5 inch heels with my gown. I didn’t think that was unusual...nearly every female was wearing heels at the wedding.

At the wedding, my boyfriend and I got some stares, but of course the main attention was focused on the bride, who was beautiful. 

About 20 minutes before the ceremony began, the mother of the bride came over to me and politely asked if I could remove my heels and offered a pair of flats that belonged to the maid of honour. She said that my height was “distracting” and she was afraid that I’d block the view of those sitting in the back rows (my BF and I were sitting somewhere in the middle). I thought it was an odd request because my BF is next to me and he’s half a foot taller than me...should he crouch down? But I didn’t want to argue with the mother of the bride. I wore my own pair of flats that I had brought. She said thank you and left.

After the ceremony, I thought this meant I could wear my heels again. But apparently not, because when I walked into the reception area the mother of the bride looked disapprovingly at me. She did not come to talk to me but it was obvious that she was annoyed.

I found this whole thing very odd. I was a very polite guest, I wore a modest dress and makeup, nothing over the top.  Yes, I wore heels that made me over 6ft but I cannot help my height, and besides, all the other female guests were in heels. Granted I was the tallest woman among the 100 or so guests, but still. My boyfriend found it rude of the mother of the bride, but didn’t say anything.

I really did not wish to cause any problems though. Should I have worn my flats for the duration of the wedding, including the reception to minimize distractions from the bride? Or is the MOB overreacting? Thank you.",402,2863,0.94

714,Not the A-hole,"I was on the train between 2 major cities, it’s a 1.5 hour journey so obviously most people want a seat. If you buy tickets in advance you get given a seat reservation, but if you buy them at the station you don’t and you may have to stand if there’s no seats available. I’d booked a seat so I was all good. Usually when you get on the train there are little screens above each seat which say if they’re reserved but they weren’t working that day, and reservations still apply even if the signs are broken. 

Anyway, I’m on the train and this couple who’d been out shopping (had loads of bags from clothes shops) got on and sat down. A few mins later some people get on and politely ask this couple to move as they’re sitting in their reserved seats. Usually people just accept this and get up and move because they know they haven’t booked, but the guy from the couple asked to see this persons ticket to make sure it was actually their seat (wtf, who made you the ticket inspector) anyway, it was their seat and so reluctantly the couple move to some other free seats opposite myself and my partner. 

The train was filling up pretty quickly and I realised it was gonna be full, it was 5pm on a weekday so lots of commuters. A lady and her son come along, looking confused as there were people sitting in their reserved seats (this couple), they were clearly tourists so couldn’t really speak english and weren’t sure of the etiquette of how to ask for their seats. Eventually they realised that their seats were taken and so asked the couple to move, again this guy gets all rude like ffs, and asks to see their tickets. At this point everyone on the train is watching. The couple are complaining and swearing under their breath whilst getting up. The kid is just standing in the aisle looking awkward not really knowing what to do (standing a bit in the way of this guy but not massively)  and then:

HIM (rude guy to kid):  are you gonna fucking move then so I can get up

 This kid is literally like 9 years old

So I told the guy: you don’t need to be so rude

HIM: what did you just say to me

ME: I said you didn’t need to be so rude. He’s only a child and you were in his seat anyway

HIM: Oh for gods sake (walks off in a huff with his girlfriend)

They left all their shopping bags under the table and to be honest, although we noticed we didn’t say anything because he was being a dick.

When I told all this to my friend later she said that even though they were being rude it was bad of us to not tell them that they left their bags. Well I didn’t really feel like walking off after him after he was speaking to people like that so nah I wasn’t gonna tell him - karma for being an asshole.

So was I the asshole?",29,60,0.94
715,No A-holes here,"Quick background, My wife passed a little less than a year ago, she wasnt really open about the pantheism but she would just say shes non religious because she honestly didnt care to even argue with people about beliefs.

Edit: I will be going, to show respect for mine and her family's beliefs and to show respect for the gesture. I never actually intended not to go just wondering if I would be the asshole? Thank you.

Edit 2 : I attended the mass. My wife's family did not attend, just my family. I would have felt like an asshole if I didnt show because I wasnt made aware until middle of mass that I had to carry the eucharist up. Aside from feeling awkward and out of place it went well. I'm sure I could have come up with a better way to honor my wife while honoring her beliefs. I still feel disrespected to a point because after the mass my grandmother told me ""Now She* is one step closer to heaven""  and I didnt even know how to respond.

717,Not the A-hole,"All right a bit of back story here. I am in medical school in a different country I uprooted my life to make something of myself. My mother has the ""I'd like to speak to the manager haircut"", and believes everything she reads on facebook, not an anti-vaxxer here is some of the stuff she's done prior to me losing my shit: 

My dad had an infection on his hand, which led to a wart he was picking at it, I encouraged my dad to go see a doctor instantly and get antibiotics. My mom told him to put coconut oil on it... He did and then proceeded to go to the doctor and told him he should not have been putting ANYTHING on it. 

My brother had/has bad acne and her solution again, coconut oil... for acne... 

She slipped and fell and sprained her ankle, I told her she needs to follow the RICE method and she asked me ""can I only do ice"". I said no that only helps reduce the swelling you need to do EVERYTHING. She refused to listen. She is still dealing with that injury a year later. Now here is where shit gets infuriating... She went to a REAL doctor and they did an MRI and didn't find anything. They told her to essentially stay off the leg (no fucking shit). She went to this Japanese ""doctor"". He apparently thinks her veins are tangled and are causing pain and is removing her veins. 

Now apparently ""she's better"" but every couple hours there is pain and she needs to ""rest"". At this point I have already withdrawn myself from giving advice since it's clearly not needed. Now this same ""doctor"" apparently helped her with her ""celiac disease"" she's been celiac for the longest time and she did a parasite cleanse (something I suggested ages ago and something she told me she has done and it DID NOT WORK). She is now able to eat bread. 

[Now she also buys this](https://www.melaleuca.com/ProductStore/Product?sku=591) from that same doctor, I tried to explain to her that there is nothing in there that is patented that PROVES it works. But she spends 100s of dollars on this garbage. Whatever I gave up that fight a long time ago. 

Now here is where she crossed the line, I was a bit stressed out because my girlfriend found out her cancer is back, because I'm so far away I skype with my parents and I was screen sharing my computer and my GFs whatsapp messages with me were there and she saw them. She didn't say anything until after we hung up and she messages me immediately after asking if she can tell me something without be getting mad. I was like okay what's the worst thing you can ask. She says maybe you should send your GF to this ""doctor"" he's ""helped me"" so much. That was my breaking point, I lost my shit. I flat out told her she is disrespecting everything I am working for, I told this story to a few of my colleagues in school and they agree with me that it is insulating to us.

719,Not the A-hole,"Background on this: I have never seen eye to eye with my mother in law. MIL also has a boyfriend who I don't care for either. 

It has been her dream to take my kids on a Disney Cruise ever since they were born. We have had massive issues with her not caring about their safety (most egregious example, she let my daughter ride on the dashboard--yes the dashboard--of her car on the highway going 80mph. Her excuse was ""she had so much fun! I couldn't help it!). So I told her that if we could all go then maybe I would I consider it. 

Her boyfriends mom died last year and he got like a small $30000 inheritance and she talked him into spending it all on a Disney cruise for the entire family (two of them, husband and I, two kids). I am going because everyone is excited but I am dreading every single minute of it. I don't really like cruises, Disney is not my thing and we are going to be away from our business for about two weeks so getting back is going to be a nightmare. 

I was packing up last night and my now 8 year old came up to me and said ""Grandma said we are going to push you over the railing on day one so the rest of us can have some fun."" I was like whoa. I asked her what else she said and it was something like ""when your drowning she's going to hook Daddy up with a huge black lady who isn't such a snit about bad food.""

I immediately went to my husband and told him I was cancelling the trip. She has said things like this to my kids before so while it may not be an exact retelling, I know Bella didn't make this up. My husband is begging me not to cancel because he really needs the break from work. I told him fine, we'll take a two week camping trip or go to the beach but for me being around his mom will be worse than work--let alone she made a joke about murdering me. 

Kids are despondent that we might not go and now guilt is getting to me. would I be the asshole if I cancel this trip?

Edit (I guess 4 hours since OP): Thank you for all the advice, from you guys this is my plan of action:

1. I (and we) are going on the cruise. 

2. I’m going to far more fun than she ever could be, moms going to ride ATVs and do the rock wall. Her plan is just to stuff them with cake and candy. 

3. I’m going to talk with whoever I need to to ensure that my husband and I are the only ones who can kids out of activities. 

4. I’m going to thank her boyfriend profusely for paying for the trip. 

edit: I forgot the most important part, my husband is on his way over to her house to talk to her in person that what she said is not ok and go over the rules for the trip. She's going to have a meltdown but it's what she got by acting like a complete ass. 

Anything I’m missing?

Edit3: lots of you asking what happened after my husband talked with her last night, this is a C&P from a reply I made:

>She just head nodded him and cried last night doing her typical ""whoa is me, I never meant anything by it I was just being funny"" like she always does. She's in for a real surprise when we get on the ship and her plans to have the kids sleep in her room and feed them awful food isn't going to happen.

722,Not the A-hole,"Context: I am working as a registrar in a primary health clinic. I have been trained in ultrasounds and other routine radiology procedures. When usually ultrasounds are done, the patient is explained the process, what is expected of her/her, and what is to be expected from the procedure - namely how to expose the area to be evaluated, and how a staff will be present as chaperone. in antenatal ultrasounds - another qualifier that is added that the gender of the fetus will not be revealed under any circumstances. this is both implicit, as well as explicitly mentioned in the consent form, as well as explained to the patient in their local language.

So, today i got a referral for performing an antenatal ultrasound. The patient is a 21 year old lady, married for 3-4 months, currently amenorrheic for 3 months. The procedure was explained to her, and she signed a consent form. She was taken to the ultrasound room, and her abdomen was exposed. A cloth was kept over her (clothed) pelvic area, and she was asked to place her arms on either side of the head, so that the probe wire doesn't' tangle with her upper limbs.

5-10 minutes later, I entered the room. She was lying comfortably, and seemed reasonably relaxed. I made small talk with her, while prepping for the procedure - applying the gel, inputting patient data. As soon as i moved the probe towards her abdomen, she recoiled and covered her abdomen. The nurse standing with me asked her to relax, and to expose the abdomen, as it was the only way to visualize the fetus. Now, at 12 weeks, the uterus barely reaches the abdomen, and is more in the pelvis, so i mentioned the same to her. She seemed anxious and a bit uncomfortable. So, i asked her if she was alright, and she admitted to being a bit anxious. I reassured her, but she wouldn't expose her abdomen, constantly bringing her hands to her pelvic region. 10 minutes of measured talk, and getting increasingly frustrated, i suggested she go somewhere else for the same, and asked send her to cash counter for refund.

She begins to apologize, but by then I has reached the end of my tether. I couldn't be objective about evaluating her, and refused to entertain her. She called her husband, and he called a lot of other people, and the matter reached the police \[EDIT: The husband called a acquaintance of his, who promptly came over with 3-4 fellows, and when i refused to entertain them either, they went and filed a complaint against me for not treating a patient - something common in the region I work. They went and lodged a complaint. Next thing i know are the cops walking up to the room where i sit to evaluate patients telling a complaint has been filed against me by a concerned party\] -  who say i am in the wrong for refusing to accept her apology, and that i should perform the USG, and that proceedings will be initiated against me if i refuse to comply. she is not critically ill, and is haemodynamically stable, nor there is any threat to the life from the pregnancy. I can refuse to treat her, and i will. AITA here?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Some Clarifiers:

1. I am a man.
2. All ultrasounds(male/female) are performed in the presence of a chaperone - in this case a senior nurse.
3. Please don't call my parents names in PM's. Please be civil. If you would rather i delete this post, i would.

EDIT 2: I am doctor. I am currently undergoing Internal Medicine training. Have been trained in radiology for 12 weeks, before being posted in a PHC as part of my rotations. Here, people undergoing training in specialisations are called registrars. Sorry, I didn't think of the non-American aspect of it. Sincere apologies.

A dog, a pygmy goat, waterfowl including geese and ducks, and I think a single chicken made it through the winter lol. Oh and a lizard of some kind, bearded dragon I think. But the worst pet he has is an Umbrella Cockatoo. This bird is a fucking JUNGLE GOBLIN that can screech so loud you feel your ear drums start to revolt. If you ignore him it just gets louder. I would also be expected to groundskeep. Mowing, watering and pruning a huge yard.. So over the last year or so he would ask me to house sit for a night and pay me 50 bucks. It happened a handful of times. He came up with the amount, as I didn't know what was fair. 

So he has a trip planned that will keep him away for the entire month of June, and he asked if I would watch the house at the agreed upon price of 50 bucks a day. Right before he left he tried to lower the price to $25 a day and if it weren't for the bird I would have. I refused and we settled on $40 a day as long as it's as clean as he wants. 

He called me the other night and picked a fight, saying that I'm a gold digging friend who only hangs around him for his money. That a true friend would house sit for free. And he asked would I be helping if he didn't have money. I said if he didn't have money he wouldn't have a mansion and a farm to take care of and I probably WOULD do it as a favor.

730,Asshole,"My wife's birthday was this week, but we didn't get to do much for it because of how busy we are. I'm currently working 7 days - 12 hours a day so I didn't have time to do anything with her. She's also been pretty busy taking care of our kids, and doing the sports and stuff.

Anywho, I figured she could use a break, and I need to make up for her birthday anyway. So I planned for my mother to pick the kids up from her, and made a $230 appointment for a three hour session for a massage, spa, facial, and whatever else they do. I got the nicest package they have.

Well, I knew my son had a game, but I didn't realize how late it was going to run. So she started to go on about how now she has to rush to get to my mom on time, and she probably won't even enjoy the spa because she's going to be annoyed.

Okay. Fine, I guess. I tell her it'll be okay. She won't be close to being late for the appointment, and I'll let my mom know she might be running late. My mom wouldn't, and didn't mind. 

She then calls me to ask me why I didn't tell her where my mom was taking the kids. She was taking them to my sisters friends party. I said I didn't think it was important. They're only going to be there for an hour, and I didn't think it would be an issue. She started going off about how now she has to bathe the kids again, and I always plan things poorly, and I should have told her everything.

Admittedly, I should have thought about how long his game might be. My kids are always bathed tho. They're not gross, or anything. Also, if your kid is in baseball they're expected to be dirty after a game? He's five. He's supposed to be dirty. My mom isn't trying to impress these people, and we don't even know them. My mom doesn't even want to be there, but she doesn't want them to not come to my sisters thing.

Anyway, getting off topic. I'll shorten this up. I said she needs to just relax, and it'll be fine. She kept going off. I also admittedly got shitty at this point, and said I just shouldn't have bothered, I guess. Or something along those lines. She hung up, and texted me to just cancel the appointment. Said she's not going. I won't get my money back, mind you. The appointment is in a couple hours. I'll probably just tell a friend to go enjoy themselves if she doesn't go.

TL;DR, didn't do anything for wife's birthday because work, got her a pricey three our spa day, she says I made the plans poorly, went off on me, and said to just cancel it even though I won't get my money back.

Everyone around us, including our parents, told us parenting was great, and that we were such strong people that we could do it. So, we decided to keep the baby. We had a beautiful little girl, and we loved her with all our hearts. 

However, we were 18 at the time. We had no money, were struggling to get jobs, and we had no idea how difficult a kid would be. Our parents turned sour once the baby was born, telling us we were stupid and they wouldn’t help us. After 7 months of struggling financially and mentally, we put our wonderful daughter up for adoption, and she was taken from us.

I don’t like to think or talk about this time. As you can imagine it was the worst thing in the world, I never have and never will go through anything worse, but we knew she deserved a better life than we could give her. The family did not want to tell her she was adopted until she was much older, so we haven’t seen or heard from our baby girl since then. We got through it together.

We are both 29 now. We both redid our A levels, went to uni, married at 24, and are now financially stable and own a house together. Last night I decided to ask her if she thought she wanted to have children with me.

So, a couple days ago, a group of friends of mine and I decided to go to a gay bar, since most of us are gay/bi (I am bi).Plus, there was a drag show scheduled for that day -something we all enjoy- so the two straight girls of the group didn’t mind joining.The night was overall incident-free, until a guy started approaching me and asked me whether I’d like to dance with him.At first I was not really in the mood, however I just went along with it since it could be fun, and the reason why I went out on the first place was to have a good time.
I was tipsy (I am aware of my limits) but he was visibly drunker, but not completely out of it.One thing led to the other and we soon found ourselves in one of the bathroom stalls, very turned on and intensively making out.He slid his hand into my jeans and got visibly disturbed in a matter of seconds.He almost immediately pulled it out and just stared at me for a while.I asked him whether something was wrong and he responded with “Well yes, you didn’t say you’re a woman”.I almost thought he was joking, but then asked him why he thought that I was not one.Long story short, in his drunken state I looked like a “very hot crossdresser” so he just “went for it”.I apologised for the confusion, however I insisted that, had he asked, I would had specified my gender, so it was mostly his fault for just assuming shit in the first place.He just told me to fuck off and left.

So AITA in this situation?

TL;DR:Some guy at a gay bar assumed I was a crossdresser, never asked for a specification and got pissed when he found out I wasn’t one.

EDIT:Wow, this got way more attention than I originally thought it would.I would like to thank you all for taking the time to read it and comment on it.I apologise for not being able to respond to everyone though.

So, I would like to clarify something ; I didn’t think I was at fault in this situation and neither did the majority of my friends.Nevertheless, since one of my friends thought that it was partly my fault as well, I really wanted to see with whom a third party would agree more.

I understand that sometimes our actions can come out as insensitive and rude, even though our intentions weren’t such.Especially in a community where some people are still shy/embarrassed/judged.Having read all your opinions now, I still think there’s not something I could had done different, although - in any future interactions - I will try to be a little more clear about myself.

Also, I am using the term “gay bar” a little loosely ; as in a bar for gay people (not just men) , LGBTQ+ people in general, even straight people who just felt like joining.

Again,thank you all for taking time to judge me.Oh and btw, thanks for teaching me how to properly type lol.I am more of a pen and paper girl, so typing long texts was never really my forte.",89,265,0.81

737,Not the A-hole,"Hi guys! Almost a year ago, my dad suddenly went MIA on us. My mom said he gathered all of his stuff in the middle of the night and left while she’s away on a trip for work. This was after he was caught by mom cheating with a college girl who he paid the tuition for, gave allowances, and even provided financial aid for the mistress’s family. Mom confronted him but he countered “he was just trying to help the poor girl.” He was multiple times & my mom confronted him but he denied the allegations yet again.  Dad had been blatantly calling his mistress within earshot yet he acts like he’s done nothing wrong. Did I say they now have a kid? Yeah. But that’s not the end of it.

Earlier this year, a lot of people from different banks had been coming to our house looking for him cos he fled and didn’t fcking pay his multiple debts. And now, the banks kept on pestering my mom to pay for them cos he freaking forged her signature as a co-borrower without her consent! Mother had been crying cos she doesn’t have the money to pay for everything!

Bet you think that’s all huh. Hell naw! A few weeks later another bank came to ask for a full payment or else our house will be forfeited. Turns out, my dad had made it as a collateral for a loan he couldn’t pay. After my mom told me the story, i almost broke down. Me and my siblings are living in different cities now but we try hard to chip in to at least pay for the interest. I was so angry I wished him death but I can’t cos he’s still my father. We’re trying our best to forget him and normally go on with our lives, take on these problems step by step though it has been real difficult lately.

Then last week, he called to “check up” on me. I’m still furious after everything he’s done so i told him to fuck off and don’t contact me again cos I don’t want him in my life anymore. I think that was the harshest I’ve been to my dad. I just exploded with anger and couldn’t really care less about what he would feel. Then I hung up on him and blocked his number. Since then I have been thinking about it and this gnawing guilt has never left me that I couldn’t sleep at night sometimes. I’m just in shambles cos at the end of the day, he’s still my father. He’s the man who fed me, sent me to school, and provided everything I needed growing up until he just went nuts with his cheating and debts. I just feel so guilty and too conflicted about the way I acted. Now, some of my relatives think I’m TA.

TLDR; Dad left after cheating on my mom, sold our house without us knowing, and now we are drowned in the pits of debt because of him and I said fuck you to him and to never appear in my life again.

738,Asshole,"When my sister came out to me a couple years ago, I told her I don't care about her being gay. In hindsight*, she was looking for an answer like ""you're so brave"" or ""I support you,"" so my apathy took her by surprise, and she hasn't fully regained her trust in me since then. 

It's not that I don't care about her; I genuinely mean that I don't care if she's gay. I support my sister for being my sister, and it shouldn't matter if she's gay or not. If she's bullied for being gay I'll 100% stand up for her, but it hasn't (and shouldn't) change how I feel about her. I care about her just as much after as before.

 I've always hated how people use things like sexuality, religion, race, etc. for attention. I mean, it's one thing when you're speaking out against discrimination against yourself or your people, but when people use it for personal gain it irritates me. I support you for being you, and no matter if you're white, black, Christian, Muslim, atheist, gay, straight, trans, etc. that's not going to change how I see you as a person, and I will never discriminate against someone solely because of these things.

Edit: to be clear, I know she wasn't asking for attention, I was just saying I don't like when other people use their sexuality/race/religion for attention or personal gain

740,Not the A-hole,"My son is 2 and today he had his second day at soccer. He is enjoying it especially the freezies and endless field to run on.

Last week on his first day, my real expectation just him have fun even if he's chasing butterflies. Just running outside and being outside is good. He played well, kind of shy going on the field a lot but he's a shy kid. He enjoys it and looks forward to the next week.

Today, he did really good. He played mosty off field and going on the field to really run on and kick the ball whenever I told him his team needs his help. Rest of time he's running and kicking his own ball which is awesome to see him dribble the ball (whats the soccer term?) My wife was miserable at the game because he wasnt primarily playing on the field like most of the kids and he was playing off field. For me it was fine he going in every now and then (as I said earlier whenever I told him he team needs help) and I will get him to spend more time on the field as the weeks go by (the team loves you helping and he will probably stay).

After the game, I ask him if he has fun he says yes and wants to go back again next weekend. Awesome, he enjoys going out on field. My wife complains again how he never spends time on the field like the other kids implying something wrong him. I told her its normal, my father and brother were both there saying its ok he had he played soccer with himself for now and he enjoys it. She still complains that it isnt normal for him to be 2 and ""far behind"" the other kids. A lot of these kids are from soccer families and this is their 2nd season ( January start ). She doesnt see it that way and disagrees with me.

Not wanted the negativity around his experience at soccer, I tell her next weekend and going forward I dont want her going to his games. I want him to have fun, learn soccer and eat freezies.

Am I the asshole for telling my wife to not come to soccer games?

Im sincerely also looking for devils advocate view points too because she cant probably express her thoughts.

EDIT: Important point noted from a commenter. My wife is from China been in North America for 10 years now. Had parents her treated her the same but hated. She is unable to express why shes doing it to our son for soccer. My apologies, please edit responses, I will go over them again.",290,1963,0.96

743,Not the A-hole,"Doesn’t sound good, and I’m also torn about it. Please give me your honest verdict. 

My best friend had a very bad, toxic relationship in the past. This was on-and-off for a while and went on for nearly two years. 

A year ago they finally broke up ‘for real’ and it took her some months to get over it. Right now she’s not even completely over him, I guess. Problem is that this guy has quite a strong personality, and my best friend is the sweetest human being on this planet - but struggles standing her ground. (She admits this also and is working on it.) 

We’re roommates now, and some time ago this guy suddenly showed up by her door. (Not stalkery, it’s the same address she had before. I moved in with her.) Best friend wasn’t there and I was ready to turn him away, but he started pleading that he has really changed and wants to get in touch with her again and even wrote her a letter. (As she has him blocked everywhere.) 

He asked me to give it to her and I said sure, but didn’t do it. I’m sure she will fall for him again, even though he said all these things before. I love her to bits and don’t want to let this guy hurt her anymore. 

AITA for not giving her the letter and let her decide for herself?

Edit: The relationship was toxic in the sense that he was extremely jealous and manipulative about it too. (‘I only need you, why do you need friends te make you happy? Etc.) He never physically abused her, as far as I know.",44,44,0.89
744,Not the A-hole,"Hey everyone,
I work in a retail store as a summer job because I’m still in school. I just got hired at this new place around two weeks ago. I have this coworker, let’s call him Eric. He’s 26, whereas I’m only 18. So I barely know Eric obviously, as I’ve only had a few shifts with him. However, he started joking with me and trying to get to know me pretty early on. He has an extremely sarcastic personality. Despite barely knowing him, he called me ‘slow’ one time, told me when he first met me he thought I was a bitch, and told me I was a hoe. All these things were done sarcastically, so I wasn’t offended. However, this made me assume he can take a joke.

The most recent shift he started ranting to me about his life. I felt kinda uncomfortable because he was over sharing a lot. He kept being like “I’m so average, I’m so ugly, like I’m bad at everything I do.” So I didn’t really know what to say because I barely know him, and he was begging for compliments. I was just like “no you’re not, stop saying that.” But in response to that, he was like “no you hesitated.” Then he started ranting to me about how nobody takes him seriously, and he feels like a little bitch even though he’s an adult. I laughed when he called himself a little bitch because I was so uncomfortable. Then he started being like “I was being serious, why did you laugh at me?” Then he proceeded to ignore me and roll his eyes at me for the rest of the shift. 

Am I the asshole here?",83,405,0.91
745,Not the A-hole,"Before anyone goes to call me out on fat shaming. No. This is not what this post is about in the slightest. I'm all about healthy body positivity and encouragement to love yourself.      


Now that this is out of the way, let me try to explain my situation. I've been doing ballroom and latin tournament dancing for about two years now, my partner is a female around my age (19) who is overweight. Now don't get me wrong, she isn't obese, she is actually pretty fit for her body type, but there is still a significant difference in weight between her and the other girls in our club. She was the one who actually encouraged me to start training, was always patient with me when we agreed to be partners and helped me build up confidence to dance like I do today. I owe her alot, and she is a very close friend even privately.     

We've never really had to argue but recently there has been some tension rising between us. As of now, I do not have the time to train like I would half a year ago. Graduating from highschool and a part time job don't allow for 5 training sessions along with a class or private lesson per week. She was already very upset when I told her I would have to limit it to 2 per week max.      


She expects us to go back to the absolutely exhausting schedule once i have more time and I honestly lost most of my motivation for such high intensity training. I still want to participate and go there once or twice a week, but even that is getting harder and harder the better we get. And of course not all, but most, problems we encounter stem from her weight. We need time to get movements or techniques down, that take the others a fraction of what we waste, and I feel like part of that really comes from how much she weighs. She always talks high and mighty about how she wants to get a breast size reduction because of her back, but can't do it due to the state not paying it unless she weighs significantly less than she does now. She says she's on a diet but I always catch her snacking on something unhealthy, sweet or fatty when we hang out.     

Now, WIBTA if I told her I do not want to continue our training unless she _drastically_ changes her eating habits? Because I do not feel like investing this much time just because she cannot restrain herself, while I actually set up a diet and exercise plan for myself, even though I am fit as is. I'm strict with myself and try my best to make this partnership work, but feel like she only ever has motivation to be all competetive about dancing, but never about her body.      
     


Again. She is my close friend. I do not wish to upset or hurt her feelings at all. She is very dear to me, but this is not fun for me anymore.
      

Edit: I live an hour away from the city without a car and have to rely on public transportation, which is scarce here. I workout 5 times a week myself to stay fit, this was her suggestion in the first place.",114,47,0.77

748,Not the A-hole,"I live in an apartment with one other roommate, we split all the bills evenly except for rent. The electric is in her name and the wifi and gas are in my name because I already had accounts set up when we moved in together. She usually ends up owning me $30-$40 a month.

&#x200B;

We've never had any issues or fights, we're very much on the same page and it's a chill environment to live in. But now she's two months behind on paying me back for those bills and I'm in the hole $80. When I asked her at the end of April, she told me she had to wait until she was paid to send me the money. Which was fine, she gets paid biweekly so I knew when the money should be coming in. Payday comes for her, when she doesn't send it I send a reminding text a day later. She apologies but said she just had to pay all her other bills with that paycheck, but in two weeks when she gets paid she'll send the money. I was doing okay with money this month so I was okay waiting and then having some extra cash at the end of the month.

&#x200B;

Two weeks later comes, she now owes me for two months. I send a text when I get the bills in, asking for lasts month and this month's money to cover the bills. Now I get paid monthly, so it was the end of the month, I had ust paid rent, and my job is having issues with my paycheck, the big thing is that it's going to be a few days late. And I had literally $12 in my account and no food in the house, because I was counting on that paycheck to be in my account already like it should be.

&#x200B;

I was annoyed, because I was flat broke, but should of had $80 coming from my roommate so I'd be okay waiting for my paycheck for a couple days. My roommate than answers my text, saying she doesn't have the money now because she had to book an Airbnb in another state for her birthday in a couple weeks. I was fuming and didn't answer. And that night she stocked the kitchen with groceries for her and got takeout for dinner.

&#x200B;

So she left for her birthday trip yesterday. No money was sent my way, when she comes back she'll have a week until she owes me close to $120, and I doubt she'll come back from a trip with extra cash like that, and I'll get the same nonsense about having to wait two weeks. So I changed the wifi password, which kicked everyone off the wifi. She can have the password again when I'm paid back in full.

&#x200B;

I was telling this to some of my friends, and they all said I was being petty and creating problems because she'll pay me back eventually. This happened once before and I was paid back after two months. And I do feel really petty, but it'd been two months now, coming up on three, where I've been paying for the wifi all by myself. If she was having money problems and told me we could've talked this out and I wouldn't have minded as much. But all I've heard from her is that she doesn't have the money because she's planning a big birthday trip and going out a lot.",49,207,0.96

754,No A-holes here,"So we were 13 months into searching for a house. Came across a brand new builder that had two houses being built next to each other in the area we wanted. Both were 3BR house that were $20K different in prices. We chose the cheaper house due to layout and lighting (but had less square footage). But really debated between both houses.   

We were first to build with them so they were initially great about upgrades but always felt the need to let us know they wouldn’t do this for every house- only ours since that was the beauty of customizing a house with them. Towards the end when we wanted things (things they initially promised were “included”) they started to get shitty and said these things would have to come out of our “budget” for upgrades. Let me say we picked everything- floor, light fixtures, knobs, paint colors, cabinets etc. We spent 8 hours just picking and finding the lights in the house. Searched for the perfect pieces and then sent link to builder to buy items for house.   

Fast forward- we move in to house in April. Other house is nearly finished but not yet sold. We went to open house and literally they got every single one of our upgrades (without having to negotiate for it). They have the same exact kitchen cabinets including handles (these are also in all the bathrooms) as well as the same bathroom lights we picked (searched and found online). We overheard them hint that the house price is now decreasing again (which means it will be comparable to ours) and they are offering a custom trek deck to the buyer of neighboring house as well as a “large incentive gift” (we didn’t get either of these).

We are rather annoyed as now the house next to ours is slightly bigger, looks incredibly similar to ours inside and they get a trek deck for same price.   Is it reasonable for us to be annoyed with this? We feel like although we got to “customize” our home given that they mimicked everything next door it looks more like their brand now than our personal picks (I.e. they’re emulating our choices and making these items staples to their brand). We spent a ton of time picking everything out for the neighbors to get the same, pay the same and then actually get a deck out of it (we did not get this).",36,41,0.9
755,Everyone Sucks,"One of my relatives just had their first grandchild. Ever since the baby was born, she has been texting a group of people (including me) baby pictures several times a week. I'm getting a little tired of it, if for no other reason than all the text alerts. (It's a group text, not a group chat, so I can't leave the conversation as easily). 

&#x200B;

Recently, another relative went in for life-threatening surgery, with her family keeping us updated with text alerts. After she came out of the (successful) surgery, the new grandma replied with another baby picture, stating ""Baby is so happy for her! in her adorable new outfit, too!"" Immediately, the text chain split, with half trying to get updates on the surgery, and the other half confirming that, yes, the outfit was adorable.

760,Not the A-hole,"This particular ex and I dated for less than a month. She told me she loved me about a month after we met and before we started dating. When we went on our first date, she said ""I know you're depressed, but try to smile and act happier at least, because you're bringing my mood down.""

In hindsight, there were hundreds of red-flags, but then again, hindsight is 20/20.

I broke things off with her because I realized I was still in love with someone else, and not with her. I broke up with her less than a week after realizing this.

I came to realize she was a very manipulative person before, during, and after we were dating. She would start off with being okay with what I wanted, and then slowly push me into doing what she wanted.

Example: There were several times near the end of our relationship when I did not want to sleep with her. She would say ""If you dont want to do it tonight, that's fine. I dont want you to be uncomforable."" To which I would respond ""Okay, I dont want to do anything tonight.""

""Okay. Well, it just kinda makes me feel like you dont love me. It makes me feel like you think I'm ugly."" This would continue until she guilted me into sleeping with her.

We both had one of the other's blankets, and she left my blanket on my doorstep. When I unfolded the blanket, I saw a six page letter detailing what an awful person I am.

Many parts of the letter were typed in caps, bold, italics, underlined, in red, or some combination of those things.

In the letter, she gets mad at me for forgiving her ""ex"" because ""right now, he's still an asshole."" I had forgiven him for ""cheating"" on her, because they never started dating so he was free to see whoever he felt. He was also dealing with major depression, which I felt I could help with as he lived two doors down from me in our dorms.

She humble brags about going to events such as choir concerts and piano recitals she didnt want to attend, which she never told me when we dated.

She tells me she's going to take my friends away from me (which she successfully did with my best friend and the girl I mentioned I actually loved.)

She tells me that I made her want to hurt herself AND brings up three that she ""saved my life"" when I was deep in my depression (which I'm not anymore, thank God) and she says that I had better be grateful and appreciate her because I owe her my life.

I decided to show my friends the letter because it was the only proof I had of the kind of person she was. She even says at the end, ""if you show this letter to your friends, I hope you dont change a single word, because I believe I have been appropriately angry and blunt.""

My entire family (mum, bro, myself) was hostage to my father's moods. He spent his time isolating us, bullying us, gaslighting us, screaming at us for hours until we cried (or threw up in the case of my brother), throwing landline phones or chairs at my mother (but never actually hitting her, which used to make me think this wasn't *really* bad), and more, until the divorce.

When i hit puberty it became even nastier so I refused to see him and he'd call me a 100 times a day until hearing the phone ring would make me retch, stand in front of my mum's building for hours, scaring the neighbours and occasionally breaking the glass door.

I told him I wouldn't take any insult directed at my mother, he'd say ""you know it's not your mum's fault if she is stupid"", which he was really adamant did not qualify as insulting her.

Because I'm petty as hell, what truly prompted me to cut ties was that whenever I opposed him, he'd act as if he was proud of me for ""standing up for myself"".
I realised he was trying to turn this into a ""I made you tough"" narrative and I was not having it. I ghosted him. He sent me 4 letters that all start with ""Well I dont know what I did to you but I'm sorry"". They were promptly binned.

*The twist*: my father has a severe undiagnosed mental illness which contributed to making him this way, notably by ""making him"" an alcoholic, leading to him being unemployed for almost his entire life. I have this same mental illness but much less severe, so I know what it's about. Regardless, he still made the choice to torture us, and not by accident: he brought my mum into his country only to forbid her to learn the language. He then was obsessed with only having daughters (because women are weak and easily controllable, amirite), when my brother was born he was so mad he didn't hold him for the first 6months of his existence. My brother took his 1st steps because my father was screaming and he was trying to get away from him.

Whether or not they know this, people who seem to think I am in the wrong here insist I should forgive my father and resume communication, for... closure?
What I'm thinking is I dont need to forgive anyone! I moved on and this is not part of my life anymore. Speaking to him means teaching him about how much of an ass he is and trying to make him see the light. I feel the efforts would be at 90% coming from me and I'm over this, not a project I am interested in. Besides, would it not be better for him to die alone not knowing - he isnt even really alone because my brother is a selfless angel and takes care of him.

TLDR; My father made my childhood a nightmare but partly due to an undiagnosed mental illness.
Also I'm super petty and I know my decision is somewhat linked to that.

I’m now a month away from giving birth and today when my husbands ex found out what we were planning on naming baby, she laughed and said “oh we chose that for boy 2!” but ultimately they went with something else. I asked husband later and he confirmed she was right, he just didn’t want to tell me.

I feel like the name is ruined for me now. It doesn’t feel right calling my baby that now knowing that she liked the name and that they had chosen it for one of their sons.

I faked excitement and asked my sister what she was going to get, mum is letting her get a tattoo of a knife on her leg and a mace on her arm. cool tattoo ideas for someone that is of legal age. 

she has already had sex and had a pregnancy scare so I thought that she had aged up or mum had at least developed a brain. 

I told my mum that if she was actually going to allow this I would call CPS, she told me I'm the sister not the mother so I have no right to call CPS.

Anyway this specific incident starts when my roommates in our group chat start freaking out because the office called and gave a “last warning” about leaving trash outside. No one in the apartment knows what they are talking about. So I go to my property manager (because I am now an employee at the office) and I apologise but i know we’ve been taking out the trash; I’m sure it’s other residents that are leaving them so please don’t fine us.

And also used and dirtied and didn’t wash the pot I was gonna use for my dinner. They have been walking all over me. I literally do everything for them.

If it’s yours please message back because without hearing anything I’m throwing it all away. 

I didn’t hear anything back. So I did. Bugs were everywhere. It was gross. Rotting fruit leaked from one of the containers.

I met Mary in college 10 years ago, and I met her boyfriend later the same day. Her boyfriend was drop dead gorgeous, but I identified as straight at the time and sealed up those feelings pretty well. The three of us were close through college, and Mary and David graduated, married, and moved away.

Cut to 10 years later, and I'm single following a string of long term relationships with women that were not particularly fulfilling. I kept in touch with Mary, and she welcomed me as a guest while I was in town for a conference. While at their house, I mentioned in passing to David that I was questioning myself, and he showed interest. While alone, we cuddled but didn't go further. After I left, we both expressed regret for having not explored this further, and the next 4 months or so was a period of explicit online conversations, then I traveled back for a week to see him and follow through physically. After that trip, he grew distant and I moved on date other (non-married) men.

Over the next few months, Mary started volunteering relationship advice to me and anyone who would listen. Her intentions were good, but it was grating to think about: 1) her marriage is clearly not as perfect as she presents it, and 2) she shouldn't be offering me any friendly advice, given that I am the asshole who secretly slept with her husband. Finally, one day she was gushing about how she and her husband were physically ill whenever they were apart, and I wrote up an email to her saying David and I had premeditated sex a few months prior, and I have evidence (chatlogs) of the affair if she wants it. Mary and David immediately block me on all platforms, as would be expected.

Mutual friends weren't very surprised that the affair occurred, but some friends did consider me an asshole for telling Mary months later, particularly when I was doing it for my own closure moreso than hers. Still, it's good I told her, right?

I’m in charge of picking and buying the ring since we agree I have better taste and I’ll be wearing it. BF told me he is comfortable with contributing 14k, which I’m fine with, and after discussing it with my mom, my mom and I decided that we would top up another 11k (to be split equally between my mom and I). BF gave this the green light. 

This week, my mom and I went ring shopping and we discussed the options at home. My dad overheard our conversation and asked in an annoyed tone: “If his budget is 14k, why the hell are you guys topping it up and getting sth fancier?” I explained that it’s a win-win - he doesn’t pay more than what he’s comfortable with and I share the burden to afford sth I truly like. My mom’s share is, well, a wedding gift, which is very kind of her. 

My dad wasn’t satisfied and grudgingly asked: “Why does he have to ‘buy’ you?” Patiently my mom and I explained it’s quite common practice now, that my BF’s older brother and sister both have engagement rings (bought entirely by the guys). Dad concluded the conversation with: “Does he feel insulted by what you’re doing?”, and it was very clear that it was an accusation, not a question. 

While my BF and I are both young, we’re both successful professionals and both have large amounts of savings. My BF’s share (14k) will put a small dent in his, and I feel that by offering to top up, I’m not implying “urgh, you’re too poor” but rather “it’s only fair that I also pay for part of my ring.” My mom agrees, but my dad thinks I’m spoiled and ungrateful.

772,Asshole,"I have worked with rescue dogs my entire adult life and have 3 dogs of my own. My boyfriend brought home a puppy in January. My boyfriend's puppy is about 9 months old, she's very cute and loves my boyfriend and I. She gets along very well with two of my dogs, however about a month ago she started picking on my third dog. 

A little background on my third dog: we think he's a border collie mix about two years old and I rescued him at about 7 months old. He had distemper as a stray puppy and has since been cured, but suffers from serious nerve damage because of it. He's a sweet boy and loves to snuggle and play, but he only has a few teeth and isn't coordinated like a dog his age should be. He's not in any pain.

My boyfriend's puppy spends a lot of time at my house while he's at work, because I have a large dog friendly yard and he lives in an apartment. He brought her over one morning and put her in the yard and she made a beeline for my third dog. She growled and rolled him over and stood over him. initially I just assumed she was getting older and trying to find her place in the pack, so I let it slide. However throughout the day she continued to have unprovoked incidents with him, so I decided to keep them separated.

The final straw for me was yesterday, he brought her over and she made another beeline for my third dog,but this time she picked him up by the neck and shook him. I struggled to pull her off of him and ended up getting bit in the scuffle. My dog ended up with punctures where she grabbed him.

My boyfriend has been defensive saying that I should re-home my dog, but I don't feel the same way. He's not interested in paying a behaviourist to work with his puppy, he believes it's somehow my third dogs fault, because she likes the other two just not him.

My brother (28) just got back from deployment. For several years he has done his best to keep his distance from our family and not talked to any of us. 

Two days ago he turns up on my doorstep with his bags. Our mother passed a few years ago, my father a year before that, and no one heard from him during any of that. 

So he’s on my doorstep being happy and pretending he is just stopping in. Talking as if it hadn’t been nearly a decade. 
Then he tells me the place he was going to stay at fell through and he has no where to go. 

Now.. I live in a two bedroom apartment. With my husband and two 5 year olds. We don’t have enough room for another person - let alone someone I don’t even really know anymore. 

I ask him if he needs money for a cab, or for me to check with some friends of mine to see if they can take on a renter. 
At the mention of him paying rent he loses his shit. He starts raising his voice and tensing his arms. My husband  stood up defensively (understandably in my opinion). At which point my brother started to look like he was about to start a fight. 
My husband used to be a police officer and he warned my brother to calm down or get out. 
After some yelling and some firm intimidation from my husband, my brother left, slamming the door on his way out, yelling about how I’ve never been a good sister. 

So here I am. I feel bad. But I feel stupid for feeling bad. Like. He verbally assaulted my husband and I, in my house, with my kids in the next room, after we offered to help. 
But a part of me is saying... he might have been in combat. He might not be seeing things right. I don’t know what he has gone through in the military in the last 8 or so years.

My estranged brother got back from deployment and wanted a place to stay. We haven’t got the space but I offered to help find him somewhere. He got very angry and we kicked him out immediately. Now he likely doesn’t have anywhere to go at all. I feel bad.

My period had arrived more than a week early, and it always causes horrible symptoms (severe cramps, vomiting, hot flashes, migraines, etc.). I text my BF and instead of shopping he just drives me back to his place.

Once back at his place I take some ibuprofen and a bath before crawling into his bed to try and sleep the pain off. Once I wake up I find my boyfriend playing Xbox with some buddies online, and I head of to the bathroom to take care of myself. I'd been in the bathroom for less than 30 seconds before my BF knocks aggressively on the door demanding to come in. I follow him into the bedroom where he points to a golf ball sized blood stain on his sheets. I apologise and offer to take the sheets down to the apartment laundry room to have them washed. Instead he hands me a bottle of hydrogen peroxide and a cleaning rag and tells me to hand wash them. I tell him I would much rather just pay the $2.00 to wash them downstairs, since I'm still not feeling well. He pulls the sheets off and tells me that I can hand wash them or I can leave. In which case I chose the latter and got an Uber back to my car at the hardware store to spend the rest of the weekend at my parents place instead.

Necessary Backstory: My immediate family has never gotten along with my wife and vice versa. They think she's dramatic (she is) and she gets upset that they refuse to resolve problems and instead pretend they aren't effecting anyone (they do). 

The Dilemma: My mother is an incredible woman and she wants to continue a long heratige of wonderfully quant and well themed birthday celebrations with her grandkids. Every year she asks to do something separate from my wife's planned celebration which is frustrating but understandable. Her wanting to flex her own grandmother creativity coupled with an hours drive and the fact that they seldom socialise at our parties anyways, we accommodate them almost every time they request a smaller get together at their house. 

Two days ago my mother sent us a message saying that she would like to have a get together at her house to celebrate our daughters birthday. The problem was that she said she had already spoken with all my siblings and made arrangements for them to be there on such and such a date. She closed asking what we thought. 

Now, we had already been planning a celebration at our house but hadn't sent out invitations as it's still a ways away, however the logical weekend date was the same as shed taken the liberty of choosing for her get together. My wife immediately got upset and told me that my mother was trying to exert control and how awful it was. I tried to calm her down while defending what I wanted to believe (and still do) was a sweet intention.

I replied back that we had already been planning her celebration for that date and that we would gladly accommodate a second get together for them the following weekend if they couldn't attend. I get a reply back that the date I proposed isn't good for them and that we should plan their get together for the day after our celebration. Frustrated I declined as I would like some rest on my weekend (especially after entertaining a children's party) and I work two jobs. 

Now, we had a family chat and a subsequent falling out because everyone views us as being difficult. How absurd is it to get upset that I wouldn't further accommodate them at my own expense when they won't even consider attending the celebration my wife is planning? She pours herself into these little parties with budget-centric but immersive themes for the kids to enjoy. They're always over the top and to have my family just start planning their own before even asking about the date, to us, is too much.

My family's defense is that my mom wanted to do something sweet for her grandkids (which I get and appreciate entirely) and that they'd only asked us if that date was okay because they'd made certain they were all available.

We moved to our current house a little over a year ago. We are on the end of a cul-de-sac. Our lot is shaped oddly, and it borders an apartment complex. There is a tall hedge, but unfortunately it does not completely extend along the property line.

Over time, we've noticed people using our yard as a shortcut to get from the apartment complex to our cul-de-sac and then presumably from there to the grocery stores and restaurants nearby. On the map, the yellow arrows are the routes people are taking through our yard.

Am I wrong for feeling this is unnecessary and needs to stop? We have 3 small children, and I don't like the idea of strangers walking through my back yard just because they can't be bothered to walk an extra block along the street.

Additionally, what can I do? I'm not great with confronting people, but I've come up with a few ideas:

1. Set up Wyze cameras and do *something* with the footage (send it to the police, post it on YouTube, idk?)

2. Put up ""No Trespassing"" signs. Would this actually work, or just make the trespassers mad and make things worse?

3. Try to give Gospel tracts to anyone who walks through and ask them if they're heard the Good News. (We're Christians. Mennonites to be exact so I'm pretty good at being passive-aggressive. )

Anyway, two days ago he died in a car crash. It was horrible for her, I can't imagine how hard it's going to be for her now.

Immediately upon hearing I went to her city and stayed with her for a while. Her friends and family were there but she gave me by far the most attention.

Last night, at the wake (at his parents house not hers), we were in the kitchen chatting and hugging, then I'm not sure who initiated (maybe we both did) but we kissed. 

Now I'm not going to lie, I am very attracted to her and it could be all the emotions coming back but no part of me didn't not want to kiss he. She's gorgeous, cute and feels perfect in my arms.

Anyway, her boyfriend's friend walked in on us and went ballistic on us. We tried to get him to calm down but he ended up telling everyone and making a scene.

I left right after, but everyone at the wake was calling me an asshole, some even threatening to kick my ass saying I'm taking advantage of her, a grieving widow.

The funeral was today, and obviously I didn't go.

I texted my friend 6 hours ago saying I'm terribly sorry for causing this and that I hope she remains strong during such an awful day. She never replied which is fine, I don't expect her too right now.

However, i got text from her mother earlier telling me never contact her daughter again.

I apologized and told her the emotion of the situation caused us to act irrationally, and that it doesn't mean anything.

Another mutual friend messaged me on Facebook saying that she can't believe I'd be such a cunt and the advantage of someone who's grieving.

I know I kinda fucked up and I should have stopped up. But do I deserve all this hate?

It's not that I was taking advantage, I know how this comes across to everyone who's also grieving too. I didn't know the guy well, but I do feel his loss knowing so much about him too. He was effectively my best friends husband (they didn't believe in marriage and they did plan to spend their life together).

I'm very worried about her though. 

But either way, am I an asshole?",496,908,0.9
790,Not the A-hole,"I was in school to be a funeral director. Most people who know me know this, and it has led to people coming up to me to ask funeral questions, usually about funerals in their families.

So I'm at a family event, and my cousin (D) who had a stillbirth comes up and asks if she can speak to me in private, so we go off to one side and she says that the funeral home who cared for her boy is scamming her, the grave wasn't correct and, what course of action should she take. Of course I look at the pictures of the grave, see that not only is nothing spelled right, but they didn't even build it correctly, so our conversation goes inside the house where I can access the internet to help her craft letters to the funeral home, the cemetery, and the council for funeral directors who might be able to help straighten the whole mess out. Her loss occurred several years ago now (probably like 2 years). But she's only now dealing with the grave because they hadn't decided if that was the route she wanted to take, and the funeral home is still involved since they're claiming she didn't pay even though she did AND SHE HAS A RECEIPT.

Since we were now in a public area, another family member who also lost a child came in, because she used the same funeral home and had similar issues (big surprise). Both family members don't know each other that well, but the second family member (V) lost her one year old to SIDS 10 years ago.

They both started discussing their losses, and V said to D ""I don't know why you're even bothering, it wasn't like you knew the kid."" At this point I tried to leave because I knew it would go south fast, and I had seen enough issues in the funeral service that I knew it would get physical. D ever the saint, just said ""V, this isn't appropriate, although I understand you're still grieving, understandably"", and V JUST KEPT GOING ""you need to let it go"" she said.

At this point, D has begun to lose her temper and is saying that they both are grieving and always will be, but that it isn't right to make it into a competition. V then shoots back with ""if it were a competition, I'd win, right (mmmmaplesyrup420)""

I said ""I understand you both have suffered loss the likes of which I will never comprehend, but it isn't right to compete for grief, Nobody's going to say you're grieving more or less than the next guy, and just because one of you is grieving on a different timeline, doesn't mean your grief is less valid, nor your loss easier or worse."" D seemed okay with this but V was very offended that I said that, called me an ass, and left. Her mom initiated a very angry phone call with me, where she basically told me I minimized the grief of V, and D shouldn't have argued.

791,Not the A-hole,"Long story shortish. I moved in with my boyfriend(Josh) and his roommate (Matt) about 2 years ago and everything was great and we all got along well, they were best friends. Then my roommate gets a girlfriend(V) whom my boyfriend does not like from the beginning and she and I are ok for a while. However we get into an argument because she says she’s going to get a cat (I am highly allergic and my bf hates cats) and I told her she can’t just get a cat without asking us first and we will say no. Plus my dog will likely kill or injure it. She loses her shit and screams at us saying she can do whatever she wants because it’s her house too. (She punched holes in the wall which I didn’t find out until much later) Eventually Matt talks her down and that was that but I distanced myself from her a lot since then. 

We all end up moving in with a friend (Joe) into a 3 bedroom apt because rent would be a steal. Things are great, but V and I are alone one day and she tells me, “I’ve only wanted to really physically hurt you once, when we had the fight about the cat. I wanted to shove my fist down your throat and beat your ass so hard and the only reason I didn’t was because Matt was there and it was damage our relationship, if he wasn’t there I don’t know what would have happened.” I’m going to be honest I don’t know how to fight what so ever and she has been in plenty of them. So after that conversation I didn’t and don’t feel safe around her alone and I don’t want any conflict out of fear she may hurt me when we are alone in the apartment together. And I don’t want to tell Matt because I know he’s going to try to fix it which will not go well. So I just stay as civil as possible. She uses a lot of cocaine and I think she was selling at one point. Fortunately V said they plan on moving out at the end of the lease into their own apt. Matt has said nothing to Josh and they used to be pretty up front with each other. 

The lease is ending in a few months Joe, Josh, and I are on board with moving out if Matt and V don’t. However Matt and V could barely pay rent this month (which is much lower than normal since we split an apt 5 ways) and I don’t think they’re planning on moving anymore since she lost her job and they don’t save money at all still.

793,Not the A-hole,"I’m English and was raised in the UK but my parents are Turkish and loosely Muslim. I moved to Colorado 6 years ago to be with my now husband after we studied at the same university together when he was in the uk. We’ve been together for 11 years in total now and I’m currently pregnant with our first child. All in all, I’d say it’s obvious that we are committed to each other and thank God we are both very happy with one another. 

My sister in law in particular however has always had an issue with me. My husband jumped headfirst into my second hand knowledge of Turkish and Islamic culture (being that I was primarily raised in an English environment) but she treats me like I’m an abused mail order bride who can’t speak English. She’s insulting and ignorant, eg. I’m blonde with blue eyes and she’ll drawl at me that I’m ‘so lucky I can blend in even though I’m middle eastern’ and other common comments are her favourite. She also likes to make fun of my nose, how hairy I am, all said in a super sweet ‘jokey’ tone where she’ll compare our arms, features, etc. Never in front of my husband because she knows that he won’t stand for it, always when we are alone. 

My husbands family have a LOT of downtime (compared to us in the UK anyway!) and recently we went hiking. I’m at the stage of pregnancy where my feet swell easily so I packed an old pair of pink timberlands that I’ve already broken in and are super comfy. Immediately into our hike she began complaining her feet were hurting. After 3 hours we stopped for a break and she took her shoes off and we all saw her feet were rubbed bloody and sore. After 6 hours they were bleeding quite badly. My mother in law shouted out ‘Melike has a spare pair! Can SIL wear them?’ I looked at my sister in law dead in the eye and said no, sorry. I want to keep them incase my feet swell up. In the end, her husband had to end up carrying her back down and she was crying because her feet had blistered and bled up so bad. 

My mother in law was totally fine with it but my SIL hasn’t spoken to me since and this happened a week ago. She has been sending around passive aggressive comments in the family group chat all week, including bible verses about sharing and giving to one another. 

I feel like I am probably the asshole because she was obviously in pain to the extent her feet were bleeding something awful, but I also feel justified because she’s constantly rude and belittling to me.

795,Not the A-hole,"So this happened a few months ago and my friends gave me mixed reactions so I decided to see what the internet would think!

My family and I have a beautiful rescue dog. She's a mischievous thing and will get any food left out. My family all leaves for work/school at 8.30 and I get up around 9-10 leaving her alone in the main body of the house for a bit. I'm a MA student with afternoon classes and I often stay up till 3am working so I get up a bit later. 

So my family are rubbish, pure rubbish at putting food away, especially my younger siblings. The number of times I've woken up and the dog has gotten into chocolate or sweets they've left out in the living room in easy reach is borderline incredible. I've told them so many times and it just goes over their heads. I was really worried that she was going to get very sick soon. 

So one day after I caught her eating a jumbo bag of sweets I decided to put the fear of god into my family. I told them she had vomited and been very ill throughout the day most likely because of these sweets. She was actually fine, she seems to be able to eat anything even chocolate several times. 

This did the trick and my family stated being far more watchful of food they left out. AITA for lying to them or was it excusable because I did it to make them realise the gravity of leaving sweets and chocolate out ultimately greatly reducing the chance of the dog getting sick?",45,267,0.93

799,Not the A-hole,"So, I have vitamin K deficiency, nothing life threatening but if I want to make sure my blood coagulates properly i have to take medication thru an IV - imagine getting in a car crash and dying because your blood just doesn’t want to stop pouring out - But like I said, it’s nothing to worry too much about, but I do have to go to a hospital to take medication every few months when my lvls of Vit K get too low.

It only takes about 5 minutes to finish the IV bag ( it’s a small one) but it takes 1 to 2 hours for me to be seen by a nurse because they prioritize other more serious cases. I don’t mind that and understand that there are a lot more people that need their attention more than me. 

I usually just mess with my phone, but this time my battery was low and I needed to call my parents to pick me up afterwards, so I decided to play with my Nintendo switch while I wait.

After about 30/40 minutes into me playing, a mother comes, taps me on the shoulder and says “you really should be more sensitive to the people around you. There are children here that are sick, and now they have to look at you playing that. Also, there are people in pain while you’re having fun”.

I got embarrassed, apologized and put my game away. But now that I think about it, I don’t know if I was on the wrong here. I mean...was I being insensitive by playing? The game was muted and the controllers were docked, so it wasn’t like I was just flailing my hands around, but I can see how that can be kinda dickish to the people around in pain.

TLDR: I was in the hospital playing on my switch while waiting and a woman called me insensitive.

EDIT: so, just to clarify some things, I’m 21 F but people constantly mistake me for 16/17, the mother in question had what I assume was a 12/13 yo boy with her, I don’t know what they were in for, but I think is safe to guess he had a pretty bad flu.

My friend and I are into a sub-fashion which is a street fashion in Japan based off of 1800 European styles plus a cute aesthetic and I really hate saying the name cause it's *not* sexual. But it's called Lolita. (if you're gonna google it google Lolita Fashion)

(I'll be happy to answer any questions BUT that's off topic).

It's a very *out there* fashion and I don't mind it. I'm a pretty social person and while I'm not okay with people taking pictures without asking (look at you taking a picture of an underage girl like that's not creepy) I'm a-okay with taking pictures with people who ask and talking to people. My friend on the other hand, is not okay with that. She just wants to wear what ever she wants and get on with her life. Okay, fair enough. But she can just get really edgy.

""People keep making dirty faces at us""

""I swear that guy is a perv""

Okay. *REALITY CHECK.* You're wearing a huge poofy dress and look like you just stepped out of a story book. It's not normal. Any time anyone asks her about what she's wearing she goes on this tangent of her sob story and how people should just accept others and this is how she feels beautiful. And when they ask me I'm kinda like, ""cause...it's cute and i like how my dress goes boing boing"" like there's nothing to it for me but she's just *soooooo dramatic.* And I don't wanna make it feel like I don't care about her deeper emotions. I just want to explain to her that, right now, what we're wearing isn't the norm and it's weird and she's gotta get used to it. It's not her job to explain it to everyone. I used to think everyone was frowning at me too, but in reality it's just anxiety and edginess.

She's also lowkey rude and mean to kids imo. I tend to wear sweeter, cuter prints. So a kid will see me and kinda loose their mind like, ""MOM I WANNA TAKE A PICTURE WITH THE *mOtHErFuCkiNG* PRINCESS"". I love kids, their excitement and pictures so I don't mind.

802,No A-holes here,"So I’ve noticed that a lot of companies are getting hate for jumping on the band wagon during pride month by displaying a rainbow version of their company logo. The criticism is that this is the bare minimum, it’s a shallow effort to improve public image, and they’re not going anything else to actually support the LGBT community. 

I believe that my (small software) company falls into this category, and I have no interest in changing my email signature because of this. The part that really rankles me is that it’s the 7th of June and this only started popping up in people’s emails today, as if it was an afterthought.

803,Not the A-hole,"  There's this kid in my school, who we'll call Z. Z and I are both 14, and he has had a crush on me for a while. He confessed to me a month ago and I calmly turned him down, saying that it would be better if we tried know each other a little more and be friends. Instead.

  After that fateful day he would follow me around EVERYWHERE. And I mean everywhere. He followed me on the way to class, to the cafeteria, and he's just been stalking me, thinking I don't notice his stares. And I thought, no big deal. He likes me. Besides, he's on the spectrum. It's just an innocent little crush.

  Boy was I wrong. He became downright obsessed, trying his hardest to get me to like him. I mentioned that I played Splatoon 2 ONE TIME, and suddenly he wears splatoon merchandise to school every day. I talk about pokemon with my friends, he brings a bunch of pokemon plushies to school. He paces around any room that we were in togeAnd this goes on for a while. At this point he's being a little weird.

  Then came the REALLY creepy shit. I fall asleep in my English class a lot, and my friends have told me about how Z stares at me while I'm sleeping and once even tried to put his arm around while I was napping! He started taking pictures of me without my consent, and according to one of my friends even went into the girl's bathroom to take a picture of me. When I came to school with braces, Z just took out his phone and said ""Smile"".

  He does this every day...I don't feel comfortable in the same room as him, and my friends have volunteered to escort me to all my classes just to avoid him.

  I've told my teachers about him, and they only told him to stop. When he kept doing it, only one of my teachers actually cared. All of the others said that, because he was on the spectrum, he didn't know how to share his feelings. But Z is absolutely scaring the hell out of me. I don't feel safe because Z is always watching.

804,Everyone Sucks,"I go to the same barbershop for several years and they hired someone new today. I usually get my hair cut by a woman but I ended up with the new woman today. I'm a man.

My standard routine is a trim on the sides, then a wash, then a cut on the top. Everything was going well until the wash. I don't know if many of the men here have got their hair washed in a shop before, and I don't know if it's the same for women, but you lay back in a chair with head over a sink. You're facing the ceiling while the barber/stylist washes your hair, reaches around, etc.

She's washing my hair and extends from the left side to reach the right side. Her chest is right in my face, clothed, but I could tell she wasn't wearing a bra. At the risk of sounding vulgar, I felt a nipple rub against my lips through the clothes. She was also well endowed.

I didn't want to make a scene so I continued with my wash and cut. When she brought me to the front to pay and outside earshot of customers/employees, I mentioned what happened and maybe it'd be better to wear a bra next time or instead of reaching across my head, just move around and work on the other side.

To put it short, I'm banned from my barber now due to harassment. There's no cut corners in my retelling, that's exactly how it happened. I tried to be discreet and I could tell she was about ready to slap me.

805,Not the A-hole,"This happened a couple years ago but some of our mutual friends still think I was the dick in this situation, so I thought I would submit myself to judgement.

I was living with and discussing marriage with a girl I'd been dating for around 3 years.  She went off on a school trip around the end of February/beginning of March  and when she came back,  things seemed off.  It was just little things, like she started texting ""luv ya"" instead of ""love you"" and stuff like that.  I finally asked her what the deal was around the end of April, and we ended up ""taking a break"". I moved out, but we still hung out almost every day, still went on dates, still had sex. 

I had bought her a new cell phone around the time she got back, an LG V10 (believe it or not this is important). Around the end of May or so, the phone malfunctions and bootloops endlessly, as they are known to do.  She gives it to me so I can try to warranty it or something to get some of my money back, while she buys herself a new phone.  I did some research and discovered that the bootloop could be temporarily bypassed by freezing the phone, so I decide to give it a shot so I can try to pull her pictures and stuff off and generally just try to win some good guy points.  It works, and as soon as I boot it up she starts getting messages from ""David"". Lots of messages, of the not so innocent variety. 

I pop open the messages to see that they go back all the way to her school trip. She's been seeing this guy in secret for months, both before and after our ""break"" while also giving me the runaround and acting like we're on the verge of getting back together.  It's also clear that he doesn't know about me at all, every time he tries to make plans with her while we were doing somrthing, she was just making excuses like ""spending time with family"". 

I shoot him a few texts, tell him who I am,  that I just discovered I was being lied to, and that I suspected he was being lied to as well.  Turns out he was recently divorced because his wife had been cheating, and he was horrified to discover that he had been the ""other guy"".  Long story short, we both washed our hands of her and went our separate ways, but literally every female I know has told me that it was not my place to tell him and that I should have left well enough alone.  I even had to leave my job because the women there ostracized me so heavily because of it.  The way i see it, he deserved the truth and I helped him dodge a major bullet before it could hurt him like it hurt me.  Clearly she was the asshole for cheating, but am I the asshole for exposing it?

Edit to answer some common questions:

>Why did you tell everybody?

I didn't.  I told one person at work, because I thought they were my friend, and who doesn't need a friend to talk to when shit like that goes down?  That one person told everyone else in the office.  We also lived in a really small town at the time, and gossipers gonna gossip.

>Why are you calling her your fiancee when it sounds like you never proposed?

When I said we discussed marriage, I meant that we had sat down and decided that we were getting marries. Plans were already in the works and a date had already been set.  I've always believed that a step that big should come from mutual agreement rather than springing it on someone and putting them on the spot for an answer. Maybe I'm wrong.

>What did you do to make her cheat on you?

Well, to paraphrase her reasoning, we had been together for a while and the relationship wasn't ""new and exciting"" anymore. She met a dude that made her feel the new and exciting feelings again so she decided to fuck him. Also, fuck you for asking that.",2179,14061,0.92

I asked my best friend if she would like to go out for a drink to celebrate both occasions and she politely declined because her father was in town and she didnt know what he planned for her birthday. So I eventually went out with different friends and a few classmates we met by coincidence. We drank a few beers in the local park, talked, nothing special.

She started texting me during the evening and was mad I was out with them and cancelled our next meet up. She was disappointed that we didnt bother inviting her, to which I responded that she had specifically told me that her father was in town and she didnt have time. 
Then she claimed that the plans we had made would have been right after school (which is not true btw, I only have time in the evening and she knows that)

So I explained that not only was she clear about being busy, I myself was also just a guest and not in the position to invite people.

She became really mad and said that I always blame other people. So I apologised and offered her a drink or a coffee and a minute to talk about that in person, which she refused.

In addition I offered to inform her about every plan I had from now on so she could participate or ignore it, but she just went on a rant about how I value my freedom more than this friendship, called me a bad influence and toxic person in general and blames me for ruining her birthday.

I told her clearly that I value my freedom a lot which doesnt invalidate our friendship, and that I'm not going to allow her to take control of my social life or who I'm friends with (for clarification, she was already mad at me when I became friends with a girl I shared a room with during a trip, its not the first time something like this happens)

I honestly feel so angry and disrespected. I have been at this job over a year and haven't been promoted, and he took the training plan I drew up and intends to go through it with her himself. 

I'm thinking about putting in two weeks today. I have plenty of savings and could focus on my mental health, and it's clear he isn't going to respect my efforts at all. 

AITA for being extremely upset over this and thinking about quitting?

ETA: he and I have discussed at length promoting me and having her report to me . So I'm not totally out of left field to think he should have done it.",56,113,0.93
812,Not the A-hole,"I (26F) have been asked by my sister, Joryn (39F), if I and my unborn daughter would like to go on a birthday cruise line trip to help celebrate our mom’s (59F) 60th birthday in June 2020 next year. She has offered to pay flight, boarding, and I’m assuming most meals, for my then infant daughter and I. I am currently 5 months pregnant with my boyfriend, Daniel, (30M) and I’s first child. Our daughter is due in November, and will be 7-8 months by the time June 2020 rolls around.

Joryn has also invited Daniel, however she asks that he pays his own way by reimbursing her. I discuss with him, and he declines, as he will not know if he can be free during the month of June 2020 between job/master’s degree. I am on board with his decision.

Now, growing up with my family was nothing short of great dysfunction. My father was physically and emotionally abusive towards me. Shoving, screaming at me an inch away from my face, barging in the bathroom while I’m undressing for a shower to beat me, calling me an evil bitch. This happened from age 4-19. My mother as a witness, either turned a blind eye, or made a lot of excuses for my father. 

On this trip, it would be my infant daughter and I, our parents, my little sister (22M), and Joryn’s family (Her husband 37M, sons: 1M, 5M, 8M, 10M 13M, 15M, and 22M, and also infant foster girl). Joryn and her husband have their fair share of dysfunctional issues, they’re like a circus. They can be very rude to waitstaff and take advantage of customer service. I’m pretty sure me agreeing to go on this trip will result in me being guilted into babysitting some of her boys. 

To imagine being on a cruise ship for a week with my chaos-addicted family, honestly seems like an absolute nightmare of a situation. I am already battling pregnancy depression and anxiety, and have no idea what stresses postpartum and caring for baby will bring. Also, Joryn and I have a rocky relationship. When I was 14, she accused me of trying to seduce her husband. I also feel her resentment of me having a girl of my own (She always wanted a girl, but has 7 boys). Excepting this cruise trip gift from Joryn really feels like a bad idea, because any gift from her can be used against me, especially something as massive as this. 

However, I only will ever have one mother, and she’s been wanting this dream trip for a long time. What sucks is that I can’t even explain why until it’s too late, as it’s a year from now. I live with her and it feels quite deceiving that I can’t discuss this with my mom at all, without ruining this last minute idea of a surprise trip that Joryn threw on me. I think my mom would be extremely hurt as to why I wouldn’t take the offer of a free trip. Please give me some perspective, because I completely dread the idea of going with every fiber of my body.",64,52,0.88

814,Asshole,"We recently bought a old house in a new area of town that is considered economically depressed in a brand new state.  The house is nearly 100 years old and gorgeous even before we fixed it up. We spent a year fixing it up, adding a pool and an awesome backyard with a stilt play house and stuff to do for her son. 

My wife and her son are extra extroverts so they made quick work of making nice with the neighbors. I was all aboard for the introduction grill where she invited our immediate neighbors over for a get together and I admittedly had a great time. I am an introvert though and I like alone time and space. 

My wife and I both work full time but she is taking some PTO during the summer since her son is off school. He will have some time at a day summer camp every couple of weeks for music and science. During the weeks she’s home, she works part time from home and has been spending the rest of the time getting to know our new neighborhood and babysitting for free. 

My wife loves kids. She always wanted more but can’t have more. 

Before we met and after her divorce, she struggled financially and she said she likes helping out because she knows what summer care can cost. She got a promotion about a year after we met and now with that and both our incomes we do really well. 

It allows her son to have friends and kids to interact with most days when he is not at camp. She will take them to the library and local events. She lets them play in the pool with him and her. They play in the backyard and I have even come home to find her feeding them an early dinner because one of the parents got caught up at work. 

The neighborhood loves her. Mostly because she is giving her time and energy and our money out for free. 

I know a lot of people in our neighborhood struggle but I think it is too much. 


Eventually it will end in August when he goes back to school but I am not sure I can survive this all summer. We do get breaks on weeks his summer camps are in and she goes to the office. 

I asked her to limit it to the two weekends a month or something more reasonable but she doesn’t want to.

In our old neighborhood, we rarely talked to anyone and had no close friends. 

I put my foot down and told her to stop it. 

I reminded her my new job paid for this nice house and may say should matter a little more and now I feel like a jerk. 

I know I am an asshole for bringing up the money thing. I have only recently begun making more. 

But I really don’t think I am an asshole for wanting the peace and not wanting strange kids in the house. The liability is high. I don’t like kids that much. We are opening our house to people we barely know. 

Would I be the asshole for apologizing for the money comment but refusing to for all the kids?",257,420,0.94

816,Not the A-hole,"My daughter is 15 and ALWAYS waits until the last minute to do a project. This time it was a cooking project. They had to video tape themselves making a recipe and then bring the food in for everyone to taste. 



It’s the day before and she insists she wants no help. I offered repeatedly to help her. My elderly mother who is very very pushy about “helping” in the kitchen lives with us so my daughter said she wanted to wait until she goes to bed at 9 to insure she gets no help. 



9:30 rolls around and she starts her recipe. 2 hours later she’s in my room crying her eyes out because the recipe failed and she can’t take it in to class. Mind you, I’m asleep because I have to wake up for work at 6am.



I tell her no I’m not getting out of bed to help her. She can turn in the video for a partial grade or remake it herself but I already offered my help hours ago. 




She angrily tells me *this* is why she never asks for help because when she does, I’m mean about it. 



Then she proceeds to wake up my mom(it’s almost midnight at this point) who of course wakes up and helps her. Then the next morning strolls around and my mom is bitchy towards me because I wouldn’t help my daughter so she had to do it.



Which in turn, makes me even more mad because 1) my daughter was inconsiderate for waking up her grandmother at midnight 2) she didn’t learn a lesson about managing her time well 3) everyone’s pissed at me now 



So then I talk to my daughter and tell her to cancel her sleepover this weekend because she needs to clean her room to make up for this cooking project fiasco. She says I’m punishing her for needing help and that’s unfair. I tell her no, I was going to let this be a natural consequence—she waited until the last minute to ask for help so the natural consequence would be a partial grade or her staying up all night to finish it. But because she selfishly woke her grandma up, there needs to be some kind of consequence. Refusing help and waiting until the last minute isn’t ok and I don’t want this habit to continue(this isn’t the first time she’s waited until the last minute and needed us to bail her out). 




I told her today before she left for school her room has to be completely clean(including under the bed and her closet—because she has a habit of stuffing everything there when I ask her to clean it) by Saturday night. If she needs help, she is more than welcome to ask me as long as she doesn’t wait until the last minute again. If it doesn’t get done, I’m canceling next week’s plans too(we have plans to go to Busch gardens and Water Country next weekend) because she WILL LEARN how to manage her time if it kills me. 



Now my mom and daughter thinking I’m an asshole but I do believe this is a hill I’m willing to die on.

817,Not the A-hole,"I arrived at about 7:15 a.m. and pulled into a large concrete multi-level parking garage. It was virtually empty with only a few spots being taken on the first level. There were at least 30 or 40 vacant spots on that level alone.

I got out of my car and was sorting through some things with my doors open. While I was doing that a car pulled up and wanted to park in the spot immediately next to me. I would have had to close my doors and move out of the way.

819,Not the A-hole,"Hi, 

This happened the other night and I'm really wondering if I overreacted or if I was justified. 

My brother was in town to visit (here several times a year). He, my parents and I were discussing the night before where to eat via text. We had agreed on a restaurant. Great. I then said I'd call them the next day when I got off work to iron out the details. 

So I did. They said ""Let's meet at 6 at (restaurant)"". Cool. I got my wife and my 10-month-old son loaded up in the car with milk, baby food, diaper bag, new outfit, and made the 10-minute drive across town to the restaurant and made it there at 6. Called my mom because I didn't see their car and I go ""where are you?"" 

She goes ""Oh, we haven't even left yet, I guess we got sidetracked with talking, ha ha!"". Best part is they live 10-15 minutes out of town and who knows how long it'll take them to get out the door and on their way. 

So I thought to myself ""Fuck this shit"" and told them ""Eh, you know what, we're not eating with you, see you some other time"". So the wife, kid, and I left the parking lot, went through a drive-thru at a fast food joint and went home. It really pissed me off and felt super disrespectful. I feel like if they can't even respect my time, especially when we agree upon a time less than an hour beforehand and knowing I have a baby with me that doesn't like to sit around much as-is, knowing that my wife packed up all of the baby bag and food and got him into appropriate clothes and into the car all for them to not even follow a simple timeline, then they can pretty much screw off. 

Was I an asshole or was this justified?

Edit: Ok more info. They aren't usually late. 

Last time, and a time or two before, my brother didn't bother to tell me he was in town for the week so I didn't see him. Whatever. 

I think I got especially pissed at this situation because my family couldn't figure out what to do the night before and was la dee daa-ing around via text. First they wanted to meet at their house. Then the restaurant. Then I said I wanted to meet at the restaurant because it's easier with a kid. Then I get ""Why?"" like they don't know we get off work at 5 and my kid goes to bed at 7:30. Then my dad sassed off and said something to the effect of ""It sounds like you don't want to really see us at all"". No, we just don't want to do Tour De Southern Illinois with a fucking infant. Pick the final destination and we'll be there to hang out.",98,238,0.96

821,Not the A-hole,"Last night I was in class which is about 3 hours long. In the middle of our lecture he went off on a tangent (he does frequently) about when he used to coach football and then about an experiment him and some friends once did. I do believe he was getting to a point that was relevant to something in the lecture but after 10 minutes of rambling, I raised my hand and asked if this all was relevant and if not if we could continue with the lecture. 

He was very surprised and said no one had ever asked that before (he is 70 years old and has been teaching a long time I presume) so I began wondering if I was out of line. My original thinking was that I was there to learn the material and he was in essence wasting my time and money by talking for so long about irrelevant things. 

He did immediately end the story time and finished the lecture without further tangents. So, was I the asshole here or was it reasonable of me to ask what I did?

Edit: Thank you all for your input and time. The results are pretty mixed so I don’t know if I really got an answer other than some would see this as rude and others wouldn’t. From my teacher’s reaction my guess is he is on the side of not rude but I will talk to him to be sure he didn’t feel slighted and explain to him my reasoning.

822,Not the A-hole,"Ok it sounds bad, I know. But hear me out. I have a friend, who I would consider my best friend, that I have been close with for about 4 years.

 Recently, I started to realize that I do a lot more for her in our friendship than she does for me. She doesn't have a car right now, so I stop at the store for her or if she needs to go somewhere I'll take her. I let her borrow some money a few months back, and she never repaid me, but offered to pay me in babysitting. I'm ok with that.

 Yesterday, her kid had a field trip that was in a nearby city, maybe 25 miles away or something. I took her to the field trip, went to a store and walked around for an hour or so, and then picked her up from the field trip and took her home. All in all, it took about 4 hours.

I asked her a week ago if she would watch my 4 month old while I got my hair done today. This was a big deal for me. I haven't got my hair cut or anything professionally in at least 2 years. I was excited. 

So, I dropped the baby off and get to the place, and she sends me a picture of my daughter crying and says ""yeah I don't think the color part is a good idea today. She's freaking out."" It seems like anytime I ask her or she offers to babysit, one of my kids always does something that she can't handle, and she guilts me and rushes me to hurry up and come get them. 

I'm really angry now and I told her it was fine, but I am mad and that It is really shitty that she always does this to me, when I feel like I go out of my way for her anytime she needs me.

825,Not the A-hole,"I am currently in an apprentice training program that's somewhat intense. I have a certain number of hours I need to attend to graduate, and if I don't get enough hours, I don't pass and have to re-apply to the program and repeat the whole year. I currently have 3 absences left for the rest of the year to cover sickness, emergencies, etc.

My sister is getting married in a few months in another state. The wedding day they chose is a work day for me, and with travel, I'd have to miss 3 days total. This would mean using up all my absences. If any time before December I get sick, car won't start, etc, I get dropped from the program. I told my sister I'm sorry but I won't be able to miss 3 days of work. I planned to send them a nice gift and visit them sometime after the wedding when I have time off.

My family is very upset with me, and say I'm being unfair because my sister traveled to attend my wedding last year, but mine was on a weekend and was much closer to her so it didn't require entire days of traveling. I know her wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime event, and I am sad to miss it, but repeating an entire year of school would be a major setback for me.

AITA for not going to the wedding?

&#x200B;

**Edit**: Just wanted to answer some common questions from the comments instead of replying to each individually.

It is not possible to go to the wedding in one or two days. I am not going to post exact locations but I live across the country and the wedding is in a small town that there are no direct flights to, and only a few flights per day. The flights, layover, and driving to/from the airports is an entire day of travel. Paying for the flights is no issue for me, but the schedules make it not possible.

I spoke with the director of the school about making an exception to the attendance policy, and they are not able to due to state laws. If they go against the laws the entire school could lose their license so obviously they're not willing to do that. The class schedule has been set with the trainers and other students for a year and they are not able to offer make-up classes.

About the finances, if I were to re-apply to the apprenticeship it would cost me about $2000 in class and book fees (online classes so I have to re-buy all the access codes... thanks textbook companies) and over $40,000 in lost income.",137,464,0.96
826,Not the A-hole,"I know the title sounds really shitty but bear with me. I’m torn. 

So we live in a relatively large condo complex with plenty of woods (and coyotes and apparently some bears) around. There’s a cat that roams the neighborhood named Nessa. She’s very sweet, even to me as someone who generally isn’t crazy about cats. She “belongs” to a couple who live up the street, but I use the word really loosely. 

I’ve never once seen her owners leave food or water out for her, much less let her into the house. Last summer was brutally hot and it poured rain. These people left her outside while they went off to Florida for two weeks. When they got back, another neighbor confronted them. They claimed that she broke out or the house by ripping through a window screen. I don’t think that’s possible, but I didn’t exactly do a walkthrough of their property to check. Anyway, I don’t believe it. 

She also seems extremely underweight, I wonder if she maybe has worms or something. Her hipbones jut out and when you pet her you can feel every one of her ribs. She’s at least two or three years old but she’s just so tiny. 

I can’t take her in myself, but it feels wrong to just leave her to fend for herself. I bring her water and tuna whenever I walk outside and she’s lounging on my porch or in my garden, but it doesn’t feel like enough, especially for such a sweet cat.

Immediately he tried to impose his own way of teaching and grading on us (the students) which was very different that anything we had ever experienced. You were expected to do things his way, and even if his was was wrong, which people pointed out to him, you were still expected to use it. R also took points off for scratch work that he didn't like, and tried to take off as many points as possible on the tests, quizzes, and homeworks. Every student he had with no exception was subjuct to this.

R also took forever to grade our assignments. We took a test the week before spring break, and got it back ~6 weeks later. He also refused to go over it with anyone. R never offered help outside of the classroom and was hostile whenever asked for extra help.

The administration took notice and we were informed that R was not coming back next year. Needless to say, we were overjoyed about this. Since the announcement, R completely checked out, he just wrote notes on the board, barely talked during class,and went to Disneyland instead of going to one of the review days for exams.

I took out my phone and acted like my brother had texted me for help with his sick dog. I appologized and ran off, mostly because I wanted my excuse to seem legit, but also because I wanted to leave the date asap.

832,No A-holes here,"Small backstory: I’m 27. I’ve been seeing my fuck buddy Nate for a year, about every week or so, and I was married for 4 years before him (my husband left me because he realized he wanted to start a family and “he couldn’t do that with me.”) As the title implies, I was told when I was 12 that I am infertile.

I told Nate that I am infertile at the beginning of our relationship. I don’t really date anymore because of what my husband did to me. I told Nate the reality of things; I’m infertile, and I’m exclusive to him (he can see whoever he wants). If he wants to double up on protection, we very well can. If he doesn’t, that’s fine too. He ended up choosing the latter.

Well. I still don’t know how it happened because I was told “with absolute certainty that I cannot get pregnant” (side note, can I do anything with the doctor who’s said this to me; would this be malpractice?). I’ve had pretty bad pregnancy symptoms for at least a month (just didn’t think it was a possibility so it didn’t even enter my mind), so I have no idea how many weeks along I am. My appointment is on Monday to confirm but I’ve taken 3 pregnancy tests already.

I told Nate later that night, and he was less than thrilled. He asked me if I was leaning more towards abortion or adoption, and I told him that honestly, I really don’t think I’d have another chance like this, and I’m thinking about keeping it. He then said and I quote “if you’re keeping it, I’m having absolutely nothing to do with that child; you’re on your own.” I was kinda pissed off because I told him if he wanted to use a condom, he could’ve; he had that choice and he chose not to. He can’t just not have ANY involvement in the child’s life, and I told him this and that he will still contribute financially, and I will take him to court if I have to.

He started calling me horrible names, which is COMPLETELY different than how he normally acts. I no longer felt safe and left his house.

I don’t really want to tell anyone in my personal life, because I have no idea how far along I am, and I don’t want to miscarry and lead to all of this conversation of if I’m infertile/fertile, etc. I feel kind of shitty because I can see his side.

And also, I glossed over the infertile part because it wasn’t necessary. But it’s not like I was told one time “you’re infertile” and this was the last time this medical complication was EVER mentioned again. I don’t want to get too much into specifics, but I have regular check ups with my primary care physicians, including an ob-gyn.

After we started bringing my daughter to church with us, people would naturally want to come up and see her and for the most part they have been really respectful with keeping their distance, saying nice things and going on about their day.  But lately as she has gotten older, started walking and talking and generally looking like a little kid rather than a little baby blob, people have started to get really bold with their interactions with her.  They will come right up to me or my wife when we are holding her and start grabbing her hands, touching her clothes, pawing at her and trying to touch her hair.  

&#x200B;

Two weeks ago one of the ladies from the choir came up to us after the service and tried to touch her face. That's when I instinctively pulled back (I was holding her at the time) and said, ""I'm going to have to ask you not to do that.""  I must have said it in a way where it could have been construed as aggressive because she kind of recoiled back.  She looked a little embarrassed, but she smiled and still reached out and grabbed my daughters foot, shook it like she was shaking a hand and walked away.   My wife told me later that I kind of shouted it, but I didn't hear it like that.

&#x200B;

The following week (last week) we saw her approaching after service and my wife and I acted like we didn't see her and just made a beeline out of the building before she could get to us (the service was packed so she was weaving through the crowd while occasionally stopping to talk to people) so we wouldn't have to interact with her again.  We just didn't want to have another awkward interaction.

838,Not the A-hole,"So here's the situation. I have 3 children who each play 2 sports at different times of the year. My son plays hockey in the winter and baseball in the summer. Me and the mother of all 3 children are divorced. We also put him in a couple of mini camps throughout the summer for hockey for skills and to stay sharp. 

He was recently asked to try out for a upper tier summer league. He obviously wants it badly. Try-outs are $80 & if he makes the team registration is somewhere between $6-800 (U.S.) depending on the team, as well as 2.5 months of out of town tournaments every weekend. I told him he has a month and a half until tryouts and is now out of school for the summer. If he found a way to earn the $80 for try-outs and made a team I would pay my portion of his registration. 

It isn't exactly about the financial burden of the extra try-out money (although the shit gets really expensive real quick), it's about him working towards a goal and being invested in it. It also isn't exactly fair that we put him in a third program when his sisters are not in 3. I gave him plenty of ideas to earn money such as extra chores, asking his nana & papa if they had any work that he could do around their place, as well as asking his mother or flyers to mow lawns in the neighborhood. I think it's instilling responsibility, and showing him to set realistic goals and work hard to achieve them, but my ex-wife thinks otherwise. What do you say?

Edit: I should've stated that if he isn't able to come up with the money I am still going to let him and pay for it. I DID NOT tell him this, yet I DID tell it to his mother.",470,883,0.92

840,Not the A-hole,"So, for a little bit of context, GF is 20 with limited drug experiences, she’s only ever smoked weed, and was interested in picking up a tab or two for her first music festival.

 I was not going to be with her, and I knew the group she was going with wasn’t the best crowd. I also know this festival is huge, and having my 5’5” 110 lb girlfriend walking around, high out of her mind, in ~* festival clothes * ~ (some daisy dukes and a tube top) just sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.  Also, she has a HUGE fear of touching men, so I don’t know why she doesn’t think she’d bump into guys at a music festival of all places? 

I expressed these to her, and she got incredibly defensive, saying that music festivals were ‘a place of love and acceptance’, and assuring me that nothing would happen to her. We got into a huge blowout, which ended in her accusing me of trying to control her life when I can’t be there.

So, AITA for not wanting my girl to trip for the first time at this music festival?

Edit for clarification: we are both girls, and it is not that I’m worried that she will cheat on me, more so that other people may take advantage of her in this mindset.

Edit 2: Thank you guys for all the suggestions, we agreed to talk about it after work. I have done acid a handful of times before, and I think I’m just going to suggest we do it together before she goes to see how she likes it. Thank you again!",261,480,0.95

842,Not the A-hole,"I had a friend I met in our freshman year in college and we became inseparable and best friends. I got married in college and had a very small intimate ceremony and she was invited. She always told me when she got married, I would be coming to her wedding. 

About 2 years after graduation, she met a guy. Her & I lived in different states at this point so we rarely saw each other but we kept in constant contact and I still saw her as one of my closest friends. I supported her and told her I was happy for her. They got engaged.  She was talking about how I better not miss her wedding, etc. 

10 months before her wedding, my dad was diagnosed with terminal cancer. She knew about it and never said anything. I messaged her and told her I was disappointed that she never acknowledged it. She immediately responded and apologized and told her she was busy and that she didn’t want to lose me as a friend. It took me a couple weeks to respond to her because I was upset, but I did eventually and we talked again. So things were fine or so I thought. She continued never mentioned getting married once. 

Then one day, our mutual friend (who lived in a different country and would have never been invited) messaged me and said “omg, did you see (friends) wedding pictures on Facebook!”  I said huh I don’t remember seeing it. So I go to my friends profile, and I eventually discover she is hiding her tagged photos from me, so I can’t see her wedding photos she was tagged in, and I’m on a limited profile. 

I was shocked. At this point, we were friends for 6 years. Never had a big fallout fight or anything. She always talked about how I was going to be invited. Even her other friends were invited, so it was not as if it was a small family only wedding.  

I was angry and I messaged her a long message saying how upset I was she hid the wedding from me and made it so I couldn’t see her pics. I asked her why did you do this to me? I thought we were friends. I feel like you’ve intentionally hid a big part of your life and you weren’t honest. I was never insulting or cussed at her, I was just hurt.

She never responded (she saw it) and after a couple days I blocked her on social media and never spoke to her again. 

However sometimes I wonder if I overreacted. I was really hurt by what she did, but I don’t know if I was right to lash out. Was I the asshole?",144,617,0.94
843,Everyone Sucks,"Tl;dr at the bottom

I’m in college, and I’m studying software engineering. I’m working an internship with a company that I’ve worked with before, and (since I’m almost done with my degree) there has been hinting at an employment offer when I finish. This particular employer sources a lot of talent from my school and is known to grant payment in excess of six figures. My resume is pretty awesome, so I intended to also apply to other places, but I still live with my mother, my grandfather, and younger brother. Any time I have ever gotten a job, I’m always hounded about how much I make. Then, my mother used that as a reason not to pay for my food, or clothes, and even requested that I pay for my place on family vacations. Now that I’m 21, she’s said that she wants to buy a bigger house for “our family” plus her boyfriend and since my credit is great, she has asked me to co-sign the mortgage! She rarely paid the prior one on time. All the meanwhile, he boyfriend pays ZILCH for anything in the house and she takes full care of him. When I asked why, she said it was because since I’ll have a “fancy computer job” soon and don’t plan on having children, she wants me to really start contributing by paying 100% for everything in my life incl. insurance, AND pay on utilities, mortgage, grocery, and any surprise expenses like car maintenance or home improvement. But I’m in serious student loan debt because she insisted she’d pay for my college but didn’t so I didn’t have a chance to save beforehand, and I want to pay all that off and then move out because I get no privacy at all, am not allowed to have a lock on my door, and don’t even get privacy in the bathroom as my sister will barge in (for example) to use the restroom when I’m in the shower. When I make a call or text, my mother and grandpa will demand to know to whom, and all my free time is taken because my mother will go out and demand I stay to provide care for my grandfather. And with grocery, they’ve never purchased any of the things I like, and eat it and complain that they don’t like it as much as their option of choice if I buy it for myself. 
One of the few at-home joys I have is making video game environments with UE4. I’ve gotten pretty good at it too.
So, it’s Me versus Mom. Would I be the asshole if I lied to my family and claim I took a job I loved as a game dev for a pittance so I can dodge paying for my mother’s whole household and secretly spend the bulk of my money at a different high paying job to pay off my huge loans early and move out?

Tl;dr: I’m going to make a pretty nice salary straight out of college and want to pay off my loans and move out of my mom’s house. My mom would obstruct that goal because she thinks I should pay for most of the household since I plan on being child and husband free. The household sucks for me.

846,Not the A-hole,"This happened a while ago (about 3 months) but thought I may as well post it here.

So its my friends birthday, and we're having a surprise party for him (although thats somewhat irrelevant to the story). We go out for a coffee, to get him out of the house, and on the way back I decide I'll buy him a pack of beer for his birthday, so we walk into a local corner store to pick him out a case. He grabs whatever and we go to stand in line. While in line, the bottom of the case breaks, and some of the beers fall out. The case did not break because of anything my friend had done. It clearly had gotten wet (it was made of cardboard) , or something had happened during transport, and it simply broke while my friend had been standing still in line. In my mind, that’s a cost you absorb as a storeowner. 

Now when we get to the cash, the cashier tells us we are going to pay for the case that broke. Now, this seems wrong as we didn't do anything to break the case, and there was no possible way to avoid it. It wasn't our fault the product was faulty. Now I'm not a very confrontational person in most circumstances, so normally I would have offered to pay half, or just paid full or whatever, but my friend was having none of it. The cash calls her manager, and this becomes important later, the manager is huge. I'm a pretty big guy, but this guy was probably 6'6 and 330lbs. He starts trying to get us to pay.. So we're arguing with the manager for a bit, and he threatens to call the police multiple times. My friend has had enough (its still his birthday lol) and just wants to say fuck it and leave. Now when we try to leave this guy refuses to let us go. He stands in front of the only exit in the store and will not allow us out of the building. He is now illegally detaining us. Now at this point we're both pissed, and my phone is blowing up because we're like 30 minutes late for his party, and I don't see any way out of this, so I decide to call the police cause I'd rather them get the call from me. At somepoint while waiting for them to come, another customer in the store called us assholes because its just $8 and who cares we should stop bullying the poor manager. Throughout this entire ordeal, he claims to have security cameras that will show my friend knocked into something or was swinging the case around.

Anyways, the police arrive, and no security feed is available and the police decide that we were not at fault, and say they are going to let him off with a warning for detaining us 

Anyways, I'm never going back into that store, but I can't tell if we handled the situation poorly or not.

847,Not the A-hole,"My mother's living situation is fairly tenuous right now.  She had been renting from someone for the last several years, but that person passed away and the property ended up being owned by the mortgage company.  My mother has not had to pay rent in ~1 year.  She works full time.  The bank is preparing to sell the property now and my mother will need to find a new place to live.  She says she has too much debt at the moment to be able to afford another lease or mortgage, until October when she has paid some of this debt off.   I don't have specifics on the financials because when brought up I generally try not to discuss the matter as I'm afraid she will ask to live with my wife and me.

My wife and I are in our mid 30's both work full time, and are about to have our first child together.  We waited to have kids until we were in a comfortable spot financially.  I would like to have time with my wife, new baby, and I to just be able to spend time together without another adult living in the house with us.  I also hold a lot of resentment towards my mother for some things from my childhood that I have not dealt with, or discussed with her,  that makes me dislike the idea of her living with us.

848,No A-holes here,"Would I be the asshole for bringing up the amount of time my colleagues spend outside on cigarette breaks during paid working time? I'm sorry if its been mentioned before. 

I work in a small office of 20 people. Some of my colleagues smoke and are out on cigarette breaks 4+ times a day for at least 5 minutes. Doing the math, it works out they spend around 20 mins per day, 100 mins per week, 400 mins per month - which equates to 6.6666 hours per month smoking on paid work time. This roughly equates to a days leave time (7.5 hours) per month, which is crazy.

Having been a smoker in my teens, I understand the want to go and smoke so am not disliking them for doing what they enjoy. However I feel it is unfair that those choosing not to smoke do not receive the same break time, i doubt I'd be allowed 20 minutes a day to stand outside for a 'fresh air' break - if you know what I mean?

Yesterday I went to a casino near a convention center after they had their first summer outdoor music festival and things were going great at the craps table. Now I don’t know if many people have experience at these tables but typically on any dice roll you can bet with or against the shooter along with a number of many other bets. I point this out because this is NOT about people winning while others lose because that’s a normal sore loser thing you encounter at these tables.

This guy walks in and jumps the shooter line, typically a faux pas but nobody really cares including me but it all started to go down from there. He was badgering and belittling the shooter, telling them out loud how much he sucks and other choice words. This almost got him into a fist fight and removed from the casino. He would also talk out loud about how large his penis was and how he’d fuck all of the waitresses.

He got progressively more drunk and gave me the same shit on my throw and here’s where the whole report to employer came in. He decided that I must be a barista and called me as such (because I’m young?) and generally badgered me about it. I mentioned to someone else who was nicer that I worked for a large chemical manufacturer in the area and instantly he became uber friendly towards me.

854,Everyone Sucks,"As a backstory, before this happened we had been friends for 3 years. We had fun hanging out together and talked on the phone a couples times a month to catch up. We lived in different states, so we could not meet face to face often. 

When I was 7.5 months pregnant, as a “last hurrah” we decided to have a girls trip in NYC. The plan was I would go there a couple days with my mom and then she would join us for the final 3 days. 

My mom and I’s hotel room had 2 beds, and I didn’t mind sleeping in the same bed as my mom, so trying to be nice I offered my friend that she can stay with us, free of charge (the hotel was around $300 a night, IIRC) so she wouldn’t have to spend her own money. I never asked for money from her. She gladly accepted. I was excited to see her. 

I was already in NYC and 2 days before she was going to come, she texted me and told me that she was sick, but she was doing all she could to feel better before coming. I did warn her, that if she was sick she shouldn’t come because I was terrified of getting sick while pregnant. I did not have an easy pregnancy so to speak - the first 4 months were rough as I suffered from HG (severe morning sickness) and I was terrified of having a miscarriage which I had had 2 before. So she knew I was very careful about trying to stay healthy. She assured me she would be okay. 

She came anyway, and she was sick as a dog. Coughing, hoarse voice, sneezing, her nose was running, she kept having to run to the bathroom to have diarrhea. I was stuck with her in the hotel room when we slept with her coughing, and with it being a NYC hotel room on a high floor we could not even open the windows. She also during the trip kept touching me and got inches from my face when talking although I was sending constant signals for her to back off.  The whole time she was very sick but was almost pretending like nothing was wrong. 

Well, I got sick for 2 weeks with a horrible cold and cough after the trip and inside my head, I blamed here. I was so upset that I ignored her, she texted me about a week after I started and she said “did I do anything wrong? Please tell me” and I didn’t answer at all. We remained FB friends. As a side note, I was also upset she never told me or my mom thank you for anything, so in my head I was upset by this too. 

After I had my baby, so about 2 months after this happened, I wrote her an apology letter and told her I probably shouldn’t have ignored her.  But I did tell her what made me upset. I told her I didn’t want to end the friendship and was hoping we could talk about it.

855,Everyone Sucks,"Broke up with BM in 2014. She was still enrolled in my district which meant I got the calls and the mail sent to me. Well I got her last report card (BM had been hiding all the others from me). Her last report card showed that she missed 29 days of school during the Wed/Thur/Fri her Mom took her to school. And she missed 3 days of school during the Mon/Tue that I take her to school. I wanted to know why she was missing exponentially more school on Wed/Thur/Fri than Mon/Tue.

The truth of the matter is that the BM just takes her out of class alot. Like for movies. Or to leave early on Friday for a weekend trip. Crap like that. I grew up with a work/school ethic where you go to school or work UNLESS YOU CAN'T. Its part of the reason why the BM and I are split up.

Anyway, the next year she didn't want to have me looking at Report Cards. So she enrolled her in this ghetto Catholic school nearby. I ended up moving to a different town (in the metro area). This town has a nice school district. The BM would rather pay $5000/year to send her to this ghetto Catholic school instead of the nice public school because she doesn't want me to get the Report Card to see how much school she is missing.

Here is the first important part:

When she enrolled her in this school, she did it unilaterally without my input, my opinion or nothing. She also didn't let me go to the initial registration meetings or any of that stuff.

Fast foward to 2019. That ghetto Catholic school is closing. So now she wants her to go to the nice public school in the nice district I live in. She lives in the city and I live in the town. She needs me to get her into the nice public school.

So she told me she wants to set everything up and go to the first registration meeting and I told her no. If I wasn't allowed to go to the reg meeting years ago, she isn't coming to this one.

She freaked! How dare I not let her be a part of our child's education? What if I do things wrong? She needs to be the first one contacted and all this BS. So I'm like wait. Full stop. If all of this is a problem now in 2019 for her, why wasn't it a problem in 2014-2019 when she was just unilaterally doing things without me?

WIBTA if I refuse to let her go to this meeting? She is insisting she will just put her in another school and go to court for more child support and a half dozen other threats.

When I was 18, which was a very short time ago, I unfortunately witnessed one of my best friends in college (who I lived with for the first two semesters) die. This happened very suddenly and violently. The entire situation of that day and the following funeral services completely broke me. This happened at a point where my father was not speaking to me. He hadn’t spoken to be for about 2 months at that part and had all but “cut me off” financially because I had gotten a piercing a few months prior that he didn’t approve of but, as a 17 year old, I got anyway. When I called my mom to tell her what was going on, he heard me crying on the phone but told her to hang up because they were having dinner and I didn’t talk to him for two days after that. Throughout the situation he said “It’ll be okay” and gave me a hug and that was about it. 
A few months later, I went to go to visit my friend’s grave with a bunch of our mutual friends and for whatever reason my dad thought I was lying about where I was going. When I was offended that he thought I’d lie about something like that and got emotional he said “Oh here we go with the water works, save it” and “people die, get the fuck over it. I’ve had friends die too.” My mom heard the whole ordeal and didn’t say a thing. I left in hysterics, hurt beyond belief and went to go visit my friends. 

Now, a year later, my dad’s friend has killed himself. This is obviously horrible. My mom, however, made a commitment to me which will only take an hour today. She now refuses to go because she thinks “he needs her” and “if I don’t understand that, then I don’t understand a marriage” and “if I don’t get it she doesn’t even want to come.” I reminded her what he said shortly after my friend died when I was an 18 year old still unfamiliar with grief. I said honestly that if he feels that way then he must not be THAT upset and if he is, I can’t really find it in me to sympathize with him.

I am good friends with a couple for around 10 years, the guy is arguably one of my best friends since teenage years (I'm now 29) and the girl I also become good friends with through their relationship.
 
They're getting married and of course, I am invited. The invites come out 1 year before the wedding because it is an overseas wedding and they want to give people plenty of notice. I am single at the time of the invite and I RSVP immediately for myself.

9 months out from the wedding, I meet a girl and get with her. It's a relationship with a real spark, the likes of which I've never experienced and my feelings towards this woman are very strong. We are together for about 2 months before I realise I'd like for her to come along with me to the wedding as a +1. When I plan to ask, I'm not expecting a yes or no, I'm not really expecting anything, I'm only mentioning it super early as a ""feeler"" to see if it was A) Possible and B) Ok with them.
So I mention it during a phone call with my mate and there is zero pressure in my request, the phone call was fairly quick and I simply asked if it was possible to squeeze her in as my +1. It should be said, that the couple knows my partner. She worked with my good mate for quite some time and they both think highly of her and were (at least to my face) supportive of our relationship. His response was *""I'll have a chat with the lady and let you know.""*

2 weeks later I get a text from him saying *""About the wedding, it's absolutely fine if she comes but the final numbers are not due until a few months before the wedding. I'm not trying to imply anything by this, but you two haven't been together long and you never know how the next few months will pan out. I don't mean to upset you by saying that but I'm sure you know where I'm coming from.""*

I was bothered by this and I made it clear, by saying *""I understand that you felt that way, but to me the comment about the length/instability of the relationship just felt unnecessary.""* His response to this was then *""Sorry I hit a sore point, There are heaps of people who we couldn't bring to our wedding so you asking me for a +1 with a new relationship was a bit of a surprise. I would have made that comment about any relationship that had been going that long to any of my mates. Every extra person we have adds to what we have to pay for the wedding.""*

There was no mention of financial burden of bringing extra people in his original response. Had that actually been the case, that’s totally fine. 

They feel like I was out of line asking and shouldn’t have. I feel like there was no harm in putting out a feeler and give them plenty of notice. I was completely fine with a yes or no and felt the comment about it being my relationship being an uncertainty (aren't all relationships?) was not needed. Am I the asshole here? Any insight on this is greatly appreciated because it has hurt my relationship with the couple.

She told me that him and another person were hit by another car. She didn't know any details beyond that he was not coming into work but was alive. I said ""that sucks"" and changed the subject. She gave me a disgusted look and said I was acting like an asshole. I asked her why and she said because I didn't seem to care that he was in an accident. I said I barely knew him and have only said a few words to him. She just got up and left the break room. 

I told my partner about this and he also said I was being an asshole. 

I don't know the guy. I've only said a few ""how are you""s to him in passing. He seems nice but I don't feel sad or torn up about it. He's also fine and at home recuperating so what am I supposed to feel? If I was in an accident I'm sure some of my co-workers would be indifferent also.

Niz is from a pakistani/asian family who are still very conservative in terms of their values, his sister and mother wear the hijab, older relatives wear burkhas etc) while he, his father and brothers have full-length beards and adhere to the various rituals of their faith without fail, routine prayer etc. Niz is very involved with the local community too so has a presence around the place. He is also in a managerial position effectively direct under the owner, who almost never shows up except maybe once a month and appears content to let his staff manage the place for him.

Niz himself isn't the hardest of workers, he usually lets the staff working under him do the work while he sits around, 'directing' us even though he could've pitched in. Fair enough, we're paid a wage - nothing I can do about it. Niz talks to me quite a lot, seems to come across as more overly friendly to me more than others. I'm a sperg so maybe I just don't pick up on it and cutting a long story short, he soon had me helping him in his office, giving me extra hours for overtime 1-1 with him etc where he was forward with me.

Eventually it gets to a point where things are awkward and I don't know how to handle it. Tries to grope me and I just pull away, walk out, a bit in shock, get sent nudes that include all but the face but they also have a snippet of his beard which from seeing up close I knew was his.

At some point I snap, push him away and say I'm not interested, not gay and to just stop and leave.

His attitude changes, gets progressively worse (difficult work, targeting me, etc) and at some point I try to escalate to the owner (I tried texting a number that I thought was his, turned out to be the 'business' mobile for customer calls)  Niz finds out and pulls me aside and says I'll regret it if I don't shut up. Eventually he made up some bullshit and said I was sacked. I'd been working there for only eight months and I was that stressed out from it I didn't think about the legal options, just being out of work. Right now, I've got a new job that's working great for me but back then I was just in such a state because I felt like I'd fucked up. 

Text him asking why and he gets really abusive and just leaves me feeling shitty. In hindsight I should have gone the legal route but I didn't think they'd take it seriously and was embarrassed so I just decided I would fuck him over as hard as I could, compile all the evidence (nudes, abusive messages, vague threat) and spread them out across the community including to his family.

I have a friend, whom I've known since I was 15. She's usually lovely but often gets a bit manic and has grand delusions from time to time. English is not her first language, she speaks enough to get by but her grammar isn't good at all and her vocabulary isn't good either. In the past few months she's sat down to write a novel in English, which is great, I encourage everyone to write and express themselves. She sent a bit to read to her friend who told her ""WOW - you're going to be the next JK Rowling, this is amazing and you need to publish it."" Since then my friend has had it in her head that she can send an unfinished and poorly edited novel to US and UK publishers without knowing the industry and thinks it'll be a best seller.

I've read the parts of the story she's written, while the idea is good all the rest isn't. I'm proud of her for setting out to finish her work because that takes effort and dedication, and she should be proud of herself.

He then offered me and my sister the old iPhone 4s he gave my sister it for free but in order for me to get mine I had to give him my iPod 5

Little backstory I was 13-14 with 4 paper rounds making about £40 a week I was saving up for ages! 
2 of the paper rounds were mine and 2 were my sisters she was too lazy to do it so I ended up taking over so I could make more money 

I understand if he wanted to teach us a lesson about money but why should I be the only one to get this lesson? I was 13-14 and my sister was 15-16 

Their defence was that she didnt have anything to give so she should get it for free and because I worked I should have to pay? I still feel like i was in the right! But just want to know if i was actually in the wrong!

866,Not the A-hole,"

Me (27M) and my fiancé (26F) (I’ll just call her “V”) are getting ready to start looking buy a house to live in after we are married and start our lives together. V has brought up to her family that her and I are looking at houses and her mother got this idea in her head that she was going to move in with us along with V’s dad and her 25 year old sister. She was so adamant about it that she even said the three of them would live in the basement and me and my fiancé would have all of the main floor and upstairs area. She also said when me and V find a bigger place later, we’ll just leave them this house and they will continue to live there and rent from us. For me there doesn’t seem to be a compelling reason they would want to move in. Maybe they want out of the apartment they are renting. 

V’s parents had a house before but they lost it to foreclosure and they have been renting ever since. For the past couple years the father has been the only source of income as an electrician. The mother stopped working for whatever reason and the sister never worked or had a job. They all stay at home most of the time and they don’t really talk to anyone other than family. The whole family has been nice to me from day one but there have been instances of pettiness towards other people when the mother doesn’t get her way. On top of that they have this dog that I can’t stand, and I love dogs. It was never trained or disciplined, and it gets spoiled so it craps all over the place and barks literally non-stop. It also has a history of trying to attack people.

Now V is talking to me about house buying plans as if they will be moving in. She doesn’t see a problem with it because it’s her family. She said they can cook and clean for us all the time. Like wtf? We’re adults and that’s stuff we should be doing on our own anyways. I’m not really on board with the idea at all. I told her the only way it could really work is if we had one of those houses with a basement/ income suite with a separate entrance, kitchen, bathroom etc. (Which isn’t really in the budget) I’m not comfortable with the idea at all. I feel that me and V wouldn’t get the privacy and space we need as a married couple and I wouldn’t be able to have any time alone because someone will always be at home. I also don’t want to put myself in a situation where I have to be financially responsible for them. Most importantly I think my marriage will suffer. I’ve heard stories in the past with parents/in-laws moving in and it usually doesn’t end well for the couple. 

I haven’t had an actual conversation about this with her other than expressing resistance to the idea. Im not sure how to go about it yet but this talk will be happening in the near future. So in this case, WIBTA if I tell V I don’t want this to happen?

Edit: I thought I should clear up a few things about my situation. 

1. We are both western culture/ American where this isn’t normal. If it was a cultural precedent like first gen Asian for example I would understand but still be against it.
2. We are having a longer engagement. This wedding isn’t until another two years. I have time to talk but like you guys have mentioned, this needs to happen ASAP which WILL be happening believe me. 
3. I feel as a couple getting married, we should be able to have serious talks like these without things blowing up. The answer for me is going to be a big fat no. I’m not going to light myself on fire to keep her family warm. I know what I have to do. I just wanted unbiased outside opinions on the matter.

She’s been a wedding photographer on the side for several years now but has been having some job trouble, so money is a little tight. I ended up buying her bridesmaid dress for her because I didn’t want being in my wedding to add to her financial stress.

My wedding is at the end of next month (July 2019), and a few days later, my fiancé and I are going on a 9 day honeymoon with a cruise that we scheduled in January.

Our friend also got engaged almost a month ago (May 2019) and due to her financial issues has decided that she is also going to get married this summer. She told me she was thinking about early July, which would be 2-3 weeks before my wedding.

That brings us to today. I got a text from my friend asking when my honeymoon is. I told her when and she said that it’s unfortunate because she’s decided to get married 2 weeks AFTER I do on the day before we get home.

I have a roommate who lives in my basement bedroom. He just started a job at a local manufacturing plant and gets up early to be at work at 5-6am depending on how much OT he wants and usually gets back around 3:30-4:30 in the afternoon. Usually he is up for a couple hours and in bed by the time I get home around 7.

As a courtesy I let him know a couple days in advance that I have a date and will likely come back to have sex. His response was, verbatim, ""Please don't"". He went on to say that the girls I bring over are loud and he can't sleep, and he's on mandatory OT and three weekends on, one off right now.

I dated a girl for about a month earlier this year who has been the only girl I've ever brought over. Every other girl I've slept with since we became roommates I never brought over, and even this girl came over for sex three times in our relationship. Every other time I went to hers. She was indeed loud, which is why I went to hers usually.

I told my roommate that it was unreasonable to expect me to not bring a date over or to have sex in my own house, and that I had left more often than not. I thought I was already doing my part by warning him in advance. If it bothers him that much, or if he feels like he would lose sleep, I think he can either wear headphones to bed or sleep at a friend's if it is truly that unbearable.

The fact that I knew we had the funds to pay for school meant that I applied to my top choices (all private colleges) which are all 50k/year and up.

We put her to sleep and I was in the bathroom (next to her bedroom). I come out 10mins later and immediately smell smoke. The air is thick with it. 
I yell hey do you smell smoke? 
My wife is in the kitchen doing some homework with her headphones in. She gets up right away Bc her phone goes off. 

I yell with more urgency “HELLO DO YOU SEE SMOKE.” She immediately gets defensive and says “I had my headphones in and I didn’t hear you. My phone just rang so I went to get it”

She has this pattern of behavior with her where she has zero accountability for anything but that’s really not the point here. I only bring it up Bc it has gotten to a point where literally nothing is her fault. We argue and whenever I ask please tell me the last time something was your fault and she usually goes off saying something like I’m done w this or I lm not repeating myself or etc to deflect. 

Anyway, again I repeat “I’m saying do you see smoke in her room?!? CAN YOU PLEASE CHECK” Now to be upfront, I am panicking a bit here and definitely was yelling. It was not civil or nice the way I said it. 

I have issues w my contacts and sometimes things look foggy so I needed confirmation. I smelled smoke and saw it but also having my wife there to confirm would have made a huge difference if we were gonna move our daughter out of the room (and give up the precious sleep we expected). 

She tells me to stop yelling at her and that it wasn’t her fault for not hearing me. Now I’m incredibly agitated and yell at her “I don’t care about what your talking about like at all. Please just go check to see if there’s smoke” again, full disclosure, I yelled this at her. 
There’s smoke near my daughters room And I’m asking for help. 

She looks at me and says well what do you want me to do about it. Puts her earphones back in and continues her homework. 

I’m pretty shocked at the lack of care. It turned out to be nothing - smoke from a neighbor burning the dinner but her room was filled with obvious haze that anyone could see. I took her out and let her sleep in our bed. Wife meantime hasn’t gotten up once from her spot.

She’s always had a lack of accountability but in a potential emergency situation, for her to act like that?!

878,Not the A-hole,"The title might be a bit vague, so hear me out. 

Every day at my lunch table, my friend and her boyfriend get really touchy. They grab, kiss, and do pretty much whatever is allowed (and what is sometimes not allowed) at a High School. They’ll even like, bite each other’s hands when it’s balled into a fist, or just each other’s wrists. 

Honestly, I don’t really know much about healthy couples like these (my parents used to, and still do fight a lot), so is this just what normal couples do?

I have this thing where I really really hate being touched by just about everyone, I’m just really personal space conscious, and I guess it sort of extends to seeing other people touching each other as well. It gives me goosebumps, and makes my stomach churn, to the point where I’ve lost my appetite.

Am I being immature by feeling uncomfortable about this? I get that I’m kind of considered a “young adult”, but still, it just makes me extremely uncomfortable. 
 
So, Would I be an immature asshole if I told my friend that she and her boyfriend are making me uncomfortable?",27,48,0.9

This made me feel a bit bad and I would be a little flirty with them with no intention of dating them. I told my girlfriend this and she said it was a form of bullying. She was one of these types of girls in high school. 
I felt like these girls would blush or do a little giggle, but maybe there was a chance that they were bullied?

880,Asshole,"  

The title sounds extreme but here are the details. My wife and I have been together for 5 years. I love her so much that it pains me to write this. The thing is, I was the sole earner for a while and I was happy to provide (I am a software developer at a local startup that has tripled in employees and gone exponential in revenue). We're not having kids, so my wife got bored of being home and doing nothing. So she got a job at a law firm as a paralegal. 

Enter this attorney, who I'll call Brandon. My wife started to bring him up quite a bit. You know when your wife starts talking about something, drops it, and then brings it up again a few minutes or hours later like there was no gap? My wife does that with stories about him. I searched through her Facebook friends list one day for ""Brandon"" and saw that they had connected. Okay... Then my wife starts going to work happy hours and I'm seeing pictures of the guy on her timeline. In most of the pictures she is positioned next to him, holding a drink. Okay...

I have gained considerable weight since joining the startup. There is free food provided to us nearly every day. My wife has maintained a really low weight and looks as beautiful as she did at 22. Brandon is more like how I used to be weight wise. However, I believe I make more money than he does.

So here it goes... I take off work on Friday, as my team is nearing the end of our project. I wait for my wife to leave the firm and I see her walking out with Brandon. They get in my wife's car, purchased on my dime, and I follow them for a bit. They go to a local dive bar and it turns out all of her coworkers are there - I see them entering. I wait for hours and everyone eventually leaves. My wife leaves last with Brandon and she takes him home. I don't see any physical contact as he exits the vehicle to go inside his apartment building.

At this point, I'm sick. I'm gutted. I wait at home for my wife and confront her about Brandon. She went insane basically, threatening to end the marriage because I stalked her. She told me she is always the DD for happy hour because she doesn't drink much (which is true), but she didn't address my greater concerns. AITA?

To start things off, I'm not pregnant. Nor am I anywhere near close to being pregnant. However, my best friend is pregnant and I couldn't be more happy for her. As best friends do, we started discussing baby names. She asked me if I had any baby names picked out for my future children and I told her my mother had suggested a name years ago for my future daughter that I absolutely fell in love with. It's super unique and it's a name that originates from the country she was born in. My mother is no longer alive, so this is something I really wanted to do in the future so my potential daughter could have a connection to her grandmother. 
A few days ago, I saw on facebook that my best friend posted a picture of those 3D sonograms and in the post she revealed the name that she had picked for her daughter. It was the name I told her that I had picked out for my future daughter. I am absolutely devastated she would do this to me. She knows what that name meant to me and she decided to use it anyway. She says it's just a name and since she's pregnant before me she gets to use whatever name she wants. I told her she's being heartless and asked her how she can do this to someone she sees as a sister. She is not going to change her mind about this, so I want to end all communication with her since I can't even imagine calling her daughter by the name I wanted for mine. Am I the asshole for doing this?

885,Not the A-hole,"During my previous marriage I wrote an extremely extensive textbook on probability. The book in question is hundreds of pages long, covers the topic in extreme detail, and includes hundreds of exercises which I also wrote up solutions to for a separate solutions manual. I should mention, as I think it's important, this is not ""undergraduate probability"" many here will be familiar with, which is generally quite trivial. This is formal probability theory which is extremely technical, and so writing a textbook with hundreds of accompanying exercises was draining to say the least. I dedicated it to my wife (now ex-wife) as she had encouraged me to continue even though I kept slacking and putting it off. Don't think I'd have finished it without her encouragement. We've since divorced and are not on good terms.

 
It's now used in many courses globally and I've received an immense amount of feedback from both instructors and students. I have written an updated edition to address the feedback I've compiled over the years.

My wife (current wife) insists I remove the dedication to my ex-wife and include her instead. I don't think this is appropriate. Even though I am on bad terms with her now, I genuinely believe she's the only reason I ended up completing it, and want to keep the dedication as a 'thank you.' When I refused, my wife went ballistic at me and it has been the source of never ending arguments since.

Am I really the asshole here?

886,Not enough info,"The title, but let me explain. I'm a young widow. My husband passed at the age of 32 and it was sudden and terrible but I don't want to get into that now.

When I finally started dating again I wasn't really dating, just trying to meet guys on Tinder to make the lonely nights pass. As it happens I actually met a great guy who I'm with to this day, almost 2 years later.

When we first met each other I was drinking a lot and didn't care about how I came across to people. I would play music from Hamilton a lot, and it's because that was our musical. He was Alexander Hamilton and I was his Eliza. I know I told my boyfriend this and I know he probably held me while I sang these songs and cried.

But now I'm better, our relationship is great and I'm looking forward to the future, something I never expected. Yet one of my greatest hopes has been to see Hamilton onstage. My late husband and I always wanted to see it together -- he said once ""It doesn't matter what we have to sell or do to see it, we'll see it.""

Obviously that never happened. But I still desperately want to see it. And my boyfriend does not.

He doesn't like to listen to the songs. He hates Lin Manuel-Miranda. He rolls his eyes whenever I wear one of my Hamilton shirts.

I understand he's tying this to my late husband but when I see it (and make no mistake, I WILL see it) I want to see it with my boyfriend. Not as a replacement for my husband, but because he's the love in my life and it's important to me and I want to experience that WITH HIM.

Right now my outstanding debts amount to \~260k (mix of undergrad, masters, credit card, etc.). I know, it's immense.

My credit is basically non-existent and my job doesn't pay well at all, so financially I'm drowning, but I'm still young and I still have hope. My sister knows about my situation and she's upset that I haven't told my long-term, soon to be very serious boyfriend. She's worried he'll find out and leave me on the spot. I'm just trying to work up the courage to tell him partly due to anxiety and shame on my own part. However, I don't share her fears that he'll run away. I think he'll just be shocked.

890,Asshole,"Im the store manager in a convenience store. Lately, we've been having trouble keeping employees. Just a combination of bad timings of people going back to school or finding a new job. In short, we've been very short staffed.

I opened Monday morning, and was supposed to be out at 5. Unfortunately our closer no called no showed, and rather than call in anyone else I just finished the shift, meaning I worked from 6am to 10pm on my own.

Tuesday, I opened again at 6am, and my relief at 4 called in to quit at 330. I didn't have it in me to so another shift like that, so I called my weekend closer. He doesn't want to at first since he only works weekends, but I tell him that I just did an 18 hour shift the day before and don't want to do it again.

He agreed to do it, and came in around 430 to relieve me. All good so far! I go home and get a great night's sleep for once.

So i come in the next morning, and the store looks like ass. Nothin on the shelves is recovered (pulled forward and front faced) the break room trash wasn't taken out, and the floors weren't mopped.

I checked the cameras, and all he did was ring people up and play on his phone. When 10 o'clock hit all he did was count down drawers, take the front half's trash out and leave. Usually after close you stay for a half hour to mop, do a little stock and front face. He did none of that. Just counted down and left.

So, I wrote him up, basically for being lazy. When he came in he was pretty mad, and told me to never even think about asking him for a favor again. So far it's already bitten me in the ass as I had to do another 18 hour shift when he didn't answer his phone when I called to ask.

I told my husband about this, and he actually agreed with him! He said that him even showing up on a day off was a kindness, and I punished him for it.

891,No A-holes here,"TL;DR at the end.

I've been dating my gf for a year now, during which time I've met some of her friends. Never really got to know any of them just because my gf doesn't get to hang out with them a lot.

Recently, 2 of her friends (who were married to each other) had a freak accident happen where the husband crashed his car, was hospitalized, and they pulled the plug on him. The wife took it hard (understandably) and yesterday my gf went to her place to help out with the chaos happening.

The 2 friends had a son together, I believe he's 4ish? 5ish? I got a text today from my gf saying she wants us as a couple to be there for the mom and kid, and my gf and her friend want me to be a role model towards the kid.

I hate kids. I really do. I told my gf when we first started dating that I don't really like kids and don't plan on having any.  And I don't have a problem with the mom, but I barely know her. My gf doesn't hang out with them much because they live almost an hour away. Besides all that, I'll be the first to admit I am NOT role model material. My mom sucked and my dad wasn't really around much to be a role model.

I told my gf that the best I could do right now is say I'd think about it. But that's totally to buy my ass some time to tell her no. Because I don't need that responsibility on my plate. I'm literally going to propose to my gf tomorrow so we have to plan on the wedding, I'm in the process of starting a new job (today was day 3) which is stressful work and I'm not sure it's a good fit for me, which is adding to my financial stress because I don't know if I'll stay with the new job or not.

892,Not the A-hole,"Hi all. About a year and a half ago, I was away from home at university staying in residency on campus. For the purpose of this post, details aren't necessary, so I'm going to cut to the chase. My house back in my hometown, where my parents still lived, was destroyed by a fire that my stepsister purposely started. No one was in the home at the time except for our pets, one of which died in the fire and the other which had to be resuscitated. We lost just about everything, the damage was irreparable, and my parents had to relocate. My stepsister was charged with arson and sentenced to serve time in prison.

So. Yeah.

How could I be TA here, right? Well, to provide a bit of context, my stepsister (late 20's btw) is mentally unwell and had been for several years before this whole thing happened. She tried to seek help but for one reason or another, it clearly was not effective. I don't know if she received any clinical diagnoses, but she was mentally ill to the degree that she wasn't completely in touch with reality. She began lying excessively and her mood swings grew more and more extreme, among multiple other worrying behaviours. I don't know what prompted her to light our house on fire, but she was definitely unhinged before it happened, so there is that. The thing is though, she was trying to get better.

One more thing - I don't know what her motive was, but I am pretty certain that this was a spiteful, hateful act. I think that some sort of beef went down between her and my parents. I don't ask about it. I'm sure you can understand why.  Lastly, they did check if she was mentally stable enough to stand trial, and they found that she was.

Even worse, my stepmother still keeps pictures of her up at home. A few relatives and family friends have said that they ""hope she gets the help she needs."" But I don't have any sympathy or empathy for her. As a person with mental illness myself\*, I don't care if she gets well, and I really never want to see her ever again. She is dead to me.

I'm not sure if my family will even want to see her themselves, but in the case that they do, I plan to refuse to have anything to do with her and will not ever be involved in anything she is apart of. AITA if I stand my ground on this? Should I make an effort to forgive her? Or am I entitled to feel this way about all of this?

**EDIT:** Thanks for all the feedback so far! I'm already learning of new perspectives to consider. But just to make a few things clear that I can already see are common themes of concern in the comments:

* I want all my of family members to make this decision for themselves. I don't think anyone would be wrong to accept my stepsister back into their lives. I'm only asking if I am TA for not wanting to do so myself.
* \* - I do not think my mental struggles are comparable to hers *at all*. I only mentioned my own mental illness experience to illustrate that I understand the *importance of treatment*, **NOT** that I understand *what she is going through*. **I don't want her to stay sick either**. I just don't actively hope for her to get better.
* If it matters, I'm 20F.",33,76,0.95
893,Asshole,"Throwaway account used. Written by my wife and I. 

We had our first child early this year and created basic rules such as no kissing on the lips, no posting pictures in social media(baby can’t consent), no screen time(science says bad before 2 years old), etc. 

About 3 months ago my mom kissed my daughter close to her lips and I reminded her not to kiss her on the lips. Instantly she kissed her on the lips.  We were disgusted because 1. She was chewing gum and 2. A kiss on the lips can be very harmful and deadly to a not fully vaccinated newborn and much safer to just simply kiss them on their foreheads. We resolved this issue after about 3-4 weeks as we needed an apology and for her to meet with a psychologist as she needs to respect our wishes as parents. 

about a month ago, we went to dinner at a busy restaurant with my brother and mom. My mom was feeding our newborn when some of her acquaintances who none of had seen in ten years stopped by. While I was talking to the husband. I turn my head and all of a sudden the wife is holding my baby and my wife and I look at each other in horror. Obviously we couldn’t cause a scene because this essential stranger is holding our child. I started making moves to get her back. We told my mother has irresponsible that was, the most dangerous part of holding a newborn is the passing off and someone sitting handing a baby to someone standing is dangerous especially with waiters and waitresses walking around. Plus She didn’t even ask to hold her nor were ready. This is a baby not a toy. 

We were so angered by this and told her, her response was ohh I’m paying for your meal get over yourselves. I then talked to my father and told him and her that she could not hold our baby for 30 days in public aka restaurants, but could still see her and the like. She refused to see the baby at all. On Mother’s Day It was about 2 weeks later (my wife’s first) and everything seemed to be getting better even though we haven’t seen each other since the incident on her request. 

The 1st thing she did upon sitting down was request to hold the baby in yet another busy restaurant. I reminded her that she can’t because she still hasn’t even acknowledged how what she did was irresponsible. She then told us that if she can’t hold the baby right then and there we should leave and if we leave we are no longer members of the family etc. We promptly left as we discussed this in advance that we need to stand our ground.  (Privilege warning). She then revoked our membership to their country club, canceled my family credit card, threatened to cancel my phone, removed us from the family group chat, among other more minor items. 

We then told her she cannot see her grandchild until she sees a therapist. I really want to maintain a relationship. My mom doesn’t talk to any member of her family due to issues and this I can’t talk to that whole side. She still has not seen a therapist and apparently they have been calling everywhere to get her an appointment. Are We the Assholes?

896,No A-holes here,"So first context is needed. I'm currently a student who begins uni in 2 years. I've lived almost my entire life with my mom and my brother. I've always been picky with food ever since I was little. 

A year ago my mom got a new boyfriend and pretty quickly he moved into the house. He's a big fan of food and likes to experiment with it. He cooks for us about three times a week because his job means he spends a lot of time at home anyways.

So here's where I come in. I'm a picky eater. It's not something I willingly choose to be, and I always at least try food before coming to a desision of weather I like it. The problem for me mainly is sauces, which I often dislike for their flavour (not all of them, but so far I dislike more then I like out of what I have tried). So my moms bf is very keen on sauces and likes to include them in a load of his cooking. So me naturally being me I try his foods but after a couple of bites I almost always dislike it.

I wanna clarify that I hate that I'm picky with foods. It's not a choice I made it's just always been this way. I always try to be polite as possible and have confronted my mom and her bf about it several times but they always take great offence to it as if I choose to dislike the food they make. Every time I don't enjoy it they always look at me with disgust and tell me that it's good, acting as if there's something wrong with me. At this point I feel like there is but idk anymore.

It's been like this ever since I was little, and I've always been seen as an asshole by my mom for it. I've even said I would be willing to prepare my own food to help not waste anything but they don't take me seriously (or at least thats what it seems like) so I've given up trying. At this point I'm scared to take down the food I don't like because I always feel like I'm gonna get lashed out on by my mom. 

Anyways AITA? At this point idk if there's just something wrong with me or not.

She asked me for basically all the money I have saved to pay for my court fines. If I have the money for my court fines, I can do weekend jail and keep my job which provides them insurance and continue to stay current with child support. If I give her said money, I can't pay my fines and disqualifies me for weekend jail and lose my job. That would in turn make them lose insurance and most likely a few months of no child support do to being in jail and looking for a new job.

899,Asshole,"I’m a gal in her mid 20’s who works at a restaurant. There was recently an event we were prepping for which featured an assortment of dishes from a bunch of different cultures. My parents are both immigrants from the Middle East, and there was a recipe they taught me (passed down from my grandmother) for a dish enjoyed in my culture that I have always loved. I recommended this recipe to the head chef, and he approved it for this event. For the first time ever, I got to cook my beloved dish myself, for lots of other people to enjoy.

I worked on this dish for hours in the kitchen; put a lot of work into it, and was very pleased with how it turned out. But upon getting back from break, I was devastated to see my dish splattered in one of the gigantic garbage cans in the back kitchen. Apparently, one of the dishwashers/cleaners carelessly threw it away. I know it wasn’t done in malice (the guy who did it is very careless and clumsy, and has some special needs), but it was heartbreaking nonetheless. The second I saw it, I burst out crying.

And when I say crying, I really mean crying. I sobbed loudly and hysterically; my face got beet red, and I started losing my footing/balance and stumbling around. Everyone turned around horrified, and between wails I cried to them that my dish had been thrown away. The chef reprimanded the guy who did it, came over and comforted me; and told me to take a break to get myself together. I walked over the break room, which had about four or so of my coworkers, and continued to cry my eyes out.

After 15 minutes, I got back to work in the kitchen (working on a completely different dish) and tried my best not to cry. But I saw someone dumping a bunch of trash into that same garbage bin, and it triggered the image of my dish in the garbage, and I started bawling again. Once again, my chef asked me to take a breather; I took a 5 minute breather and got back to work again; but little tears still continued to stream out of my eyes.

The chef told me he thinks it would be best if I just work more basic duties today (like sweeping or breaking down boxes in the back). I agreed to do it, but felt embarrassed. Whilst sweeping, I felt real shitty; embarrassed I had been “demoted” to such a low-level duty for me, and still broken up about my dish.

900,Not the A-hole,"**Some Background:** My 15lb neutered male cat is a known asshole. He has some low-key aggression and is okay around my dog and his sister but has attacked every new animal that has dared enter our home. This includes a friend’s American Eskimo and my Rottweiler when we first adopted him. My male cat also has feline idiopathic cystitis and his bladder becomes inflamed when he’s “stressed.” When this occurs he pees BLOOD all over my house. He has flare-ups when he receives less attention than usual, so I treat his condition is by spoiling his little furry butt with prescription cat food and lots of activity. One of his favorite activities is going for a “walk”.

&#x200B;

**The Incident:** Once a week, my cat dons his harness and leash. We typically hang around the yard where he eats grass and rolls in the dirt. He’s a bit skittish outside and runs back towards the house once he sees a person, another animal, or hears a loud noise. Sometimes, he decides he’s feeling brave enough to walk down the sidewalk, but never far.

&#x200B;

We made it to the sidewalk, and a few houses down from us some visitors get out of their car with their Pomeranian. I see the little dog sprint in our direction and prepare myself for when my cat decides to run away. However, once my cat noticed the pup, he actually moved between the dog and I and lunged. I pulled the leash hard enough to yank my cat off of the dog, but it got a few scratches.

&#x200B;

I ran my scared cat back into the house and returned to a very angry dog owner. This lady immediately started to scream at me about how my ""rabid"" cat attacked and injured her “$600 dog”. She told me that she was taking her dog to the vet and that I’d be paying for it. I apologized but told her that I didn’t think I was liable for what my LEASHED cat did to her UNLEASHED dog. She obviously did not take it well and threatened to call the cops. I told her to go ahead, went inside, and ignored her.

&#x200B;

I’m not worried about being held liable for “damages.” This happened several weeks ago, my city has a leash ordinance, the injuries appeared superficial, and I've heard nothing since. However, a few of my friends think I should've offered to pay some of the expenses since purebred dogs are expensive and my cat was a feral kitten I got for free. Or that I shouldn't be walking him given his history. My stance is that this lady shouldn't have had her dog off the leash in the first place! Having a small dog does not exempt you from leash laws- it could have been hit by a car or attacked by literally any feral cat in the neighborhood. However, they might have a point about walking him. Exercise is good for his FIC, but is he too aggressive for walks? I really don't want to stop walking him. 

&#x200B;

**Tl;dr:** Off-leash Pomeranian is attacked by my leashed cat. Owner threatens to sue me over the vet bill. I don’t think that paying the bill is my responsibility. I also don't want to stop walking my cat.",99,88,0.93

904,Asshole,"Hi all. 

My sister Eleanor and her husband Paul were staying over at our place for my much younger brother's wedding over the weekend.

Eleanor and me have daughters who are both 15. My daughter is called Sarah and hers is Becky. They are both very pretty but are polar opposites in terms of personality. Becky is very confident, outgoing, has loads of friends and is a huge party girl. She's also very capable academically and according to Eleanor is top or near the top of most of her classes. Sarah is the opposite. She is a kind and gentle person but is sensitive and at times awkward, with major issues with her confidence. She has a few very close friends rather than being part of a large group. Her academic performance is decent but not exceptional like Becky, but we are nevertheless proud of her because we know she works hard at school. 

Becky bullies Sarah and has done for a long time. She is spoiled by her parents who think that it's ''just harmless kid stuff''. Just this weekend she told Sarah that she was too ugly to go the wedding and that she would have to stay out of the photos. She also tried to push her out of big family photo at the reception. My wife Diane had to find Sarah after she ran outside crying. This bullying has gone on for years and nobody has made an attempt to stop it. 

Sunday morning in the garden we heard someone scream inside the house. We ran into the kitchen to find Becky feeling around the kitchens trying to find her glasses. She has very bad eyesight, bad enough that according Eleanor she needs to feel around for her glasses on her bedside table since everything is a blur for her. She has worn glasses in a high prescription since she was a baby. 
Becky was crying her eyes out until Diane found her glasses in one of the food cupboards. Once she had got them back on she started saying that Sarah took her glasses. 

I called Sarah downstairs and she admitted that she did take the glasses. We were all disappointed but Eleanor and Paul proceeded to tear into her about how cruel and nasty she was and how frightened and upset Becky was because of her. 

Sarah tried to explain that Becky had been taunting her about the photos and had been saying that she would be cropped out, but Becky's parents had no sympathy and said that maybe a ''bully'' like Sarah deserves that. I went ballistic and said that Becky had been bullying Sarah for years and they have laughed it off. Paul tried to say that Becky's ''girly teasing'' wasn't bullying and that what Sarah did was. 

I can see why Eleanor wants Sarah punished, but at the same time her daughter was the instigator and I don't agree with her wanting to punish our daughter after hers inflicted years of psychological abuse on her. We don't want to punishing Sarah. Obviously it was wrong to take the glasses, but it was a response to years of torment.

910,Update,"[OP here](https://amp.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bi3v9u/wibta_if_i_report_my_friend_to_the_police_for_a/)

Over a month ago, I asked if I should report my friend for vandalizing a botanical garden for no reason. Now, I’ll try to give the most important details of what happened after the post.

Several days after I made the post, I decided to report my friend. The easiest way to do this was speaking to an adult, so I got with one of my best friends who I trust to speak with our pastor. Our town is small, and our pastor is very well known in the community, so we knew he would be the best person to talk to. We spoke with him in private and it turns out he knows the president of the botanical garden personally. We told him the name of our friend and we told him that this was an anonymous tip, and that when the vandal is caught, we want the money to be donated to the botanical garden. 

After that, nothing really happened. It wasn’t until about 3 weeks later when something finally happened. In between one period at school, my friend came up to me and boasted that he’s going to get charged with destruction of property. This made me mad but a little happy at the same time. I was mad because he was being an asshole to the end, but I was glad that he would get punished.

Again, nothing happened for a while, about 2 weeks. However, I checked the local paper today and a section is dedicated to explaining that the botanical garden vandals have been caught. The botanical garden has decided not to press charges against the vandals, however they are forcing the vandals to do community service at the garden over the summer. The newspaper states that the “tipster did not accept” the $500, but it never says that it was donated back to the garden. 

The ending of this story was pretty boring, but I don’t care. I just hope that this will open my friend’s eyes and that he will stop doing stupid things.",27,439,0.98

914,Not the A-hole," So  a couple of days ago, our enterprise sent out a system wide email  survey. The email also said your responses are ""confidential"". And our managers were pretty anal about getting the survey done.

&#x200B;

My  manager emailed us saying if anyone lost that email, just email HR and  they will send you the survey again, which made me think why does HR  need to email again and why cant my manger just forward the email to  everyone. Upon closer look, the email said, that this survey is  confidential. below that, in smaller font, it also said, that this email  survey has been specially customized for you and please do not forward  the link to anyone. This basically means that even though they are not  asking for name or email or other identifying details while filling out  the survey, the fact that my link is unique tells me that my responses  are automatically tracked to my name and email.

So  I just sent out a text to my group, telling them that this survey  is not anonymous, just FYI. In case someone wanted to write strong comments. Most of my colleagues were genuinely surprised  and thanked me for the heads up, some of them even had a 'oops' moment.

But, one of the my colleagues FREAKED out and accused me of manipulating the  group into lying and being dishonest. She wrote a strongly worded text  to me saying that surveys (whether anonymous or not) are a vehicle for change and honest responses  are expected and are actually helpful. And that I came across as asking them to be dishonest (whether it was my intent or not). In full disclosure, I did send a follow up text  to the group saying that please answer honestly.

&#x200B;

I  freaked out and called some of my colleagues for guidance, who could  not believe that it was even an issue. and most of them that its just a  damn survey, shouldn't be a career deciding factor. They were genuinely  appalled that my colleague was making an issue with this. Eventually I  texted that colleague back, saying that I agree with her in all her  concerns, however, I dont think I have the power to influence the minds  of 15 highly educated, adult **doctors**.  And if anyone's responses change on the fact that this is not  anonymous, then its their problem and not mine. You can not fault me for explaining the terms and conditions to someone. I am not encouraging  dishonesty.

However,  this has deeply bothered me, that she portrayed me as someone  advocating for anarchy and attempting a coup by forcing people to be  dishonest. If a word of this got out, that [u/nastygeek](https://www.reddit.com/u/nastygeek/)  is encouraging people into lying, I will have to explain to the  management, which may or may not appreciate my explanation. I do want to  talk to her face to face asking her how the hell she dare to accuse me  about forcing people to lie without any concrete proof and tarnish my  reputation like that.

915,Asshole,"Alright so let me preface by saying I am, in fact, in college, so hookups, one night stands, and friends with benefits are pretty commonplace. 

That being said, I’ve had some good times and some regrettable times in my bed. I made a joke awhile back to one of my friends (guy) about wondering how “good” I was at doing the deed. We laughed and he told me to, literally, ask the girls how it was. I figured this was the best option, why not hear it straight from them?

So, for the past 3 years of college, after a hookup, I’ve asked the girls to rate me, on a scale of 1-10, how good the action was. I’ve gotten a wide range of numbers on the scale and various reactions, but all positive. Some girls (friends with benefits) laugh and give me a 1, while others (hookups) joke about it happening again. 

The number doesn’t exactly matter to me anymore, by this point it’s more of a running joke with myself to ask the question. However, recently, I had my first negative reaction to my poll. We had just finished up and we were crawling back in the bed to cuddle (I got her a glass of water and some snacks) and I jokingly popped the question. She seemed horribly flustered and, even though I told her it was a joke and she needn’t answer, she called me plenty of worse things than asshole, got dressed, then stormed out of my apartment.

&#x200B;

So I live in Nashville, TN but I'm getting married Halloween of next year near my hometown in West TN. It's a two hour drive from both Memphis and Nashville airports, and less than a third of our small wedding (A total of roughly 15 people out of 105 guests total) is flying in. Part of the reason we're getting married out there is because everything is cheaper for us and for our guests as opposed to getting married in the Middle TN area. 

&#x200B;

Most will be driving from my town in West TN and Nashville in their own vehicles. I've been told rather aggressively that I'm acting like a jerk because I said people can figure out their own transportation to and from my wedding. I'm close to uninviting some people because of how some of my guests are treating me because of this.

&#x200B;

Car rentals are cheap, which they would have to do anyway to get to the town from an airport (total of $70 for the whole weekend). Surprisingly, despite it being a rural area, there is Uber in my area both ways to the venue and hotel we have blocked reservations at ($25 each way, but still, it's available). Both of these things have been made clear to all guests, especially since we have over a year before the wedding even happens. That should be plenty of time to figure out your transportation.

&#x200B;

I truly feel that, as an adult, if you can't figure out how to watch your drinking enough to get home safely, that's not my problem/fault.  My father, who doesn't drink, has also offered to shuttle people if they accidentally get too drunk even though they drove, which I have also shared with all the guests. I've also offered carpool plans and lodging at local friends/family houses to assist with any budget troubles.

I've provided my own transportation at every wedding I've ever been to, rural and urban. I've never felt like that was a big deal when I was an attendee.

I decided to help him try to talk to this girl while we were at the wedding and reception. Basically, he and I walked up to her together and I started talking to her as I know her much better.  Fast forward a few minutes and I excuse myself to get cake, leaving him and her to talk alone. Half and hour goes by and they break for the throwing of the bouquet and garter, after which he comes up to me all happy having had a good conversation with her.  He decides he wants to go back to our hotel and sleep while I help clean up at the reception. Turns out the girl in question was going to stay and help too (I did not know this) so we ended up working together for a while.  Next day I get a text from her thanking me for staying and helping, and we chat for a bit about just nothing.  This goes on for a bit, and the next day she changes the tone of the texting to something more serious and she starts sending pics and stuff (nothing explicit). Tuesday he and I were going out that morning to do some shopping, and i had to stop at the bank.  While we were there I left my phone in the car with him, and I guess I left it on because he was a text come though from her and asked me about it when I got back.  I explained to him that she was the one that reached out to me and I thought nothing of our talking, but he cut the shopping trip short and went home. Now he isnt answering texts or calls and has told me he doesn't want to talk. AITA?

Tuesday morning were going to go to go to the mall, I hadn't told her I wasnt interested but also did not reciprocate any of the feelings, and she texted again with my phone on in the car as we were using my bluetooth and spotify, which is when he saw the notification. 

He and I texted tonight and we are going to talk it out over dinner tomorrow night and see a movie (Dark Phoenix, yay). I'm sure everything will be fine after tomorrow as he is a great guy and I never meant to hurt his feelings, I should have immediately ended the talking when it got serious.

I didn't really know how to respond and I felt for the woman, so I told her ""if she's ok with it, sure"".

Basically, my ex (F) and I (M) dated for almost 5 years. It was one of those relationships where both of us thought we were punching - I.e. we both thought the other was the most attractive one in the relationship (please for the love of god don’t try to tell me punching means we were abusive to each other - we weren’t, it was a great relationship).

So naturally, as we loved each other’s bodies a lot, we shared photos of one another. I’ll be the first to admit I had more of her than she had of me, but they were all consensually given and taken at the time, and we agreed we would never share these photos outside of the two of us. A promise we have kept (well I assume she kept her side. But then, I’m nothing worth sharing anyway lol).

The relationship has since ended (a couple months ago) for non-physical reasons (essentially new jobs and long distances). However, we never really brought up what we would do with the pictures we have. So my question is - am I the asshole for keeping the pics of her?

Disclaimer - I have absolutely zero intent to share them with anyone. Even if the relationship had ended badly, that would be a disgusting thing to do. I still care for her as a person. She was just really hot and I enjoy... reminiscing. I realise that sounds yuck to some people..

925,Asshole,"Back in December my husband and I signed a fifteen month lease with a friend.  We figured she needed a better living situation and we could save around $3-400 dollars a month in doing so. There were no foreseeable circumstances that could have messed up the living situation as far as we knew of. About a month later my dad got himself into a legal battle over my Grandma and her estate. I wasn’t involved in the case, I told my dad I thought he was making a mistake over it, and otherwise just went about life.

Fast forward to two days ago and my dad calls to tell me that he was taken to court, lost, and therefore lost his income(it came from my Grandma). He said that he is facing homelessness and asked if my husband and I would move back in for enough time until he could get his SSI and disability which would take around six months. I told him that I wanted to look into other alternatives and talk with my roommate before making any decisions.

Yesterday my husband and I brought this to our roommate’s attention.  We said we didn’t know what we were gonna do yet but we wanted her opinion. We also said if we come to the decision to move back in with my dad that any financial penalty of breaking the lease we would handle and we would give her at least thirty days notice if/when we decide to move.

Her opinion was that my dad did this to himself and it shouldn’t affect the living situation here. She feels that if the consequences of his actions include homelessness then that is his problem and it shouldn’t cause her to have to be kicked out. She feels that the fair thing to do is for my husband and I to stay here and just let the dominoes fall so to speak.

After this discussion she went to her room, slammed the door, and yelled to either her boyfriend or her parents over the phone about it. My husband gets a phone call from her boyfriend saying that if we choose to move in with my dad and break the lease then I will have betrayed her trust and we would no longer be friends.

My opinion is that while it isn’t my responsibility to help pay for my dad’s rent, it is equally not my responsibility to stay here if I feel my family needs me. In all fairness it’s not my responsibility to be stuck in a lease, feeling like a terrible human being, just so my roommate can continue to be out of her parents’ otherwise safe/stable environment since she can’t afford a place of her own and is currently unemployed.

Thanks.

Edit:
The policy here is we can break the lease at any time as long as two months additional rent is paid, which my husband and I are prepared to pay.

I never would have signed a lease if my roommate were unemployed. At the time she was but then suddenly quit without telling us in advance a few weeks ago.",46,42,0.88

Took some time to think about it and read over what people have posted and came to the following conclusions/actions:

1. My husband was being an asshole by flip-flopping on our agreed lie. We talked about it and he agrees that it wasn't fair for him to do. He also admits that my mother's outbursts were a sign shes still the woman she was. I guess in my initial rundown of events he missed the part when she touched our son, so now he's pissed. But he still pressed me to come clean to the kidos

2.  Lying to my children is not okay, even if its to protect them. When I think about the possibility of this coming up again when they're older I believe it would be very damaging to our relationship. 

3. six-year-olds are smarter than they let on. When I sat them down and told him that the woman actually was his grandmother he said that he ""knew I was fibbing"". My daughter couldn't care less, which was to be expected. 

4. I also did some internet stalking and discovered that my mother now lives in the same state as us so I suppose another encounter could be in my future... yuck.

Ok so my husband's birthday was last week, for the occasion I decided to make a number of traditional West Indian dishes. We live out in a somewhat rural area and the supermarkets nearby don't have most of the necessary ingredients. So I pack up the kids (boy 6, girl 3) and head toward the city where I know of a store that has what I need.

&#x200B;

I've got everything and I'm standing in the very long check out line when an older and somewhat disheveled woman attempts to squeeze between us and the people in front. Shes got salt and pepper hair and a worn tired face. At first glance, i didn't recognize her. But she shouted ""oh my god""; it was her voice that made me realize. It was my mother that I've had no contact with for nearly 20 years. I froze. I couldn't even think. I just stood there.

&#x200B;

She was going on, something about how she can't believe it's me. Then she noticed my children. My son was riding in the basket of the carriage ( yes I know he shouldn't be in there) and she reaches over and puts her hand on his head and asks ""are these my grandbabies?"". I flipped the fuck out. Her touching him sent me info a literally panic. I shouted at her not to touch him, then lifted him out of the carriage, scooped up my daughter and we headed for the door. As I was leaving she yells ""You bitch, you won't even let me meet my grandchildren!"" Now she's following me as I try to weave my way out the crowded store. My son is asking me ""whos that lady"" and just as we make it through the door she shouts again, ""no matter how you run I'll always be your mother! I have a right to see my grandbabies! Your nanna loves you!"".

&#x200B;

When I get in the car I'm at the point of tears, I never thought I'd see that woman again, its been so long and I've literally moved to another neighboring state. I couldn't believe the odds. My son asked me again who the lady was; ""is that grandma?"" I lie, "" no that was some confused woman"" He's not buying it at all, more questions until I distract him with his tablet.

&#x200B;

When I come home without any of the stuff my husband is confused and asks me what happened. I get the children situated and tell him all of it. His response is not good... he accuses me of potentially damaging our son and confusing him because of the lie that we **BOTH** agreed to tell him. That my drug addicted, physically, emotionally, and financially abusive mother was dead. He claims that maybe shes changed, its been all this time, but I don't think it's worth the risk to involve her in our lives now. I wouldn't even know how to go about sitting down a 6 and 3 yr old and explaining that their grandmother is not in heaven like I said and that she's such a bad person that I don't want them to have a relationship with her...

&#x200B;

My husband is threatening to tell them anyways, I'm sticking to my original story, AITA?

927,Asshole,"So I was flying from Maui to DFW and I was sitting right in front of a screaming baby. It was torture. I was getting irritated and I about told the parents to shut their baby up. All they were doing were rubbing/patting its head like it was a puppy dog instead of actually trying to calm the baby down. So WIBTA if I told them they should try and calm down their screaming child so it would stfu?

EDIT: Thanks for the feedback guys now I know what to do in case I have to deal with a screaming baby on another plane trip

EDIT 2: Guys let’s not start arguments here, be civil or i’ll have to press the handy-dandy report button

EDIT 3: The parents should obviously know what they were doing evidently wasn’t calming the baby down. They should’ve figured out another way. But no one seems to understand that.",164,57,0.81
928,Asshole,"So I made a post on this sub a bit back where I got mad at my brother for treating me like his own personal photographer and making me do weird things. Also he was getting mad at me for not taking the best photos. So I told him he was a selfish prick and to stop treating me like his own personal photographer.

So basically my brother for a few days kept trying to convince me to go to this location with him. I knew he was doing it just so he could get pictures of himself because he went a bit back and his friends took photos of him. He complained they sucked though I looked at them and said they looked fine. He said it was cuz he wasn’t the “center focus” of the photo. Therefore I knew he wanted me to come so I could take photos of him. For days and days I told him no and that I’m trying to focus on my studies and pass all my finals. I’m on the verge of getting a C in one of my classes and I want to be able to do well enough I can get a new phone. He was persistent even when my parents kept telling him no and that I have to study. Hell I like a distraction from studies here and there but like if it’s not for my enjoyment I ain’t doing it.

So basically I’m still busy cuz finals are next week. He still was persistent but this time my mom gave in and said he will go with him to that location. 

Fast forward to later last night my mom is giving my brother a lecture on how he was selfish and how bad it was he was persistent to make me go with him in a time I had a lot of work. 

My mom talked with me later and said he basically made her do some dangerous stuff in order to make her take photos of him. Like she could have almost tripped and gotten badly injured. I talked to her about how he would make me squat in the middle of a walk path to take photos of him. He even made me look stupid trying to get in a position so I can take a photo of him. He gets angry when they don’t come out his way and makes us do it again and again till he gets what he wants 

It’s bad cuz I feel like Instagram is corrupting him. He’s so obsessed over his followers and likes. He has around 750 followers and gets around 250 likes. He also gets mad when a certain person doesn’t like his photo and talks about Instagram crap with me when I clearly don’t care. He’s always like oh this and this drama or beef is happening. It’s like the increased amounts of likes he gets inflates his ego. Me and my parents have seen changes in him how he’s more arrogant and thinks he’s better than me. Like I swear so what if I have 140 followers and average 50 likes per post I’m happy with what I have, it’s not everything and it never should be. 

I proposed the idea of deleting insta for a bit from his phone and my parents weren’t sure since they felt he wouldn’t be happy. So what I did was I took his phone while he was sleeping, deleted insta and had my parents delete the App Store so he couldn’t redownload it. I put it back.

932,Not the A-hole,"Sorry if the title is off and for any mistakes here goes,

I visited the shelter because I was feeling low and cats are awesome so I thought I’d volunteer and maybe get some cat therapy.

So I went down with my BFF and BF and we played with kittens and old cats (PS: favourite gala name was granny and she was so moody, I loved it). I saw my now cat Zuzu, I didn’t go up to her at first because I knew I’d fall in love with her. So my foresight didn’t save me and I learnt she had been abandoned since late Jan 2019. It was then May, so she had been there for +/-5 months. I spoke with the manager and he said he’d phone the owner and see if they’d get back to him and he told me to wait a week. So I did, I confirmed payment on her shots and snips and waited another 3 days for the owner to contact back. They never did. 

So it’s now a about month in an I post a pic of her on social media, the owner is a distant acquaintance, a friend of a friend kind of thing. It’s a small town. She sends me a direct message and claimed ownership. I explained the situation as well as the attempts at contact and she called bullshit. She never addressed the abandonment, and bowed when I firmly stated that the cat was now in my care and I would provide her with a lovely home. She hasn’t responded yet and I did apologize to her in the messages. It’s weird I know where she lives and works, it’s one of the nice bars in town. She’s a sweet person but,

I just feel bad. I understand cat love. I understand bonds, but how can you leave a kitten in a shelter for +/-5 months? How long is that even in cat time? 

I’m conflicted but feel like I’m doing the right thing. I thought very long about bringing a cat into my home and even got the support of my housemates and close friends. I gathered supplies and made what I couldn’t afford. I love that fluffy stinkball, but how do I manage this relationship in a small town? Do I ignore it? I just don’t know how not to be the asshole here...

Edit: 
Abandoned as in at a shelter, not on the side of the road. Left there after being put into boarding,

The local SPCA does have a boarding facility but on weekly fee basis. She (Zuzu was left there for way over that time) and the owner was contacted before my attempts after filing for adoption.  

Thanks guys, I really appreciate that a lot of people get why I feel so bad but also firm on the decision. 

There’s some photos of Zuzu on my profile for anyone asking as well. Thanks! Oh and cool silver thanks! Cool platinum! Thank you!",1073,11114,0.89
933,Asshole,"So basically today my friend and I went to the casino. He didn't want to play since he was low on money so I gave him 50$ to gamble so we could have fun together. Basically him and I played a couple games of baccarat. I lost the all the money i bet however he won almost quadruple the $50 I gave him. I asked him if he could share his winnings since it was my money he was risking. That's not what he thinks, he thinks that since he won, its his money and he doesnt need to give me any. I was upset after he said this and told him that it was a dick move on his part.  Anyways, Ive been ignoring his texts telling me to get on discord. AITA here for being upset and ignoring my friend?

Edit: After reading comments, i decided to tell him that im upset with him about him not returning atleast the $50 i gave him. He didnt seem to care that i was upset. I guess this is a small price to pay to see what kind of friend he is.",135,233,0.94

935,Not the A-hole,"So this past year, I was living in an apartment with 5 of my friends, and dishes were always a major issue. Most of my roommates were so bad about doing dishes that I eventually just grabbed a big box to put all of their dirty dishes in, otherwise nobody could use the sink. Its a small kitchen. 

I've always been very good about cleaning my dishes as soon as I was done using them.  The dirty dish box was always full of dishes usually from the same 3 people, but it wasnt that big of a deal because it was out of the way. The box made a very good compromise for all of us when everyone was around.

Unfortunately, winter break started and 3 out of the 6 of us went home for break, but me and 2 other people were planning on staying in the apartment and working at school for break. Before winter break started, i tried to emphasize to the roommates who had the most stuff in the box to please try and clean up their stuff. I would leave notes on the fridge, texts in our groupchat, and even told them personally that if there stuff wasn't cleaned from the box by winter break i was going to take all their shit and stuff it in a bag, since i didn't want to have to deal with their dishes that they didn't clean up. Also because it was a bit of a health hazard. The few times my girlfriend had touched some of the dishes in the box she immediately broke out into huge rashes all over her hands.

So to no ones suprise, winter break comes and the box is still full of dishes. True to my word, i took everyone's crap in the box and stuffed it in a black bag and put it in the corner. This was mostly because one of the roommates who had stayed behind is the worst offender of leaving dirty dishes everywhere and had borrowed literally everyones dishes in an effort to not clean his. So there were piles of dirty dishes everywhere and i needed the box to fit these new dishes. 

When everyone returned (a month and a half later) three of the roommates were fine with what i had done, took their stuff out of the bag and moved on with their lives. 

Two roommates in particular (who were gone for the whole month and a half break), we'll refer to them as R and T, got extremely angry at me for putting their stuff in a bag, claiming that their stuff was ruined beyond repair, and that i should have cleaned up their stuff, because that's what friends do. 

I am much more friends with R, and was more acquaintances with T. Anyway both of them basically called me and my girlfriend assholes for not cleaning all the dishes in the box for them. Even though half those dishes had been there since thanksgiving and it was February when they finally even noticed it. Also they didnt clean the dishes that were in the bag afterwards and just put them back in the box.

937,Not the A-hole,"I'm 29. I have some sensory issues to put it mildly. I also have hyperacusis (sensitivity to sound). There's some trauma associated with my birthday. It's not a fun day for me. 

I request no posts, texts, or calls. The dinging is painful. Even on silent, the frequent notifications are overwhelming. I also ask that people don't do the big excited behaviors that usually end in a hug. I don't demand or get angry when they do those things, unless they touch me or clearly disrespect the request. 

People tend to be mad or hurt. Some say it's rude or ungrateful. Some think my requests are too burdensome to others. I guess it's the guilt of not doing the normal nice things. I can understand that to some extent, but that's a them problem IMO. Some people try to fix me. I find that condescending. 

I think it's rude to disrespect someone's request solely to make yourself comfortable. Especially when I've said it makes me uncomfortable. I'm not telling them what to do on their birthday. I'm asking not to do it on mine.

938,Not the A-hole,"Hey guys. Please excuse any grammar issues as English isn't my main language.

So some context: I am visiting my religious family for around a week before I go somewhere for college. I myself have been agnostic for quite a while now, and my parents reluctantly accepted it but stated that as long as I'm in their house I need to follow the rules, which I respect and understand.

However, it gets a bit more complicated - I am very soon leaving for my second year in college. Like, June 11 soon. I want to hang out with my friends (who are closet atheists) one more time, but the thing is, tomorrow begins a holiday of my religion, where we are not allowed to drive or use any electricity-using equipment.  The holiday begins on Friday night and continues until June 10, and on Friday morning and noon I'm going to be too busy helping my family prepare for the holiday. 

Now, my friends (who live at least a 10 minute car ride from all directions from me so meeting on foot is not feasible) and I thought of going somewhere DURING the holiday since that'll be the only time we'll be able to do so. 
I asked my parents if I that will count as disrespect towards them and they said that I can't violate the religion as long as I live with them, and this counts as such. I feel like since I am going to be out of the house for the social activity, and since I'm not going to use any of my parent's money or belongings (one of my friends also has his own car so there's no issue of stealing from our parents anything) it's really my decision from here and I'm not doing anything morally questionable since I'm 19 and an adult now. However, I'm unsure and would really appreciate some less biased opinions.
Thank you so much for your opinions. I am ready to accept either result.

INFO - just so people know I have a healthy relationship with my parents, and even if they do somehow find out they wont kick me out of the house (no that itd matter since id be leaving for college the next day anyway) so thats not a risk. And the plan is that I get outside the house, go somewhere where no one from my religion will be present in and get picked up by a friend from there.
More INFO - walking is NOT possible. Me and my friends tried to discuss that and found out that way at least one of us would have to walk for quite a bit in the heat in just one direction, which even if was possible would just ruin the mood)

EDIT - So far it would seem IWBTA. Welp, sucks that I won't get to see my friends without being TA but I respect my parents.
EDIT 2 - well looks like it's getting a bit more polarized now. Both sides use solid arguments.  I still tend towards TA but it's subject to change.
EDIT 3 - ok now I'm not sure...
EDIT 4 - well I'm beginning to see where the other side is coming from
EDIT 5 - Woah, that post seens to be more thought provoking than I expected. Thank you so much for the food for thought guys.
Edit 6 - well so far it would look like the NTA side is winning, not considering the NTA opinions that just bash religion or YTA opinions that forget im following the rules while im in the house. Thanks so much for the inputs y'all
EDIT 7 - well guys I think we pretty much said it all. It was definitely an interesting, thought provoking discussion. I think that so far the best option ia go through with it and just tell half truth to my parents to prevent the relationship from getting more strained. This might count as disrespect towarsa my parents but at the end I also want to meet my friends one more time before i go down under. Still feel free to add your opinion of course if you feel like something can be added. I thank you all one more time for the intelligent opinions.",233,260,0.92

940,Everyone Sucks,"(Sorry to the mods for reposting, didn't know spaces counted as characters)

So this sounds terrible and I honestly likely won’t do anything because I know that dogs always look for their masters when they go to sleep, though how aware she is is debatable. My dad's dog (was originally mine) is 16, has 1 almost working leg out of 4 bad ones, incontinent, blind can't hear, can't drink on her own, needs to be hand-fed, has to take an average of about 6 pills a day, can't lay down or stand up on her own, and she just seems so sad all the time. She can't go on walks and can barely get to the end of the driveway. Her whole body is arthritic.

She had a few close calls over the past few years: her liver stopped working, and then randomly started up again, her paw got run over by a car and the stress and pain caused a lot of issues, she's had at least one seizure that we know of. My dad was actually going to put her down, but then she woke up when the vet left the room and he said he still saw some light behind her eyes so he took her back home.

That dog was/is well loved and taken care of by us. A few years ago, I moved away to a neighboring state to go to university. I can't have dogs in the dorms, so I didn't take her with me (and honestly, she was in constant need of care by the time I left already). When I moved away, my dad took even more care of her than he did when I was home, so she’s his dog, now.

I will say that my dad pampers this dog so much, I don't think he's treating her badly or anything, but I think it's cruel to let her live in so much pain - I don't care how many pills she takes, you can tell she's in bad shape. My mom and dad live alone with the dog and my siblings will come over to visit, but they can't ever leave the house with no one home because the dog will have an accident. My dad took her to the vet recently for more pills and, while the vet gave her what he asked for, she said ""I could just slap you."" My dad's reply? ""Oh the last guy who ran this practice would have grabbed me by the lapels and shook me.""

He KNOWS that the dog needs to be put down, and he refuses to do it! We've all offered to take her to the vet ourselves and he still will not let us. I've been debating giving the dog benadryl when I visit one weekend, but we've given it to her before (as a sleep aid) so I would hate to have it not work and only cause more harm. I feel like a monster for even considering it. The only other thing that I can think of is to give the vet a house call and to do it when I'm the only one home. I feel terrible even thinking about this, but this dog is in so much pain, and there is no way I can convince my dad to say his final goodbyes. WIBTA if I were to SOMEHOW put the dog down behind his back and attempt to make it look like a natural death? I know that if I just took her to the vet, unless she had a reason to go like another seizure, he would never talk to me again.

EDIT: let me clarify (and probably dig my own grave some more), I WOULD NOT DO IT MYSELF, if at all. No excuses for myself, I phrased it horribly. I don't want to hurt the dog anymore than he already has by keeping her alive. Also, y'all this is my dog too, he just took over when I left for Uni.

EDIT 2: I think that the next time I go home, I will talk to the rest of my family to see if they will do a sort of intervention with me. I will let my dad know of some euthanasia services that can do house calls for the dog. I really want to drive home the point that he and the dog can part on his terms. I know he's going to argue that she's not going out on her own terms, but it's better that they say goodbye, because I feel like even she's ready to go. I feel like if she dies in her sleep then he'll never be able to move on from it because he won't get any closure.",53,61,0.88
941,Not the A-hole,"I'm 25F and my boyfriend of 6 months is 27M. I've been living in a pretty large US city since graduating college, but haven't made any close friends...I've found that it's much harder to meet people as an adult when you can't just share a class with someone.

I downloaded Bumble, which most people know as a dating app but it actually has three separate ""modes"" - dating, friends, and networking. The friends mode, BumbleBFF, only shows you other women if you're a woman and other men if you're a man. So I've been using that for a couple weeks now and had a couple of coffee dates with some girls. No super best friendships blossoming yet or anything, but it's gotten me out of the house and it seems promising.

I was over at my boyfriend's apartment the other day and I pulled out my phone to do some swiping during a commercial break. My boyfriend walks in and is like ""what the fuck are you doing?"" which annoys me that he's instantly jumping to conclusions even though it's clearly all girls on my screen. So I show him the app and explain it, and I swipe through a couple of girls to show him that it's not a dating thing, and of course with my luck a guy comes up in the queue. Occasionally guys will put their gender as female and try to get dates on the BFF mode...this is maybe 1% of the people on there, the rest is really just girls looking for friends. So my boyfriend gets even more upset, and I am annoyed because I feel like I haven't done anything wrong, so I tell him to look it up on the internet if he doesn't believe me. The evening pretty much ended after that and I went back to my place.

This morning he tells me that he's ""uncomfortable"" with me using the app because ""Bumble is a dating app"" and it would not take much effort to switch over to the dating mode. I don't think that logic really holds up because it wouldn't take much effort for me to download Tinder either...effort is not the obstacle that keeps me from cheating, I don't cheat because I'm not a cheater and I just want to make some new friends.

944,Not the A-hole,"(Using a shared throwaway account)

I'm in my early 20's, and I was living with my father while I attended college. My father suddenly passed away in a car crash early last year, so I was suddenly weighed down with a lot of expenses. I couldn't afford to live there alone (I wasn't paying him rent, I was offering alternative methods of payment like cooking, cleaning, shopping for him, etc), and on top of that, he didn't have life insurance so I had to eat the funeral costs.

During the funeral my mom (dad's ex-wife, it was a nasty divorce) offered to let me live with her until I can get back on my feet, since I would have to put college on hold until I could earn some more $. I agreed and moved in.

I was unable to find work for nearly six months. During my stay their, I took care of all the household chores -- I did 100% of the cleaning, cooking, shopping, and other errands like going to the post office or calling for maintenance appointments. I also did both of our laundry and dry cleaning, and made her bed/tidied her bedroom every day. 

I had access to the guest bedroom, of which I was not allowed to decorate nor was I allowed to have friends over. My mother would frequently (daily) barge in and did not let me keep the door closed. She would often demand my attention at any moment to rant at me about various things for several hours long -- I had zero privacy and was essentially her handmaiden for several months. (My therapist used the word ""covert incest"" and ""narcissistic personality disorder"" to describe the situation. I was a surrogate husband). She used this time to frequently bad-mouth my father around me, even though I told her often that I was still going through the grieving process and didn't want to discuss him.

After awhile, I suddenly got a job and was able to move out on my own. My mom is now claiming I owe her rent for the time I lived there. We HAD discussed rent briefly before I moved in, but she never gave me a quote, and even when I tried to follow up, she never asked me for the money until after I left. There was no ""official"" agreement.

I told my friend while venting I had no intention of paying. She says I would be an asshole for not paying, but my logic here is, I was essentially paying my rent with my time and effort. Not to mention, yes I had a bed to stay in, but I didn't really have a room or any privacy.

945,Not the A-hole,"I used a throwaway because I’m paranoid about my friends finding my main account. 

I recently moved from New Jersey to South Carolina. I’m going to be completely honest and say that I was extremely reluctant to move. The only reason I did is because with the cheaper cost of living, I will not be working full time and instead will be focusing on finishing my degree which I was unable to do in Jersey because I couldn’t afford to not work part time. My husband really didn’t like living in Jersey for various reasons, the cost and the cold winters being two of the biggest reasons. So we comprised. 

I never pictured myself living in the south. Ever. I don’t like the weather, the politics, how spaced out everything is, how slow everything moves; I didn’t think it would ever be for me. However I’m really trying to find things to love down here but it’s really hard when I don’t have any friends besides my husband and I haven’t started school yet so when he’s at work, I’m driving around trying to get to know the area, going to the gym and just generally trying to keep myself occupied however I’m home alone a lot and the depression is real. 

So my husband really tries to get me out of the house when he’s not at work. Plantations are very popular attractions down here. I went to one once when we visited his parents down here and I said I would never go again. It’s weird to walk around and stare at pretty old houses and flowers while almost entirely glossing over slavery and the horrible things that happened there. 

He thinks my refusal means I’m not trying and that I just need a reason to hate the south and southern people when honestly I just think it’s fucking weird and makes me uncomfortable.

946,Asshole,"OK, so I'll try to make this short.

My mother-in-law is planning a surprise birthday party for my father-in-law.  My wife got roped into helping set this up...specifically with decorations etc. (despite the fact that we live 2 hours away from my in-laws).  Mother-in-law asked my wife to spend $200+ on decorations for the party on our own credit card so my father-in-law wouldn't see it.  I told my wife that I wasn't comfortable doing this and she got all upset.

My points:
1) We're not a bank, we don't have unlimited amounts of money to loan out to people
2) My mother-in-law already owes us ~$75 for something else (from a couple weeks ago).
3) She lives 2+ hours away, so it's not exactly 'easy' to get money from her (she doesn't use venmo or anything).  
4) We've done things like this before, and she typically doesn't pay us back for several months.

AITA for saying no to this?

Edit: My wife and I have joint accounts for everything.  In general, we always talk to each other whenever we're spending money on something out of the ordinary (such as this).  If one or the other doesn't agree with the spending, then we don't...or compromise.  So this goes both ways.  Not just me dictating things to her.",43,59,0.89
947,Not the A-hole,"Every night our neighbors' kids have a running marathon from 9 p.m. to sometimes 11 p.m. It is extremely loud because it's an old building with hardwood floors.

 We have asked them civilly to stop running so late because we go to bed at 10 or sometimes just want to watch tv peacefully. Thing fall off of our shelves too. Every time they have responded with ""we have little kids, what are we supposed to do?"" We have told the landlord on 3 different occasions, and he has called them to request that they keep it down. Nothing has changed.

Last night I lost my temper with it and went up there and knocked on the door loudly. In prior instances they just don't answer the door, so this time I knocked very loud. When they answered I said this situation is out of control, rude, and ridiculous. I told them I don't understand why their kids are up so late, and why they are permitted to run so much. The dad said he would try to keep it down in a nice tone. The self righteous mom said ""we have little kids! What are we supposed to do! We are moving next month anyways!"" to which I said I don't care, that's your problem, and we have the right to the enjoyment of our property.

949,Not the A-hole,"Using a throwaway and I've read the sticky, this is a very personal post and not in any way political about gay rights or anything like that. 

My brother is one of those kids who we knew was gay from the time he could walk and talk. It's really no big deal and it's just who he is. However there are 4 kids total (I'm the oldest, 10 years separates all of us, brother in question is youngest) and this brother is the absolute golden child of the family. He has been in all manner of trouble; things like stealing almost $20,000 from our grandparents, armed robbery, drugs, aggravated DUI and on and on. However my parents have bailed him out at every single turn. He is also incredibly arrogant on top of all this and I can barely tolerate him. My two middle sisters have been really guilted by my parents into always being there for my brother and I've definitely become something of a black sheep because I just can't deal with him. Now that he's ""clean"" (which I seriously question) the family has been expected to rally around him. He's living with my parents and I have been going over for Sunday dinner so I'm not avoiding him by any stretch. 

There is a huge pride event in Bisbee, AZ and my family is expecting all of us to pack up, drive for 4 hours share an Airbnb with 7 adults and 2 kids all so we can watch my brother be in a parade, in addition to just sort of being around for the entire weekend. In addition to everything I mentioned above, I've very agoraphobic and I just don't enjoy crowds. My parents know this about me and still are insisting I go. They and my sisters are really trying to guilt me into saying basically that Philos has been clean for almost a year now and if we don't support him then we don't know how bad the fall may be. 

Then I got this little gem via text from my brother last night:

> ""So I heard you weren't going to Bisbee with us, well I want you to know if there were a weekend for homophobic, introverted pieces of shit that hate their own family, I would go to support you. Piece of shit.""

951,Not the A-hole,"This happened about 5 years ago, but it still sticks with me because of one person's reaction.  I'll try to keep it as brief as possible.  I went out with a group of friends to a bar in downtown Los Angeles.  We get inside, and while some of them go looking for a table I quickly head to the bar to grab a drink as I want to catch up with everyone else as they had been pre-gaming.  The bar tender (who I'll admit was a VERY attractive woman) takes my order, and when she brings me my drink tells me she loves my cologne and asks me what brand it is.  I told her it was Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male (the one that comes in a bottle shaped like a male torso).  I take my drink, go over to the table the group has found, and start drinking.  

&#x200B;

About an hour and a half later I get up to go to the bathroom (I've had about 3 drinks at this point).  On the way back I stop at the bar for another drink.  The same bar tender comes over to help me, I tell her what I want, but before she makes the drink she hands me a bottle of water (""on the house"" as she puts it) and a pen & paper.  I'm a bit stunned about the pen & paper so I ask her what they're for and she says ""oh, you know what I want"", and then walks away to make the drink.  I have absolutely no idea what ""oh, you know what I want"" means, but since she had been acting pretty flirty with me, and had straight up handed me a pen and paper, I figured she wanted my phone number.  I write my name and number on the paper, and when she comes back I hand it to her.  She takes a look at it and says  ""oh no, I wanted the name of your cologne.""  Pretty embarrassed, I apologize, take the paper back, and write the name of the cologne.  

&#x200B;

I then take my drink, go back to the table, and then tell my buddy about the embarrassment I just suffered.  His girlfriend and her female friend that they had brought along immediately start berating me, telling me that I shouldn't have hit on her like that, that I probably made her really, really uncomfortable, and that I should never hit on bar tenders or waitresses.  My response was that I wasn't hitting on her at all, I wasn't spitting game, and I friggin ASKED her what she wanted me to write down and SHE responded with that weird, cryptic answer. 

&#x200B;

 I am well aware that in many service industry jobs, the employees, ESPECIALLY female employees, are expected, or even required to flirt with the customers.  I've been to Hooters, I've been to Vegas, I know how the whole thing works.  But I had NEVER had one of them hand me a pen & paper completely unsolicited, let alone give an answer like this bar tender did regarding what she wanted.  I don't think I'm the asshole at all for misinterpreting her intentions given the way things went down, but I figured I would ask this sub.  So, AITA or not?",28,55,0.92
952,Not the A-hole,"My SO and I have been engaged for a while and we decided to set a date. It's over a year away and deliberately the week after school summer holidays midweek so It's quieter. The area we're getting married in is incredibly busy in peak times and my SO would hate any attention.

&#x200B;

We picked this date, asked our parents if it was an issue to speak up. No issues so we went ahead and booked. Fast forward a week and we get a message asking if we could move the wedding to within the school holidays to make it easier for the MIL who works in admin at a school. Speaking with my partner our instant reactions were ""absolutely not."" It's not the wedding we want. 

We explained this and got a reply asking to move it to the Friday a week later. We both winced a bit and i put forward that Friday lunchtimes are also likely to be busier and it's not what we'd really want.

Her dad replied again and asked if we could move it it would really help them.

I know my MIL is very unhappy in her work and probably doesn't want to stick her head above the parapet so hasn't asked for time off but i feel like your daughters wedding should be an exception, regardless of workplace rules/politics.

Of course if the choice was move the date or her Mum can't be there we'd move the date but i also feel like it's an unfair request, there was an opportunity to raise an issue, a small (<15 people) quiet wedding is what we both want more than anything.

We've also had offers from her dad to pay for the wedding and my Mum to pay for the honeymoon, neither of which we expected and my Mum's was given with the sole request of ""Do whatever you both please"" To the extent she didn't even expect an invite if we wanted to alope.

953,Asshole,"So I have this $20 bill that has this cool old design as it's the previous design from the 80's I believe. Then this morning I pull up to McDonald's, get a couple items, totalling to $5.01. I pull up to the window and give the lady my cool $20 bill and one penny, she holds it up to the light which I understood as it looks weird and I figured she's making sure it's legit. She puts it under the cash drawer, gives me my change back, I get my food and leave in a hurry (I was late to work.) 

As I'm driving trying to put the cash in my wallet I notice she gave me 2 $20 bills and a $5 bill. For a moment I was incredibly confused wondering if I just took money out of my wallet some how, I check the receipt and low and behold it says I paid with a $50. Now I was seriously about to turn around and go give the money back thinking this worker is probably freaking out realizing she just gave me $25 more than I was supposed to. But after some thinking I realized 

1. This girl probably didn't even notice as she put the the bill under the tray 
2. She probably won't get in trouble as I have worked in the food industry and they'll see she tendered a $50 and there's only a $20 under the drawer, most she'll get is a stern talking-to because mistakes happen and she clearly wasn't stealing the money 
3. McDonald's is a multi-million dollar company, this is a McDonald's I go to all the time and they have probably made hundreds of dollars off me alone, so what if I get $25 back.

So if I don't go back later today WIBTA?

EDIT: To the people saying this could be the one mistake that breaks it for her and leads to her getting fired, wouldn't me showing up and giving the money back not draw attention to the transaction that she messed up on? Would she not get in trouble whether I bring it back or not?  I feel not giving it back keeps the blame off one person, if I bring it back they know exactly who messed up. They're not going to let her off just because I brought it back, if she messed up she messed up.

EDIT2: I appreciate all the feedback and the many points I didn't take into account, I'll let you know what the verdict is when I get off work.

EDIT3: Even though my coworkers agree that there's no harm in keeping it, I've decided to take it back on my lunch break to try and get there while the cashier is still there. Y'all are ruthless but I appreciate it the feedback and the many points I didn't think of. I'll let you know how it goes.

FINAL EDIT: Well instead of going to return it on my lunch break, I instead had to call the bank for a charge that was disputed yesterday and after they agreed I shouldn't have received it, it was posted to my account today. I called and they said they couldn't refund more than one false charge a year. WTF?! So yeah I didn't get to return it because of the stupid bank, and I'm not going to. This lady probably didn't get in trouble and if she did for this happening multiple times, maybe she shouldn't be a cashier if she can't count money.  And to those saying ""but good karma!"" Well I just got fucked out of over $30 so I'll take that as karma paying me back.",160,111,0.9

On a few occasions, one of my classmates has hosted a party that all or almost all of us in sophomore year have gone to (some movie nights, a barbecue, etc). A few days ago, one of my closest friends in my program, Lauren, told me that Andrea, another girl in our year was having a party and I should come. So I said sure. Well, I arrive at Andrea's place and to my shock, it turns out that this is a party where a woman has come in to sell sex toys. I was a bit shocked to say the least, as I was not told this was the case. The saleswoman, Andrea and a few other classmates seemed a bit, well, unhappy to see me there. But I did not want to make things awkward and just walk out. So I sat there for 15 minutes or so while the woman talked about the products but at that point, I was feeling a bit nauseous and made an excuse about forgetting an assignment for my elective class that I had to go finish and left.

The thing is, I'm 20 and still a virgin, so being involved in something sexual that is so public is very awkward for me. I've also never discussed anything romantic with my classmates beyond ""I've been single for a long time."" Honestly, I couldn't stay without feeling nauseous about it all. I felt really blindsided. To be clear, I have no problems with my classmates buying or using sex toys if they choose to, but I just did not want to be involved.

Her daughter and my son are dating. We kept it to ourselves, but we were ecstatic. She's beautiful, hilarious and like another daughter me.

We both have very sex-positive families. Sex is not a taboo subject, especially now that they're adults. When they got serious, A went on birth control. During a discussion on planned parenthood, he mentioned that A went off it because of mood-swings, but she's not ready for sex yet. I'll admit I thought it was strange, but it's her choice.

The other day the two of us went on a run (yes, we are that close). A mentioned missing my son and insecurity about al the Brazilian women on the beach he'd be saying. **I told her that if she trusts him, she has nothing to worry about. He loves her and her probably misses her more because she's amazing.** She mentioned being worried he'd be bored and I gave her advice on what I do when my man is far away. I suggested that she puts some makeup on, get into something sexy and take ""pictures"".

Not long after my best friend and I were hanging out. We were talking about the vacation. I said I missed my husband. I told her I sent him some pictures and about the suggestion I gave her daughter. She lost it. She was fuming that I suggested her daughter take nudes and include her face in them. She was going off on me and calling me awful things.

I told her that her daughter is an adult and I'm not responsible for the choices she makes, I just gave advice.

She said that I'm an idiot if I don't think her daughter wouldn't take the advice ""an adult she trust like her own mother"" and run with it. She mad that I went ""you're insecure, here give him naked pictures with your face in it"" (which isn't the case)

I told her that we're both the grown ups there, I didn't force her daughter to do anything and it's advice I got from her. She told me to stop ""shut the fuck up about semantics"" and sex advice you give to young adults is different etc. That sending photo's to your husband is different than to your 19 year old boyfriend.

She's furious about the face thing especially, because of the shit can happen. I stand that regardless of my advice, her daughter is an adult who chose to include her face in pictures.

Then she called me a creep who valued my son's gratification over her daughters safety. I told her that she's infantilizing her daughter and said she isn't being as ""sex-positive"" as she says she is.

She said that sex-positive means making an informed choice, her daughter was not informed about the consequences of taking nudes. She said that I gave awful advice to an inexperienced girl to feel ""cool"". I told her to relax, because her daughter is old enough to take nude pictures and even do porn if she chose to.

She started screaming like a madwoman saying that her daughter does not want to star in porn and that's ""the fucking point"".

She then excused herself before she got physical. I feel like she grossly overreacted and going ""mama bear"" over a 19 year old is ridiculous. I love and care about my son deeply, but I don't doubt that his choices are his alone.

Edit: She's also furious I suggested that she text them to him, so he can look at them when he missed her. That telling her to purposefully give him pics to save was irresponsible. But isn't that the point of pictures?

**Edit: I am not involved in my sons sex life. This young woman approached me for advice. Her partner just happened to be my son. I gave the same unbiased advice I'd give to ANY adult. Because that's what she wanted.**

I work in the menswear department of a department store in New Zealand (I will leave the city unnamed due to the country itself being quite small and there only being few department stores nationwide).   
Two weeks ago (May 2019), I was cleaning the register and a customer approached me with a pair of mens underwear in hand. She asked if I was available to serve her and of course I obliged. She explained to me that she had purchased a pair of Ted Baker (designer brand) underwear during our February sale. They had a rip (not on the seam) and she was wanting to exchange them for a brand new pair. Our returns policy is very lenient and we generally aim to please the customer providing that said customer isn't try to pull one up on us. I asked if she had a receipt, she replied ""no I don't, sorry!"". I asked her if she had the box, a tag or even a screenshot of her internet banking indicating the transaction happened, and she wasn't able to provide anything at all. I then told her that we wouldn't be able to do an exchange without proof of purchase. She understood and was about to leave.   
One of my colleagues (Linda) appears and says ""oh! I can help you!"" and then she takes the customer away and  I observe her do the exchange I had just denied. The customer turns around to me and says ""your colleague is so helpful!"".  


I am fuming at this point. My colleague completely under-minded me and made me look incompetent. I told my one of my other colleagues (Jennifer) about it and she said ""yeah she'll do that to look good and get sales later"".   
Shortly after, I decided I wasn't going to to through the entire day irritated and annoyed, so I decided to confront Linda about it. I approached Linda and said ""hey, next time I'm with a customer discussing a return, do you mind not undermining me right in front of the customer and making me look like an idiot like you did just there?"" Linda profusely apologises and I walk away.   
Later on, my manager (Ben) approaches me and said, ""did you know Linda has been crying in the bathroom? You should apologise for what you said"". Confused at this point I responded ""oh, are you talking about the 3 month old underwear without a receipt I denied returning?"". To that Ben responded ""she was only doing the right thing by the customer, those type of returns are definitely a grey area"". I thought what I asked from the customer was completely reasonable, and my point I brought up with Linda was valid.

975,Not the A-hole,"I am the owner of said nail salon. 

Around a few weeks ago, I got a call from a customer panicking and asking if we see could find her wedding ring she left in our salon. 

I and the employees looked around but we could not find anything and I told her over the phone. She proceeded to explain that her wedding ring is worth $50,000 and I NEEDED to find the ring or she was going to call the police. 
We did a walk around the store again and I could not find it. I told her that again over the phone. 

She then said I had to check every bodies pockets and bags including employees to see if any of them stole her ring. I told her this is a family business, every employee here is part of my family and I am 100% sure none of them stole her rings. I also said I’m not checking any of my customers bags or pockets and she can head down here and try and find it herself. 

She said she was heading down there right now and after our phone call she was going to call the police. I told her she can go ahead and do that. 

As she was coming to the salon I walked around the store again and saw rings on a table a customer was sitting at that I thought belonged to said customer. I asked if the rings were hers and she said no they were already at the table when she came. 

I grabbed them just as the customer on the phone came in and told her I found them. She yanked the rings out of my hand and said she was going to call the police back and tell them not to come and left the salon. 

I thought that was the last I’d hear from her but today she came in and I told her I was denying business by the way she acted. I told her she had no business accusing a family owned business of stealing her belongings and she had no authority to tell me to check my employees/customers pockets and bags. I also told her I understood she was panicking because her rings are expensive, and well it’s her wedding ring but before you accuse someone or threaten to call the police, come down and try and find the item first. 

This is not a validation post. She told me I was being too harsh and left a review. My friends and family don’t think I’m wrong but I’m trying to see the customers POV. What do you think?",290,1416,0.95
976,Not the A-hole,The story starts a couple years ago when I didn’t feel like driving my sportier car in the winter. So I bought a beater for about $400 and and a couple hundred dollars in parts and fixed it up. Used it for a little while but eventually sold my sportier car and bought something more practical. My little brother at the time was looking for a job but didn’t have a way to get there. So i told him if he got a job he could use the beater since I really didn’t have much use for it anymore. After he had been working for a while I just gave the car to him. If something came up I would help him with it but I told him that it was his car and his responsibility now. Fast forward to today the car is 27 years old now and basically falling apart. I told him that he really needs to save up some money and buy something more reliable because that car is not going to last forever. Well then I see that him and my dad have been watching videos on building gaming PC’s and what parts to buy and so on. I told him it wasn’t a good idea because he really needs reliable transportation and not a new gaming PC. He went and bought the PC anyways. Well earlier today I hear him outside trying to start his car and it just isn’t starting. Then I hear him come inside and walk over to my room. He asks me if I can give him a ride to work and I refused. I told him to ride his new gaming PC to work. Now my father is mad at me and we have been arguing all day about how I am a jerk for refusing to give him a ride. Even though I warned him that the beater car could be junk tomorrow.,35,131,0.97
977,Asshole,"I just got into a huge fight with the wife because I was reluctant to call in sick after finding out she's tweaked her back.  She was over at a friend's house and had a back spasm.  Friend gave her a couple advil.  She was able to drive home and walk up the stairs to the house, I got her to lie down.  She seems able to move around, just has pain in her lower back and trouble bending.  Her back has been an ongoing issue lately. 

She basically told me I have to call in sick tomorrow but I was reluctant to do so.  I get 50 hours of paid sick time per year but I dont like using it, don't like calling in to my boss and making excuses.  I'm a telecom technician. I broke my leg last year and am still recovering, I'm on a modified schedule and dont have as much physical labor as I normally would and get fewer jobs assigned to me.   Because of this I've been feeling less valued at the company which plays into my reluctance to call in sick.  We have a 2 year old daughter, she's very active during the day, and a 12 year old who's with his dad this week. 

Essentially she needs to take care of a toddler for 10 hours while I'm gone, and her mother was already planning to come over for about 3 hours to help out, she'd be here between 11 and 2.  

Am I an asshole for asking her ""so... do I absolutely have to call in?""

Edit:  well, I guess I'm an asshole, fair enough.  Just to let people know, I'll update... first of all, surprising as it is, I've actually looked after my toddler before.  It's not that bad.  She plays with stuff, you feed her stuff, she makes messes.  I wasnt expecting wife to clean up and chase after the kid, I was just hoping they would survive while I went to work...  And arent you supposed to keep moving and doing things if you have back spasms?  

Anyway, I called in sick.  I've been up with the baby since 7am, didnt really have to do much.  Fed her some food, let her play with her toys, let her watch Max and Ruby, followed her around while she played in the garden.  Wife seems ok.  She says her back is much better today, and feels bad because I probably could've gone to work.  

Either way, it's nice to have a day off I suppose.

980,Not the A-hole,"So this story took place about a year ago, when the horror film ""A Quiet Place"" was in theaters. I'm only posting it here now because my wife and I have gotten starkly different opinions from the people who have heard it, and they actually seem to be based mostly along gender lines. (The men who have heard this story think I was justified, while the women don't.) So I'm curious what you think.

My wife (23F) and I (25M) were out at the theater one night, seeing ""A Quiet Place,"" which is a movie that loud audience members can easily ruin. Unfortunately, our showing had those. The theater was probably about 1/3rd full, but there were three teenage boys, sitting in a back corner, talking and laughing quite loudly. Lots of people were turning to look at them, but nobody was doing anything. After a couple of minutes, I was getting pretty annoyed too. I wanted to solve the problem as quickly and cleanly as possible, so I said, loud enough to be heard, ""hey, can you guys shut the fuck up, please?"" One of the kids said, ""sorry!"" an audience member up front laughed, and then all was quiet.

For a while, it worked. The kids were dead silent for a solid half hour, but they eventually eased back into their original volume - even going so far as to rip loud farts and burst into laughing fits. Again, the audience members were turning around and were clearly annoyed, but nobody was doing a thing. So I did.

As quietly as I could, I got up from my seat (already near the back of the theater) and made my way to the kids in the very back. My wife grabbed at my arm, but I was already up and moving, so I pulled it away. I bent down when I reached the kids and quietly whispered, ""Hey guys, you're way too loud back here. It's a problem. Next disruption you make, I'm gonna go find someone and get you kicked out."" They whispered their apologies back to me, I went back to my seat, and the kids didn't make a peep for the remaining hour-plus of the movie.

When the movie ended, I was surprised to learn that my wife was really upset with me. She agreed that the kids were obnoxious and ruining the movie for everyone, but she was mad that I confronted them. Apparently she was embarrassed when I told them to shut up, and she got really scared when I went over to the kids because she thought I might try and fight them or something. (I should note that I have literally never been physically aggressive with anybody in my life.) I maintained that the problem was clear, the solution was clear, and someone had to do it. I did concede to her, however, that I probably should have warned her beforehand that I was going to get up and talk to the kids, and I apologized to her quite thoroughly for that. But still, the disagreement about my actions remains over a year later.

So, what do you think? Was I the asshole, or did I just do what needed to be done?",61,75,0.93
981,Not the A-hole,"Original post had 14,000 characters because i'm fuming mad about this situation.

&#x200B;

To make it short and simple for Reddit it boils down to this:

My niece moved in with me to escape her parents because they are trying to get her back on the right path in life and continue her college education and avoiding drugs, but she wants to just do whatever she wants and is tired of being told what to do. She is 19 and legally an adult, no one can FORCE her to do anything she is unwilling to do, so I decide to take her in hoping to give her some advice without trying to directly control her and just hope she might start listening to me because i'm trying to help her instead of directly rebelling against her controlling parents.

&#x200B;

However, it doesn't work out that way. I give her a few very simple rules for living here. Keep the doors in the house closed (there are reasons I wont get into), keep the gate at the front of the property shut, don't make too much noise (she loves listening to loud ass music), and don't bring any drugs or weapons onto my property. That's it. That is literally all I asked of her in exchange for living here.

&#x200B;

Well fuck me I guess because she started breaking every rule I had immediately. She started leaving doors open all over the house, even once leaving the front door open. I mean who the hell even does that? Just leaves the front door open? It was letting the cool air out and letting bugs inside and the dogs could've ran outside unsupervised. She also left the gate open numerous times. I haven't seen any drugs, but I haven't exactly been snooping either, however I did catch her playing with an assault rifle-looking BB gun and told her to leave that in her car, I don't want it in the house or used on my property. She argues about it ""not being a weapon"" for a while but finally relents and agrees. Today I find it in her room when I was looking for her (to complain about her leaving the front door wide open), so she disregarded that too.

&#x200B;

She lies to me constantly, on a daily basis, about literally everything. I can't detail it all because that's how I hit a 14,000 character count in my first post, but i'm sick to death of it. She also begged me to let her get a dog, I said NO, I do not want a dog in the house and I tell her that she is an irresponsible dog owner and shouldn't have a dog. I said this because she is 19 now, and since 18 years old she bought then abandoned 2 other dogs. A couple of days ago she just comes home with one anyway.

&#x200B;

Im tired of this shit. I'm tired of her. I want her gone. She has somewhere to go if I kick her out and she also has her parents' house, so it isn't like she'd be on the street. But i'm strongly considering kicking her ass out tomorrow.

&#x200B;

Edit: Some people are getting this mistaken impression I thought i'd be better parents than her parents. While that would easily be true, her parents are horrible people, that isn't why I let her stay with me. She was determined to leave her parents regardless. She had already made up her mind. I let her stay with me because between the options of her being in my home where I could somewhat keep an eye on her vs her living with some strangers who knows where, I judged it to be safer for her and more reasonable to give her a chance to live with me instead. I didn't think i'd turn her into a functional adult over night, I just didn't expect her to deliberately disobey every rule I put in place out of spite because we have always had a good relationship and she has never behaved this way, she has even stayed here over holidays before for a week or so and never had an issue.

&#x200B;

Edit 2: I'm helping her load her stuff into a uhaul right now and afterwards she'll be driving off to her new place. She is officially no longer living here as of now. Thankfully it all went down without any confrontation. We talked for a bit and she agreed to leave because she was unhappy with the arrangement and having to keep doors and the gate closed and she wants that dog. As of now, it's no longer my problem. I just hope the best for her as well as that poor puppy. Only solace I take is in knowing the last 2 dogs she abandoned found actual good owners after the fact, so it all worked out in the end. I can only hope if/when she bails on this one, it will also find a good home.",204,1211,0.95

My aunt got me into the company we both work for and we are currently in the same position. There is only one way for us to grow in our company and as such we talked about how we both wanted to eventually move up and I even flat out asked her if she was going to be ok if I applied for any promotions and she said that it was fine. Well the time came sooner than either of us anticipated when we both got a call yesterday from our manager to notify us that a position unexpectedly opened and they would be having interviews today and making a decision tomorrow. I was ecstatic and immediately called her with the news and that's when everything changed. She didn't know I was getting interviewed too and she was acting really off. I could tell she wasn't happy and eventually after 10 mins of beating around the bush I flat out asked her if she was upset I was being interviewed. And that's when she told me that she would quit if I got promoted before her. Not that she would quit if she didn't get promoted... only if I got promoted before her. So if somebody else got the job it was fine.  I asked her if she wanted me to rescind my acceptance for the interview and she said no but it was all really passive aggressive for the rest of the conversation before it was finally so awkward that I got off the phone. 

We had interviews today and I wished her luck and I told her I would be happy if either one of us got the job. And I called her after our interviews  to see how it went for her and we both felt good about it. However, she kept asking me questions to get info on my interview but was really secretive and wouldn't answer my questions... 

I love my aunt but I really want this job. But half of me wants for her to get it just so that I dont have to keep worrying about us having to compete  every time a similar position opens. 

So AITA? Part of me thinks so because she helped get me the job and she's my aunt and my elder but I'm conflicted because I SPECIFICALLY asked her before this promotion even came up if she would be ok if I went after promotions and she said yes! 

TLDR: Aunt and I both interviewed for the same promotion. She helped me get into the company in the first place.

I’m waiting to reply. I feel pretty fucking offended by the whole thing. First because she knows I would never ever be down for that kind of thing. Second because she’s really thinking she can come around my fairly radical queer friends and pedal this shit. Third because the non butchy comment hits a nerve.

We've been together for 4 years now, I've met her family multiple times (they live about 9 hours away) and we all seem to get along fine. When Veronica first moved here she was living in a really bad place, so I offered to have her move in with me, so she did after 3 months dating. My folks liked her so much that when we went on a family vacation we took her with us to an all inclusive resort in Mexico, as well as multiple excursions. We paid for all of it, she or her family didn't pay a dime. It wasn't a big deal, we have money, we like her and her folks were super grateful for 1) ""Saving"" her from the shitty place she was living and 2) treating her well and taking her on a vacation, including her in the family. 

Now a few years later, out of no where my girlfriends sisters decide to plan a family vacation. All well and good, Veronica and I have been planning to do a vacation to Mexico for a while now so I figure we could all go together...only I find out they don't want me there. Veronica wants me there but they say its a ""family vacation."" In fact, when she said she wanted me to join they left her on read for half a day and seemed pretty annoyed by it. Obviously I'm upset. She will be spending most of my money (I make about double what she does), we've been planning to go just us for about a year and being so openly excluded despite what we have done for her is a massive slap in the face. I'm not saying that they owe us, not at all and I never thought about it as a repay me sort of deal, but I still feel its sorta unfair that she will be off enjoying a resort while I'm left at home.

When someone posts here, we're only getting one side of the story. There could be nuances and context that we aren't seeing because the post is from one perspective. I notice some commentors that act as though the OP is a Disney villain for being TA or acting as though the other party is the embodiment of evil. Though there are some cases where it is more obvious which party is in the moral right, real life is complicated and it's disappointing to see people rush to a hard-set judgment when morality is much more complicated than that.

There are also the posters that get defensive when people disagree with them. I understand that being called TA might feel like an attack and some commentors can leave pretty bitter replies. However, it becomes obvious when someone is just seeking validation when they shut down ANY criticism whether or not it is valid. 

I also understand that posts can come across harsher than intended. Conveying meaning through text is difficult, especially with the terminology. Just because you're TA doesn't automatically mean you're a wicked monster- you're just in the wrong in this situation.

Her MOH is currently pregnant and will be either at 41 weeks or have given birth  by bachelorette weekend. She’s expressed that she’d still come out though, baby in arms if need be.

The bachelorette will definitely include going out and drinking and dancing, and it will probably be a wild night. The MOH would still be invited to dinner beforehand and brunch the morning after, but not the actual partying.

She’s still on our insurance, but it doesn’t cover much, if anything, when it comes to the care she needs, so my husband and I end up footing the bill for her appointments, treatment stays, etc.

It’s been years of dealing with this, and at this point, my entire family is exhausted. My daughter has expressed guilt for costing us so much money, and every time she swears that this will be her last time going away for help, but a couple months pass and we end up right back where we started. She promises that she’s trying, but I’m starting to doubt that. If she were, obviously something would have clicked or changed by now.

My other children have had to have their lives be put on the back burner because my eldest daughter has taken priority with her issues, and I don’t feel like it’s fair to them. At this point, I wonder if it’s time to step back and just let my daughter figure this out for herself.

WIBTA if I stopped financially supporting my daughter until she proves that she can stay in solid recovery for a significant amount of time? I don’t want my daughter to die, but at this point, I feel like there’s nothing I can do to help her anymore. I’m at the end of my rope.

EDIT: She has a treatment team consisting of a therapist, dietitian, psychiatrist, and primary care physician that she sees weekly/bi-weekly. That just doesn’t seem to be enough for her for long periods of time.

EDIT 2: We’ve looked into getting her on Medicaid, yet none of her providers and practically zero treatment facilities take it, so even if she had it, it wouldn’t be of any use. I did not consider having her apply for disability. I’ll bring that up to her.",322,349,0.91

998,Asshole,"Hi everyone, I stayed at an Airbnb that is pet friendly (dog bowls included) but strictly has a no pets on the couch rule advertised. They say they will charge $60 per hour for deep cleaning if they find it's been broken. Here is my argument, the living room is maybe 300 square feet and the couch is a HUGE sectionional. There is a small piece of living room in front of the couch filled with a huge coffee table. There is barely any room in the apartment besides the couch. It is not practical to keep two dogs off the couch the entire trip, especially when we are out of the unit as there is almost nowhere else to go. 

The sectional is so big I can't even cover it all with a blanket. I covered two sections with a blanket the best I could. Anyway, the place was in perfect condition besides some dog hair on the couch which I vacuumed before leaving. After the trip, the host says they found dog hair on the couch and will charge for deep cleaning. I tell them it's not a fair rule because in a small apartment it's impossible to keep two dogs off the couch.  They need a smaller couch so there is room for dogs or a cover that can be used. 

I agreed to the rule as stated and knew about it in advance, but I did not know the size of the sectional. I literally don't know how I could keep both dogs off the couch when I left the apartment. They would both basically have to stay in the same spot on the ground by the entrance and not move. I tried my best to cover it and when I was home I wouldn't let them stay on it, but of course they would try to jump up sometimes. 

Please note there was NO damage or issue, only dog hairs which I had already vacuumed. Am I the asshole for letting them on the couch and would I be the asshole for leaving a bad review?",72,49,0.82
999,Asshole,"My sister is in her last year of high school and she wants to enter an Arts and Design specialty in her college of choice, but she needs to achieve a certain grade in order to be eligible for acceptance. I went to the college to ask for this certain grade and it turned out to be achievable. The problem is, my sister has never really tried anything seriously regarding her studies in the past, she used to fail one or more subjects each year. This is the first year where she is putting in effort in her studies and has actually managed to more or less finish studying the whole curriculum before going to the exam (something she never done before). 


However, My sister is the type of person that if she has one page left in the book and a month to finish this page, she will procrastinate till the end of the month and then end up not being able to finish it. Acting on my knowledge of her behaviour (which is very similar to me actually, i just know how to control this behaviour and keep it in check) i told her a higher cut-off grade for her specialty and since then, she has been working at double the effort. The exams are next week though and she's starting to doubt she'll ever do good, seeing that she regularly did bad at previous years. She thinks this year will just be more of the same and just today she broke down crying to my mom telling her about how she didn't expect the needed grade to be this high, my mother was weirded out by this because she knows this specialty is relatively easy to get into. Mom came to talk to me about this and i told her the whole thing.

Upon learning about my plan and seeing that i've took it upon myself to go through with it without consulting her first, she lost her mind at me, telling me i made a grave mistake and telling me to go tell her the truth. But i think that even if she thinks what i did was wrong, telling my sister the truth in this tense week will just make her relax more than usual and it's guaranteed she won't study a single word this week before the exam. 

Am i the asshole for coming up with this plan and acting on it behind my parent's back? I did what i wished people did for me, to push me further. My parents are the type of people that accept mistakes with an open heart, but they never really teach how you to improve yourself and not repeat those mistakes, they're very content with mediocrity. I've had to do this for myself all throughout medschool and i'm just trying to improve my  sister in return because God knows my parents won't be able to do that.

1000,Everyone Sucks,"*Edit*: he left me, saying that seeing me gain weight was more “exciting” to him than seeing me lose it.

I (29F) and my fiancé (30M) have been together for almost 10 years. In that time, I’ve gone from 300 pounds to 130 and then back up to 150 due to an injury keeping me less active.

My soon to be husband has stayed about the same weight this entire time. When I began my weight loss journey he would join me at the gym and diet with me, he soon fell off the wagon and went back to an unhealthy eating style. He’s not obese but he does have a few extra pounds. I’ve never minded and it hasn’t affected our relationship in any way.

However, my latest gain has been quite recent. I was cleared by my doctor for physical activity last week, but with the schedule I have I haven’t been able to make it to the gym.

This morning, I was struggling to button up some pants, and my fiancé verbatim said “yeah I would just stop trying if I were you, you’re just getting fat again.” I couldn’t believe my ears. I just started yelling, called him fat and called him out on his daily laziness. He knows I’ve been injured and he knows I’ve been insecure about my recent weight gain.

I apologized a little while later but he just shrugged it off and hasn’t been talking to me. I know what I did was wrong but I don’t think he has a right to ignore me at this point..

1006,Not the A-hole,"Hi all. 

My daughter Lucy is 22. She is an accountant working for a big firm in London, having graduated uni top of her class last year and is working towards getting her chartered status. 

Last Saturday she went on a night out with her friends and nothing seemed to be the problem. But today I was scrolling through facebook and noticed something. Lucy and several other people (some of whom I know as friends of hers, were tagged in a large video post. I had a look, and it showed a group of about 30-40 young people in a supermarket car park at night. They were drinking and smoking what appeared to be cannabis joints and were playing music loudly. They had a car there and were taking it in turns to swerve it and drive it around the area at high speeds. I could clearly see Lucy and her girl friends in the group.

A second video showed a police officer shouting at the group, and they all responded - including Lucy -  by shouting verbal abuse and threats at him. Whoever was in the car even accelerated towards the officer to make him go back. 

I don't know what happened next. Lucy got home OK and seemed perfectly fine the next morning (minus a hangover). 

When Lucy got home from work I showed her the video and demanded to know what she was thinking. She said the gathering was ''a laugh'' and doesn't have any regrets ''Nobody got hurt'' she said to me. Her mum was just as angry. Obviously Lucy isn't a school kid so we can't ground her or anything like that. We did give her a stern talking to but in response she had a huge crying tantrum saying we were trying to control her and stop her having fun. 

In response to this we told her to pack her bags and get out. She cried even more at this and stormed out without taking anything. 

We phoned her a few times but she didn't answer. I got a phone call half an hour ago from the mum of Lucy's best friend Tina, saying that Lucy was going to stay at their place tonight. From her tone of voice it seemed like she thought it was wrong of us to kick her out. 

We both love Lucy but to be honest her behaviour has driven us to this point. She is very smart and career focused but at home is very lazy. She expects her mum and I to cook for her and clean up after her, and at times shouts at us if food isn't ready quick enough. She commutes to work but if she's going anywhere else she expects us to drop whatever we are doing and give her a lift. We have suggested she learn to drive but she has stated that she won't commit to driving lessons unless we promise to buy her a car straight away. We also pay her phone bill. 

I don't think I did the wrong thing by telling her to get out, but my wife has been crying and telling me to phone Lucy and let her come home. I think having to spend the night homeless might just be a wakeup call that this can't continue.",58,41,0.82
1007,Update,"[OP here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/boglvq/aita_for_considering_breaking_up_with_my/)

I made the post 22 days ago and I have a small update to it. I made the post with some heavy jet lag, having flown to visit my GF across the pond. I was tired after the long flight on top of other stress, 2 people and a dog stuck in one small room with lots of strangers in a foreign country and I didnt speak the language. Yes that is stressful. The dog is a husky border collie mix that was rescued off the street in Romania. On top of the shedding he didn't like me and didn't listen to me after a few days. At times he would growl at me coming around him or my GF. 

Then a few days after my post I left where we were staying with my GF and her dog to go to her place. There I was able to sleep in, have space, have time to think and de-stress. I saw a video on my GFs computer of her dog at the shelter. He was happy to see the people at the kennel and he was looking forward to attention/food from them. After that video it made me realize that he was new to the situation and not scared or aggressive like I thought he was as my GF only had him for a few weeks when I first met him. I went through the trick routine that my GF went through with him, rewarding him with cheese, for several days. Then I started walking him on my own. By the end of my trip he was excited for me to even put my hand on his leash, he followed my commands, and we became best buds. My GF even has good picture of him cuddling with me on the couch. Now that I am back home her dog has been mopping around and laying in the chair that I was sitting in most of the time and I miss him. We were rough housing at one point. I was playing on all 4s when he crawled underneath me and rolled over to expose his belly and neck to me, a completely submissive move on his part.


**TLDR** Made my OP out of stress, had time to calm down, me and the dog are best friends now. I miss the little fur ball.

I go to the club a few times a month, sometimes it's a cover charge with a ticket costing $15-20, sometimes it'll be free entry with RSVP. This particular night was free.

There's a bar there, of course, for serving drinks. However, they do not serve tap water, instead you have to pay $5-6 for a small (not even 16.9 oz - it's 330ml/11.5 oz) bottle of Fiji water. They also rig the faucets in the bathrooms to only give warm water, so you can't refill a water bottle unless you want to drink warm water. Also, expectedly, you can't bring a water bottle in.

So, the bartender has to just reach behind him and grab a water bottle. I don't even remember if they were room temp or kept cold - I want to say the former. Because all they have to do is reach behind them, AITA for not tipping a dollar on the water bottle?",37,35,0.87

A few weeks ago I was introduced to a friend of a friend, let's call her Polly. I'm a paranoid schizophrenic, and the mutual friend who introduced us told me that Polly was too. Smashing, I thought, someone who gets it. Don't get me wrong, my friends and family are beautiful, understanding people, but I thought it'd be nice to finally have someone to talk to who has firsthand experience. 

No such luck. It became apparent to me rather quickly that Polly was lying. Suspicions initially arose for me when inconsistencies popped up in how she described her symptoms: first she claimed to have only auditory hallucinations, then she claimed to have both auditory *and* visual ones; first she said she'd had symptoms since she was 10, then they didn't start til she was 16. I kinda let that slide because hey, everyone's experience is different, sometimes symptoms *are* inconsistent and people make mistakes with info. But then there started to be other things. She told two different people that she'd been diagnosed at two different ages and gave two entirely separate stories about how she *got* the diagnosis. What sealed it for me was when she started talking about her ""new meds"". I asked her what she was on, and she said lithium. Now, lithium *is* sometimes used in treating schizophrenia, but it's pretty ineffective by itself and is used as a sort of add-on to antipsychotics, rather than being used as the sole treatment. I asked what else she was on and she said nothing, just lithium. 

I called her out on it, then and there. We were in a group of friends at the time. She tried to defend herself at first, so I pulled up the studies that showed the ineffectiveness of lithium as a standalone schizophrenia treatment and the need for it to be paired with antipsychotics. She admitted to lying, then started crying and said she only did it to seem interesting. I was pretty annoyed and told her that it's not on and there's no excuse and it's actually kind of offensive to those of us who *have* the disorder to pretend you have it to seem quirky and different.

I agreed, but at this point I assumed we would stay friends or get back together. 

My ex proceeded to begin publicly seeing another girl a week later, no word about the cat. I picked up the remainder of my stuff from him a month after the breakup, no word about the cat. I went on a trip out of the country and while there, my ex posted on social media that he was officially in a relationship with the girl he had been seeing (and who, at this point, I'm fairly confident he had cheated on me with). I was tipsy, drinking wine and enjoying my vacation in Spain, and my friends kept sending me photos of them together being like ""oh my godd"" and I didn't want to see it anymore. I was feeling petty and wine drunk and 'laugh reacted' to this relationship status. 

My ex blocked me on all social media after I did this. In turn, I blocked his number for peace of mind. Since then, my best friend who is our mutual friend has also blocked me for no apparent reason. It has been upwards of 3 weeks since he blocked me. Today my dad approached me saying that my ex texted him, saying he made a vet appointment for the cat tomorrow and he would be there to pick him up in the morning. 

After 2 months of no contact regarding the cat, plus the blocking on all forms of social media, I had pretty much assumed the cat was mine. In my opinion, he lost the right to contact me about anything, including the cat, after blocking me. Blocking someone from contacting you implies that you do not intend to speak to them, ever again!! And all of a sudden, he wants to come take the cat that MY FAMILY has financially supported and grown attached to for a year? 

So I called him and he got upset, claiming I couldn't just keep his cat and it isn't fair. But I feel as though he doesn't have the cat's best interest in mind. He's willing to uproot the animal for completely selfish reasons from a home where he has lived for a year, with other cats to play with, a stable financial environment where he will always have what he needs. My family is not okay with giving the cat back to him. 

Am i wrong for believing his chance to make plans regarding our cat was when he blocked me from contacting him in any way?

EDIT: I was told I should add some info -  
My ex did not live with me and my family. Last year, he moved back home from an apartment, but since his family was allergic, we decided the cat could stay with my family until the two of us moved into our own place together. The original arrangement was that the cat would stay with my family for a few months- it has been a year.

The cat is 3 years old. He got him about 5 or 6 months before we started dating. The cat probably doesn't even remember a time that i wasn't around. I personally did not financially contribute to the cat for the 1.5 years he wasn't at my house - however I did watch the cat/take care of him as needed. Then for the past year my parents have assumed full financial responsibility. My ex has not provided food, litter, or anything. The only financial assistance was the vet appointment to get him shots and fixed before he even moved into my house. In addition he did not try to contact me at all regarding the cat since the day we broke up and I said I could keep him for a bit. I wasn't anticipating 2 months of no contact at all, just waiting around for him to decide what to do...",157,177,0.93
1025,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because my sister knows my Reddit. 

I’m getting married next year and I’m so excited about it. My fiancé has all his groomsmen picked out, and I’m in the process of asking my bridesmaids. I’d also have liked to include my twin cousins E and A in the bridal party, as we were always so close growing up. A is a guy and lives a few hours away. E is FTM, which I’m sad to say plays a major role in this AITA. 

I drove out two weeks ago to visit A and ask if he’d be willing to be a part of the bridal party. I put together a box of goodies, and a card that said “Will you be a part of my Bride Tribe?”, deliberately not trying to use the word bridesmaid. He was excited and we talked a little bit about expectations/plans for how his and E’s ties/pocket squares would match the bridesmaid dresses. I specifically asked him not to mention anything to E because I wanted it to be a surprise.

Fast forward to this weekend and I meet E for lunch. I give him the same little box of goodies with the same card. E’s reaction didn’t go as I expected. He got really angry, accusing me of wanting to “fit him back into a feminine bridesmaid mold” despite his transition. I tried to explain that I’d picture him and his brother wearing color coordinated suits, but I didn’t get the chance because he kept talking over me. I feel like he went off the deep end. He called me bigoted, asked why I wanted him to support a wedding that would only end in a divorce, called me “basic” and adhering to stupid sexist traditions. He left without giving me a chance to really explain.

I guess today E finally calmed down and talked to his brother who must have explained because he sent me a text message apologizing and saying he’d be in the bridal party. I drafted a text message saying basically that while he’s still invited to the wedding, given his feelings towards me, it’s best if he isn’t a part of the bridal party. My fiancé says I should do whatever makes me comfortable, but my mom seems to think I’m being to harsh on E and should have seen this misunderstanding coming. She says I should be more understanding, considering the abuse/discrimination he must face. She says I should give E a second chance and if I don’t it will cause all kinds of family drama.

Would I be the asshole if I refuse to let him be a part of the wedding party?

ETA: 
Wow, I cannot believe how much this blew up. So I’m going to clarify a few things here in hopes that it addresses your questions.

E sent me a text apologizing. His apology was for “snapping at me”. He admitted he was wrong and it was “totally out of line” and now that he talked to A he knows what I meant and would be in the wedding party “if I’d have him”. Nothing specific was mentioned, and I haven’t sent any response yet. 

A also did call me this evening, but I was out to dinner and missed his call. I called him back but right now we seem to be playing phone tag.

ALSO, E is a man. He uses the pronouns he/his/him. Just because he may have been an asshole/acted out of anger does not give ANYONE license to misgender him. If you want me to take you seriously, use the correct pronouns for E.",1969,17661,0.85
1026,Not the A-hole,"My fiance and I got engaged about 7 months ago and we have been through a lot over 4 years of dating but have always found a way through it even with a pretty significantly long ""break"" in the middle of our relationship. We have moved on from the past and there are no problems there. Long story short, her mother goes out to an event with her family without us and invites a man my fiance cheated on me with (Keep your thoughts on cheating to yourself) . The mother says he was her last resort and she had to have someone. As my future mother-in-law I felt extremely betrayed and felt as though she didn't give a shit about me or her daughter. We were both very angry towards her mother and the mother said ""I don't see why it's a big deal since you both are over what happened."" Implying that we weren't actually over it. This made us much more angry to the point where we cut her out of our lives for about 2 weeks before she texted me while she was drinking and said ""Be careful, she's only with you for the money, don't say I didn't warn you."" I replied with ""Shut the fuck up"" and blocked all communication with her. My fiance and I split rent and both work full time, so the mother was referring to my parents money which is more than average but not overly substantial. They take us on a trip or 2 a year but make me rely on myself the majority of the time.

I told her about when my husband and I told our young child, five at the time, that we were Martians and we had to leave Mars because it was destroyed by an earthquake.

When he was seven, he came home from school, walked in the door and immediately told us we were stupid. We asked him what was wrong and he told us that he found out that we're not Martians we're Earthlings. Both of our kids are adults now and we have a great time recounting the story and they think it's extremely funny. 

After sharing the story with my coworker, she looked at me wide-eyed and was completely appalled telling me that it was a dick move and abusive to the child with lifelong trust issues, etc. For reference, I'm 50 and my coworker is 25ish and has a six-year-old child, so I understand that now people have a very different view on how to play around with their children, but she said it was the same as beating them with a belt. 

I full-on belly laughed and now she's mad.

But I just discovered that my wife has been planning a surprise bday (a few weeks away). I am not supposed to know about it, one of my friends blew the surprise, but I really want to say something to her about how I don't want the party at all. I understand that it is a kind gesture, and I do appreciate what she is doing, but I feel like if it was really ""for"" or ""about"" me, she would have paid attention the past many years when I've expressed what I really like to do on my birthday. I'm also a fairly ""homebody"" type person, so a party about me is already giving my some anxiety. I can be more extroverted, but even then I usually have to wake up that morning in the right mood to be around that many people.

1033,Not the A-hole,"using a throwaway since my ex knows my regular reddit. 

Way back-ground: last fall my ex-boyfriend and purchased a European trip through a student travel company. Full on planned to fly on the same flights, we were going to camp, overnight Euro-rail and hostel but we did book a couple nights in airbnbs and a really cool old hotel in Switzerland. 

In April I caught him cheating red handed. I mean I didn't catch him in the act but I saw some texts from a girl we know then saw her coming out of his apartment in a total walk of shame of moment at like 5AM as I was stopping by to bring him breakfast before I started my clinical that day. He still denies it but now that are dating, so yeah...deny all you want asshole. 

So at first he told me he wasn't going to Europe and I was like fine I'll go by myself. My dad offered to help me out with the more expensive places to stay so I was all set to go. Then my ex thought he could bully me out of going by buying his new girlfriend tickets on all the same flights then insisting I change the reservations on the hotels and Airbnb to his name. 

At first I thought it would just be too awkward so I tried to return or change my flights and it was just such a pain in the ass I got frustrated and hung up. Then last week, I had an epiphany that I didn't mess anything up and I should not have to be the one to both miss out and incur extra expense at the last minute to change stuff. I'm going. 

Ex is so pissed at me. He says that he'll pay for my ticket changes and that me being on the same flight as them is going to make it so awkward for him (as far as I know our seats are still together and I'm not moving mine...good luck to him) and that the ""nicer"" thing is to change my ticket since he would have to change two tickets instead of just one. He asked what to do about the hotel and I said well that's a no go but since the Airbnb's are two room he and his new girl can sublet from me. This made him so furious that I thought he was going to punch the wall of my apartment. 

I will openly admit after him being such a jerk, part of me is really wanting to make him suffer through the awkwardness and yes I'm being vindictive and thus maybe I'm being an asshole.

1034,Asshole,"My wife’s sister is a college student that works 2 part time jobs, and goes to school. She hasn’t gotten paid, and needs to pay for a college class by today. My wife just told me that we need to let her borrow $350 by today to pay for her class. I was bothered by this because she didn’t even ask me, she just told me that her sister needed the money and would pay us back next week. I told my wife that we can let her borrow the money, but I don’t want to be paid back in payments. I want the full amount next week. Her sister says she can only pay us half next week, and the the other half, a week later. I really can’t say no because I’ll look like an ass. My wife is already upset at me because she thinks I’m being an asshole for expecting her sister, who works part time, and goes to school, to pay us back in full when she gets paid.  I understand that she needs the money, and her part time jobs aren’t cutting it. However, I do see her buying lots of make up, and other non-necessities, so I’m not sure if this is a budgeting problem for her, or if she’s just not making enough money problem. If she’s working 2 part time jobs, I would imagine that she should have budgeted her finances knowing that today was a deadline to pay for classes. Deadlines are not something that appear out the blue, and surely, there was some indication that this expense was coming. 

Admittedly, we do make good money, and this loan probably won’t hurt us, but it’s the principle of the matter that bothers me. We recently had a large expense that took half of our savings account. I’m now wanting to build it back up by stuffing it with as much money as I can. I work in an unstable company, and don’t feel comfortable with the measly savings that we have.

1035,Not the A-hole,"I just created this account because my cousin uses Reddit, I think. I apologize for my broken English because it is not my mother tongue.

So, I (Female) have a big family who gather mostly on Sundays to have lunch together. Since I was a child I am used to do nothing while I wait for my meal, maybe just playing with my other cousins or something. Meanwhile, my grandma, my aunts, my cousins and my mother cook the meals/do the dishes/clean the floor/whatever. I never cared until I grew up and started to notice this behavior...

The men in my family (uncles, in laws and cousins) come to my grandma's house and just sit on the couch, watching TV, talking about stuff, drinking beers and pretty much doing NOTHING while the women cook and prepare lunch in the kitchen and basically do all the work. To make things worse, they all have this habit to give the first plates of food to the men and then the last of them plates to the women, so they (men) can eat first. Why? Well, because my grandma was taught that way, that she should have the food ready for when the men arrive tired from work. And she taught the same way to my aunts and my mom.

As I started to understand why things were the way they are, I decided not doing the same and, if my uncles and cousins can stay in the couch doing nothing, I will be doing the same damn thing because it doesn't feel fair, to be honest but I never said anything or complaint and nobody said something to me, either.

The thing is that last Sunday we were in my grandma’s house as usual, but my uncles arrived sooner, and my cousin said that he was really hungry and that he had to be in the gym by 14:00 so my aunts, mom and grandma were in the kitchen overwhelmed because they had nothing done yet. I was in the couch watching TV like it was not my problem, like my uncles and cousin, because if they don't move, I don't move.

As my mom was setting the first plates of food to my uncles, she saw me doing nothing and she just said ''well, you don't even go to help? Can't you see how overwhelmed we are in the kitchen?'' And then I just said out loud in front of all of them ''why should I be the only one helping? There are 4 more people besides me in this room, you know?'' She then just shut up, looked at me and went back to the kitchen. None of my uncles and cousin said nothing they just kept staring at the TV or at their phones like they were not there.

I felt terrible. Not for them, just for my mom. She didn’t say nothing at that moment because it would be like admitting that just because I am a woman I'm expected to be in the kitchen and they all know how sexist is that.

I don't feel like apologizing because I am not going to be a ''waitress'' to my uncles and I'm not planning to change my attitude until they (the men) change theirs. But I also feel bad for my grandma, my aunts, my cousins and my mom because I'm refusing to help them in the kitchen.

1036,Not the A-hole,"I just discovered the sub and this happened several years ago. Interested to hear your opinions on the matter.

I had just graduated college and been out for about 6-8 months. I was looking for entry level accounts payable positions. I applied to a local dentist chain and was called in for an interview. I arrived about 10 minutes early and checked in with the secretary. During the interview process, I was always punctual and the extra few minutes gave me a little time to relax before hand. So I went to wait in the waiting room. There was no one else there.

About half an hour goes by and I hadn't been called in. Frankly I was getting a little irked and asked the secretary if I was still scheduled. She called someone and told me they would be out momentarily. Another 15 minutes or so goes by and a couple of employees greet me walking by as I'm sitting down. I smile and politely greet them back. 

Not long after, the secretary takes me to a conference room. Those people who greeted me moments prior were running the interview process. They started to inquire about my background and ask typical interview questions. They had a copy of my resume but the way they were asking questions made me believe they were just reading it for the first time.

I don't remember the exact exchange but they asked some question about why I was interested in working for their company and I politely responded by saying I don't think I'll be pursuing a career at the company based on how they handled my interview. I said it was okay that they were late (sometimes shit happens) but to not even keep me posted and just leave me hanging felt unprofessional. And when I mentioned that it seems like my resume hadn't even been looked at before that meeting they just sat there stone-faced like I told the truth. I told them to have a nice day and I left.

1037,Asshole,"Edit 2: well, fuck. whether or not I am an asshole, it seems i need to just stop smoking, period - on the balcony is the first step.

So, I live in an apartment complex that has banned smoking in the apartments but allows smoking on the balconies and in common areas. I'm not a heavy smoker but I do enjoy it and probably smoke like 5-10 cigarettes a day depending.

My *direct* neighbours on all sides are not smokers and have the habit of leaving all their windows open (all day and night). I am NOT the only smoker on my side of the building (there are like 5), but I know my habit is gross and I don't enjoy the idea of sending unwanted smoke into people's windows. I live on the fourth floor, so walking downstairs every time I want a smoke seems like an unfair burden just to be 'polite'.

I have the *right* to do so, but it still feels like an asshole move. My question: am I the asshole for smoking directly below a neighbour's open window? Part of me feels gross for doing it, but part of me also figures that ""that's life"" and if they don't like it they can just close their windows or pass a policy banning smoking in the common areas.

1038,Asshole,"My household is falling apart due to this. My husband is trying to pick up the pieces but my son isn’t talking to me. I know reddit has a younger crowd so looking for opinions wherever I can get them. 

So I have two teenage kids very close in age, 15M and 14F. Being their mom I know exactly what they’re like, what they need, and what kind of parenting they respond to. My son is very social and extroverted, which is great, but he’s also got poor impulse control and is easily distracted. His grades are mediocre and I’m just worried about how he’ll focus and go on to a good college. 

My daughter is like the exact opposite, more like me, where she is more introverted and academic. She’s never had any problems with school work and the only thing I’m concerned with is her circle of friends that’s always changing or falling apart. She doesn’t have nearly as many friends as my son. 

The issue: a few months ago my son told us he wanted to date a girl (we have rules in our household about dating before 18). So he wanted to negotiate with us about 1) bringing the girl over after school and 2) having longer curfews. Knowing him, I set a few requirements. For the next semester he had to improve his average grades from a B- to B+ or A, he can’t break curfew even once, and he had to pick up more chores (mostly just cleaning his room and basement rooms, which he uses the most). He agreed but ended up breaking curfew 3-4 times, so I said no. He was upset and I’m sure still seeing this girl but he can’t bring her over and his curfew is the same as before. 

Now last week my daughter came home and told us very excitedly that there’s a boy in her Gifted history class who wants to take her on a movie date, so she needs curfew extended to 11pm. I said yes on the spot. My reasoning was solid. She’s always been responsible with curfew (she rarely goes out at night) and her grades are already high. I upped her allowance a bit and wished her good luck. Since then her new boyfriend has been round the house and husband and I wholeheartedly approve. 

But now my son is lashing out over the “injustice” despite how many times I’ve tried to explain my reasoning. I truly believe he cannot have a girlfriend and be responsible with his biggest responsibilities. I told him his sister, despite her age, is more mature than he is likely due to both personality and perhaps gender (girls mature earlier than boys) and that it’s not a punishment for him. I’m just trying to do the best parenting for both of them based on their own aptitudes. 

AITA for this decision? My husband stands by me but my son has sworn he HATES me, which is pretty standard teenager behavior but still. I’ve never seen him so hateful and it is making me doubt things.

**EDIT:** I’m sorry but anyone who’s an actual parent of teenage boys and girls would agree with me that girls mature faster than boys. It’s hardly sexism when it’s your own children and you see them everyday and know what they’re like because you raised them from birth.

Now if you want to respond to the rest of my post then I’m all ears.

**Last edit**: Ok I’ve read everyone’s responses and I’m going to digest it. I get that I’m the big bad right now but I can’t help but wonder if a lot of people will understand me better when they have kids, especially teenaged kids. Don’t get me wrong, I love them both but you know what I get frustrated too. I’m human too. My son is hard to discipline and sometimes I just want to blow off steam even if that means posting on the internet. I don’t think that makes me a bad mom, just a human being who wants the best for her kids.",1060,913,0.81
1039,Asshole,"4 months ago I came home from college to find my mother dirty, and completely lost. She forgot I was coming home and that I called her 40 minutes before for telling her I was getting close to home. 
I took her to ER that night, and after a scan, they found a giant aneurism of 40mm on 25mm, which caused hydrocephalic. They operated the hydrocephalic, she then had a drain, and after two weeks, they ""kicked"" her out of the hospital even trough the aneurism still had to be operated.

She couldn't stay alone, and no center of revalidation could take her while waiting for the operation because they did not have the stuff to monitor the aneurism. 
So my brother, my sister and I decided to do shifts.

My mother had an appointment to do a scan and get an appointment to have the aneurism closed. I should have come home the day before, but my sister called me and told me it was ok for her to stay one more day, and that I should stay in the city and meet them the next day at the hospital. 
I was woke up by a phone call to my brother in the morning, telling me my sister had found my mom laying on the ground. She fell from the sofa. She was brung to the hospital in a coma, and stayed in intensive care for four days before passing off. 

My sisters apologized many times, and I always tried to protect her, saying she shouldn't feel guilty, and it wasn't her fault at all. She told me many time that that night, she heard a noise at 11pm and did not go to check it out because she thought it was her dog. That she thinks maybe her dog pushed my mother off the sofa, and that, this night, she kind of cared more about her dog that had been sick and at the vet for the past 4 days. 
She asked me multiple time how I felt about this and if I resented her for what happened, and I could never have said that I did.

Three days ago, we got really drunk, and at 4am, she asked me once again. I totally lost my shit and threw everything in her face. How I fell guilty not having been there that night, the fact that SHE told me to stay where I was and enjoy when she wasn't feeling like watching for my mother because of her dog. The fact that she could have done something if she went to see what was that noise. I feel relieved, and shitty at the same time because I must have been really hard for her to ear.

Yesterday, I received a message from her telling me I'm really selfish, that she spent difficult time thinking about this, and most of all, that while I won’t apologize my brother (Who didn't call to tell me this or to talk about what happened) will refuse to sell the house we inherited. 
I feel like they once again treat me like a child, like you would refuse to give a lollipop to a kid if he won't say ""hello"" to the lady next door. 

I don't feel like I should apologize, and what they did by blackmailing me with the heritage makes me want to give them a big middle finger and tell them to fuck off for good.",89,252,0.91
1040,Not the A-hole,"Background: I'm a working actor and I need a new headshot photo. The photographer that I worked with before charges $300 for a 1-hour session (which compared to other photogs in my city... is not bad. Most others charge $500)

I asked my dad to help split it with me. He called back a couple days later and said that he had reached out to two people willing to do it for free.

1) A family friend we used to live next door to. From what I remember, she mostly did concert photography. But her daughter is an actor, a model and was in pageants, so I trust that she knows what to look for in terms of headshots (she might have actually taken her daughter's headshots??? I'll have to ask..)

2) my grandma's new husband's daughter. I've literally only seen her at Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner. Yeah. That's all i have to describe her lol.

My first instinct was to just immediately go for the family friend, but I figured reaching out to the husband's daughter would be a nice way to welcome her to the family and get to know her.

After getting her phone number from my Grandma, I asked to see her portfolio and if she has experience with headshots.

She got immediately offended and accused me of not trusting her, being all like ""I know what I'm doing"", ""i've been doing photography for years"", ""i'm doing you a favor"", blah blah.

Then she told her dad and my Grandma and now my Grandma is blowing up my phone saying that I hurt her feelings and that 'family should come first', all this stuff.

My dad tried to defend me by saying that i'm looking at other options and that it makes sense for me to want to see a portfolio (bless his heart). This made Grandma even more upset and now she's accusing my dad and I of not being accepting of her husband's family.

And bc she's a Facebook Grandma, now the whole fam is in our business and taking sides on the issue.

(And after all this, I still have yet to see a goddamn portfolio???? I found her instagram... Nice selfies but nothing that says anything about her professional quality.)

AITA here?? I thought I was being reasonable but now I'm questioning myself. I didn't mean to hurt anyone's feelings, I just thought I was being professional

EDIT: Because people are getting confused... I did not reach out to her myself. Nor did I ask my dad to reach out to her. He did that entirely of his own volition. 

I already had a photographer that I wanted. I just asked for him to split the cost, not for him to go searching for another photographer. He decided by himself to talk to her.

I only considered her, bc I wanted to be nice and give her a chance. Also, he didn't ask her to do it for free. She offered. She set that price. No one told her to do it for free. 

And for those asking ""what's the harm?"":
The photos may be free, but I still have to pay for hair, makeup and transportation. Not to mention, finding the time between two jobs and an intensive rehearsal schedule. One doesn't just walk into a studio photo-ready and take photos in 30 seconds. It takes time, effort, and preparation from all participants involved.

Why waste the time and money on a photo session with her if she's not a good fit? Especially when I can use that time on an actual professional?

TL;DR - I need a new headshot photo, a distant family member offered to do it for free. I asked to see her portfolio and it hurt her feelings.",82,62,0.91

I have also heard horror stories from friends about maids who didn’t work out and I think it would be more trouble than it’s worth.   Honestly I just don’t like the idea of having a live in maid and I really don’t want one.

I have explained these reasons to my wife but her response is that those are not valid reasons especially if we can afford help. Her reason is that she is too tired and a maid would make her life easier. 

My wife has a full time job and I am running my own business. We have one 5 year old daughter. We currently split the household chores. I sort out laundry, pack the kid’s lunches, ferry her to / from kindergarten every day, and take care of our dog . My mother helps babysit my daughter after kindergarten.  We hire help to come in twice a week to clean the house etc.  We rarely cook at home because of our schedules, and usually end up eating out or ordering in.

I don’t understand why my wife thinks we need a maid. I have asked her what she needs help with so we can look at whether I can do more or whether there are other solutions instead of hiring a maid. 

She got upset because she thinks I am accusing her of just being lazy and that I am insensitive for not understanding the real work that a wife and mother has to do around the house.

1046,Not the A-hole,"So in January, my dad and I went shopping for a new car for me, because my 200,000 mile Chevy Blazer was about to fall apart. He fell in love with a 2018 Jeep Renegade (I needed 4wd). He test drove it, and when we got back, I wanted to look at some used Jeeps. He wouldn't allow it. So I sign the paperwork and kind of pause when we get to the monthly payments. It was going to be 490 per month. Again, I ask if we could look at a cheaper one and was shot down. Now, including insurance, I'm paying 740 dollars per month for this car. His name is on it so I could stay on the insurance, but he does not pay anything for it. He also takes it when he wants, without asking, despite having two trucks and my mom's car. 

Yesterday, shit hit the fan when I was informed via text that I was going to have to take my grandmother's old car to work on Friday. Turns out, they had planned a family trip to an amusement park several states away... without me. And they were taking my car. I finally put my foot down and said no, and that I had plans on Saturday. I was just so sick of having to share this car I pay more than a paycheck for every month. I do still live at home, (grandmother owns the home), because I can't afford rent with this huge payment.

Now I've been informed, via Facebook, that I have until Monday to get my own insurance and until next month to get my dad's name off of the Jeep. That isn't what bothers me. I wanted to do that anyway. What bothers me is that because of this fight, my mom, who I've been close to all my life, is angry at me and acts like I shouldn't want to have my car to myself.

AITA for getting mad that my parents take my car when they want?

Update: A lot has happened since I posted this. I took a mental health day off of work so I could deal with this situation. Called the loan company to get his name off of the loan, so I could get his name off of the car. I also looked at seeing a therapist because I internalized some stuff. My dad actually apologized.  They're still going on the trip, but they're taking a different car. He also kind of walked back his ultimatum. Everything can stay as is, but I think I'll still get my own insurance because it is cheaper. I've thought about deleting this post because I didn't intend to get this huge, but I figured I would give an update.",101,376,0.96

Met a woman whose in-laws are worth $1 billion but keep her on a financial leash. What I do for a living, she loves as a hobby. Now she has this terrible business idea, which is total BS, she's just bored and wants to feed her own ego because nobody takes her seriously.

We met 3 times, she invited me for lunch, she went on for hours and hours about her shitty idea, wanting me to agree with her. I was being very very EXTRA polite, trying to steer her into the direction that her business is not gonna work for various reasons. I hoped she'd get there herself. She totally ignored it and just went on and on. What really pi$$ed me off was her assuming I'd do favours in the industry for her since 'we're friends'. I have only met her 3 times, she doesn't know anything about me, isn't interested, and all she does is squeeze me for info and reassurance.

Another thing that annoyed me was her assumption that 'we're so alike, we have the same passion'. No. She's a bored housewife who doesn't get to spend her in-laws money as much as she'd like, frustrated and confused, while I studied, worked and built important business relationships in my field for 20 years.

Husband said I was being too nice, and next time I should just tell her straight out 'I don't work for free, there's clearly no potential friendship here, since friends don't squeeze new friends for their work contacts, and no potential business relationship here, since you assume my time and expertise aren't valuable enough for you to pay me'.

My grandparents were in a car accident on Saturday and my sister, mother and grandfather were all in the car. The complete right hand side of the car was crushed (UK so drivers side) which sat my grandfather and mother behind. My grandfather died instantly and my mother was rushed to a specialist hospital as she suffered serious brain damage. My grandmother is in a different hospital, my sister is absolutely fine except for a broken wrist.

My grandmother has terminal cancer and hemophilia, has had several blood transfusions but I have been told she isn't going to make it past Friday. My mother is in a medically induced coma but is brain-dead and doctors have told me she won't survive off whatever machine is keeping her alive.

My grandmother is currently awake although internally she is not in a good way. I told her that my mother broke both her legs and has damage but otherwise ok... I even showed her an old photo to pretend she is fine and my grandmother believed it. I can't tell her. My sister wants to tell her but what is the fucking point? Am I the asshole if I let her die thinking her daughter is still alive or does she deserve the truth?? 

Sat at my mother's bedside right now and in 4 hours I'm going to the other hospital to see my sister and ultimately decide what to do - what do people think? Please help me I am only 24 I have no idea and will do what everybody thinks is the best course of action.

1052,Not the A-hole,"(Throwaway because family knows my account.)

&#x200B;

Short introduction: My sister-in-law is guillable af and an MLM that she hasn't fallen for has not yet been invented. She is selling it all, from the wraps to the oils, to some sort of weight-loss coffee thing she swears by. She pretty much lives on FB and to be fair, so do I (a lot of family lives abroad and its a good way to stay in contact). That's how I even realized something was up in the first place.

The problem: SIL has a degree from a good college in a field that guarantees quite the decent pay, so she recently got a fulltime job (because my brother made her after she started spending my familys money on her scams) and while I don't want to get too into it, it involves people with drug addictions and very heavy personal trauma. Lately I've been noticing that she started following a lot of people on FB and when I dug a little (I don't trust her, okay?) I realized she knew most of those people through her work. She also started leaving inappropriate comments on people's walls, praising the effects of her oils and stuff for things that range from migrains to anxiety disorders and depression. I also realized that she had started recruiting some of those people for her MLMs.

Last week, I decided to talk to her about it, casually asking about how she knew those people etc. and when she confirmed how she knew them, I told her to her face that what she was doing was really shitty and super unethical in my book. Tbh, I was really fcking mad and I still am, especially because all she did was talk about how she was the one with the degree so she knew better. I tried talking to my brother about it but we aren't really all that close and whenever I tell him something, she just refutes it and he believes her.

I could go to her boss and report her for misconduct or something like that, since I know they have very strict ethical guidelines of how to treat their patients but obviously that would hurt my brother and I don't want her to start relying on my families money for her pyramid schemes again.

So WIBTA?

&#x200B;

EDIT: SHE GOT FIRED!! It wasn't my doing, to be clear: she added some of her co-workers on FB who saw what she was doing and she got reprimanded a few days after I posted this. She has now been FIRED after she continued trying to scheme people. My brother did not appreciate my ""I told you so"" because he thinks people at her job just didn't like her (??) and apparently she's been blacklisted from working in the industry in my city. Good riddance, I guess.",115,428,0.96

1054,Asshole,"This is pretty simple. At some point after our marriage, my wife went from brushing her teeth twice a day + flossing, to no longer flossing, to brushing only once a day, and finally, brushing once every other day. Her justification has always been ""I forgot"" in the morning or ""I'm too tired"" at night (even though she can lay in bed on her phone for 10+ minutes before calling it quits). For the past 6 months, before we go to bed, I will say ""Did you brush your teeth?"" and she will say ""No"" in a bashful way. I will tell her, ""Go brush your teeth"" and she will respond with ""I'm too tired"". I will then end up making a typical frustrated 'ugh' sound. And it's true she is usually tired. She works 12+ hour shifts and sometimes brings her work home. One day off a week, so she's working 65+ hours a week. But I'm not asking her to workout or do some life altering task. It's just brushing your teeth!

&#x200B;

Every now and then, I will let her know she's gonna end up in a bad spot with her teeth and any procedure she get is not only gonna be painful, but expensive too despite having dental insurance. This went on for 6 months and a month ago, she started having some bad pain in her mouth. She went to the dentist and turns out she needs a root canal. I know root canals are no joke. I had one when I was 11, and after all the pain and vomiting during those multiple procedures, I swore to take care of my teeth. Since then, zero cavities (we're 27 now).  So when she told me she will have to get one, I think she expected me to feel sympathetic, empathetic, and sorry for the trouble she will be going through. What ended up coming out of my mouth was ""And whose fault is that?"" along with a ""You have no one to blame but yourself"". This set off a small argument and she hasn't spoken to me for a full 24 hours.

&#x200B;

I'm just having a hard time feeling sorry for her. In fact, I feel pissed about it. This could literally have all been avoided. And if for some reason she needed a root canal despite her brushing everyday? I definitely would've felt bad for her. But she brought this on herself.  I reminded her often to brush her teeth, I warned her, I talked to her about it over 6 months and she didn't listen. Now that it's all a reality, she wants me to feel sorry for her. I'm not her parent and she's not a little kid. She's an adult and she should know better to keep playing with ""fire"" like that.

&#x200B;

AITA?

Edit: So yeah, YTA seems to be the consensus. I'm planning to make it up to her by taking her out (to a tooth friendly) restaurant and movie. Also gonna apologize and admit my frustration got to me.

1056,Asshole,"So I just started dating this guy, we really click, he's great, yadda yadda. He lives in a house with 3 other people, owned by one girl. It's a super nice house, and they're all good friends. At first I was a bit apprehensive because two of the housemates are girls, but I met them early and they seemed cool.

Until this past weekend, that is. The house threw a party, which I heard are always amazing. I was invited, and I wanted to bring my emotional support dog, Sadie, to the party with me. I have really bad anxiety sometimes and she helps a lot. Sadie is super well behaved and a medium sized dog, so I thought it would be no problem, plus people really love her especially at parties. She's a total ham. I even put her ESA harness on her. But when we got to the door, my boyfriend and housemate (the house owner) opened up and she looked a little pissed. She said Sadie can't come into the party, that it's not a good environment for a dog, and she wasn't given advance notice so that she could at least dogproof. But why would I give notice that I am bringing my support animal with me?

So I asked her what if I was blind or epileptic and needed a dog. She said if I was blind she would have been happy to make arrangements beforehand for me, and that if I was epileptic that party wouldn't be a good environment for me anyway, as there are strobes and loud music which also aren't great for dogs, totally missing the point. I kept arguing with her about the legally protected status of my dog, and she just kept saying it doesn't apply for private property. This kept going on for like 15 minutes and she got more and more annoyed, saying she's seen me a hundred times out without the dog, but it's a party which is duh, where I'm more likely to have anxiety so of course I wanted her there.

After going back and forth she was basically like, ""look, the dog isn't coming into my house. That's final. You can put her in the backyard but that's it.""

While in the backyard, Sadie dug up some stuff because she's used to always being with me and I guess broke or chewed a chair. I'm fine with paying for those things if me and my bf stay together, but I kinda don't want to because if she'd just let my dog stay with me it wouldn't have even happened and because my bf didn't really take my side against his housemate and said it would be best if I don't bring Sadie over there again in the future as his housemate is really pissed.

AITA for getting into it with her?

&#x200B;

EDIT: For the people focused on me not wanting to pay, I said I didn't want to, not that I won't, but as I said in the comments:  The chewing in the backyard, I didn't even see, so I'm not even sure if it happened or if it was her and asked for pictures but still haven't seen any, and the flowers my bf sent me a picture, doesn't look like she dug them up, but instead was walking on them since they were right next to the backdoor and she wanted to get to me. I still get that I should have to pay if she messed up the flowers, that's not the point.

ALSO: My argument wasn't that she's legally allowed to be in the house, just that it's dickish to refuse because it's a support animal. It was more than my dog is an esa so does have some legal rights and isn't ""just a pet"". Even a service animal can't go into a private house, duh, everyone knows that. That's why I said she totally missed my point. But whoever that person is that says a service animal CAN'T is an asshole which is why I think she is the asshole.",782,893,0.83
1057,Not the A-hole,"Edit: People keep asking about insurance, we live in UK and the procedure and all past and future apointments reguarding his teeth were free. 

At the moment my boyfriend is waiting to have his wisdom teeth removed, because of the placement his needs to be sadated but should only take 30 minutes. He has a preop in a few days and he asked me to come with him to both the pre-op and to comfort him while they give him the needle.

When he told his mum it did not go as planned, first she said that I should wait in the waiting room because it would look stupid if all 3 of us go in together, when he said she can wait instead or just go get coffee and come back once we are done she got agetated (edit: i meant agravated) and said ""your brother let me in the room whenever he had to go, why cant you? Besides I am your next of kin"" he got annoyed and said that if i am not with him then he just wont go to it, she said ""fine all 3 of us will go in for your pre op"" she was pissed.

I tried telling him that it is insane that she wont let him either do it alone or with someone else, and that in the future there will be a time where he might feel too uncomftable with her being there for check ups. I also said that if he wants her there for comfort then I will drop the subject, be he was the one who asked me to be there. And he told me of his needle phobia and knows that in the past she has not helped with stress in that situation. He said that it is just easier to comprimise and let her sit in because she doesnt like being told no. I told him to grow a back bone and tell her how he feels and asked him what he plans on doing when he is in his thirties?? He got annoyed with me and I feel like I should drop the subject. Am i an asshole?? Or controlling??? (I feel like i am pushing it)

Also to clarify we have been together for over 3 years, its not like I am a new gf cus i would understand why she wouldnt want me there in that situation.

Update: He has decided to try one more time to get her to understand it from his perspective, but he told me if it did not go as plan he is going to catch her off guard at the preop, the plan is when the doc calls his name he wants to stand up and say loudly ""mum can you stay here and my and OP will go in"" aparently she hates making a scene (he told me in the past she would always wait untill they were alone foe her to argue) i personally think this will cause an issue between them but it is his call and i already voiced my opinion on the plan. 

I did apologise for telling him to grow a back bone and he thanked me and said i had a point. Thank you for the advice.

Also, to the people who basically told me he needs to man up, you all need to learn that it is not just children that are scared of things, it is okay to be scared as an adult.",36,41,0.92

My daughter had some plans with her friends and we decided to host the party at night. We invited our extended family and friends and told them that the party would start at 7pm.

1060,Not the A-hole,"Updated at the bottom! Husband thinks I’m asserting myself in MY house but I feel like it’s for the best. Sorry if it’s long, trying to explain it well. Tell me if I’m being an asshole. 

Husband has two sons from a previous marriage. I have two daughters. Boys are 12 and 8; girls are 8 and 4. Bit of a Brady bunch situation we got going on.

My ex husband and I coparent very well. No issues being in the same place. Was hard and took some family therapy, but for all my girls know, mom and dad are buddies. 

Husband and his ex? Not so much. I’m usually on his side, as she can be petty. She talks bad about us to the boys. 

Anyways, the boys don’t quite see me as a mother figure, more like a buddy. I don’t want to force it. Oldest cuddled up to me on the couch one night while dad was working and asked if I liked his mom. I said “of course. She is a good mom and I got two cool kids out of the deal.” He then starts to tell me a couple things mom has said about me, and that it hurts his feelings when they argue. And that it’s scary hearing his dad argue with his mom. He’s about to be a teenager and I just said “your mom and dad are adults and should handle themselves better than that. But everyone loves you and your brother, and that’s why it gets heated” that was about it.

Now, I can’t control what goes on in that house, short of a court order saying to stop talking shit, but I do feel entitled to telling husband to chill in my own. When husband got home, kids were asleep, and I laid it all out. That they’re hurting their kids, and I get why he gets angry, but he needs to be a adult and quit perpetuating it. Every time she calls, there’s an argument between the two of them. So I said, new rule, take that shit to the garage when she calls. He thinks I’m asserting myself and not letting him discuss matters with his ex in his own house, because it was my house previously. Told him I don’t give a shit about him discussing matters with his ex, but I’m tired of hearing them arguing in front of my kids and his own, and that is just going to be how it is here from now on until they can get it together. 

He’s angry with me. I’m getting a “it’s not your business” vibe, which he hasn’t said, but anyways, I felt like I had to do something.

UPDATE: kid free last night (yeah!) and we had a chance to discuss our argument. I was demanding and patronizing, and apologized. We eventually came up with a different plan. 

We spoke with his attorney this morning, and he’s going write up an agreement prohibiting the type of bullshit detailed above. Custody agreement is already in place, and if we decide we want to deviate from that, it’s up to the other parents discretion, but special consideration be given to things that benefit the kids. If the matters are financial, we’ll let attorneys handle that. We plan on asking her to meet with her to discuss in person. I suspect she’ll decline, but we will make sure she knows that if she does decline,  the attorneys will handle. No more petty bullshit. 

As for the comment about who’s house it is. He admitted that there are some insecurities. Poor guy was raised with some pretty strict gender roles being reinforced, and brought up education and my career. (Y’all, he is quiet and reserved. For him to say these things was shocking) He is more intelligent than me in countless ways, and works his ass off taking care of me and all of our kids. The way he has accepted my girls, and tries to take care of things is just...I can’t really express it. Hurtful to know that he feels insecure sometimes, but hearing him open up in that way was refreshing and...attractive. I like him pretty good, and will definitely keep him.

When I moved to uni I quickly became friends with my flatmate, Tony. He's white but listens to a lot of rap/grime music. Sometimes he jokes about how I'm ""not black"" because I prefer older music and don't act like a ""stereotypical"" black guy. Not to mention, there'll be times where ""nigga"" comes up in a song or whatever and he just says it without caring. I'm not gonna lie, this bothers me. I've confronted him about it a few times and he always says he ""forgets he's around a black person."" Make of that what you will. I also became buds with another guy, Mark. Mark's a decent guy but he keeps asking me for the ""n-word pass"" as a joke and it's starting to get on my nerves. Mark has an asian girlfriend, which is important later.

Me, Tony, Mark, and a few other mates were pre-drinking to go out last night. We were all pretty drunk, but not drunk enough to do or say anything we didn't mean (the night was pretty young). Everyone in the room was white, except for me. Mark made a racist joke (quinted his eyes with his fingers pretending to be asian) and everyone laughed, but I was taken aback. I was thinking *did he seriously just do that?* and I called him out on it in front of everyone. They all told me to lighten up, because I ""talk about race all the time,"" but only because they're always joking about how I must have a huge dick because I'm black or asking for the n-word pass - most of the time, I'm telling them that it's not that funny and to leave it alone. I said that none of them have the right to make racist jokes like that and Mark told me that it wasn't aimed at me, so I shouldn't be offended by it. I told him to fuck off, and Tony started defending Mark - when I said that Tony wasn't in a position to talk either because he clearly doesn't care about saying nigger around me, he just looked at me and said, ""that's a you problem, not a me problem."" I called him a cunt and he said that's cool, and the room was silent for a minute or two.

I went out on my own after they came back and Mark told me I'm like a brother to him and we're good friends and all that, trying to make up I guess. He said that he was one of three white people in his high school before he came to uni so he knew how it felt to get discriminated against. I asked him why he made the joke if that were the case, and the he actually stood there and said that it wasn't aimed at me so I shouldn't be offended. 

I told him I wasn't having it because jokes like this get cracked way too often for my liking and if he couldn't understand why I'd be offended by a racist joke, even if it wasn't aimed at me, then I didn't see him as a friend anymore. He said that he doesn't care (I guess the whole friend thing was bullshit) and then I went back inside, grabbed my booze, and drank on my own in my room. Did I overreact here?

i followed [/u/jennifer538](https://old.reddit.com/u/jennifer538)

 advice and went back to the hotel. I bought a box of chocolate and went  back and apologized. I said that i now understood my mistake and that i  was really sorry wasting her time and possibly a ride for a different  paying guest.

she said it was okay, but she did not want the chocolates. I told her to have a nice day and left.

I appreciate everyone giving constructive criticism. I was in the  wrong, so thank you for making me see. I'm young and stupid and i want  to be a better person.

1066,Not the A-hole,"My fiancée and I recently went to my mother's house for an engagement celebration dinner. 

My mother proudly showed my fiancée the very pale ""cream"" (white) suit that she has worn to many family gatherings - weddings/christenings etc. This suit was accidentally ruined in a freak ironing incident some time ago.

My mother told my fiancée that she's planning on having a similar suit made for our wedding.

My fiancée is not a bridezilla - we have had multiple compromises and productive conversations and none of the usual bridezilla clichés have come up. However she was always beholden to the tradition that ONLY the bride wears white at a wedding. I know this is a thing and it's not unreasonable as far as I can see. We're far enough ahead from the wedding that she has over a year to find something to wear.

So - WIBTA? I know that modern attitudes to traditions change but I'm genuinely surprised that my mother doesn't know or ignores this tradition. 

Tldr: I want to tell my mother not to wear a brand new white/cream suit that she doesn't even own yet to my wedding.

1067,Not the A-hole,"I saw a car making aggressive, jerky turns and thought to myself “I hope I’m not riding with that asshole.” Turns out I was. I wish I had just declined the ride now. Hindsight 20/20. 

I always say a polite “how are you?”/“you doing alright?” if asked how I’m doing. And when I did he had a huge emotional outburst about having received a big ticket that could prevent him from driving again and he thought he hadn’t done anything wrong and thought he had dashcam footage to prove it. He was so emotional and agitated because it happened 10min before he picked me up. 

He kept looking back at me instead of the road and the driving was jerky because he kept drifting into other lanes. Several times he took both hands off the wheel to gesticulate and then had to grab suddenly before we bumped into a parked car or the next lane.  

I did what I could to calm him down. Of note, we were pasing through an unsafe neighborhood and I felt equally unsafe in the car and out. He eventually told me about his money issues and how even fighting the ticket would cause strain. 

And I feel for him but the driving terrified me. I haven’t left a rating yet because I don’t want to be an asshole. But I also think I should report the unsafe driving. Keep at least one hand on the wheel, right?

1068,Not the A-hole,"I (23) take care of my sister(10) and grandfather (70 & paralyzed). When I first started doing it I was pretty depressed and didn’t leave the house. Now that I am feeling happier, have a boyfriend and have friends that moved back to our hometown, he nit picks and questions everything I do. Sometimes my aunt (52) helps, but she normally just buys him diapers once a week or something.

He purposely only asks me for things when I am about to leave to make me late. Anytime I leave the house he scoffs at me and if I come home any later than 9:30pm, he goes off on me about how selfish I am being. I leave parties, sports, dinner, and general social events to feed him at the times he wants and I usually end up leaving early even if someone else is there because of the anxiety I have from being constantly reprimanded. I am feeling extremely resentful that I cannot live my life and my anxiety and stress has peaked.

He took care of me as a child because my mom was a drug addict, and he tells me he gave up his life to take care of me. I feel like that’s fine and dandy, and I appreciate not being on the streets but most of my life was spent in deep depression because of the way he treated me. I gave up any semblance of a career to take care of him in this shit hole town. 

On the other side of things, I love my sister and wish I could be there for her more but I am not sure I am ready to be a mom. I am literally still a kid and I have so many psychological issues that it makes it extremely hard to parents. I also have literally $40 in my bank account.  I really don’t want to leave her and it makes my heart break but I am not sure if I am equipped to take care of a child.

This week I told my aunt that I was moving out and she started saying I’m making her life so much harder and that I should be staying and taking care of them.

1069,No A-holes here,"So I turn 18 in literally an hour, it’s 11pm, and it’s a big deal, well to me anyway, as I feel it should be, I’m an adult.

My family have gone through some rough patches the past couple of months. Both my Mum and Grandpa have terminal cancer and they’ve both had a rocky past two months with their health, in and out of hospital, hardly out of bed, that sort of thing. My Mum was diagnosed when I was 8 so while this is definitely the worst I remember Mum’s sickness is my version of normal. Grandpa has taken a downhill slope very slowly so it wasn’t a shock either.

On top of that my parents have had to go away for business, I’ve been travelling to visit my BF 10 hours away a couple of times, life’s been busy. And while I didn’t want to nag or annoy I did try to keep my birthday in the back of everyone’s minds because honestly I could do with a little extra attention and 18’s pretty special. But all I’ve felt like I was doing was nagging, especially because my parents promised to shout me flights to my BF for my birthday instead of a party (though we’re still going out for dinner as a family). I kept looking at flights especially when they were discounted but my parents didn’t want to know, and now it won’t be happening until around August. 

Mum admitted to me yesterday she’d completely lost track and not only had gotten me nothing for my birthday, but neither had anyone else. Only my BF. She took me shopping today for Pandora charms because I told everyone that’s what I wanted. It’s the first time I’ve ever selected my own present and it felt a little less special.

My Dad (who’s a dickhead alcoholic) forgot my birthday COMPLETELY so when Mum told him she’d made a dinner reservation he flipped about how he hadn’t been included in that discussion (he had, he was just drunk at the time).

So honestly tomorrow doesn’t feel special, it doesn’t feel like this massive milestone 18 is supposed to be...it feels like a throw together. I know everyone’s health is important but after the shit I’ve gone through and done for everybody I just want a day, but doesn’t look like I’m getting it.

1070,Not the A-hole,"I'm gonna start by acknowledging what a bizarre situation I'm in. Welcome, Reddit, to the Kafkaesque hellscape my life has become. 

A couple of months ago I [21M] had an absolute nightmare with my landlord/living situation which basically resulted in me becoming homeless over night. I ended up staying in a hotel for two days before a friend [27M] offered to lease me the spare room in his house while I tried to sort something else. I was pretty blown away by his kindness, as we're not *that* close, just in the same friendship group. Gratefully, I signed a six month lease and moved in. 

Here's the thing: this guy and his wife's [24F] sexlife is honestly kinda fucking bonkers. For a start they do the DD/lg thing full time at home, which I'm incredibly uncomfortable with. Like she fully dresses like a toddler and sucks a dummy and plays with baby toys and stuff when they're both home. No offence if you're into that, but it fucking skeeves me out. Won't get into it, but I have a lot of past trauma that makes that stuff make my skin crawl. Further they have sex *all the time* and *everywhere*. I get home from work and they're just banging on the couch with the living room door wide open, I go to get a glass of water and they're fucking on the kitchen table, I go for a piss and they're shagging in the shower without the door locked. She's even made comments that allude to them doing it on my bed while I'm not there. It's reached a point where I'm barely leaving my room for fear of walking in on them.

A week or so ago, I asked if they wouldn't mind dialling it back a little bit with the sex and kink related stuff. I've essentially been told that I'm under their roof and this is how they live so I have to deal with it. Also got a strip torn off of me for kinkshaming and was told I have no right to police their sex life. They also complained of having heard my boyfriend [20M] and I when he's been over, so we're even on me walking in on them. I'm really not trying to police anyone's sexuality here but I'm seriously stressed with the situation. AITA?",598,2494,0.96

1074,Not the A-hole,"Hello. I’m currently involved in a sexual relationship with a friend of mine. We’re never going to end up together for many, many reasons (all of which involve our circumstances, not our compatibility) but we’re great friends with a brilliant connection and the sex is fantastic.

We don’t get to see each other very often, maybe once every few months. We’re currently both attending a conference away from our respective hometowns. Work is paying so separate rooms. 

So, we were having sex in his hotel room last night. It was awesome. I came three times. Now, like many women, my orgasm can be a complicated thing. Sometimes I can’t cum at all (usually when drunk or very tired), sometimes I have one big orgasm, sometimes multiple smaller ones. I can cum from penetration alone, which I know is unusual. I know my body pretty well, I know when it’s not going to happen, and I can have a great time regardless. 

So, I cum three times. He keeps trying. I tell him, baby I can’t cum again. He says yes you can. I said no, I can’t. He keeps trying, I’m moving his hand away sometimes but also not always, enjoying the sensations even if I can’t cum again. But he keeps insisting I can. At this point I have said very clearly several times, I cannot cum. And he is telling me repeatedly yes I can. I get fucked off. I felt disrespected and like he was telling me he knew more about me than I did. 

So I pushed him off and got dressed. I told him I didn’t want this to ruin our week together, but I was leaving for the night and he owed me an apology. He refused to apologize, said I wasn’t clear enough and that he’d taken “I can’t cum again” as a challenge. He also snapped that no woman had ever said that to him before.

Side note, he’s a good looking dude and he’s had a lot of casual sex. Pushing three figures. I suspect that like most men, he’s been lied to A LOT by women about sex and orgasms. He seems to think that orgasm from penetration alone and multiple orgasms are the norm, and it’s definitely not. Maybe 1/10 women can cum from penetration, and while he’s fantastic in bed, he doesn’t have a magic dick that alters how a woman’s body functions.

He’s mad and is refusing to apologize.

1075,Not the A-hole,"****FURTHER UPDATE****

HR told my manager to hold off on the meeting this weekend as they want to have either my managers boss or someone from HR there too.  No doubt to make sure my co-workers don't pull their usual bullshit.

****UPDATE****

We had a conference call with my manager, her boss and HR.  They asked me what my perspective was as to what is going on and I said there is an extremely unprofessional culture in the store that ultimately will only hurt the store and prevent it from growing business wise like it should.  They asked me specifically what I had experienced and I told them about the behaviors, pettiness, how territorial they were and how that could only become a negative in the grand scheme of things.  I told them how I've been hollered at, cursed at, told to shut up...you name it.  I said I just can't see me coming into work for the next 10+ years with this environment.

My manager verified everything I said and said the behavior continues despite her calling them out on it (which she has and they yelled back at her).  I mentioned to HR what their response was and how shocked I was that they felt entitled enough to speak so disrespectfully to their boss that way.

HR apologized for the fact that I have had to deal with such poor behavior.  She said that is NOT acceptable on any level and no one should feel like they are walking on eggshells like I am.  She asked if this behavior transpired in front of patients and I verified that it has.  

They asked me to put some ideas together on what can be done to rectify the situation and send it to them in an email and that they would do everything they could to make sure this is stopped.  I then got off the call while they continued to talk.

My manager came in and gave me a big hug and said she appreciates me and that she doesn't want me to leave (she is actually a very nice and sincere person, just sucks at conflict resolution).  She said she was frustrated because HR asked her why it got this far before they heard about it because she has been telling her boss for ages about it and just told him the other day it was getting worse, yet it took for me to reach out to get the conversation going with HR.

In the email I said there should be a system implemented where when someone is out of line they get a verbal warning that is actually written up and signed by the employee and manager.  After 2 verbals it becomes a written notice that goes to HR for review.

I then said policies need to be implemented that EVERYONE follows, and I listed about 8 or 9 things that currently are issues and how to deal with them such as rotating patients with employees as they come in so no one monopolizes all of the sales, and clear guidelines for returns, and that everyone needs to do repairs and dispensing and employees can no longer pass that off to others so they can be ready to catch the next sale.

I showed it to my manager and she loved it, I then signed it and sent it off to HR and her boss.

We are going to have a meeting this weekend where we will go over all of this and everyone will need to sign off on all of the policies including acknowledging the verbal/written notice system.

So I feel better knowing HR was respectful of what I had to say and took it seriously and that my manager was on board with everything.  

Thank you all so much for your kind responses, they really helped me feel confident this morning and empowered for this call.  You all are amazing kind souls and really helped lift my spirits! 

****ORIGINAL POST****

I work in a place where we get a 2 percent commission fee on eyeglass sales.  I just started here a couple of months ago.  One coworker in particular has flat out told me she doesn't like me, hasn't since day one and has even said there is no reason for it, but that's how it is so stay the fuck away from her.  If I so much as accidentally get too close to her (cramped areas such as around register) she snaps at me.  On a few occasions customers have come to me and asked me if I could help them, so I did.  She then yelled at me (in front of customers) for stealing her sale.  She thinks that because she says hello to someone as soon as they walk in the store it makes them her customer.  Coworker #2 hollered at me for 5 minutes straight the other day because her customer returned a pair he bought but didn't like on her day off and purchased a different pair and I put the sale in my name (per my managers instructions).  She yelled that was fucked up, and after I told her our manager told me to ring it up in my name she said that was bullshit and I shouldn't have listened to her, but rang it up in her name.  She was stomping her feet, cursing at me, hollering...you name it.

These two have caused others to quit before by acting this way.  I was hired because I have over 20 years experience in the optical field and I'm good at my job.  My husband thinks they are threatened by me.  I'll be damned if I let them run me off.  

My manager feels like she's talked to them repeatedly about their behavior and it hasn't changed over the years so there isn't much more to be done.  I escalated the matter to her boss (who has told me he is fed up with their shit) and we have a conference call with him, my manager and HR tomorrow.

AITA for escalating this?  My manager says I need to have thicker skin and just accept that they are screamers and strong willed individuals.  As a previous manager and business owner before that I can say without a doubt that I feel her response is bullshit, and I would have fired them ages ago.  Thoughts?",96,490,0.97

I'm her mom, so of course I think she's beautiful, but realistically she is exceptionally very pretty and it's the thing everyone comments on about her, which bothers me AND her. People also always tie that to her 'breaking boys' hearts' or teasing her about boyfriends or marrying boys. She's not even 7 years old yet, but people have been saying this type of stuff since she was a baby.

Emma has never liked this, and since kindergarten if someone says she's pretty she'll say, 'I'm kind and smart too' or 'I am a good helper and like to share too.' She also gets upset and draws inward when people tease her about breaking boys' hearts or having a boyfriend. Since she was maybe two years old she has always talked about marrying girls and thinking boys are icky, take that as you will; we are. We don't expect a little child to have her sexuality figured out but we also don't want to make a big deal about it or 'correct' her in case she does end up wanting to marry a woman.

So long story short, after Easter, I sent an e-mail out to our family and close friends asking them if they could ease up on talking about her appearance and teasing her about boys after she cried that night because her Grandma said she'd have to marry a boy and she didn't want to. You'd think I asked my family to cut off limbs or eat a pile of dog doo based on the response and things have been tense since, with lots of passive aggressive comments about how I 'won't let them say ANYTHING' and how what they're saying is 'normal.' Her paternal grandparents responded that they are going to 'just skip' her birthday party in case they 'offend' me.

My husband (and my brother and his sister) are the only ones who don't think I'm being an asshole here, but now my extended family makes me think I'm making a big deal out of nothing, but these comments really do upset Emma a lot, so I don't know what to do here.

EDIT: Since a bunch of people have asked, this is the e-mail sent to our families:

""Just a head's up, we're trying something new. Emma has told us that it upsets her when people compliment on her appearance or tease her about boys, so we'd all appreciate it if no one made comments like that to her. You know she rarely fusses, so if she says something bothers her, we want to try to take it seriously, and appreciate your help.""

My wife and I have a friend named R.  I would consider R a good friend and we sometimes hang out and get drunk together, both at my house and out on the town.  However, R and my wife were friends before we met and R just recently came back into her (our) life.

R works odd shifts and has a son that my wife adores.  I'm not big on kids myself, but the kid has had a hard life and I do my best to be a friend to him (he calls me Uncle D - obvious alias).

Just this past week, R asked my wife if she could pick up his son from school, as he'll be out of town working a job.  I have no problem with this and fully welcome it.  She is just helping out a friend of hers and ours.

However, this lead to R coming to pick up his son while I am at work, therefore leading to him and my wife being alone in our house.  I think that this is very inappropriate and made my feelings known.

I trust my wife.  I really do.  That being said, I still don't think that it's appropriate for a single man to be alone in our house with her.  Maybe i'm just old fashioned or something in that respect.

Anyway, she got mad because I voiced my displeasure with this.  We got into a small squabble over it.  She declared that she is a Christian woman (I am an atheist, but she is actually a Christian I respect in regards to her faith) and that she wouldn't disrespect me or herself like that.

1083,Not the A-hole,"Full disclosure, this happened roughly a year ago while I was still in grad school. I was an uber driver at night to earn some extra money and would often pick up drunk college kids going to-from bars.

&#x200B;

So this night I picked up 3 drunk girls from a neighboring school. They were going from a campus pregame to some bar/club in the next town over. I'm a small female who drove strangers at night so I had a little laminated rule card hanging on the backseat. Basically no rude, drunken behavior, nothing that disturbs my driving otherwise I have the right to kick them out whenever. If they refuse I call the cops.

&#x200B;

On the way there the girls start drinking vodka out of water bottles and I ask them to stop several times. They do for a while but I still catch them sneaking sips. Then minutes later they start singing some sorority song (it was Party in the USA but with their sorority name put in). At one point this girl starts talking about one of their friends and they start chanting ""f\*ggot"" and laughing then they break out that same song and add his name into the lyrics and also a bunch of similar slurs. At this point I'm fed up. I've asked them several times to A) stop drinking in my car and B) calm down and shut up.

&#x200B;

Granted, I never said if they don't stop I'm kicking them out because in my mind I already gave them plenty of chances. I spot one of those little 24hr drive thru Taco Bells and pull over and tell them to get out of my car. I tell them to go ask the restaurant to call them another ride because I'm done. They get out in confusion and I just drive off. I reported the incident as advised but heard nothing back from Uber.

&#x200B;

So recently I was sharing stories of my uber driving days and told this little story. A few people thought I was a major asshole because I put those girls in a lot of danger by leaving them at a random Taco Bell parking lot at night. They think the right thing to do was to take them to their destination but report them after. Honestly I was just following the rules I set for myself and didn't think that much at the time. I was just fed up with their behavior. But WITA/AITA for what I did?

**EDIT:** The taco bell was open at that time and had a few other college kids inside. This was in a suburban college town so the only people out at that hour were other college students.",83,43,0.85
1084,Not the A-hole,"Mobile. I started this at 3am because I couldn't sleep. I get up for work in 2 hours. Enjoy.

I've (27F) been in a relationship with my partner (27F) for over 6 years and we're currently buying a house together i.e it's hecking serious. 

My parents have an inkling of my relationship but I have not confirmed or plan to talk to them about it. I don't feel obligated to for reasons below. My partner respects my decision. 

My parents are Asian and Catholic. You know the type, picking and choosing whatever part of the bible to suit their agenda (casual homophobia and racism), only goes to church once a year, but they did place my siblings and I in Catholic schools. 

They're not extreme, they're pleasant if you meet them and have friends that are gay and of other races. 

From a young age, my mother has physically and mentally abused me. Maybe I was a particularly shitty child and for a while, I did think this. Growing older, I recognised she was just an unhappy woman in an unhappy marriage, in a country that made her unhappy. Since I was a tomboy growing up, she looked at me as a defect and took her rage out on me, compared to my other siblings. 

My father, absent with work, defended me at first but eventually took my mother's side as I never spoke to him about my abuse. My mother would hide whenever she hit me, even praising me if I lied to him about where my bruises came from. My childhood was fucked up. 


I acknowledge that they've worked hard to provide us a life in the Western world and I'm fortunate to have the opportunities I have now because of them. Although, I worked hard so I could move away from home. 
As a female, it was expected I would remain in the house until marriage (to a man, ha) and it was a huge blow to my mother when I managed to get into a good university away from home. 

I've been independent from them since 18. My father dropped me off my uni halls with a luggage filled with clothes and that was it. I borrowed money from my bank and scraped by with government loans until I got my first job 3 years later. 

I played the good Asian child and gave money to my parents when I got said job, but stopped after I realised I was only getting invited to family outings because I paid for them. 

I now live my own life and I have a civil but tense  relationship with them. 

My older brother has cut contact with them completely for the past 7 years. Maybe that'll give insight. 

I am asking if IWBTA is because the last major argument that happened between us was 4 years ago. They're still my parents and I would like them to be present in my life events, but not so much that telling them about my partner will open another rift in our relationship.

My mother, especially, lives a life in delusion and thinks she has been a saint of a mother.
Our last 3 major arguments has been trying to get her to admit what a shitbag she has been, but no sauce there! 

They'll be hurt to find they haven't been invited to their child's wedding.

1086,Not the A-hole,"I've been friends with one of my best girlfriends (in her late 30's) for years and she's had a troubled love life. Without getting into specifics, she isn't in the best relationship right now and her life is riddled with anxiety and depression problems. I've always supported her through this, and have done my best to be a good friend. I think she'd benefit from being in a relationship with someone better than who she's dating, but she is attached. This relationship causes her to make bad decisions at times, and I've always done my best to be the voice of reason and support her when he isn't treating her well. She's contemplated sleeping with an old acquaintance who was in a hapless marriage in the past and I've told her that if she did I would never speak to her again. I've been cheated on, and I told her willingly making that decision makes her a bad person who I wouldn't want to associate with.

So earlier today she regaled a story to me about a guy she had been fooling around with on occasion  and how she met this guy's family, took photos for them, and socialized with his wife at a party. The story made me sick to my stomach and I exploded at her. I told her how awful it is to do something like that to his wife. I also told her to grow up. How I can't trust her with my own partner, and how I cannot be friends with someone who is a bad person like that. I realize my reaction was over the top, as I was yelling, but my reasoning, I feel is justified. She shouldn't have done it, being someone who was once married herself.

I'm not someone who would want to take part in cheating, and I don't really know what was going through her head to bring her to do that sort of thing, especially when she has a real relationship with someone else (albeit not the strongest or best, but it's mostly steady).

I have often tried to discuss the politics of China with my wife but she has no interest.  Today, I asked about what my step-daughter has learned about Tianamen Square massacre out of curriousity from school in China.  She knew nothing.  As I tried to explain what happened, my wife became agitated.  So I dropped the subject.  I feel that it is important to know all history, good or bad regarding any country.  I pointed out that the US has also some bad history but we are free to talk about it in hopes we don't repeat our history.  My wife thinks I should not bring up these topics, but I strongly disagree.

1088,Not the A-hole,"Let me just start by saying, I'm really handy and I know how to tinker and fix things. I've fixed phones before for people and when you have the tools and a steady hand, it's really not too difficult. The mall kiosks charge around $100 to fix a cracked screen, however, I can buy the part and install it myself for about $15. I [21M] have fixed my gf's [21F] phone screen before, and I've fixed her little sister's [15F] phone screen before too. 

Her sister is a major brat and can be rude and hurtful towards me. Not always directly, but through the things she says to my girlfriend. An example is when my gf was asking her sister a question in the sister's room and I poked my head in the doorway to see if they were done. I was later told that her sister started fussing at my gf about me doing that and that I am not allowed to come into her room ever again. I try to do nice things for her sister, such as, fixing her phone screen, buying her food, and driving her places. Lately she's been even worse than usual. She blamed me for getting her sick after I bought her McDonald's and also I drove 20 mins to her friends house to pick her up from a pool party at an agreed upon time and she just says ""come back in 2 hours"". She begs her sister and family for things and they usually give in. I think she's extreme spoiled and expects things to be done for her. 

Anyway, so her iPhone has been dying at progressively lower percentages over the past few weeks until recently, it completely died. Everyone knows the older iPhones have notorious batteries and I had suggested we replace it when I did the screen, but she said no. So now, she has a dead iPhone that needs a new battery, my gf wants me to fix it to avoid paying someone a lot to do it, but I'm like, ""she's mean to me, I'm not gonna do her any favors until she starts acting right towards me"". My gf has agreed in the past that her sister is a ungrateful brat who is mean to others, but because they are siblings, she's on her side. My gf tells me that it's not my role to teach her sister a lesson. She keeps telling me to fix it or I'm an asshole. She says that maybe if I fix it, then her sister will be nice to me. I personally believe in action speaks louder than words, so she can start being nice to me, or I'm not doing it. 

I've talked to my parents, co-workers, friends, and my own siblings about it and every single person told me that I shouldn't fix it for her. So what do y'all think, AITA?

1089,Asshole,"I am married and have 2 kids. I’m a SAHM and work part time in the evening (I go to work once my husband gets home). I have a few best friends and I thought of the idea to go on a weekend getaway with them. I asked them if they’d be interested in going next spring/summer so it’d give us all time to save up for the trip. 

I told my husband about the trip idea and he seemed less than thrilled.. I explained that I think it’d be good to get away for a weekend and not have 2 kids up my butt all day. He is normally super supportive of me hanging out with friends/going out/traveling with friends. He was taken aback because he thinks the trip will cost a lot of money. I told him I could save up from my part time job (it doesn’t pay much) and just use that money so we don’t use any of our usual monthly budget. He got upset and said that he doesn’t get to use his money to go off and spend on whatever he wants so why can I do that with my money? 

I’m big on the philosophy of all of our money being “our” money and not his/her money. I just thought it would be ok if I used the little money I do get to save up for the vacation. (We aren’t super tight on money, but we don’t have lots of extra cash either). 

He is right, I don’t usually like him going out and spending lots of money on random things (shoes in his case). It got me thinking that maybe I am overstepping by being so strict with how his paychecks are spent (budgets, etc). Also, I now feel bad that I could spend the money that I’d use on the trip towards our family instead or put the money into our house. I also realize that he doesn’t usually get time to go out with friends/weekend getaways. I know that part is my fault, I get frustrated/overwhelmed being home with the kids all day and I can’t wait until he gets home so that I’m not the only one taking care of the kids. He always claims that he doesn’t do stuff like that because he prefers to stay home with his family, but I know it’s partially because he sees that I’m overwhelmed/frustrated.

Edit to add: what I mean by buying shoes is in the sneaker head type of way. Like he has bought 3 pairs of Nike/Jordan’s/ whatever the latest trend is this year. I don’t mean if he needs new shoes then can’t buy them. I just mean I don’t usually budget for a new $300 sneaker every month. I do like the idea that people mentioned of putting aside free spending money for both of us so we can buy what we would like guilt free.

I also think I was maybe unrealistic with how much a weekend trip to the Bahamas would cost.. I was thinking it would end up being around $1000 with flight, hotel and food.",84,144,0.9
1090,Not the A-hole,"So this happened last night and is still pretty raw so I will try to explain in as neutral a fashion as possible. TL;DR at bottom.

Recently, my wife and I got sod placed in our front and back yards. Before that it was mainly just weeds and such that took me about 20 minutes to take care of with a standard mower. Now, I find that it's taking me 2+ hours to finish the back and front yards, which doesn't include the time to rake all the dead grass (because our mower is a POS) and edge the lawn. I also want to point out that we do not have a big lawn, approximately 1500 square ft. 

Anyways, we had been on vacation for a week so the yard had not been mowed for some time. I had been mowing the back on my day off, but I quit after it took me an hour and a half to only mow half of it due to the length, thickness and how wet it was, even in the summer heat. My wife came home, saw that the job was only half finished, and made some comment to the effect of ""Oh, you couldn't finish the job? What did you do all day?""

I did not take this well, and stated that if she wanted to have it done then she could do it herself. This is when she tells me that she has never mowed the lawn and she ""isn't going to start now"", and that mowing the lawn is a man's job anyways. She also stated that since I have more days off a week I should have more responsibility around the house

I flipped out. We have a very good relationship, and both of us have worked at various times. We have no kids, but when we married I worked full time while she worked part time, then she managed to find fulltime work while I went back to school. Now we both have full time positions, with me working three 12 hour shifts and her working a more traditional 8-5 M-F. We have always split chores around the house, doing our own laundry and whatnot. I told her that saying that mowing the lawn was man's work was a bullshit excuse, as I could never refuse to cook dinner or do the dishes by saying those were ""women's chores"". I also pointed out that we both work the same amount of hours a week so it's not justified to say that I should do more just because I have more days completely free of work. 

She ended up saying that I was getting out of line and acting like an asshole because she didnt know any other wife whose husband made her mow lawns. I think that I am in no way in the wrong here, but it's been bugging me all day that I might be wrong. So, AITA?

TL;DR: I asked my wife to mow the lawn. She said that's a man's job and I had more free time. I said that's a BS excuse.




Edit: For clarification, 1) we both have been wanting sod for a few years so we wouldn't have the worst looking house in the neighborhood and could actually do things in our backyard. It was no one person's decision. 2) We have an electric push mower that I have been using for 5+ years. Never had an issue, but this new sod is very nice and thick and apparently holds moisture like a camel, which just clumps up the bag opening every 5 feet or so, requiring it to be manually cleared. Very slow going. 3) Our work hours are very similar despite the difference in days. When I work I leave the house by 6 AM and will not get home until 8 PM at the absolute very earliest usually later. She leaves the house at about 8 AM and will leave anywhere from 430-5 PM. Her boss is very cool with her taking several hours off during the day if she needs it or she will leave early if the office is empty. I am very jealous.

That being said, we talked and it seems like getting a lawn service is the best option for this particular circumstance, if we can find one that is affordable. Thanks for blowing up my inbox with your well-meaning suggestions and, for some reason, discussions over sex and gender.",271,431,0.96

1092,Not the A-hole,"A bit of background: There is a floatation therapy center near where I live. I have chronic back pain and floating helps a lot. I started going fairly soon to when they opened, about three years ago. The center has four different themed rooms that you can choose between at the time of booking. Probably the third or fourth time I went there, an older woman who had booked an appointment at the same time as mine started complaining insistently that she wanted MY room. I agreed to swap because while I liked the theming of the room I'd originally picked better, functionally they're all the same so it wasn't really a big deal to me.   


The owner and his partner were grateful that I was easy-going about it, and were extremely generous as a way to make up for my inconvenience. They gave me a free float, a free sauna, and as I was also an early return customer to their business, they added a lifetime pass for 15% off any service I booked to my account. Sweet! And I did, in fact, book the next two or three services online and got 15% off.   


But then at a certain point, the discount pass just...stopped working. I can still see it on my account, with an expiration date of May 2999, but when I book a service, it doesn't apply.   


This center is a pretty small business, and as someone who started going pretty early, I get some perks thrown my way. I got two other free floats (once due to a last-minute cancellation, once when the owner noticed when I came in that I was particularly stressed/anxious), I have upon occasion gotten free upgrades in service, if no one is booked after me they'll let my time run an extra 10-15 minutes for free. Given all the other freebies I've gotten, and given the fact that I feel like I was more than reimbursed for my inconvenience, to ask, ""hey, just wondering what happened to my lifetime discount?"" feels like the epitome of greed and entitlement.   


But on the other hand...this is something that they already gave me, that they assumingly did mean to be a “lifetime” discount, not something additional I’m asking for. It’s likely they aren't even aware it has stopped working on their online portal. I also think I would book more frequently if I was getting 15% off everything, which would be nice for my pain management. 

I'm truly torn on this - WIBTA if I asked what happened to my discount?

1096,Not enough info,"First time, long time. Throwaway for reasons. 

I’m super concerned I may lose my job and That I’ve failed to appreciate the ramifications of my actions here. Thanks to anyone taking the time to read it. 

Background: I am a licensed professional in a specialized field. I work in a small (<10 person) office. It is open concept. Everyone is Caucasian except for one admin assistant who is African American (Sarah ~58 yo). For the most part, everyone gets along well enough. I’m not trying to brag or anything but I don’t think anyone in the world hates me. At my worst, I might annoy someone but I’ve never yelled or been mean or made any enemies. Ever. Super non-confrontational.

My wife runs a small home based business. Sarah has bought things from my wife before. We have always had a friendly but not friends relationship. She is not MY admin but we work near each other in this small open office. My grandma passed away recently. Sarah offered condolences and at one point she put $40 on my desk. I don’t recall what she said but it was perceived by me as gas money for the trip to the funeral. As politely as I could I returned the money saying that I appreciate her thoughtfulness but couldn’t accept it. I’m not sure if this is something she does with everyone or if it’s a cultural thing I’ve never heard of before (I’m 30). Regardless, we never talked about it again but I now sense she may have been upset by my actions. 

Fast forward a week or two. We’re all (8 or so of us...my boss is out of town) in the conference room eating lunch. As I alluded earlier, we can be a rowdy bunch. We all tend to have lots to say. Conversations move fast and can usually range from current events, pop culture/entertainment gossip, industry news, or personal. In the CONTEXT of the current topic of conversation (promposals) I brought up a news story in our local paper. I’m scared of being too specific and outing myself but suffice it to say, a local student had gotten in hot water for a racist prom-posal sign. 

Someone asked me what the sign said. I very hesitantly told them what the sign said. It did not include any slurs but made reference  to “blacks picking cotton.” I need to stress, what I said was in a VERY disapproving tone like, “I can’t believe someone would even say such a thing” At that point in time, Sarah halts the conversation, says we shouldn’t talk about this around her, and that we need to change the subject RIGHT NOW. there was a long awkward silence until we could all kind of shift gears to something else. 

After the lunch I asked one of Sarah’s more closer co workers if Sarah was upset. She told me she didn’t see why she would be, not to apologize, and to just let sleeping dogs lie.

1099,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR at end. Repost because I can’t spell AITA and character limit. 

My late husband had 4 kids with an ex wife, and the kids were alienated from him.

Once we married, his life was back on track, he got a job and paid child support, and a tentative rapport began between him and his kids. (They lived in a different state, so the rapport was mostly texting and phone calls.) Tragically, as this just started to bloom, my husband was diagnosed with kidney cancer and after a 3 year fight, died at the age of 44, leaving behind these 4 kids. They were all teenagers when he died.

I tried my best to be kind and supportive to them all, but we weren’t given a lot of time to become close. After my husband died, I did not maintain a deep contact with them, although I contacted them about the death, offered what pictures, clothes, belongings I could to them, as they had very little from their dad and obviously had a lot of emotions to process.

It’s been 8? Years since he passed, and his youngest daughter has reached out to be messenger friends, and we’ve exchanged friendly how-are-you type messages for about a year. She told me that she is on disability and doesn’t work, and has struggled with a drug addiction and did rehab. 

She lamented about 6 months ago that she didn’t have pictures of her dad and her from when she was a kid and I immediately dug through my husbands old picture albums and sent her all of the pictures I could find of him and the kids. She was very grateful. All was good.

Randomly a week ago I got a message from her (hadn’t heard from her in months) and she is asking for money, and the gist of the message sounds *very* “addict” to me (my dad was an alcoholic and I’ve been exposed to lots of addicts). She asked me to PayPal her some money “for groceries just to make it to the end of the month.” I immediately worried she was maybe needing money for drugs and I didn’t know what to do. She’s never asked me for money before.

So I replied hey, I’m traveling (which was true,) and said I’d get back to her, and then honestly forgot about the convo (I was traveling, applying for a new job, finishing a college class, and a ton of other things were going on.)

I got an angry message from her yesterday (it’s been about a week) that said something along the lines of “you could have just told me you weren’t going to give me any money instead of stringing me along”. 

I deleted the text and didn’t respond. Boundaries and confrontations are my weakness. My heart is heavy that she’s had a difficult life, but my “addict behavior radar” is also pinging loudly.

AITA for just ghosting the convo? Should I reply?

TL;DR- kid from my late husband messaged me asking for money, and she has a history of addiction. I said I’d get back to her and forgot, and she messaged me angrily saying I could have at least told her I wasn’t going  to send her money. I haven’t replied. AITA?",10,46,0.92

I love my wife she is a fantastic mum and I could not ask for anyone better to raise my kids. I am the only one that works in the household and she is a stay at home by choice. 

My problem being is she is incredibly messy herself we have a 2 and 4 year old and the house is just a wreck constantly. She may do washing once a week, the floor never gets swept up, things are never put back. My two year old spilt juice on the sofa and my wife has just let it sit there all day. 

She doesn't drive atm so me and her family do the bulk of the errand running. I don't expect the house to be immaculate but I believe being a stay at home mum/dad brings a certain responsibility that being making sure the house is in relatively good shape.

1101,Not the A-hole,"I (19F) recently discovered that my mother has been logging on to my brother (22M)’s Facebook account regularly, and reading his messages. I discovered this through needing to borrow my mom’s laptop one day recently for a school project because mine was not working, and realized that the open tabs included my brother’s Facebook account open with his messages featured on the screen. 

This could be explained away as my brother having borrowed the laptop similarly to what I was doing, and logged into his account himself, however this is not the case as my brother attends a college out of state and was not even residing in the same state at the time. I thought it was odd initially, but I didn’t think too much of it because I got distracted with my school work and forgot about it. Since that occasion, I have needed to borrow my mom’s laptop at least 4 more times and the exact same thing has happened each time- my brother’s facebook account is open with his messages tab being displayed on the screen, as if my mom had just been lurking through his private messages right before I asked to use her computer. This does not seem like normal or justifiable behavior for a parent of a 22 year old, and I’m not even sure if it’s legal. Since this is obviously a habit of hers, I feel very strongly that my brother should be made aware so that he can take action to change his password and confront her about this (or do whatever he wants with the info, I just think he should know). But I’m unsure if this is ethical of me to do, as I know it will cause family drama and that my mother will resent me for this, and my brother will likely not be too happy with her after learning this. I just don’t know if this is a situation where I should just let everything be or if I am justified in “stirring the pot”. I know that if it were my messages that were being read I would definitely want to know. I am just unsure on what the best way to proceed is in terms of being a decent person.

1102,Not the A-hole,"I was talking with my fiancée this evening and wanted to get opinions on this.

My future MIL suggested getting a memory table for our wedding where we can put the names and photos of people like our grandparents and my mother, who passed away ten years ago.  My initial reaction is that I don’t want one.

The reason why is that my family, my aunt and cousin in particular, always seem to make events in my life about my mother (e.g. “your mother would be so proud,” and “I miss your mom every day I wish she were here,” or their favorite “something something smiling down from heaven.”) I’m sure this will happen at my wedding anyway, but I think a memory table would just invite this and I don’t like it.

I get everyone remembers those who have passed on differently, but I don’t choose to do it this way.  And, it can bother me when they direct it at me, especially since it feels like every major positive event in my life is overshadowed by the fact my mother isn’t alive to be there for it.  To me, I just think it would be easier to not have it at all.

Everyone was cool at first and I handed out all six of my beers and got a Bud in return. I was cool with that since they were being cool. I just started lightly strumming my guitar as I was chatting with this really cool girl. She asked me if I knew ""3 little birds"" by Bob Marley so I started playing it. 

All of the sudden this dude just started making fun of me. I don't know exactly what he said but it was like ""we're all friends from Indiana University and this douche thinks he can play guitar over our conversation"" (again not exact but I know he mentioned IU  and called me a douche). The girl I was talking to said don't worry about him and asked me to keep playing so I kept playing. The guy got up and got literally in my face and said that if I didn't take my guitar and get the fuck out so he could talk with his girl friend he was going to shove it up my ass, then burn it then throw it in the lake. This time even the girl didn't stick up for me and I said that it was really lame to take my beer and not be cool. He said IPA is shit for hippies and burn outs from Oregon (good call for a dumb ass, he nailed that) and that it made me smell like shit. I got up and left and the entire group was laughing at me as I left, even the girl who asked me to play the song. I was camped a few spots over from them and I could hear them partying for a long time but they were gone before I woke up this morning. 

It was such and unnerving experience, was I the asshole there? I don't want to make that same mistake again.

My parents are incapable of supporting anything above a minimum wage job as a result of their lack of postsecondary education along with my father's disability from work and my mother's alcohol addiction which has cost her countless job losses.
The house they wish to live in is what is my soon-to-be deceased grandmother's house in a different state across the country. My parents always brag about how nice the house is and it seemed to be nice when I went there once. 

The reasons I want to stay consist 

1. Free education because we're poor

2. Family lives here (many uncles and cousins, some of which are in the industry I want to work in when I'm out of school)

3. I'm in a really happy relationship, which my father dismissed with the statement that ""There's other pieces of ass out in ___""

4. I'd be supporting them.

5. My parents aren't very pleasant, they refer to me as degrading shit when they have me do chores or tasks.

After cleaning around a bit, I started to get a nasty headache, largely from the amount of stress I had yesterday, so I decided to lay down to take a nap. My mother decided to pester me about not getting enough sleep and how I ""shouldn't stay up so late on that phone"" while I was trying to sleep.

My mother tells me to ""just take some pills if your head hurts"" and I, rather stupidly and still hazy from half-sleep, ask if it usually helps with her own pressure-based headaches. Instead of answering me, she got defensive and then snatched my phone.

Me, being pissed, went to take my phone back because I got sick of this bullshit she pulls, but she just tries to push me away and """"""playfully"""""" says ""go back to sleep, you don't need more distractions!"" and hands the phone to my dad.

My dad says ""Your mom is the one who took your phone, so she's the one who'll give it back to you."" as if I was still a goddamn teenager. I was fuming at this point, so I popped a couple of painkillers and took my phone back. My dad was pissed and demanded that I give my phone back. I refused and lashed out against him saying that this was between me and my mom who shouldn't have shoved him into this. He tells me I'm behaving like a brat and I just leave the bare phone case there out of spite.

It usually leads to sports talk, which I am more than comfortable in because I played sports and follow quite a few pretty closely. However, I feel that sometimes my privacy/personal space gets invaded with people asking me, and I will dismiss the question. This includes people interrupting phone calls, tapping me on the shoulder when I have headphones on, walking down the street having conversations with other people, but also times where I'm simply existing and can see them staring at me while they think about asking. Usually these people have the same follow-up questions: Basketball? Parent Height? Sibling Height? My sister's roommate's whatever is 6'2"".

I completely understand the curiosity, I do. When I see a person my height, I wonder the exact same thing. Did he/she play a sport? At what level? How good would they be at my sport? So that part isn't lost on me. I choose not ask any questions not because I think it would be an asshole move (I really don't know, that's why I'm making this post) but because I know they get asked all the time, more than most people would guess.

1110,Not the A-hole,"TDLR; my husband thinks we should re-home our puppy because he chews things.

PUPDATE: after all of your guys lovely feedback I’m confident once again that I’m not in the wrong here. When the husband came home from work I laid down the law with him and the younger hims and am proud to announce that no one (not even the husband) will be re-homed.

Second pupdate: you guys I’m not a bad dog mom. My dog has toys to chew on. My dog isn’t left unsupervised all day long with free reign of the house. I promise you the issue is the level of energy in addition to his breed. He’s a lab/collie mix. He just hit 8 months so his puppy teeth are all gone! 

Things you need to know before we delve into the fine details of this nonsense: 
My husband is a cat person, and I am a dog person. Up until recently we’ve only rented and so we got a cat because they were allowed. My husband decided our cat was “lonely” and that she absolutely needed a cat friend. So now we’re two cats in. I help take care of them, do vet appointments, litter box and everything else. 

We bought a house and had a baby, but my husband tells me I can finally get a dog because we have a yard. My husband brings home a THIRD cat as a rescue without consultation. We end up re-homing it a few months later because it is causing absolute havoc (peeing on the baby’s things and does not get along with the existing cats at all). 
During this time I’ve been scouring for a dog that I think would fit in with our family. I’ve always had rescues growing up but since we needed to ensure the dog would get along with the cats and kiddos we decide it would be best to get a puppy. 
Okay background done. Good? Good.

I HAVE HAD PUPPIES BEFORE AND I KNOW HOW MUCH WORK THEY ENTAIL -my husband however, does not. I have spent so much time and energy training our pup. He is crate trained, he knows his basic commands, he gets played with. He’s a good boy. The problem is that our dog likes to chew things (he’s a puppy after all). My husband and kids cannot for the life of them figure out that if they want their things to be safe to put them where the dog can’t get them. 
I don’t see this as a problem and figured I would just play with the dog more to get that puppy energy down. My husband just starts complaining non-stop about how the dog is destroying everything (almost all of which is his and the kids stuff). He’s chewed through extension cords left outside, things placed up against his crate, and other things left behind that shouldn’t be there in the first place. My husband refuses to help play or walk the dog but has threatened to put him up on Craigslist multiple times and has recently asked a coworker if they wanted him. All that gets talked about now is how terrible my dog is and the kids have followed suite.

1112,Not the A-hole,"The first time I caught my son smoking weed when he was 18. A cop brought him home because he was caught with his friends smoking near their high school. The officer was VERY lenient because my son had 0.5 grams of marijuana on him and he could’ve been charged with disorderly conduct and marijuana possession involving a minor which is a felony with an average of a 5-20 year prison sentence.

Instead, they confiscated it and brought him home to my place. He told us to ensure this doesn’t happen again, and he’s informally “sentenced” him to 300 hours of community service for the summer. I thanked him for his kindness and grounded my son for the rest of the summer and forced him to do the community service.

I took away his phone, TV, and all of his electronics, and gave an opportunity to earn back 1 week of freedom in exchange for 1 page about the harmful effects of marijuana on brain development, the possible prison sentences for what he’s doing, incarceration rates of black people and how **real** that reality is (goes without saying we’re black), how it’s a gateway drug and what that means, etc. He did that for 8 pages, so his 3 month punishment became a month.

I told him I never wanted to have this conversation again and until marijuana is legalized, he will NOT be bringing that to my house and risk ME ruining my livelihood. Nor will I allow him risking himself, at least on my watch. He can live with his mother who lives in Colorado if he wants to do that (my son doesn’t think college is for him so he makes $15 an hour working at UPS. We don’t charge him rent, and we demand in exchange for free rent, he saves 2/3rds his money so he can have a nice cushion of at least \~80K in 5 years before he moves out on his own.

Well I caught him smoking again earlier today. I told him I wasn’t having this conversation and that he has 30 days to pack and be at his mom’s house, or to pay for his own apartment. He’s begging for another chance but I already gave him and I made myself clear. If he still wants free rent, he can live with his mom. He doesn’t really want to do that because he’s dating someone. I told him it’s not my problem and will serve him an eviction notice soon.

1117,Not the A-hole,"So I've tried asking for advice on this topic previously on another sub but didn't get much help.

I bought a house with 2 acres in a rural area with a fence surrounding the entire property because I'm not really into hanging out with my neighbors and I just want some privacy.  I have a large electric sliding gate at the front of my property.

Now I have a neighbor which is two older parents probably in their 60's and their 18 year old disabled son.  This kid has been driving me up the wall for the better part of 2 years now.  First he is obsessed with garbage cans.  He has forced my gate open and broke it multiple times to get in to my garbages.  I just spent $2000 having my gate which he broke tore down and replaced with stronger one which he couldn't pry open.  Well a few days ago I caught him on camera (which I also bought specifically for watching out for him) jumping my fence and grabbing my cans and running down my driveway with them.

Additional issues are he makes very loud screaming noises which sends my youngest son running scared into the house when he comes around, my wife was once late for work because she couldn't get out of the driveway after he broke the gate and had to wait for me to come home and fix it, the financial and time expenses he has caused me, the lack of privacy of someone constantly coming on our property, the fact his parents promised me 4 and 5 times over that it won't happen again and it never stops, and last but not least I am concerned he will eventually be hit by a car as people pass our property going 50+ mph and he is regularly near the road unsupervised.

My wife wants me to keep reporting him every incident but my mom whose is a special education teacher said I would be ass and should be supportive to their troubles.  I just want to be left alone.

TLDR: WIBTA if I called the cops on my disabled neighbor that won't leave us alone and has broke our stuff?

Edit:. I don't want anything bad to happen the kid he isn't evil or anything he is just not cared for properly.  I don't know what his disability is but he seems to be of very low intelligence. He cannot talk and doesn't seem to understand what I'm saying when I try to talk to him.

1118,Not the A-hole,"Context: I live alone with my brother. He totaled his car last December and is usually borrowing mine to do stuff. Nothing important, just for groceries and for bringing his girlfriend to spend time with him (her house is a 5 min walk distance)

Today, he used my car for something equally unimportant and the battery failed. No big deal.
I was to get another one today, but since it's kind of late, I couldn't, and I asked him to get one tomorrow. I would pay, obviously.

What made me not want to borrow him my car again was that he responded with a crude ""no"" to my request and the reason was that the car was mine and not his. The thing is, everything he does, he asks for my car, even it's a 5 minute walk distance, and most of the time I dont even ask for gas. I never said no to him, but now, I think he deserves to be walking or getting uber to places.

But on the other hand, I'm feeling petty and guilty for thinking that.

More info: I'm 23, he is 22. He doesn't help with insurance or documents regarding the car. We are both unemployed uni students with the same aliment pension money we receive from our father.
We have almost no expenses since our mother let us live in her house without paying rent, water or electricity. So I use my money for food, gas, maintaining my car, books and equipment required for internships or laboratory classes. Since he never goes to uni and is basically a leech, I dont know what he spends his money on besides pizza (that's harsh buts it's the truth and he even acknowledges it), and he's perfectly able to spend some in uber or even hold money to get another car.

Anyway, today he came running at me, arms up like he was asking for a hug. I was cornered at my register and tried saying “no no thank you” but he kept coming up to me and planted a kiss on my shoulder, full of chocolate-stained drool (which left a nasty spot on my uniform). I felt really uncomfortable about this, almost violated. I feel like I had no power to do anything to stop him. 

To add to that, a few years ago, he lifted up his shirt and I saw his penis, which obviously was uncomfortable and unwanted.

1120,No A-holes here,"Just realized this is my second post about bachelorette parties haha.

This past week I went to Ibiza for a 5 day bachelorette. I live in the states so this was obviously a massive, expensive vacation. When all was said and done, I probably spent ~2,500, on flights, the villa we stayed in, meals, transport, etc.

It has been a dream of mine to go to Spain for a long time so I was super excited for this trip! I did everything asked of me In preparation for the trip, including mailing party decorations to Spain, venmoing the organizer on time for everything etc.

There was a semi-strict itinerary that involved dinners, scuba trip, beach days, clubbing days, etc. Anytime there was a group activity like dinner in a themed outfit or going on a boat, I did it.

The problem started on the scuba trip. We all paid around $250 American to go on this trip. Well, when we got on the water, the other girls just wanted to take pictures on the boat and I was the only one who actually went scuba diving. I stayed out by myself with the instructor for the whole excursion. No one seemed really bothered but it was obvious I’d separated myself. 

That night we all did dinner together, next morning went to the beach together, etc.

The following day I wanted to explore the town. No one else did, they wanted to lay on the beach again. So, I went by myself. I had a great time! 

This continued for several days where the girls just wanted to take pictures on the beach every day and I wanted to do activities or visit places I’ve dreamed my entire life about. Every day I made sure to participate in something if it was a legit plan, like a cooking class, which I loved. I also made all the pregames and dinners. For breakfast sometimes Iventured with one or two girls (out of 15) to a local spot.

Now it’s the end of the trip and I get the feeling everyone thinks I’m a bad friend. I genuinely don’t know. IMO this was my vacation too, that I paid for, and I shouldn’t have to stick with the group 100% of the time.",123,1145,0.96

My mom announced the other day that she had decided what she wants the baby to call her: Mormor. It's Norwegian for ""grandmother (mother's mother)."" My dad is going with Grandpa.

Some background: we are white Americans with families that have been here for generations. My mom has always been into family history but has gotten more into genealogy since she retired. She has always had an affinity for the Norwegian element in our family history and has really fixated on it (my name is actually technically a Norwegian name, but one that is super common for Americans my age too), and has found and gotten I touch with some distant Norwegian cousins. I love Norway and think our distant cousins are lovely, but I have never understood my mom's over-identification with that branch of the family specifically. Our Norwegian ancestors came to America in the 19th century, and she is at best 1/8th Norwegian. Meanwhile, we're both more than half English, but she shows little interest in anything British. The Norwegian branch is through my mom's mom, whom I called Grandma, and my mom called her mom's mom Grandma. Because we're American. Nobody has used Norwegian words for generations or spoken the language. 

When my mom said she wanted to be called Mormor, I told her my immediate reaction, which was, ""isn't that a little...contrived?"" My mom asked why, and I said because we're not Norwegian, we're American. She was surprisingly non-defensive and said she didn't have to use it if we hated it. I backed off of that and told her I wasn't going to tell her what to do. She said we can talk about it more later. My husband and I have talked about it and have a hard time imagining referring to my mom as Mormor to our daughter. It feels like indulging a weird exoticization of Norway and Norwegian-ness and kind of embarrasses us. But she’s also 70 and this is her only grandchild.

That’s when I tell her “no like me and you” this is when she starts telling me things like “yeah you can do do that” indicating to me that I’m free to do whatever but she is only there to see her family and she hasn’t seen them for a year and probably won’t see them for the rest of the year.

Am I the asshole for being annoyed that she wants this to be just a trip to see her family? I feel like I’m the third wheel here.

The family next door to us are pretty good friends and I adore their youngest two daughters, especially the youngest, Princess (not her real name, I just spoil her, she’s very well behaved)

Princess and her friend who is there almost every day looked to see what was going on, my mom noticed them and asked if they wanted a popsicle. I buy them some every summer and they just come and get them when they want, I knew that giving the two of them popsicles would mean I would have to give this Satan baby one too so I put my doggo on my hip and said “No popsicles, I told this hard-headed girl to leave the dog alone and she didn’t listen so no one gets anything!”

The other kids protested loudly but I wasn’t having it. I took doggo into the house and came back out, I called Princess over and told her she and her friend could come and get a popsicle later but that the other girl couldn’t have one because she scared the dog and that was mean. Princess said “Okay” And bounced off, all smiles.

Mom thinks I went too far but I think that the child didn’t deserve a popsicle, however I also think it would have been cruel to give everyone one but her so I just withheld them completely, at least until she leaves. AITA?

My daughter on the other hand is a different story; her phone is always blowing up with snapchats and text messages from people with male names (I don’t read their messages; I just see the name pop up on her home screen) and she’s always talking about what guys are cute or whatever. I think she’s too young to be talking to all these different guys; but I digress.

&#x200B;

Last week, she invited some guy to her room while we were home. I thought it was weird and brought up to my wife and she didn’t really think anything of it. I came home today and my wife said a guy was over again, so I went upstairs and opened the door to the two of them making out with no shirts on. She tried to scream at me to get out and got mad how I didn’t knock and I told her it was MY house and that what the hell is she doing upstairs with a guy. I told the dude to leave and he was like a deer in headlights and ran. I told her that she’s WAY to be young to be having guys over and for now on, she’s only to hang out in the basement with the door open (of which, I can pretty much hear everything because I work from home one floor above in the kitchen. The basement also has a TV so it's not like they'd have nothing to do). She tried to complain and I told her I’m the parent, what I say goes, end of discussion.

&#x200B;

I talked to my wife about it later and she didn’t completely oppose the basement idea, but maintained that she’s a high schooler now and I can’t stop her from having sex. Which I get, she’s a teenager, I used be one too; if they REALLY want it, they will find a way, but that way will NOT be a free pass in my house. My wife’s parents were very sexually open, so her parents had 0 problem letting her bring boyfriends over at 13, but she was also taken advantage of by older, manipulative guys, as a result of this openness so she understood my POV.

&#x200B;

My daughter is still pissed at me, saying I’m treating her like she’s a kid (which I am, because she is). I’m normally the laidback parent so this is the first time this has happened to me. I don’t THINK I’m being unreasonable, but I’m open to criticism IF I am. Wanted to get an objective POV.

&#x200B;

Edit: Forgot to mention that she can also only bring home guys when I'm home. We have a home security system that takes pictures/videos when someone enters the house, so I'm not too worried about her doing it behind my back. I'll also go down there randomly/periodically when one IS over.",323,557,0.9
1130,Asshole," [UPDATE ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bx6epc/update_aita_for_not_wanting_my_parents_to_know/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) 

My boyfriend was born in America but his parents are from Argentina, and he speaks Spanish, eats traditional culture and has various traditions from Argentina. But he is very light skin ( as his ancestors are from Europe ) and his name is Benjamin. So it isn’t very obvious that he is a Latino except that you hear him speaking Spanish.

Now, I don’t have a problem with him beign a Latino but my parents are very conservative. The “ all Latinos are criminals “ type of conservative. My brother once had an “exotic” girlfriend and my parents didn’t like it at all. So  when we decided that it was time to him to met my parents, I told him to hide that he was Latino. He was alright with that.

Once we were having dinner with my parents they ask about his last name ( Rossi ) and he explained that his grandparents were from Italy. My father, beign like he is, said “ for a moment I thought you were an illegal “ ( because for him all Latinos are illegals ). Then my mother followed with another comment and my father with another and they basically started insulting all Latinos. I could see my boyfriend being really uncomfortable, specially when my father ask him if he agreed with them. Lather that night, when we had left my parent’s house he told me that he wasn’t going to hide his ethnicity any longer, that he felt insulted.
I understand my boyfriend but my parents love him. And I don’t want to sacrifice my relationship with them because of my boyfriend, but I don’t want to left him either. I think that he should hide it a little longer at lest until they accept him or once we are already living together or something.

UPDATE:

After all your comments I saw it. I was being a horrible person and i was also being racist when I tried to defend my parents. I wanted to fix things. First I apologize with my boyfriend, he said it was okay and not my fault, although I am not sure anymore if he is being honest and not lying so that I don’t feel bad. And then the hard part, telling my parents. 
 
I decided to go alone.I had started this mess and I had to fix it, and I knew it wasn’t going to be nice so i didn’t want my boyfriend to also go through this. I went for lunch with my parents. After we finished we were talking. I started with “hey did you liked Benjamin?”, they did like him. Then I told them that I needed to tell them something, they looked me directly in the eyes probably thinking I was pregnant or something. And then I told them. I was prepared for shouting, but no, It was only silence. After a couple of minutes my dad said “ so you date one of those..” and continue with a lot of insults. My mother tried to convince me to dump him, I told them “ didn’t you like him? He didn’t seem like a nice guy?, but then my father went about how they always seem nice when you meet them but then they become into monsters.

The discussion when for a couple of minutes, me trying to let them see that he was a nice person and then ignoring me and continuing with their insults. I simply left. I feel like shit now, for what I did and for what I have now done. My parents are racist, but i love them, they raised me and give me a lot of good memories. But I also love my boyfriend and I decided i prefer keeping my relationship with him. I don’t know why Amy parents going to do, not talk to me ever, or talk to me but only to insult him. But I did it, it didn’t fix what i did but at lest I feel a little bit better.

Thanks for all the people that respond to my post. I know a lot of you aren’t going to forgive me and are going to call me a racist. But at lest you help me see what I did wrong and how I was hurting my boyfriend.",1071,2573,0.9
1131,No A-holes here,"My husband is the best man for a wedding we will be traveling out of state to later this month.  The bride and groom will also be traveling to this location, as it takes place in the brides hometown, where her family still lives.  Bride and groom will be staying with her family the week prior to the wedding.

My husband just mentioned to me that groom asked if he could stay with us the night before the wedding, and my husband said OK without checking with me.  I am not OK with this.   

AITA for insisting my husband tell the groom he cannot stay with us?


EDIT:  I want to say that I do want to take back my final question above.  I was angry when I wrote that and realized shortly after how awful that was.  Whats done is done and I absolutely DO NOT want to make the groom uncomfortable during his special time.  Seriously guys I get it.  

I AM upset though that my husband agreed to this without asking me, and I honestly believe this shouldn't have been asked of him us in the first place.  I also want to add some context below that will maybe help some of you stop thinking I am the devil in the flesh.

We are all in our late 40's, this grooms second marriage, grooms second destination wedding, and second time my husband has been the best man.  This is about the groom, who makes more than my husband and I combined, not wanting to pay for a hotel room that night.  That is all.  I am not keeping the two of them from hanging out and getting drunk and reminiscing, and neither of them are big drinkers.  I wasnt planning on locking my husband and myself in the room after the rehearsal dinner.  We of course would spend the rest of the evening with the groom, or they can do something without me, I am fine with either.  Contrary to what alot of you are assuming, I do like the groom and never stated otherwise.   I just feel at the end of the night that groom should be sleeping in his own room.  And this is NOT the same as having someone stay at your house, and in fact groom has stayed at our home.  This is about sharing a tiny living space with someone I am not very close with, and wanting my own space.",176,220,0.92
1132,No A-holes here,"Yes. I get it. She is 16. She has a boyfriend. They've been together for more than an year. And they are probably having sex. 

But they do stuff behind closed doors whenever he is here. And I don't want to know anything about it. So on Sunday, when we were having breakfast, I bought this up. I told my daughter that she can't do anything sexual when they are in the house. At this point my daughter started crying and she was like- ""We are not allowed to do anything in our house and his house. Where should we do anything then? On the street?"". She left after that. 

My husband had a wtf expression on his face. And he agreed with her and told me that it would be unsafe to do anything outdoors and it is better if they did it under supervision. I just can't believe it. I thought my husband would support me. Was I the asshole here?",1035,4233,0.94
1133,No A-holes here,"My older brother and I were 13 years apart, but he died suddenly when I was 4 - he was 17. Obviously, my parents took it really hard and they were scared I would too. At the time, I don't think I knew what was happening at all, but my parents made it a priority to have me in grief counseling, which I did up until a year after he passed. To this day, I have absolutely no memory of him. I don't know his voice, face, etc. except for what I've seen in photos or videos.

I don't know if I'm going to explain this well, but I feel like my parents have always placed more emphasis on our relationship than actually existed/exists? They always talk about how as a little kid, if I was having a fit, I'd just see him and start to calm down, or how we were ""two peas in a pod"" and inseparable, how my older brother was so excited to have a little brother to teach and how they see so mcuh of him in me or whatever. But I don't remember any of that. When people ask me if I have siblings I say no, because I don't and it feels like I never did. I have no connection to him, I just don't feel anything towards him. He sounds like a great guy but I don't know that.

Anyways, my parents are hosting their annual memorial for his birthday, and they want me to speak. Before, they thought I was too young but apparently 16 is the perfect age to talk about your dead brother. I hate talking about him or the memorial with my parents because they get really sad and nostalgic and it makes me feel uncomfortable because they start up with the ""you look so much like him"" and I just feel suffocated. My friends are torn - half think it'd be rude if I didn't just make up something generic and go, the other half think I should just skip the memorial altogether if it makes me feel weird. I feel like any adult in my life will automatically tell me to speak because it's the right thing to do for my parents, but I don't want to. It would all be generic lies or parroting stories my parents have told me a million times.

1134,Asshole,"I work at a summer camp as the head leader for little children (max age 12) and we have hs volunteers who help us out.

We have this one intern who is super lazy and never does any work, honestly it would make me mad if he was getting paid, but its just hours so whatever.

We were having an activities time and lo and behold, the lazy intern wasnt doing anything, when we started to play basketball he became extremely interested. We have speakers in the office and he asked if he could play music. I told him it's not for him but he can play some music for the kids. I told him he can basically play anything that doesn't have swearing, I thought that was easy enough.

He told me he would play a playlist that he has that he made specifically for something like this. I left to do some paperwork and when I came back he was blasting the most profane music that was a mix of like metal and rock. On top of that I saw all the kids just sitting on the sides of the gym, wandering around in the halls, and doing things unsupervised while the lazy ass intern was playing 1 on 1 with another volunteer.

I told him to come to my office, where I had a long talk with him. He constantly rolled his eyes and looked around the room. Finally I told him that he could leave and not to come back. He then said 

""I honestly couldnt care less, you've signed my volunteer hours and thats all I need for the coming school year.""

He left, but before doing so, he turned on his bluetooth and blasted a song that had like 5 swear words for every 5 seconds the song played.

I noticed he left his volunteer hours sheet which had upwards of 30+ hours on it, I took one look at it and ripped it up and thought nothing of it.

While I was closing up I noticed he was trying to get inside the building begging for his hours back. He told me that he needed it because he was gonna be taking night classes on top of a full schedule during his final year in hs, and it will be near impossible to get them during the school year.

His parents called, and my supervisors and a lot of people who heard about what I did called me an asshole, quite frankly I feel like it was a bit harsh, but he basically did nothing for the time he's been working at our summer camp, and I don't think he deserves to have them at all, so AITA?",70,65,0.9

UPDATE: I have requested they install a covered trash can and include the rule in their listing. The response was a canned ""thank you for your feedback; we will consider your request""

I'm more inclined toward a negative review and calling support if they do not install the covered trashcan and take the matter seriously. We shall see. 

---------------------------------------

EDIT: This is in the US. 

To preface, there is no way for me to simply change reservations, so please do not advise or suggest that as an alternative. It cannot be done. 

I have a place booked for two weeks, from the 31st to the 14th. The place is immaculately clean, the hosts are respectful of privacy, provide extra amenities, and the space is quiet. It even has a/c. 

This is a five star experience...or would be if it weren't for this one thing. 

On the wall in the bathroom, it says ""please no paper in the toilet!""

I assumed this meant paper towels, perhaps feminine products, as English is not the hosts' first language. But no. They mean toilet paper. 

So every day, in a tiny trash can in the bathroom that doesn't even have a lid, there is shitty toilet paper. They dont even have the decency or forethought to fold the paper so there aren't skid marks screaming from the ivory mound of paper. 

And I just find this so utterly unsanitary and disgusting that my prissy, gut reaction is to leave a one star review. But I'm conflicted as everything else is perfect. 

Since we cannot leave and find other accommodations, I don't want to bring the problem to the hosts. Ideally, that's what I would do, leave, and give a four star review. I realize it's not their fault  we have to stay, but it is objectively unsanitary and just...to me, insane. 

I want to be fair and don't know how to be, so please, 
if you think I WBTA, please also state what review you would leave instead.

Edit2: I also have no reason to believe the septic system can't handle it. There are eight guests and NO ONE but the hosts are not flushing their toilet paper. Which might make us assholes if there really is a problem that arises later, but I'm not alone in the household refusing to let my skiddies shine.",179,195,0.91

My wife and I are in our mid 30s and recently had our first child. We’re both Christian and want to have our son baptized in our faith (no comments on religion please). The issue is that since we got married, my in-laws, specifically my SIL, have intruded on our marriage and have begun overstepping boundaries that my wife established now that we have a baby. It got to the point where we went very low contact with them for awhile just to adjust to being new parents and having time to ourselves as a nuclear family. 

Call it pride, stubbornness, or what have you, there were mistakes made by all parties involved and it was only recently that we’ve reconciled enough to meet at family functions and be civil to each other. 

Last weekend during a cousin’s birthday party, our baby’s baptism came up and we mentioned that we had already asked the prospective godparents and that everything was already planned. My SIL immediately got upset that she wasn’t chosen and left for the restroom teary eyed. My MIL asked us if there was any way to make her one. My wife told her mom that it was too late and we had taken a lot of time to think about who we wanted as god parents and were happy with our choices. When my MIL asked me if I agreed, I told her the same thing and that my own brother wasn’t chosen but he wasn’t offended. 

My SIL came back to the conversation at this point and accused me directly of not wanting her as a godparent because of the recent tension. I was honest and told her that despite our problems, her sister and I had both decided we wanted a married couple (she’s single and hates the idea of marriage) as god parents who might one day provide additional marital and parental guidance to our child. Please note that we support any lifestyle choice but wanted our child to have the option of going to another, familiar married couple for advice in the future.  

She shouted that this was to get back at her for all the drama in the family. I had reached the limit of my patience at this point and told her that it wasn’t about her but our child. If she couldn’t understand that, then she really wasn’t ready to be a godparent to anyone. 

I knew it was wrong of me to say but before I could apologize, she started crying again and left the party. I apologized to my in-laws and wife for what I said but they just told me to give her time to get over it. My wife told me it’s not their choice, it’s ours. 

The sad thing is that I don’t know if my SIL will get over this and I feel really bad about hurting her feelings. AITA for not considering her as a potential godparent?",28,136,0.96

1143,Not the A-hole,"It’s been a couple months since I’ve started working at a small pet clinic and I’d like to think I have a good relationship with my coworkers. They’re all fairly older than me and we have decades of years between us, so while I think of them as friends, I don’t really speak with them as I would with people my age. My boss recently created a new Instagram and has found my Facebook account. Both of which she has sent a request to follow / be my friend. There are things on my social media that I didn’t feel comfortable letting her see, especially because it was a professional work environment, so I ignored both requests and kept to myself.

She approached me about a week later asking if I had seen her requests. It was a bit awkward to say yes and that I deleted them, and I gave the lousy excuse that I didn’t use them often to see. She pulls out her phone in the break room, shows me the screen, and requests to follow me again. She advised me to take out my phone and to accept it. Finally, I told her that I wanted to keep my private life separate from work, and that I would accept it another time. 

Unfortunately she didn’t take that too lightly, and was upset and obviously offended that I said no. She said that social media was outside of work and it was okay for us to be friends. When I told her there were just some things I’d rather keep private, she accused me of having some dangerous, illegal things on my profile and took it to the head hospital manager to reopen my application interview in case I was suspicious of something unprofessional?  She stated something like they needed to rescreen me to make sure my public profile on the internet wouldn’t tarnish the clinic’s reputation. 

Should I have just accepted?

INFO: No, I don’t have anything explicit or illegal on any of my social media, I didn’t want to accept because there are a few things I didn’t want her to see. I’m in a lesbian relationship and I have many photos of my girlfriend and I, and I knew she was somewhat religious and I didn’t want her to judge me. I also have photos of my tattoo that they are not aware about because they do not allow tattoos at the clinic. I wear long sleeve scrubs so they’ve never seen it.

EDIT: Thank you all for putting in your input. They had pulled me aside yesterday for my 3 month review and HR and my boss were there. They brought up the topic of my social media and thankfully HR sided with me. We never signed a disclosure when I got hired regarding my social media so by law, it was out of their jurisdiction and practically none of their business. They saw that all my accounts were marked private and there was nothing that they can find against me anyway. It’s awkward to work with my boss but I’m glad it’s done and over with.

I work in IT for a corporation that you might well have heard of. I have no desire for the corporation or myself to be identified. This corp is large enough to have their own full-time team-building trainers who fall under the umbrella of the HR department. They do other stuff like organizing social events and managing our internal events website. They are both in their early to mid twenties, one guy, one girl. They are responsible for lots of awareness raising, themed days, awful little videos about how nice our corporation is to its employees, etc. Absolute fluff of the highest order.

I'm happy to say they have been off my radar for most of my tenure at the company. That is until this morning's ""Team Dynamics"" event that they call ""Horizon"" for reasons unknown.

The altercation: at one point in this grueling 3-hour event they asked people to get on all fours and bark like dogs. They insisted on it. I should add that this pair of chuckleheads record absolutely everything they do so they can cut it together for the corporate news site, so the girl was in the corner with her camera rolling. This was the final straw for me after a morning of increasingly ridiculous shit designed to 'get us out of our shells'.

I said no, I'm not doing that, and I moved to the back of the boardroom. A few others saw what I was doing and got up off their stinky yoga mats to do the same thing. Chucklehead senior--let's call him David--sees this and rushes up to me with a big grin. David says something like ""everybody's doing it, don't be a spoilsport"". I told him it was not something I was willing to do. I tried to make a joke of it but he wasn't having it. Voices got raised and he asked again a couple of times, he even tried to take me by the upper arm and lead me back to my place.

""Look, anyone who doesn't get involved is getting a verbal warning,"" he says, looking around for support. Was he joking? Maybe.

I flipped. I told him I had 17 years of industry experience and a department that relied on me to function, and he had a polo shirt and a fucking whistle. I stumbled over some of the words but that was the gist. Then I stormed out and slammed the door.

I heard laughter from the meeting room and then a chorus of obedient dog barking from my colleagues. I went out to my car to fume.

1150,Not the A-hole,"A little backstory. Newly married and pregnant. Lucky wedding night. Lol. 

My family loves my husband, sometimes I think they like him more than me! Anyways, we currently rent in California as buying here is insanely expensive. My husband is an attorney and I work for the government, but we plan to have me stay home for a while once the baby is born. On my husband’s salary alone we’d only ever be able to afford an apartment if we stay in CA. Any house we could afford here is not the type of home we incision raising our children in. 

We plan on moving out of state where, not only is housing affordable, my husband would make more money, allowing me to stay home a little longer and not stress so much about hurrying back to work. We’ve spoke extensively about this plan and are set in our decision. 

My mother, on the other hand, wants us to move into one of the homes for sale in her neighborhood. They are well out of our price range, over and hour and a half commute to hubby’s work, and not the kind of houses we want to live in anyways. Plus! They’re too close to my mother, whom I love dearly, but can only take in small doses. 

My mother will not let this go. It’s gotten to the point of her yelling at me, in front of my In-laws, and telling me I’m not going to make it as a mother on my own in a city where I don’t have help. Never mind that I’ll have a loving and supportive husband and all the friends I could ever need at the tip of my social media platforms. 

I’ve become so frustrated with her that I yelled back and told her “fine, you want us to stay? Buy us a house!” She didn’t like that response and replied that she tried helping us get a house right next to her. Her idea of help, I guess, is telling us over and over there’s a house for sale. 

At this point I’m reluctant to spend any time with her at all as this is driving me away from her. We typically spend one night a week together for dinner and sometimes we go over to hang out at the pool on the weekends.

We get to my S/O Mother’s house, (she got fired from her job months ago because she no longer felt the need to show up) and she tells us she has no money for groceries for her new boyfriends daughter (she has autism) so her grocery list is very specific and VERY pricey. Well her new boyfriend isn’t working either, but somehow they have four new bottles of CROWN and huge bulk boxes of Marlboro cigarettes stored in the freezer.

So then she tells us to go to the grocery store ( she doesn’t ask, she tells) to get these groceries for a child we just met literally then and there.  By the time we get back to her house, we find out she had left to the bar and calls me and says she can’t find the cash my s/o loaned to her (I had no idea he did that) we needed to meet her to give her some more. 

By the time we get back from dealing with all this bullshit, I’m exhausted and quite annoyed because now I can’t even afford to get my daughter what she needs, or we can’t afford to give his cousin a graduation present. Because we now need it for gas to go back home. So my s/o mother says, “ why don’t you ask your grandparents to western union you some”like first of all they would but it’s like why the fuck should I even have to ask for them to do that?

I know it sounds shitty, but I would’ve had no problem helping the little girl,but why couldn’t her father do so? Why couldn’t they work to get their needs like I did? Why do I have to ask for help because I had to unwillingly sacrifice my daughters funds just so that little girl wouldn’t be hungry.",22,29,0.92
1153,Not the A-hole,"I love my best friend, but she’s really getting under my skin with this one. 

She’s 22 and engaged to a 34 year old man who has a seven year old child. BFF fits great into their family unit, the daughter loves her, all is swell. But she undermines / attempts to take the place of the child’s mother constantly. It’s weird and frankly uncalled for.

For example, bff will post a picture of her and stepdaughter on Facebook with the captions like “there are no STEPS and HALFS in parenthood. Just moms and dads!” Or “i could be the typical stepmom, or I could just be the best parent I can be! The other day she told me I’m ‘just her mommy’ and best friend! *heart eyes*”

Seeing her around her fiancé and stepdaughter makes it obvious that she puts the idea in this girl’s head to call her “mommy” and to stop telling people that she is a stepparent. If the actual mom gets brought up in conversation, BFF will quickly switch topics. It’s like she wants to erase Mom from the kid’s “family picture”.

I know it isn’t my business, but it seems so damn wrong to me, and it pushes the daughter’s real mother (who is very much around, and very much involved in her daughter’s life) by the sideline. I also feel that it has to be confusing for the child.

1156,Not the A-hole,"My girlfriend and I moved to a new town 5 months ago and bought a newly constructed home, we celebrated the occasion by getting a new Golden Retriever puppy. There is going to be a garage in our backyard but the builder hadn’t started building it yet since the ground hadn’t thawed. This has left us without a fence or grass as they need to construct the garage and then finish grading our lawn. 

Clearly getting a dog during this time wasn’t ideal but it was something we really wanted to do. When there was still snow, we would take her out into the backyard to do her business but now that the snow is all gone we have stopped doing that as the yard has become a mud filled lake. 

For the last month or so, I have been taking our dog to a public green area about two minutes away from home. It is not the largest space but it is the closest spot with natural grass to our home outside of letting her do her business in other homeowners lawns (which feels wrong). It is also clean and doesn’t require me to bathe her each time we go out. At the end of the green space is a wooden fence and on the other side are some 2 storey homes with their back deck facing the green space. I am typically only there for 5 minutes or less. 

The other day a lady came out onto her deck yelling “Jesus F****** Christ”. I thought she must not have seen me and would be embarrassed knowing someone heard her but soon figured out that her comment was directed at me. She told me there were other places for my dog to use as a washroom. I nicely tried to explain that I currently don’t have grass or a proper yard to use for my dog’s bathroom breaks and that this was the closest public space to me. She responded by telling me there is a perfectly good path with natural grass 2 minutes away and that I should take my dog there as it won’t bug anyone. I tried momentarily to reason with her but eventually stopped responding to her comments. I do kind of see her point of view, I probably wouldn’t like to see dogs using the bathroom all day either. However, from a convenience standpoint, I don’t want to take the extra 4 minutes per bathroom break and then spend extra time washing my dog each time she rolls in the path’s “natural grass” and mud.

Even though I feel justified, this has been bugging me for the last few days and I wanted to see if maybe IATA and if I WIBTA if I kept using this public space?

Edit: For some context, I always pick up after my dog and dispose of the bags. I also only go to this spot about 2-3 times maximum per day.",32,30,0.87
1157,Not the A-hole,"Me and my SO are temporarily staying in my hometown which is in another country from where we usually live and study. After having asked around for a place to stay, a friend of a friend offered us their guest room + other facilities in exchange for us paying half the rent. This plan was made and agreed to months in advance. We didn't really have any expectations as to the quality of the flat, and I never asked for specifics regarding the state of the place (my mistake), I simply assumed that the place would be alright since the homeowner seemed nice enough to offer it up and asked for a decent amount of rent money. 

When we arrived, however, the place turned out to be... well, not so pleasant. The hallway and living room was filled with random junk, and our ""bedroom"" turned out to be a cupboard under the stairs. Think Harry Potter, but a bit bigger. The home owner had managed to squeeze in a queen sized double air mattress, but this meant that there was no floor space for any of our stuff as the cupboard also led to the bathroom and one needed to get by the mattress to enter there. Both doors leading to the hallway and bathroom also opened into the room, giving us even less floor space to work with. 

We weren't thrilled by what we saw, but the home owner was super sweet and gave us a warm welcome, seemingly oblivious to our (hopefully) discreet reactions. 

The room had no windows, the door to the hallway could not be properly closed and the fact that it was situated between the hallway and the bathroom meant no privacy whatsoever.  

Keeping up the chirpy atmosphere, the home owner left for a quick run to the shop and me and my SO took this opportunity to check out the entirety of the flat. The whole place reeked of weed and we saw spiders literally everywhere we looked. The hallway, bathroom, living room and our bedroom had spiders of all shapes and colours crawling on the floor, walls and ceiling. In the living room, we were greeted with a wonderful display of old Nazi pins/badges. One can argue that the home owner is simply a history enthusiast who likes collecting relics of the past, but the whole thing just gave us a weird vibe. We never asked, and the homeowner never addressed the pins either, so it remains a mystery. 

We stayed for one night, barely getting an hour of sleep each because of spider paranoia and the uncomfortable mattress, and moved out the next day when the owner was away. I made sure to message them saying we had gotten another offer for a room closer to my work which was too good to pass up. 

I still feel bad for leaving in such a hurry and for thinking that the flat wasn't ""good enough"", especially since the homeowner was being so kind and welcoming to us. My dad is telling me that I'm just being too fussy and that the flat was a perfectly fine place to stay over the summer. I'm starting to doubt our decision to move out. AITA here?

1159,Not the A-hole,"Hello everyone, I was just thrown completely for a loop last night and maybe I really fucked up. I think I'm a decent person and while I'm certainly not a cassanova, I'm also definitely not an in-cel or ""nice"" guy and I've dated a few girls here and there. I'm now 19. 

I am one of a very small handful of people that stayed behind in my college town to take summer classes. All my friends have left so I found a group of people who are also here and all of them seemed cool enough so I've pretty much been hanging out with them every night. I don't drink or smoke out so almost always by the time things wrap up it's usually me and this girl Claire as the last sober/non obnoxious ones since she doesn't do any substance either.  Claire is knockout gorgeous but also sort of a silly tomboy type girl. She's very easy to talk to and is one of the funniest and wittiest people I've ever met. I honest to god thought she was too good for me but I really enjoyed her company. I started to think maybe something was up last Friday when the ""house"" was essentially a hot box and we took a walk in the park down the street and she held my hand and told me how comfortable she was with me. I was still to shy to do anything but it was an awesome moment. 

Last night she and I were in the basement of the house watching a movie and first she hooked her leg over mine and then insisted I take my socks off so we could compare shoe sizes. We then got in like a ""foot wrestling"" match and we were both laughing hysterically. That went on for a while and she sort of laid next to me on the couch. She has a slight lisp so it cracks me up how she says ""boobs"" so she kept saying that word to get me to laugh. Then she said something along the lines of ""if you like how I say it so much, show me your boobs and I'll show you mine."" Before I could even get my shirt up she had her tank top off and braless and I was like holy shit she's fucking naked. 

So at that moment I decided to make a move I went into kiss her but as I was trying to put my hand around her back I landed square on her naked boob. She freaked out. I mean it went from a fun playful evening to her being absolutely furious with me in a matter of seconds. I told her I was really sorry that wasn't what I wanted to happen and she replied with ""I don't even see how that's possible!"" She gathered up her clothes and sort of threw on  sweat shirt and stormed upstairs. I can't get her on text or VM so I think she blocked me. 

i'm so sad because I honestly would have never even tried anything if I thought this would happen because I just loved hanging out with her. I feel like such an idiot for even trying to kiss her much less touching her. I feel awful but was I the asshole?",64,63,0.9

1162,Not the A-hole,"I’m just a little bit bewildered by a situation with a friend of mine. We have been friends over the past few years, and grew close over a shared experience we have had which was quite traumatic and sad, so to me she was a dear friend. 

We originally know each other from living in a similar area and being in the same social group and became closer together as she opened up about experiences on Instagram, which I identified with and we ended up being close.
Her online following has now grown and she has a few thousand followers, and constantly talks about her account and sees it as a huge deal. She often told me how stressed and busy it made her, and she did kind of start to be distant from me and my other friends in favour of ‘bloggers’ to which I didn’t really understand as I don’t spend much time on instagram or care that much about likes and followers, but I’ve always been supportive of her account, followed her, liked things and commented when she’s needed a bit of a boost when promoting a brand. 

She always talked about how you should always be there for friends, and talks about having good values and being a good person etc. on her social media, but recently she became extremely bad at replying and actually being there when I needed her. She’d half make plans with me and then never reply back when I said that I can do that time/date etc and has been increasingly absent and a bit of a crappy friend. 

I bumped into her recently and I was a bit off with her, as to me she was no longer the good friend I used to know. 

She then messaged me to say sorry if she hurt my feelings, and she could tell I was being off with her , and she knows she hasn’t made effort with me recently. This has been brewing in me for about 6 months, so I just said that it’s pretty shitty to make plans and then be uncontactable and not interested in seeing me. She then said that because of her Instagram account, she is so busy that shes not ‘seeing people’ anymore- so she isnt meeting with actual friends anymore because her Instagram account is taking up all her time.  I kind of went in on her a little bit, saying that I’m a real person and meant to be a good friend that she’s being horrible to, and shes putting Instagram followers over our friendship, to which she had no other reply than ‘We all have different opinions, good luck for the future ‘.  

She’s 30 years old and I find this so odd and such arsehole behaviour! Am I the asshole? Or is she?

Edit: for info, the instagram account is not her main job. She has said before it brings her a bit of extra cash and some freebies. I get that everyone has different interests, but no friend has ever dropped me for a side project before!

Edit: for info, people have been asking how many followers she has. Its around 4k.

Edit: also, people have accused me of pushing my friend and saying i’m unsupportive, which is not the case. Ive always been there to support her whilst she had this page and engaged with her when shes said she’s lacking interest on a particular post, I always comment , like, give advice, take photos etc. And her instagram page is what brought us together in the first place",41,218,0.95

1164,Asshole,"Background: For my daughter's school, the administration reached out to me to do a career day presentation as part of a larger career day event.  Approximately 30 parents were involved of varying jobs and levels.  I have a somewhat interesting job (to me) at a pharmaceutical company running a few laboratories but still able to do benchwork.  I'm at a job level where I give presentations constantly, sometimes at moments notice and I'd like to think I'm good at what I do.

Additionally, recently at our take your kid's to work day I did a 60 minute session for an auditorium of kids on exactly what I do.

There also is a bit of tension in the relationship regarding my wife's work status.  With my support my wife gave up her career to be a SAHM until our children entered full time school.  That time has come and gone, the kids have all been in school for years now and she doesn't plan to return to work.  It is somewhat OK from the money side of things since I earn a good salary, however I'd be lying if I said it wasn't an issue in my head.

Issue: Just before leaving for the presentation, my wife started in with  ""For the presentation, you should talk about..."".  That struck a pretty sour note for me since she 1) really doesn't know what I do 2) I am a skilled presenter and public speaker with fresh and relevant experience with kids of this age group.

I responded (although cutting her off) ""No, I'm already all set with the presentation, thanks"".  This didn't go over well.  On one hand I feel like the asshole for cutting her short like that before being able to contribute, but on the other hand I am still a little put off by her telling me what I should say about my career when she has a basic understanding of it at best.

I know this is going to blow up in the near future (we've been avoiding each other), and I need a bit of a calibration.

EDIT:  It looks like an asshole consensus!  Apparently I have some apologizing to do and stop avoiding some difficult discussions.",73,87,0.88
1165,Not the A-hole,"So I am roommates with my sister (I DO NOT recommend). In our household , everything you buy is yours and doesn’t have to be shared. Or at least that’s *normally* the case. 

I eat more than a lot of people. Hell I eat more than people that are almost twice my weight most of the time. I’m also trying to bulk up as I go to the gym, so I have to get  plenty of groceries that can last me day after day.  I assumed I could just leave my groceries in the pantry and fridge and expect them to be untouched as of course, I didn’t buy them to share because then they last me an even shorter time.

My sister doesn’t spend a single cent towards the groceries I bring home. She rarely does grocery shopping herself and just gets fast food or just makes spaghetti. Yet I’ll check the fridge and see this and that grocery item of mine has been depleted somewhat or opened already. This annoys me because I’m trying to make these groceries last as long as possible because I’m trying to save money so I can treat myself for once. (I haven’t been able to for a long time but that’s a whole entirely different thing.)

*Hey OP, just ask or tell her to stop ya goof!* 
I’ve actually tried that. Before we lived in an apartment together we lived with our mother and I was doing the same thing then that I do now, buying groceries to make me last and such. Long story short within another story, my sister came back from college (300 miles away), ate my groceries, I assumed she mistook them for ones my mother purchased and very kindly, even in a joking manner, told her they were actually mine. She told me to shut the fuck up and that she didn’t care. I was actually kinda taken aback by that so I didn’t even know how to react. 

Also more info on my sister, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a couple years ago. And for about as long as I’ve known her, she gets into incredible rages when she does not get what she wants. I witnessed her cuss out our own aunt (the 2nd closest family member in her life to her) because my aunt was worried she might be developing a drug and alcohol addiction(as a minor) and was pleading she just tone it down a bit. Basically, if I believe if I tell her to stop again, she’ll lose it, I’ll lose it and we’ll be a divided household. 

Today I wanted to one of my favorite desserts. It comes in a box and there’s 6 of em. I get it and there was one left. That brings the total of how many of it I’ve had to 3. Yeah, she ate the other 3. So instead of going the petty route and start eating whatever she brings home, I’m close to thinking I should just buy a mini fridge and shelf to keep in my room to just keep her away from my groceries. 

AITA if I do this?

TL;DR
Sister keeps eating groceries she doesn’t pay for. Telling her stop would most likely anger her and divide us. I will probably keep my all groceries in my room now.",55,172,0.94

1174,Not the A-hole,"So this happened a week ago but I’m not entirely sure if I was justified.

I work in a retail position and I’m normally on the register to let people buy stuff. Of course this is the brunt of where shitty people really shine, as most retail employees know.

It was a really rough day. I had to come in on a shift I wasn’t scheduled for and I was already pissed with management for not listening to my schedule. I was also running around to do online orders and labour and helping customers on the floor and it was just a huge mess since two people called in sick. I was exhausted. Furthermore, the boomers that came out to play were worse behaved than normal. Basically, my patience was wearing thin.

So then this couple comes along. I greet them and request their membership info, and they... well, didn’t say anything. So I just carried on. The female then got mad about the fact I didn’t take her phone number. I explained that the male said you didn’t have one. She then gave me her phone number and I entered it, and they gave each other some smirky look. I was suspicious.

I was scanning their stuff and their items were in big boxes, and one of them was a soft mat for a dog crate. I was pulling the mat across when little papers I’m supposed to put into every bag ended up falling all over the floor. The male kicked some papers towards me, but he didn’t help, and he kicked the ones that were more in his way than anything. I quickly scanned the items in their cart and then picked up the papers, but I was so tired from earlier and my back was DYING, and I groaned. I then heard the female chuckle and when I glance up, she’s pointing at me and whispering something to her friend. 

This is when I place the papers on my till and mumble “thanks for your help,” and hand them their receipt. The male then unloads on me, shouting “OH, YOU’RE WELCOME,” and then I kind of snapped and told him that maybe if he and his wife weren’t too busy making fun of me and giggling like idiots, maybe he could’ve acted more like a decent and respectful member of society, and that acting too cool for service workers makes him look like a dickless jerk. They abruptly left. 

AITA? I just really, really wasn’t having it.

1177,Everyone Sucks,"About a month ago my boyfriend and I bought a thoroughbred kitten from a breeder. She’s been doing this for around 15 years and has won a ton of awards from cat shows.

My boyfriend and I show up and her house is disgusting. Messy which is understandable, but I mean filthy- smelled so strongly of piss I started feeling sick after around 10 minutes. We even saw one of the males jump up on a table and piss right in front of us.

She’s got like 12 cats running around, 4 adults and the rest listens from 2 recent litters. The mom of the cat we adopted was already sequestered with a male so that they could mate- this cat had just given birth to 7 kittens 3 months prior. 

There was another pregnant cat who just seemed in such bad shape, so tired and just... not having it. I don’t know much about breeders or breeding cats, but that house does NOT seem up to code- and making a female get pregnant a mere 3 months after giving birth seems cruel.

We were there for a while talking to this lady and filling out paperwork and whatnot and she shares a bit about her life with us- she has limited mobility from a recent surgery and persistent back problems. She’s divorced and has two grown kids but from what we could gather- they both live pretty far away and she doesn’t seem to hear from them often. We are pretty sure that her livelihood is breeding these cats, but in her current state, I think she has become completely overwhelmed with it and is now really going overboard on the breeding and selling of her cats which most people do as more of a hobby unless they have a TON of space/ability to do it right.

I’m pretty sure that if we reported her she’d lose her licence and maybe her cats- it would probably destroy her financially and emotionally since despite everything, she loves her cats. I just really think those animals are not being treated properly, and I think she needs to stop what she’s doing since she clearly is incapacitated.

1182,Not the A-hole,"I earn a significant income and I expect it to grow more in the coming years. My investments will also mature in a few years in which I can expect to be decently wealthy. I’m saying this to emphasize that in an event of a divorce, I have a lot to lose. 

I have told my fiancé several times that I will not marry without some sort of protection or guarantee for my financial future. At the time she agreed, but now I think she simply said whatever it took at the time to get me onboard with marriage. She probably didn’t think I was serious but I certainly was and am. 

I talked this over with my lawyer and he drafted what I consider to be a pretty ironclad prenuptial agreement based on my concerns. He even suggested adding an infidelity clause which I didn’t think of, but certainly welcomed the suggestion. 

I talked this over with my fiancé and told her to go over the prenup with her lawyer to see if we can reach mutually agreeable terms. She got VERY offended that I even felt the necessity for one. To say she got upset would be an understatement. She was particularly offended by the infidelity clause. I certainly did not expect this reaction from her. She is now insisting that she will sign no prenups. 

Her reaction is making me have second thoughts. She claims that I’m not respecting our relationship and I’m expecting it to fail, which is not true. However, life is unpredictable and anything can happen at anytime so I’m just trying to protect my financial future in case of a divorce. 

I’m beginning to question everything after her response, especially to the infidelity clause. I thought we had a good relationship and never questioned her loyalty before, but why should she get so offended if there is nothing to hide ? It really feels like she would prefer to take me to the cleaners in the event of a divorce.

Keep in my mind, most of the terms in the prenup, including the infidelity clause also applies to me. She is more than welcome to modify it because I’m faithful and have nothing to hide. But at this point I’m planning on just calling the whole thing off.

1183,No A-holes here,"My husband and I met online, he's moved far away to live here with me. We have a small house and now a baby's due in a few weeks. 

His relationship to his mother is hard to describe. To put it short, I'd say they've always been together, but they've never been very close. It was a big shock for her when he decided to move so far away. 

Now after a while of her getting accustomed to the fact that we're married and have a baby on the way, she now seems to share the excitement and I'm very happy about that. We've talked about her visiting us overseas when the baby's born. 

&#x200B;

Now we recently brought up the topic that she can't stay as a houseguest with us. We did point out that we'd love to have her here and spend time with her, but she can't sleep at our place. We offered to help look for accomodation in our area (there's holiday home here close by). My own mother offered to come visit around the same time as her, so they could share an appartment and split the costs. 

Our main reasons for this are that we don't want her (or any other houseguest, for that matter) while we're having a newborn for the first time, and also that we don't have the space. The former guest room is now the nursery, where the baby's things, clothes and changing table is. We also consider it too stressful to have a stranger in our intimate family space right after the baby's born. We're uncertain how hard it will be (sleep deprevation, hormonal changes) and a house guest would certainly add to the stress level massively. Especially since the relationships are not super close to our mothers.  
My own mother also reacted slightly hurt by the fact she can't sleep on our couch when I told her, but she took it much better than my MIL.

1185,Not the A-hole,"I'm 21 and my older sister is 35. I was raised as her little brother since birth. Two years ago I found out that my sister is actually my biological mother and that my parents who raised me are biologically my grandparents. It was a shock to me but I've had two years to process this information and I think I've come to terms with it. I still consider my grandparents as my parents. I was raised by loving and caring parents and never had to want for anything. I love them dearly. 

On the other hand my sister and I had a very difficult relationship growing up especially during my teenage years. I felt that she was extremely overbearing and overprotective. Even though my parents allowed me to go out with friends and gave me a curfew (11pm) my sister would often call and demand to know where I was, what I was doing, who I'm hanging out with etc. She tried to stop me from doing things she thought were too dangerous. She tried to stop me from swimming in our condo swimming pool because there was no life guard there despite the fact that the pool is tiny and not very deep. She also secretly asked her boyfriend to tail me and my friends when we went cycling at the beach because she was afraid I would drown in the ocean. I was 17 at the time. Me and my friends were cycling and I turned around and saw her boyfriend casually following us on a rented bicycle. It spoiled my mood and ruined the outing. At the time I thought she was just being a weird, overprotective sister. My friends all thought she was really weird. None of their older sisters behaved this way. But now it all makes sense. 

Since she revealed to me the truth about my adoption she thinks she can transition into a more parental figure in my life. I am really uncomfortable with that. I was raised for many years as her brother. It's just strange to see her as a parental figure after so many years. She made an emotional post on facebook about how she finally told her ""son"" the truth and ""reconnected with him"" as a mother. I didn't say anything at the time but was very uncomfortable with it. Yesterday she reintroduced me to a family friend as her ""long lost son"" in front of my mother/grandmother. I was pissed and said out loud that she is my sister and will always be my sister. She's not my mother and will never be my mother. I can't explain why I was so angry. But I was really furious. She burst into tears and left the room. Didn't come out for the rest of the night. My parents haven't said anything to me directly but the family friend thinks I was too harsh and that she was ""just joking"". I haven't spoken to my sister since yesterday night.

1187,Not the A-hole,"Crucial information here is we both suffer from depression and have been seeing each other for just over 8 months. 

So my boyfriend and I both study full time. At the beginning of this year he stressed to me that it was going to be a big year for him and he needed me to respect that. It’s my final year of my honours degree so I agreed that work would have to take priority.

He’s always offered me an open door when I’m feeling down and I’ve often taken him up on it. There have been times that I’ve just gone to his house and spent time in the same space as him for support. He’s always maintained this is ok, but now he’s turning around and saying this time I spent with him has ruined his academic process for the year and he has no work to show (he’s a digital illustrator) 

He maintains that because of the stress of the relationship, and me not understanding when he needed space, that he hasn’t been able to complete his work.

There is part of me that understands my responsibility: I should have been more proactive giving him the time and space he needed to work however I am 100% NOT responsible for him sleeping all day, playing games, going out, getting distracted by movies and telling me “yes absolutely you can come over” and then turning around when he has a deadline and telling me I stopped him getting his work in on time.

All year I’ve kept up a constant stream of communication with him about the space he needs and whether or not it’s ok for me to come over and he’s never really been upfront about whether or not he doesn’t actually want me there. He has a nasty habit of saying yes when he means no.

Also I find it frustrating that when I point out his lack of effort on his part, he just defaults back to “The stress of the relationship” causing the issues

He’s been given MULTIPLE opportunities to go into remission and get the work done. His lecturers have been really understanding but he still hasn’t done it. The responsibility of this then falls squarely on my shoulders. 

It’s at the point where if I talk about any academic success of mine he gets sulky and resentful that I’m passing and he isn’t. It’s really hurtful to me and I refuse to accept responsibility for his academic failure. I can understand how I added to his stress but in the end it’s in his shoulders. And over the last 3 months I’ve tried extra hard to make sure I’m not in the way. 

I’ve been stressed too this year and I haven’t failed my semester. I feel like I’m the scapegoat here and I refuse to take responsibility (more than I already have) for his academic struggles. 

So AITA here? Have I actually had more of a direct responsibility for his failure than I’m willing to admit?

I have family in the Philippines that live in run down areas of the country. They can barely afford medication for sick family members and can't afford clothing. My parents gives them a hefty amount of money every month for their basic needs. However, I have cousins who I barely know message me on Facebook asking for more money because of unexpected emergencies. I also have family who message me asking me to find them romantic partners in the U.S. so it'd be easier to immigrate here.
I am a full time student who is currently paying off student debt, struggling to keep a roof over my head as it is, but I do have a couple thousand saved incase of emergencies.

They also see the clothes I'm wearing through my Facebook photos and ask to send them over. I've sent old clothes that I no longer wear in the past, but they continue to ask for more.

I spoke to my mother about my family and she tells me I'm selfish for having this extra money and not giving it to my family. She goes on about how I have aunts and uncles with cancer and medical needs are expensive.

EDIT: I am 20, former BFF is 22.


My dad’s been in and out of my life due to drugs. For the past 3 years he’s been sober and is about to move closer to me because of a new job, or so I thought. I’m getting married Friday. I was excited about my dad’s progress. He was going to be the one to give me away but that’s not happening.

My former BFF has a 2 year old daughter. As it turns out, her daughter and I are related. C and my dad have been in a secret relationship and he only straightened up after he found out she was pregnant. I always thought it was odd that my dad was overly affectionate with C’s daughter, but it makes sense now. 

I found out C’s daughter is my half sister when we were rehearsing for the wedding and I realized that I forgot decorations at my house. C’s daughter got sick all over her clothes and she didn’t bring extra, so she needed to get some. I told her I’d take her and her daughter by her apartment to get clothes because it’s on the way to my house. I go in and I had to use the bathroom so I follow her into the apartment. When I step outside the bathroom, I see her dress and my dad’s suit hanging up together, presumably from the cleaners. In her daughter’s room where she was changing her, I also saw a framed picture of my dad holding her. I asked her what it was doing there and she froze and was unable to come up with an explanation. 

I got back in my car and drove to my house without saying a word. I left her and her daughter back at her apartment and I still don’t regret it. I was angry and didn’t want to go back to the venue, obviously. Eventually my fiancé came and took me back. I didn’t tell him what was going on but he knew I was upset. When we got back to the venue I unleashed HELL on my dad and called him out and told him he wasn’t going to be the one to walk me down the aisle and give me away. 

It ruined the mood and everyone left. My mom said I should’ve handled it in private and not been as harsh, so I’m beginning to rethink my choice. I texted my former best friend to let her know she was uninvited and I have blocked both of them on every platform. I know I caused a scene but I was so angry and still am. I can’t believe they’ve been doing this behind my back for a few years. My dad isn’t moving so he can be closer to his job, he’s moving in with my former best friend because they have a kid together and they’re in a relationship and have been for quite some time now. Not only that, but she lied to me about who the father was and I believed her.

Took my 7 year old daughter to a friend's birthday party. She's normally well behaved, but today she was kind of a brat. She stuck her finger in the kid's cake to eat some frosting. I told her if she misbehaves again, we are leaving the party.

It came time for everyone to sing happy birthday. My daughter interrupted the song by singing cha cha cha as follows:

Happy birthday to you, \[Daughter: cha cha cha\] \[Me: STOP\]

Happy birthday to you, \[cha cha cha\]

Happy birthday dear Aiden, \[Cha Cha Cha\]

Happy birthday to you, \[cha cha cha\]

I told her ""stop"" after the first line of the song, but she kept doing it. It was super embarrassing, as she was drawing attention to herself instead of the birthday boy while simultaneously throwing everyone off rhythm. I grabbed her arm and we left as she started crying and throwing a fit, saying she didn't do anything wrong.

1193,Not the A-hole,"Quick back story: The child’s mother (my wife’s sister) is addicted to meth and is a prostitute and the father has been ghost his entire life. The mother abandoned him and left him with their other sister whom she was living with at the time. The other sister eventually got fed up with the situation and basically told my wife that either we can take him or she will call CPS and let them handle it. This took place in Arizona which has a notoriously bad foster care system which usually ends up in abuse, so we couldn’t let that happen. We decided to take him for the time being.

Fast forward to now, my wife and I are at our wits end. We have 3 children of our own that we are struggling to provide for, we are currently co-living with my Mom and splitting rent/bills because we are not financially secure. My nephew was also born addicted to methadone and we’ve noticed some potential development issues coming to the surface. He can’t speak very well for his age, he doesn’t understand potty training, very destructive, whiny and just very difficult in general. I’ve seen my wife break down several times and cry because she just isn’t equipped to deal with it. It’s also taking a toll on my kids who have started to resent him, even though they may be picking that up from me and their mother. We love him, we want the best for him, but I don’t think we can provide it for him.  We don’t want to be angry with him or take out our frustrations on him because none of this is his fault, but we can’t do this anymore. We decided that we would look into other options, but there is nobody else in the family that can or will take him. The parents are MIA and the other sister said no because she needs to put her family first, which I understand. So this leaves us with the option of getting the state involved and letting him go into the system (in Texas). Just the thought of this makes me sick to my stomach and I don’t know if I could live with the guilt. But I also know that we can’t live like this any longer.

So my [19M] parents kicked me out two years ago. There was blame on both sides there, and it is what it is. One of their conditions after kicking me out was that I wasn't allowed to speak to or see my younger sisters [17, 14 and 5] any more. Of course I was upset by that, but I did break one of their rules and I couldn't think of a lot of things that I could do in order to circumvent that condition without making things worse for everyone so I kind of made my peace with it and tried my best to move on.

It's her first big leading role, and I'm insanely proud of her for getting it. She's apparently asked our parents if I'll be there and they just wouldn't talk to her about it. 

I really want to go along and show my support for her. My plan is to sit somewhere inconspicuous and slip out at the end hopefully unnoticed. I'm still figuring out how I'd let her know I was there (current plan is just have the oldest sister tell her). However, I'm apprehensive. I know if I go and my parents spot me/find out there'll be hell to pay. God knows what kind of trouble I'll be in, but I'm more concerned that it'll also get my sisters in trouble - the oldest for speaking to me and the middle for asking about me more than the once - and I really really don't want that. I'm just completely torn. I really want to support my little sister, and I know the chance of my parents seeing me in a large packed theatre is slim, but it's still a chance all the same.

1202,Asshole,"My dog is sick. She (potentially) has some kind of mammary cancer which is starting to develop. No one noticed until I brought her to the vet two days ago and they felt small pea shaped cysts growing on her belly. They've quoted me $1200 to do a biopsy to check whether it's cancerous or not, and if it is, they'll put her on chemo drugs. She's 11 and dogs of her breed tend to last 10-14 years. I keep some money aside for my dog for this express purpose. I've got $500 in a safe in case of emergency, and I don't mind adding the extra $700 out of pocket.

But my fiancee and I share finances. This is money I've always kept aside, even before I met her, so by all rights it's my money. We have a 4 month old daughter who is formula fed. My fiancee doesn't want to pay for the biopsy and instead wants to use the funds (which she didn't even know about until now) on our daughter. She needs formula, diapers, new clothes, an exersaucer, etc. We talk between each other before big financial purchases (over $200) and she says this is one of them and she is vetoing it.

A little context: I work part-time and my fiancee is not working right now to be a SAHM. Her family is rich. Ludicrously rich, but they don't share their wealth and instead keep it in investments. In emergencies, they'll give her some money but otherwise she earns whatever she can and that's it. I argue that I should take money that I earned and use it on my friend (and ostensibly a part of the family) and if we run into trouble, she should ask mommy and daddy for help. They won't help me, but they will help her.

So I did just that. My daughter needs things but I took the money and spent it on my dog. She had surgery today without my fiancee knowing. I played it off as I was hanging out with my friend with the dog. The dog is staying with my friend for now.

Am I the asshole? We aren't strapped now but it does make things harder. I was willing to make this sacrifice for my dog.

**Small update and correction:** the surgery is to remove the cysts and send them for analysis. Whether it's cancerous or not, the cysts are now gone. They said eventually they would become big (whether malignant or benign) and cause pain, and this surgery is preventing that pain and in the case of cancer, may be helping her out, too.

We are not strapped for cash. We collectively have about $6,000 in savings, so the $700 I took is of (relatively) little consequence. My fiancee was against taking any money for the dog, even if we could afford it. Whenever I want to spend something on myself or for our house, it always boils down to ""we might need the money for xyz for our daughter"", even if that never even happens. We will not be going without food or clothes or whatever. There's like a 1% chance this will cause us issues, and if it does, we have bigger things to worry about and her parents could help a little.

1. no being home alone together
2. no closing the door if they're in a room alone
3. absolutely no sleepovers

Now, my daughter's boyfriend got in a bad four wheeling accident last month, and he had some pretty serious complications with one of his legs, so he's been in the hospital for several weeks. I've been much more lenient than usual while he's in the hospital – I let my daughter stay with him overnight sometimes – because 1) it's a very emotional and scary time for both of them and 2) them being ""alone"" in a hospital isn't the same as them being alone at home (nurses are always coming in and out of the room, they can't sleep on the same bed, etc.)

The boyfriend is finally getting to go home from the hospital in a couple of days. He'll be able to take care of himself if he absolutely *has* to, he's not completely helpless, but he lives alone in the country with his grandmother, who's pretty old and feeble, so it'd really help him out to have someone else around for a couple weeks (especially someone who can drive). It's summer and my daughter's out of school, so she and her boyfriend are begging me to let her stay at his house and help him out until he's a little more stable. They mentioned their idea in front of the boyfriend's grandma, and she perked up and seemed very excited about the possibility. I think she'd really like to have help, too.

The problem is this, though: I'm not comfortable letting my daughter stay at her boyfriend's house, especially for such a long period of time. I've always been very set in my no sleepover rule, and it would feel really weird to let it up just because the boyfriend's leg is broken. I'm not stupid - I know a broken leg won't stop them from having sex, and I know my daughter will sleep in her boyfriend's bed even if she says she'll ""sleep in the guest room"".

1209,Asshole,"I live in an area in California that is mostly mexican and people of other latin american descent. My wife is Guatemalan and so is her family. Im a white guy and a self taught spanish speaker. Many people in my wife's family don't speak english that well and her mom doesn't speak any other than a few phrases. She can barely order food at a restaurant and can't really do much without a family member with her. Generally i speak with my wife's family in spanish. My wife's mom sometimes calls me when she can't get ahold of other family members asking me to translate when she's doing basic errands or has some sort of issue with someone who can't speak spanish. It's getting pretty annoying having to deal with it so i told my mother in law that she needs to learn how to speak english. I told her I'm sick of dealing with her shit because she can't speak english, she's been here for 8 years she should be able to speak english by now, in comparison i taught myself spanish and portuguese within a year and russian in 2 without even living in the countries that speak them. This honestly shouldn't be that hard. I gave her sources that i've used, duolingo, mango and provided dictionaries. I've even told her about ESL classes she can take.

Many people in my family are upset with what i said. They said what i did was incredibly disrpesectful and that I'm flaunting my white privlege by doing this shit and I'm acting racist. Somehow telling someone you should learn the language of the country you live in is racist. They went on about how I'm a racist trump supporter and whatever. Nobody in my family is on my side on this issue not even my wife and I'm wondering where i went wrong. I was incredibly polite to my mother in law and i explained that i'd help her along the way but she needs to become independent. I love her and my family they're all decent people but she needs to learn to speak english as do the rest of the family.

  
EDIT: i am aware that the US does not have an official language, stop pointing that out everyone fucking knows that. I'd also like to rephrase something, when explaining the situation to my MIL i didn't tell her ""I'm sick of dealing with your shit"" i told her that it's getting frustrating that I'm being used as a translator at random parts throughout the day and i want you to be independent and be able to do what you need to do without one of us as a translator in a really polite and respectful tone",562,711,0.86

1213,Everyone Sucks,"Keep with me here, but there's this guy who I don't know if I consider a friend anymore, but who always talks about cuckolding, like a lot. Whenever he meets any couple he then talks behind their backs about how he bets he could bang that guy's girlfriend and make him watch because he's so ""alpha."" I also know from other friends that he's had that same conversation with them about my GF and I. I'm not exaggerating at all, he actually finds a way to make this weird cuckoldry thing a topic of conversation every time I see him and with everyone else he hangs out with. I've never seen anything like it

We're all in university and he mentioned asking on the university subreddit if anyone wanted to hang out one night when we were all drunk. I wake up the next morning hungover and browsing the sub and then see a post matching his description of his post the night before. I click on it and see people in the comments calling him a weirdo for his post history, so naturally I looked and what I found was just too fucking good I honestly started laughing out loud reading through his post history. He claims to have cucked people before in conversation, but his reddit post history is full of nothing but him asking for bulls to come plow his gf (now ex gf) over months and him making fantasy posts (hopefully) about being cucked in weird subreddits. 


Everyone is pretty weirded out by him constantly bringing up wanting to cuck people and I think this is just too poetic to not share with a few close friends. If I found out he was into this shit just through his post on the college subreddit I would not share with anyone, but this guy makes him being ""the bull"" such a huge part of his public persona that I find it really hard to sit through him talking about this knowing the truth.

1214,Asshole,"So last night me and this girl that I had started dating recently went out for a fun evening. We went outdoors, grabbed some food and headed over to a bar. At the bar we both ended up running into a lot of friends when I came across my friend, we’ll say “Jeff”. me and Jeff sidebar while she talks to some of her friends. Once we get back together she says, “So.. you know Jeff?” “Oh yeah! We used to work together and blah blah blah. Do you know him?” She then Starts this story about how they were talking to each other at one point and about a date they had. We’re both very sexual people and had done our rounds with many partners before we got together so I already assumed the story was going to end with, “we hooked up.” 

That is indeed where it went but her phrasing... she goes on about the date and how he came over and, “Fucked me.” ... what... not saying, “We had sex,” or “we hooked up” or even “we banged,” I would have been fine with that but no, she says, “Yeah so later that night he came over and fucked me.” She continues on about how he ghosted her and things fell off.  But I lost all focus. For some reason that specific way of saying it put me in a weird tailspin. I got quieter and only started having conversation with people that approached our table and I started to keep it light with her. I felt so weird after hearing that especially since he was at the table right behind us and you could just feel how awkward it was around us. 

She then (I guess noticing my mood) said that the sex was terrible and that she faked it most of the experience. I don’t want to hear details! I don’t care if it was bad and you’re trying to make me feel better I just don’t want to know! We finished our rounds and went our separate ways back home. I don’t care that they hooked up it’s just the way she put it. I gave her a half hearted hug and she gave me a peck on the cheek and I went home. 

She messaged me today saying I didn’t have to act like that in the situation and that I should just relax because it was like 3 months ago. AITA for getting “weird” about the situation?

EDIT: so consensus says I’m the asshole. And ya know, I’m cool with that. This is clearly a personal  hang up of mine that I let get in the way of a fun night with someone I really like. I just need to grow up and if I say I’m ok with being open about those things, I need to be open to it all I guess? Idk still kinda on the fence myself but I’ll take the judgment. Also, we’re fine! It was one little tif and we’ve both gotten over it since then.

EDIT: funny enough since even my last edit, there’s been a surge of NAH. Thanks for confusing me everyone.. haha but I think people are forgetting the alcohol that was involved. By the time we got to the bar we were both about a 6 pack in(from our time outdoors) 2 margs(when we ate) and another “fish bowl marg” each and two shots(that we took at the bar. In all honesty, I’m going to chalk this one up to alcohol being a big factor. She was probably drunk and had no filter, I was drunk and had no rationality to the situation. I think in each others eyes we both just kinda messed up.",107,50,0.85
1215,Not the A-hole,"My friend and his gf of a few months came by for dinner and drinks this weekend along with my fiance and a couple other mutual friends. At some point I took off my wedding and engagement rings so I can cook and get chicken all over my hands (salmonella is bad kids) without worrying about them. After we eat and dishes are placed in the sink I reach blindly for my rings  since I always put them in a specific notch in the counter and only feel one.

Cue panic. I asked everyone if they've seen the wedding band anywhere or if it got knocked off the counter and it got to a point where I was on all fours on the ground hyperventilating while me and our friends searched.

I showed them all a picture of it in case and the gf goes ""oh that thing? I thought it was foil I threw it away!""

Record scratch. Dafuq? Everyone was staring at her and I'm pretty sure my face was changing colors more rapidly than metal under a blowtorch. She starts giggling and points at the trash. The trash is about half full of food prep stuff and puppy pads because we have a disabled French bulldog that literally cant control his bowels so yeah. Pads.

""What it was an honest mistake! You left it with the other food stuffs and I was just trying to help!""

I asked if she was serious and she shrugged and repeated that it was just a mistake and the ring would most likely be sitting on top of everything. Cursory glance said nope. My saint SO offers to dig it out and I was too furious to say anything so I just nodded and glared at her. My friend (the bf) helps him too and they do end up finding it after nearly puking from the dog doo. After they wash it off they place it on a towel to dry and the gf still kept saying that she accidentally mistook it for foil.

I turn to her and in a calmness that afterwards left me shaking and lightheaded said ""You need to leave now, before I crush your face because I ACCIDENTALLY mistook you for cockroach.""

My friend and her gasp and our other friends kinda stared at each other and back at me.

Gf bursts into tears and storms out. My friend follows her after an angry glare at me. Our other friends told me I took it too far and maybe she was just playing a prank etc. They even mentioned that it was because my wedding band was not that expensive it wouldn't have been a big deal if we lost it. My SO asks them to leave too as I am about to lay the wrath of God into them.

So reddit, am I the asshole here? Did I overreact?

**Tldr friends gf throws my ring away ""accidentally"" so I tell her to gtfo before accidentally confusing her for a cockroach.**

**Edit: lots of comments to muddle thru so I'll add one here.**

Thank you to all the comments even the ones saying iata. I recognize that threatening violence was not okay and I regret that part but if I'm an asshole for comparing her to a disgusting pest I don't want to be right.

Some clarity as well - she NEVER apologized which is why I dont think it was accidental. She was chuckling and snorting while my SO and her bf dug through dog shit and food peels. She knew she fucked up because she didn't make eye contact with me at all while they were doing it either. Even her bf doesn't think it was accidental after I talked to him today, but that it was harmless and we didn't really lose the ring and I shouldn't have called her a cockroach.

The ring, although inexpensive is sparkly and does not look like foil. It was absolutely insulting that my friends thought it was a non issue that they thought that I can just buy a new one if I had actually lost it. I'll post a picture in a bit to clear up confusion.

Edit 3: last edit for the night Here are the rings put together: [http://imgur.com/a/zqfKYr1](http://imgur.com/a/zqfKYr1)

Thank you to everyone with different perspectives. I'll say it again, I shouldn't have threatened her, yes it was in the heat of the moment but her smug laughing face pushed me over the edge. Not an excuse. Maybe I'm biased to not think my ring separately looks like foil but really its seeming less and less of a mistake when you consider that putting foil in compost makes no sense. She could've tossed it in the other two bins but she put it in the one we told them only food scraps and biological wet trash goes into. Like they've been to our house before. The bf is still going to be my friend since honestly I don't blame him for the things she chose to do. That's her agency. Not my problem.

&#x200B;

EDIT 4 FINAL EDIT. (will be adding to this as I read through)

I have read through most-ish of the comments so I will try and answer multiples of questions here and also some clarifications.

1. *Why are you wearing your wedding ring if you're just engaged?* \- My fiance and I went shopping for wedding bands together after he gave me the engagement ring. When we found one that remotely fits, we took it home and pried it open wide enough to fit the engagement ring, and I wanted to wear it already and he agreed.
2. I am also a girl, they were at my house.
3. *Why is there poo in the kitchen trash?* \- We have 3 bins in the house. 2 of them are open air, one for recycling, the other for non-recycling. The poo pad + compost bin is metal and covered and double bagged. We've had our disabled dog for around 6 months and this is the method that has worked for us because it's a hassle to run outside with drippy poo pee pads 3-5 times a day.
4. I recognize IATA for threatening violence. I do not feel bad about calling her a cockroach.
5. *Why are you focusing your question on calling her a cockroach when you should be asking about the ""crushing her face"" deal?* \- At the time, and even now, our friends thought that the cockroach bit and telling her to leave was the bit that went too far.
6. *How do you know she did it on purpose?* \- She still hasn't apologized, even if it was accidental. She did not throw anything else away because I throw everything I don't need away as I cook. She has been to my house many times. She has seen my rings together on my finger often. **Also, if she accidentally threw away some 'foil' she wouldn't have recognized that she did from seeing the picture.**
7. *But you found it so why are you still making a big deal about it?* \- If I didn't reach for my rings at the time and they left after dinner, we would have thrown away the bin and it would have been lost forever.
8. Thank you to all the people that say my rings are beautiful.
9. I didn't even realize the title said ""it"" until this morning, sorry about that.
10. *Why do they even know the value of the ring?* \- We found them separately on Etsy and got both pieces for a bargain and bragged about it when we got them.
11. *What is the stone in the engagement ring? -* Alexandrite. It changes color depending on ambient lighting.
12. We will be investing in a ring saucer to place my rings in when cooking to mitigate any future incidents.
13. *How long have you known these people? -* The GF has been around for 7-8 months and we have hung out many many times before and during my engagement. The BF has been a close friend for around 10 years and no, I am not cutting him out. The other 2 guests are acquaintances that I've known for about a year. 

I am pretty sure I missed something else but [here is the dog tax of Jackson](https://imgur.com/gallery/8Bol5WA) that some of the people have asked for. I will keep trying to respond to the comments but this really blew up. Thank you for your perspectives.

1216,Not the A-hole,"I had no idea what to call this post so let me explain. Also just got off work so sorry for grammar/spelling.

Im 24, and got a labor job right away out of highschool, it pays very well and has great benifits, becuase of this i was able to buy the condo my parents where renting at the time, i told them to keep the downstairs part, id live in the upstairs. I agreed to charge them half of what the other guy was charging, becuase i just wanted to cover some neccesities, not make a profit of my parents. 

We live very independently, on my wishes. Everything we have is seperate, and although we visit eachother everyday, and after work i have dinner with them some nights, for the most part i like to have a fair bit of privacy.

When i first bought the place, i made 2 rules clear, they were not ever allowed to enter my area unless i was home and gave them permission and they where not allowed to guilt trip me if i didnt want company (sometimes its becuase i have other plans with my GF/friends, or i had a long day at work). No matter the reason they had to respect that.

The first few months was good, they followed the rules, and i enjoyed spending more time with my parents than i would had i moved across town. But the rules started to get broken more. At first it was my mom using the emergency key to get into my home too do laundry, clean up, and do dishes. I told her i appreciate it but i like my privacy, and it stopped. Until it started up again but this time she was doing those things and borrowing stuff (mostly pots, pans, food products/ingrediants they forgot) 

They always respected the 2nd rule, but the 1st one was always trampled over, until last night. Last night my car was in the shop, and they must have forgot becuase i was laying in bed, post sex with my GF, and i heard the front door open, went to check and they are in my kitchen, casually doing dishes. I walked in half naked and politely asked them to leave. But that wasnt the end of it.

I went down later that night and told them if they didnt start respecting rule 1, i was raising rent back up to what it was before, and that im dead serious. I used this as a threat becuase my parents are not poor, and i know they could still afford it, i just know they wouldnt be able to afford as many luxuries as they have recently been buying. 

my parents didnt say anything, but i got a mile long text from my brother basically calling me a huge dick, and telling me to respect my mother.

1217,Not the A-hole,"Under unfortunate circumstances, my husband of 3 years recently received an inheritance from his grandmother. It is significant. Not quit your job money, but you don't really need to worry about being hungry or homeless ever money.

We have separate finances, and intend to maintain separate finances. We are both debt free with good savings, and make good money. There is no real financial need for either of us.

He does intend to use some of the money for ""us"". When we move a few hours away later this year (both jobs are portable), he intends to buy us a house outright. That said, I will then spend the next 20 or so years paying that money back. We have already worked out a repayment plan. I am appreciative, however, that I won't have a mortgage and be paying the bank interest on my half. [Edited to add: I would be on the deed at 15% or so ownership at first - the amount of cash I can contribute to the purchase from savings. We would probably update that over time. Where we live you can hold property in percentages.]

Recently, one of the smaller investments matured and he had an influx of cash. About 1% of the inheritance. I semi-joked about using it for a honeymoon. We never had a honeymoon due to life circumstances, and we have had a rough 18 months caring for his grandmother. We could use the break. We were her only local family, and were present through treatment to the end. He responded that it could be his half, and I'd have to save up mine. 

Honestly, I hadn't thought of him treating us to trip until it just sort of stumbled out of my mouth. I don't think I would have even thought twice if he had responded in jest. But the response wasn't a joking one and while it wasn't meant to be overly negative, it was just very clear to me that he doesn't see that as something he would do. It just really sat funny with me, even though this is his money and I really don't consider it mine.

And now I feel like I was the asshole here for even suggesting it, or thinking that is a way he should spend his money. 

To be clear, i could probably save up an equivalent amount in 12-18 months if I'm careful so his suggestion wasn't unreasonable. It isn't as if such a trip is out of reach. And yes, he would prefer I spend less, save more in general.

1218,No A-holes here,"My boyfriend wants to get a tattoo of what my name means. We've been dating for almost 3 years now, but it still makes me uncomfortable that he wants to put something so permanent about me on his body. I pretty much told him that while I loved his tattoos I wasn't really ok with him getting one that was so obviously about me.

He told me that he wasn't really asking permission when he told me about the tattoo and since it was his body, his vote was the only one that mattered. To be fair, I would be really hurt and upset if  my boyfriend told me to change the way I dress or to get a tattoo. I would probably love any other tattoo on him, but I feel like I should get a say if he's tattooing what's essentially my name.  


Edit: I've gotten a mix of NAH's, NTA's and YTA's which is telling me I should probably talk to him tonight and understand better why he wants this tattoo specifically. I love him and this is not something I want to give him an ultimatum about.",66,152,0.95

We were quite annoyed, as it would be nearly impossible to spend that much money on food in only two days! We got into a huge argument and we kept pressing him. It turns out he spent it all on vinyls (the entire Primal Scream discography) and CBD-infused vape juice. Needless to I was livid! I told him for the next two months he'll only be getting half his usual food allowance and absolutely no personal allowance. He screamed at me and called me a bitch.

1220,Asshole,"Daughter in quotes because she's biologically not my daughter, I only raised her as if she was until she was nearly 5. Then me and my first wife finally divorced and when she wanted to do a paternity test I found out she was conceived during an affair my wife had with some College teen (she was 26-27). So suddenly I had no argument to get custody for her, even though I got custody for her older brother. I didn't see her until she was like 14 and wanted to really know me and her brother, but since then we never had real active contact, as me and my wife live far away from her and her mother and I didn't want to make it so complicated for my new family. It's hard to explain to be honest and I certainly regret and think about it a lot.

Now she graduated from a really good College and I should be proud of her and I definitely am, but even though I got an invitation and flight tickets from her I decided not to go there, so last week I sent her the tickets and the money they costed and some money as a graduation gift with a letter that I appreciate it but can't be there and that she should spare the effort when she gets married or even for birthdays. 
I just couldn't do it as I didn't want to meet all of her real parents families and especially not her mother as it would've been a really atrocious and anxious situation and I didn't want to do this to me and also herself as she would've had to do a lot of explaining which isn't appropriate in this occasion. It should've been about her and not about our totally disturbing family structures.

I didn't talk to her ""brother"", so my son, yet, but I suppose he was there as they got close in the last years without me being involved and while I won't see her often anyway, I'm still keen on being someone she has positive connotations to if you can say that and I really fear she still could be upset.",46,43,0.81

My husband is upset about the classmate trying to ruin this for our daughter and possibly the 4-year-old should he find out from his sister.

1226,Not the A-hole,"This is a throwaway account.

My husband's nephew currently lives in Toronto, and is Canada on a student visa. My husbands nephew has a fake college degree from India and only took a one year course in basic accounting and his having hard time finding a job related in his field so he can gain residency. He decided that he was going to move to our province where he doesn't need a job in a related field and can work at any job for two years and receive his permanent residency.

My husband decided that his nephew would stay at our home until he gained his residency. My husband also wants to give him a job and his own business because he knows that very places would hire people that are on their student visa's due to the amount of paperwork and hassle involved. I don't really care about him hiring his nephew for his business, but I do not want him staying in our home. Though my husband works hard and makes a lot money, he doesn't help around the house at all. He works ten hour shifts a day, and usually doesn't get home until after 8:00 PM. Since this is the case, I am the one that does all the household work for our family (We also have two kids, one is in University, the other is in high school). I don't mind doing this at all and it doesn't effect me in anyway, since I only work around 20 hours a week at a part time job. My problem with this is that when my husband's nephew is going to stay with us I know that I would be responsible for cooking food, doing his laundry, giving him rides around the city for things he needs to get done and etc. I proposed the idea of letting him stay with us for a week and while he looked for his own place in the city, but my husband for absolutely against that. He brought up the that my niece stays with us and he doesn't have a problem with her staying. I bring up the fact my niece pays rent ($400 a month), helps around the house, does all of her own cooking and laundry, and that we had an extra room in the basement for her. (She is also only staying for three months because she is about to be married and will move in with her husband then.) If my husbands nephew were to move in, he would be sharing a room with my son in high school (my son doesn't want to share his room) and will not be paying rent because my husband thinks it's not right for him to charge his family rent.

Anyway we had a huge argument about it and I made a stand. I said I was not going to allow him to stay at our house. My husband is basically already giving him a job and he his parents back in India make more than enough to support him if he has any financial troubles.

1227,Not the A-hole,"On mobile. Formatting might be wrong but here goes. 

So my little sister N, lives in AZ with her wife M. 

M, texted me via N’s number last night asking me if she could have my SSN so her sister could get a job. I told her I didn’t feel comfortable and basically a no. 

Then in our family group chat, N texted saying how she was going to basically stop talking to us because we’re judgmental and always critical of her decisions. And that we basically don’t care about her. Previously she had texted about having a job interview and my little brother asked a question about the place she applied at. However, the text was jumbled and a lot of it didn’t make sense. In the past I have suspected that M was responding to some texts acting like she was N. The only reason why I suspect this is the word choice and some of the sentences being grammatically incorrect as far as word usage. M’s first language isn’t English. Hence why I suspected this. I figured it was M, some of the tirade due to the fact that I denied her request to use my SSN. 

I texted N saying how she always plays the victim and makes it seem like were mean to her and don’t care about her. When in reality, she will lash out at us. Mostly via texts with incorrect sentences and what appears to be broken English. I also said that she was wrongs for saying we don’t care when just under a year ago they were in Chicago and wouldn’t drive the 1.5 hrs to see us in Milwaukee because M said they didn’t have time. Same thing in AZ when we all lived there when she couldn’t come and visit. Cause M was busy. Though when she did come over M day outside in her car and would start honking after 5 mins of visiting us. I love my sister but sometimes her wife is just controlling and weird. 

AITA for telling her how I feel? And telling her that I think her wife doesn’t know what a boundary is?

1234,Not the A-hole,"I'm thinking of not inviting my father to my graduation next year and I want to know if I would be TA for doing so. Here's some backstory: 

My father is kind of a bad person. He has always struggled with money and alcohol, and smokes constantly. He has 4 kids and I'm the oldest, and each kid has a different mom. He recently had his fourth kid with a woman he'd impregnated after only dating for 3 months and only wants to focus on that kid. His reason for having my brother was ""I just want a family"" as if he didn't already have 3 other kids he never sees. He could easily visit my sister more as they live in the same city, but he doesnt. And she has special needs so she needs even more attention than a normal 10 year old, and her mother is a drug addict.

I don't want to invite him to my grad because he treated me horribly the last time I spoke to him (a year ago) and won't own up to his mistakes or apologize. He told me to go fuck myself on my sweet 16 just because I was helping with dinner when he texted and I only replied with ""thanks"". I then got a long paragraph later in the evening about how I was being a bad daughter and selfish for not calling him on my birthday.. as if he couldn't call me himself. He also lashed out at me a month or so before that when he told me his gf was pregnant. He had invited me to stay with him for a weekend and I agreed, but then he revealed the gf was pregnant and that made me uncomfortable and I decided not to visit him. He then got angry and told me I was being a disrespectful brat. I kept asking him to respect me and give me time to process the information he'd thrown at me, but he refused. 

My grad is coming up next year and I'm seriously considering not inviting him, but I am conflicted because my relationship with him is hurting my grandmother (his mom) and I know she'd take it poorly if I decided not to invite him. 

TLDR; my dad has treated me badly and I don't want to invite him to my grad because of it, AITA?",19,26,0.84

At a party, after hearing a girls name and major I realized we matched on tinder. I pulled her up and showed her my tinder asking if it was her. She laughed (I later realized it was an uncomfortable, nervous laugh) and was like “omg, weird” or something. Her friend next to her laughed as well. It was then that I realized I’d matched with her as well and I showed her.

Next day after the party I receive a message from both girls separately saying I outted them and their friends didn’t know. One of them was quite rude while the other just explained her feelings.

Now, I didn’t say in front of people “we matched on tinder” I only showed them. I don’t think anyone else would have even paid attention if they hadn’t made a big deal about it. There are also quite a few women that use tinder to find friends in addition to finding men for hookups/relationships. I didn’t think saying we matched inherently broadcasted that they were queer.

AITA?

Edit: I’ve read enough comments to not feel bad despite what I believe will be an asshole verdict. Essentially the thought is “don’t bring up dating profiles it’s awkward” which might be true to awkward people but if you’re willing to put a dating profile online for anyone to see them own up to it.

“But only queer women would’ve seen”
No, tinder is not perfect and often lets people you’re not looking for swipe on you. You can send profiles to people. How many screenshots of dating profiles have you seen online being made fun of? Exactly.

I obviously know not to do this in the future bc a lot of y’all online are insecure apparently, but I will accept my asshole verdict in peace knowing many people also assume you are out if you are on tinder. Thanks guys!",102,191,0.91

1245,Not enough info,"Okay. This looks fucking terrible, I know. Hear me out. 

Some background:

15F

Living with my father

I cut contact with my mom about a month and a half ago, moved away from her a year and a few months ago. I moved away because she and my stepfather are highly narcissistic and incredibly abusive. I was feeling incredibly depressed living with them and I'm glad to be away from them. I won't go into great detail on what they did, but I'll list a few of many things that my birth giver specifically did:

-Abused me in favor of my other three siblings from her. My siblings are 3M, 5F, and 18M. 18M has never lived with us, but is still in contact. She'd let me starve because making me food would wake up the little ones. She'd procrastinate putting money in my lunch account, too. I was 90-100 pounds living there, and now I'm 170 pounds just from being able to get an adequate amount of food. Not only this, but she'd force me to share my food with my little siblings, and they always ended up never even eating it. She'd also compare me to my other siblings and say how lazy I was compared to them, how insubordinate, etc. I told her I was feeling depressed and she brushed it off. I told her 18M was feeling depressed a few months later, and she got super worried and asked a lot of questions and even accused me of treating him badly.

-Constantly berated me. I could never do anything right.

-Manipulated me and lied to people around me such as my teachers to make them hate me. A lot of gaslighting went on.

All this being said, I feel nothing towards her. She's not my mother to me, she's just the woman that pushed me out of her vagina ~15 years ago. Whenever people ask me about my mom for various reasons, I always have to explain that I've cut her out of my life, and they ask why, and it spirals down from there. Some people berate me and call me a dick, because ""she's your mother"". No, she's not. It would save me a lot of stress to just say that she's dead, or that I don't have a mother. I wouldn't do it for attention seeking reasons. She's just no longer in my life and she's dead to me, at least. I don't want to talk about her.",78,168,0.92

1247,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I, beside our differences in finances, are happily married. She has a stable job and I work in my family business. My wife has always been unhappy with how the earning from my family business is divided. While we were dating, I worked under my parents and the earning was split three ways: 1 part to my parents, 1 to me and 1 to my sister. My wife didn’t have a problem then because we haven’t shared our finances. 

A few years after our marriage, my parents retired and handed the business to me assuming that I will continue to provide for my sister. The earning was then split 50/50 between my sister and me. My wife is upset of this arrangement because my sister doesn’t work at the company. While this is true and I understand her reasoning, my sister is supposed to own half the company if my parents knew there were any conflicts. I’m not sure if my sister somehow got wind of this but shortly after, she discussed with my parents and me that she is finally able to make money doing what she loves (she’s an artist) and that it is unfair for me to do all the work at the company.

1248,Not the A-hole,"A relatively good friend of mine introduced me to a couple in the past few months that they are close to. The couple has 2 children, then younger of the 2 is 6 years old. I have a 5 year old, and it is always nice to meet other parent friends, as a large number of my close friends are child-free. It's not an issue or anything, it is just nice to meet parents within my social circle, as we're pretty tight and and I enjoy being around other more open minded weirdos that happen to have kids.

&#x200B;

ANYWAY, I have these dinners that I host in my home that are like an open house for a group of my friends. I keep them private, and add people that I feel comfortable opening my home to. I have only twice now taken people off the invite, one person only ever attended once and I am not very close with, and I do not get along with their partner. It didn't cause drama. Another person behaved inappropriately (another story) and I made the decision to leave them off going forward, which I believe to be a mutual decision and for the best.

&#x200B;

For the couple in question, they have been regulars at these events at my house and also my kid's birthday party. Their younger child, the 6 year old mentioned above, has some really bad behavioral issues. They are violent towards other children and adults, for example running into a room where other, younger kids are playing, pushing them down and then running away or purposely slamming a door on one of my friend's hands. They are destructive to things in our house (I have houseplants, and they were tearing leaves off one and scattering them through the house. My partner had to sit by the plant to protect it the rest of the day). When told not to do something, they try harder to do it, or ask why and when explained to, do it anyway. The parents are trying, it's not like they ignore the behavior entirely, but it is hard with a house with adults and kids to pay attention to everything a kid does. But it also seems to cause conflict between the parents, and one of the parents seems to get very angry when this behavior is going on. I had to tell them that the child was pushing a 4 year old down, and I felt weird, like a tattle tale or something. quiet place to go.

&#x200B;

We have kids frequently, but before they started coming, it was never like this. It wasn't calm, but this is beyond stressful. I don't look forward to the dinners anymore, and I try to make excuses to skip them.

The next event is coming up, and I just left the couple off the invite. I didn't say anything to them because I don't know what to say and I feel like it will just make them feel bad about their kid.

1249,Asshole,"(Some context): I’m American and my wife is Middle Eastern. Ever since we had our first child (8 years ago) we moved to her country. It was a mutual decision. I was raised by shitty parents and I have cut contact with all my family. She is very close with her family so I didn’t want her to be away from them. It makes me happy to see that the kids are growing up surrounded by loving grandparents and extended family, so it worked out perfectly for us. 

The only downside is that my wife brings in more money than me and it honestly doesn’t make me feel good. 

I received a really good job offer that is hard to pass. It pays way more than my current one. Unfortunately it’s in the US and that would mean we’d have to move there. It also requires many business trips. I told my wife I want her to quit working and be a stay at home mom instead. I explained that there is no one around I trust enough that will be able to take care of the kids so she will have to. She’s being stubborn though saying that being a SAHM just isn’t for her and that she loves working. But I know that there is no way she’ll be able to find a good job in America because of her race. 

Her parents have told me that I’m being inconsiderate and that I should even reconsider the move. However, I feel like I’ve sacrificed a lot and now it’s her turn. Does this make me an asshole?

1250,Not the A-hole,"Last year, I stepped down from my corporate position so that I could move home and head my family's business, so my parents could retire.

My sister has a 4 year old son. I didn't get to spend a lot of time with my nephew, so we don't have much of a relationship. She delayed getting her son into school, and was sending him to a local daycare so she could work. A month ago, there was an abuse issue with a different local daycare, and my sister flipped. She didn't want to send her son to any daycare anymore, because she doesn't trust anybody else with her child.

So, she brings him into our office. Her son is a terror. She uses an iPad to keep him busy, but doesn't make him wear headphones. So, he sits in the office listening to cartoons at top volume, until he gets bored and starts running around, yelling. Whenever I tell my sister that it's distracting, she says he's just playing. He's walked into the conference room during meetings twice now, and my sister has just laughed it off. He'll draw on the whiteboard for a couple of minutes, maybe ask his mom for a snack or something, all while I'm trying to keep our client on track. We often run out of paper for the printer because he uses it to draw. There's crumbs everywhere from him eating, the glass on our copier is covered in streak marks from him, there's always noise going on.

Last Thursday, my nephew came into my office and just started playing with things on my desk, staring at me but not speaking to me. I asked if there was anything I could help him with, and he just kept doing it. I tried to show him how a desk toy I had worked, and he smacked my hand away and kept fiddling with it. I was like, fine, okay, and then, he kept forcing it the wrong way and broke it. But I just said ""uh oh"" and suggested he play with one of his toys. He says no. He picks up a little toy car I have on my desk. Drives it off the desk. Okay, fine. Picks up a stress ball, rolls it off the desk, fine. Grabs the broken desk toy and walks it off the desk, no worries. Takes a picture frame, and I see where it's going, so I take it from him. He starts hysterically crying and screaming. I explain what happened to my sister, she's pissed, tells me I have no right to try and parent her child, I'm bad with kids, I don't know her son. I'm mad, so I say she needs to keep her kid out of the office. I'm tired of dealing with all of this, it's done. He needs to go home or back to daycare. She bursts into tears, tells me it's not fair. And of course, she turns it back on me for being childfree - I don't understand a mother's love, I'm not being fair.

Our parents are pissed. My dad calls me and says he regrets bringing me in, I don't understand the value of family, etc. She hasn't shown up the last 2 days, doesn't answer my texts, calls, emails, so I'm stuck with all her work. My mom told me it's just ""what I deserve"", but I feel like I deserve a quiet workplace, too.

John claimed to be a member of the New Zealand Royal navy. I knew he was a phony from the beginning, since i am a member myself i noticed him wearing the uniform incorrectly on social media and when i met him at a party he told me stuff that didn't make sense such as serving in units that would've been impossible with his occupation and time he claimed to have enlisted etc. I have told Kathy and her friends my concerns but they never believed me because he had photos of him with groups of other navy guys on ships. Im guessing either photoshop or maybe he had a bunch of other phonies dress up on a ship or something idk. 

I was able to get someone i knew in the service to search up his name and i found that he actually enlisted but was dishonorably discharged within a week of entering for bad conduct. Obviously this means he is not a lieutenant and should not have any uniforms. I get this information within a few weeks before his wedding. There's several legal ways to do this but i don't want to get into it for confidentiality.

  Kathy's brother emailed around 1600 making announcements for the wedding. This allowed me to get everyone's emails. I sent an email explaining all the discrepancies of his uniforms, stories he told, and finally proof submitting his discharge papers. Kathy decided to cancel the wedding and there was massive flame war that occurred, via email. I didn't even know that was possible but it happened. People went on saying how was a scumbag that should've minded my own business. Other people have told me that i should've told Kathy this privately but i feel everyone should've known that this man was a lying piece of shit. Kathy was initially angry but has now thanked me.

1256,Not the A-hole,"A bit of context: my brother is eight years old, almost nine. I am fifteen year old female. My parents are in their mid 40s. I only see my brother on breaks, because I live with my grandmother during the school year. I share a room with my brother when I'm there.

As I said, my brother is eight years old, and I only see him on breaks. Despite his age, he speaks like a toddler. For example, he can't form a full sentence yet. Instead of asking, “How do you spell ‘_____________’?” he says, “How-a spell ‘___________’?”

This is really concerning for me. He was in speech therapy for his first few years of school, but my parents pulled him out of it last year because he wasn't being treated fairly. He has to retake the third grade next year, despite having a 3.8 GPA. He failed the state tests because he just clicked on whatever answer he saw first. 

Now, that isn't the only think he does. He constantly makes noise, no matter how nicely or meanly you ask him. He is constantly moving and being distracted. If you take away something he wants, he screeches like a banshee. 

Another thing that worries me is that my parents seemingly don't look after him. When I'm home for breaks, my step-dad (his father) expects that I take care of him. My SD wakes up around lunch time, maybe later. My mom works until 6 almost every night besides Sunday and Monday. 

I am responsible for watching after him, getting him food, and basically keeping him out of trouble. This causes me severe stress and made me have a mental breakdown last summer. They know nothing about this, and I am too scared to tell them in fear they'll either say I'm faking or send me to a mental hospital. 

I still look after him, whatever toll it takes on me. I love my brother more than anything in the world, but sometimes I resent him. I feel horrible. 

Today, I made him lunch, even though my mom was home. I was already making myself some, so I thought I might as well get him food too. I made him the exact same thing I did a few days ago. He threw a fit. He started screaming, saying how he wanted what I had. Instead of scolding him, my mom said I should share my food. 

Then, my mom and SD left the house to go run some errands, and yet again, I was left with babysitting duty. My brother ended up tripping and spilling his lunch all over, and skinned his knee. I cleaned the mess up and gave him an icepack and a painkiller, because he wouldn't stop screaming. 

I try to clean his knee, but he screams and runs off. I have to coax him off his bunk bed (I can't fit up there) and give him a bandaid. It took ten minutes for that entire ordeal to happen.

This $190 is $100 to my mom's savings (which I keep for her in my safe) and $90 for my mom's car insurance.

This brings me to why I believe my sister has something to do with it. She ""found"" an iPhone 7 Plus on Saturday. It was just laying in the grass apparently and unlocked. So she was able to reset it. No Apple ID required. You can definitely tell it's used. It has scuffs and a pop socket mark on the back. It's not that far fetched to believe someone could have lost it and never setup an activation lock. Very slim but possible. But the fact that there is $230 missing and she now has ""found"" an iPhone that could definitely have been purchased at that $230 price point is extremely odd.

&#x200B;

But I told her, ""I find it very weird but I would think you wouldn't lie to me. So I believe you."" So would I be an asshole if I went back on my word.

I have been very cordial about the whole thing. We haven't accused her since there isn't enough evidence to make it clear enough that it is her. I can't imagine her being brave enough to steal from both my mother and myself. But sometimes kids are fucking retards. She would be putting so much at risk if she did do it. Because this won't be a slap on the wrist. She'd be losing her entire summer and any plans/fun she though was going to have. Plus the simple fact that she would betray our trust like that.

&#x200B;

I'd rather have lost the money completely due to my own stupidity than her have stolen it. It hurts just to think about it.

&#x200B;

EDIT: She stole the money. I came home after work today and pressed her. My suspicions were right on the money (pun intended).

The surprising part was where she got it. I assumed from a friend in the complex or school. She bought it from an adult female off of OfferUp. She is beyond in trouble right now. She could have easily been stolen or robbed. It'd practically be without a trace.

My mom lives with me in my apartment. Dad isn't around. We are her sole providers. So it really fucking hurts to know she stole from us given how much we provide for her. The amount of times she lied to us on different occasions is astounding. Well, hopefully we can correct this behavior and she'll never do this again.",24,41,0.93

1259,No A-holes here,"**Background**:

My nephew (call him John) is 22. He's had a shitty life due to an abusive dad. Drug and alcohol issues started when he was barely a teen, lots of anger issues, run ins with the law including an assault arrest and a couple of DUI's in his late teens. That said, he's been trying to get his act together. He's been clean and sober for the past year while going to a local community college and working part time.

His mom (my wife's sister) remarried a really wonderful guy who's been helping John get his act together. They have a six year old son (call him David) who is really close with John, his half brother. I have a daughter who is also six and she is really close to David. They're basically growing up together since we live close by, they go to the same school and so on.

**Current Situation:**

I'm out this week, traveling for work, and John's mom wants to take my wife (her sister) out for a girl's evening. She is suggesting that John watch his brother and my daughter for the evening. To be clear, John already baby sits his half brother on occasion and they have a really good relationship.

**My problem:**

On the one hand I really want to say yes. John is a good kid and I think he's genuinely trying to turn his life around. I've been encouraging and helping him along and I want to see him succeed. On the other hand, I am very aware of the stats around how kids get injured or die and John is literally a walking stereotype of the kind of family member not to let your kids stay home alone with. Anger management issues, substance abuse issues, criminal record, it's so bad it's a cliche.

If I say no I am very clearly saying I don't trust John to do this, which I think will hurt him, but the fact is that I don't trust John to do this. I'd lend him money, I'd loan him my car, I'd let him house sit my home no problem, but this is my 6 year old daughter we're talking about here.

To make it worse, my wife (who has been super understanding about this) asked me ""ok, but if not now then when will you trust him?"" and I didn't have an answer to that.

Note, English is not my native language so my bad if this isn't clear. Happy to clarify in comments.",72,393,0.97

But that never happened. So I decided to donate the money to a charity ( which helps kids with  genetic disorders ). The investments I made mature in an year and I plan on donating all of it.

1261,Not the A-hole,"My (now) wife and I have been together for 15 years, 3 of them married. We were high school sweethearts, and have been together ever since. Though the relationship with the inlaws was difficult at first, it seems that I was an accepted member of the family.

At the time of our wedding, we both decided that we wanted to have a relatively cheap wedding (budget of 10k) as we didn't really see the value of spending much more on a celebration for us. We purchased our own liquor from a wholesaler, went light on the decorations, limited our invitations, etc. 

The wedding went off without a hitch, and the next day we went through the various card and gifts, wrote down who gave what for thank you notes, and noticed something. We didn't receive anything from my wife parents, not even a card. We also found out that our leftover champagne was taken by my inlaws and given to my brother-in-law. 

I don't want to feel like I'm entitled to a gift, but the lack of even a card on such a memorable day (oldest daughters wedding, first wedding of their 3 kids) made me think that my inlaws don't even value our marriage enough to commemorate it with a card. AITA for expecting a little more from my inlaws?

Edit 1) Thanks for all the responses, definitely some perspectives in there I didn't consider.
For those asking for more information, they had no financial contribution to the wedding. In fact, we were so budget-conscious that we were considering not having a DJ (would just have a music service hooked up to the sound system) but they insisted that we needed one and said they would pay for it. After the wedding, they only provided half of what the DJ cost and that was from her grandmother. 
I want to say that we had roughly $150-200 worth of unopened champagne leftover.


edit 2) Some other information: there was no religious dispute (as far as I know), hopefully the card was not stolen/misplaced (no other issues), we see our in-laws at least once a week, we were even caring for my wife's 90+ years old grandmother with dementia in her home (we moved out because the inlaws were demanding rent on top of our almost 24 hour care).",105,642,0.96

Anyways, as the title says, my coworker’s father recently passed away. This is sad and I do feel very sorry for her. However, today a different coworker was walking around getting people to sign a card for her. When she got to me I signed the card, then she asked me for money. I asked what for, and she said that people were donating money as well. I told her no, I would not be donating any money. She gave me a sour face and moved on. I asked other coworkers and most of them stated they had donated some money. When I said that I didn’t because I felt that no amount of money would bring her father back, they all said I was insensitive and an asshole. I truly feel that asking for money in this situation at all is ridiculous but apparently it’s a trend that goes on in my workplace when someone’s family passes. The thing is, I know this money isn’t going to go to helping for funeral costs or anything like that because she said her father had good life insurance. I don’t see the point in lining her pockets just because she’s sad. Am I the asshole?

Edit: To be clear I never said the phrase “lining her pockets” out loud. If that makes me an asshole separately from what I’m asking about, so be it.

Edit: The money was not for flowers or a gift or anything like that. It was a strictly just giving her cash for her loss.

Edit: Like I mentioned in the post this money isn’t going to help pay for the funeral or any arrangements that needed to be made. The money was going to her specifically.

I smiled back and said hi. Then she asked me what my name was, and after I replied the mother looked down at the girl and said ""how many times have I told you not to talk to strange men?""

After she said that I felt kinda weird about the whole situation so I just let out kind of a quiet ""ahh i'm sorry about that"" then went back to stocking. The lady then came up to me and told me it's strange that a man my age would talk to a little girl that I didn't know and that I should really be more aware of what I'm doing. I really didn't know how to respond to that so I just kind of nodded and went back to work.

1267,Not the A-hole,"I am 22 and love to bake. I take the cakes into work for my coworkers. Recently. a coworker has been asking me to bake for her family events. She has been giving me money, but its usually not even enough to cover all the ingredients. 

&#x200B;

Recently, she messaged me to order 170 decoraticve cookies, 40 cupcakes, and 3 different 2 tiered cakes all but one for the same day, her kid's 1st birthday. Also to face paint at the party. I told her it would probably cost a lot. She said it was fine and the party was on a Friday. I agreed to facepaint for the friday.Later she messaged to ask for a price. I told her i couldn't face paint because she had changed the day to a saturday and i was busy. I was worried about finishing everything but a friend offered to help so i thought it was fine.

&#x200B;

I hate asking about money so, I had a friend help me write a polite message to her and check my price estimates. I had figured the costs and that it would take 40 hours to make (with help) I told her $350 for ingredients and then told her it would be 40 hours and she could decide what that was worth.

&#x200B;

She responded complaining that she had only budgeted $300 and that i had agreed to face paint. I repeated that i wasn't available cuz she changed the day. I told her i couldn't afford to make her order for less than $350 and that it didn't include my time and, for $300 she would have to cut back.

&#x200B;

She said she wanted everything for $350. I was confused since it wasn't a favour and i was getting nothing for my time, but i was already uncomfortable and agreed to try. She asked for a sample of the cookies in advance. I refused due to time constraints and costs.

&#x200B;

The next day, i got an offer for my uni course, An advanced graduate diploma and is full time, plus my actual job which is part time. I worried i wouldn't get her order done in time. There was over a month til her party so i messaged to ask if she could get someone else to do two cakes and i would do the cookies, cupcakes and one cake. I cut the price to $150 which doesn't really cover costs. I have never interacted with her outside of her asking me to bake stuff so it's a big favour. I told her that uni had to come first, particularly since i wasn't being paid for my time. I had two friends check the message to make sure it was polite and that my reasoning was clear.

&#x200B;

She got upset that it was last minute and would be hard to find someone else who would do the other cakes. I apologised. She said she would try to get someone else to do the other two cakes. She was planning to contact a bakery although im sure they charge far more than me. I now feel guilty. I was trying to be nice. I messaged as soon as I got my uni offer. i wanted her to have time to figure it out. She has 6 weeks til the party. I'm scared to message her. I haven't taken any money from her yet.

Apparently when I had asked her before she was under the assumption this would be a unpaid internship which I was not too excited about. Although at the end of the first week surprise surprise my boss hands me a paycheck of 150$ for 3 days of work he tells me he dislikes unpaid internships and I should have some pocket money for the summer. After working out a 60$ per day contract I leave and head back to my mom's.

1270,Not the A-hole,"I'll try to keep this short because I've vented on other subs. My husband (30m) has been unemployed since March, we have been barely scraping by on my salary alone and I've been very frustrated with him because he's been incredibly picky about getting a new job. We both grew up in blue collar homes so I don't know why he has this notion, but he keeps saying he's ""worth more"" than a $15 an hour job. He has a GED and has only worked in one industry his entire life, and it's an industry he doesn't want to work in again. 


Anyhow, with a huge amount of luck he landed a high paying job that starts this week. Providing he passes a drug test.  


He quit smoking mid-March for a few weeks because he wanted to test clean, but then Endgame came out and he ""had to see that stoned"" so he begged me to be ok with it and promised he'd get clean again after. I told him I couldn't make him do anything, but I didn't think it was a good idea.


As you know, Endgame was a while ago and he just never quit smoking. He said he'd just pick up some QuickFix and go that route. I told him again I was uncomfortable with it, and he promised everything would work out.


Now a week before the job, they're letting him know that since it is such a high-paying, working with big machines position, the drug testing will be pretty thorough and they will probably have someone in the room with him. Now he is coming to me begging for reassurance that everything will work out.


I'm kind of over it. I have supported him and made things work by myself (he even refused a part time job) and HE was the one who promised me fake pee would be ok. I honestly feel like he put getting high over our financial security and I don't feel like reassuring him any longer. If this falls through, it's on him and it will be up to him to get a freaking job at Target or something because all my savings are now gone.


And before people say I should have been more firm about why I didn't want him smoking, I have always been vocal about my dislike. I have asthma and the smoke really bothers me. I also have an emotional aversion to pot because I was falsely arrested in a drug raid (ex was a dealer and I was at his house when they were busted) so I feel like if anyone should be getting reassurance that things are going to be alright, it should be me. 


AITA if I don't tell him everything will be ok and I think he messed up? He always said it was alright that he smoked weed because he ""always paid his taxes and showed up to work on time"" but now he might not be getting a job for it.

1274,No A-holes here,"Hi so the title doesn’t really give you the full scope of the story, but I wanted to get some opinions about my course of action. 

So last night, I went out dancing with a few friends. Before we get to the spot, we agree to meet at a bar beforehand. I get there late, and instead of going to the table and hopping on their tab, I go straight to the bartender and open up my own tab. There’ve been issues dividing the checks with this group so I decided to avoid it completely.

Anyway we all chill, turns out they ordered food which they offered to share. I said “no thanks I already ate”. The reality was I didn’t want to get involved in an argument over the check and how much I should be paying (again there have been issues). Server brings out a plate of wings and loaded fries, cool I’m chilling. Then he *accidentally* brings out a second order, saying that he gave us the wrong amount of wings. They already started eating, so he said that since he couldn’t take the wings back to the kitchen, we could kee it no charge. 

Free wings?

Now I say “alright I’ll have a bit” and I take exactly 4 pieces of the free 20 piece wings. Literally. So we close all the tabs, I’m good on my front thinking that I don’t owe anyone anything. 

So we get to the spot, and order a 30 dollar pitcher of beer to split between 5. We sit down at the table, and my friend who’s sitting across from me serves herself half a beer and the rest of the table a full cup. Before she gets to me, somehow the ENTIRE pitcher spills on me. Of course, there’s not much I can do aside from just taking the L in stride in the moment and laughing it off. What use would me flipping out do anyway? 

So I sort of get cleaned up but now I reek of beer. Turns out the (new) white pants I was wearing are dry clean only. So there’s a bill.

So that’s the backstory, now for this morning.

I get a text saying I owe $20 from the initial bar tab as my share, and then the $6 for the beer. Now if I literally had 4 pieces of *free* wings, I’m tryna understand why I would be charged as if we split the bill 5 ways. So no, I tell them I’m not paying that since I had my own tab and the wings were free. They still say “oh you had a little bit of fries so just send $10”. I was a bit drunk so maybe I had some fries, I wasn’t gonna argue further anyway, so I just sent the $10.

Now they’re demanding I send the rest even though I couldn’t have the rest of the beer and now I have a dry clean bill for these pants. Literally the person that spilled it said “don’t worry you got it”. Not that I’m demanding they pay for it, but it would be nice to at least be offered or at the VERY least say sorry.

He's also your stereotypical redneck man that makes his wife do everything for him. He still has a temper and is too immature to control it all the time) who said he spent 8 hours researching alz.

He showed me a book by a ""doctor"" that said you can reverse the symptoms and when I told him that anybody could write a book, he accused me of being pessimistic. I just let him do his thing, bc I'm on the other side of the state and can't do anything anyway.

We talked again and he told me that she didn't absorb stress right and didn't eat or sleep well and the book said if she had done those things then she wouldnt show symptoms. It felt to me that he was blaming her for getting sick. So I looked up the author of this book and the only study his name was attached to was an unblinded 10 person anecdotal study that said Alz can be reversed. I sent him the following text:

""While I do think we need to consider all possible options, I do think it's healthiest to look at these things with a little bit of healthy skepticism. The only published study I can find his name on is the trial that he talks about in his book, which was preliminary and unblinded with only 10 participants, meaning it's really unreliable data. I'm not saying it's not accurate, it's too early to tell and I'm not a scientist. But I do think in the interest of spending effort where it can be most efficiently spent, I think we need to make extra sure we're not being bamboozled. You can sell a lot of snake oil with the right pitch.""

He got really mad that I said that and hasn't talked to me since

He swears by this book and is under the impression that it's going to save the day when I'm sure we all know it's not. But 75% of the stress in her life is due entirely to him leeching her money (and my 14 year old brother's money he got from a settlement after our dad died) for his failed businesses (which he's trying again now to get mom out of work), plus the fact that he yells and screams when he doesn't get his way

Husband said he clearly saw what was happening and froze. He feels like he should have said something.  

In any case, we've decided to not have people over to our house for a long time since we apparently are unable to control who is invited. We also have decided that we will not attend and future family functions where uncle is attending. 

I have confirmed creepy uncle's behavior with SIL and she told me he did the same to her while she was pregnant a few years back.

I am very hurt that my husband did not protect me in that moment and, probably irrationally, feel like he should make an announcement to his family why we won't be attending future family functions instead of being silent about it. AITA for wanting him to do that and should we keep quiet for the sake of the family?",136,958,0.96

1280,Not the A-hole,"My ex and I split about 4 years ago, when our child was nearly 2. I kept all the baby items from the baby shower: clothes, bottles, crib, etc- aside from things with sentimental value to ex (some clothes blankets, toys), as I had primary custody of our child together. I have since remarried and have a 7 month old, and ex is expecting a child with a new partner. Today, I woke up to several voicemails and text messages demanding all ""the baby stuff"" that was left behind and, supposedly, came from ex's family. This somehow included almost everything that was left (crib, dresser, changing table, bottles, receiving blankets, and more) I said no. 

IMO ex has had 4 years, including the entire time my partner and I were expecting, to lay claim to these items but replacing them midway through my child's first year on next to no notice seems ridiculous. We are not inherently better off financially than ex and their new partner, but we make wiser financial decisions and are more financially stable for large purchases such as these. I'm upset that ex feels entitled to these items, as though my home has just been a storage unit all these years, and that instead of approaching me politely, ex demanded I give them ""back"" and got hostile when told no. Ex is also behind in child support for our child together, which has impacted finances in my home since I am still on maternity leave and only receiving partial pay.

1281,Asshole,"Me and my wife have 2 boys (2.5y and 4y (edited for clarity)). Our relationship is not going smoothly but we do our best.

My wife suggested to me to start teaching our oldest how to bicycle some time ago (yes I could've come up with that idea myself, but truth be told she was first to suggest). Two weeks ago we tried first but our child refused because he said he was scared. 2nd try he refused again because he had much more fun stuff on his mind, 3rd try we skipped because we changed plans.

Yesterday I come home and my wife tells me my son has something to show me. We go outside and he just rides off, pretty smoothly. My wife half-understands that was not how it was supposed to go and apologetically says ""I just wanted to get him used to the helmet and the bike, and next thing he just starts cycling. I didn't expect that. But I have it all on tape"". In any case, he showcases his skills some more, but I'm just really angry&upset for missing this life event (it's a big father-son thing in my opinion; I live in a country where everyone teaches their kids how to cycle). I have a hard time being happy for his accomplishments at that moment. I’ve never seen him more proud and try to keep up a good smile. Back inside I watch the video and it does seem she had to rush for the camera.

I ask her why she didn't call me upfront and discuss her plans, and I tell her I am very upset/angry. She tells me I shouldn't be angry and that I should be proud of my son. I tell her I want to continue the conversation after the kids are in bed.

I bring the kids to bed and come back. She says something to which I reply I really don't want to talk right now. She tells me she's really not looking forward to spending the evening with a grumpy person, so I should lighten up or leave. This touches a nerve and I yell at her (from 10ft away) how unbelievable I think it is she doesn't get it. Out of spite she yells at me that if I wanted to see my son learning how to cycle I should spend more time at home. This infuriates me, I slam the dishwasher (30ft away from her), which makes a lot of noise, confront her about what a spiteful thing it is to say (I work fulltime making a lot more, she parttime, its a regular discussion) and start leaving. She realizes the comment was off and says 'I shouldn't have said that, but'. I leave, slamming the door,not before telling her she should ask anyone with an IQ over 50 whether or not I am entitled to be angry. She yells I should pack my bags (a hollow phrase that she has said a handful of times before).

I take a long walk and come back, after which she asks me to explain myself, to which I tell her I don't understand her attitude at all. She tells me to sleep in another room and I tell her ‘no’.

I seriously regret making a lot of noise at the start of the evening with the kids in bed. I don't think they could hear what we said, but our oldest probably heard us having an argument.

1287,Not the A-hole," 

Hey everyone, let's start with a little backstory to my current dilemma.

My dad (67M) has 4 children (38M, 37F, 25F, 13F). The two oldest are from his first marriage, and he was with them all through their childhood and through university. My mom raised me (25F) as a single mom, after my dad started a new relationship (with the mother of his youngest) shortly after my birth. We lived in a different country than my dad, so I saw him about biyearly, until I moved to his country 7 years ago. Since then, I've seen him about 4 times a year. Usually it's when he calls me up and tells me he is in my city for his youngest's swim meets, so we meet up at the pool and chat for about 30 minutes.

A few weeks ago, he calls me up and tells me there is a big swim meet in my city during the first weekend of July. He asked me if I could move out of my (small, 1 bed, 1 pullout couch) apartment (which I own) for that weekend so he, his wife, and their friends could stay there and save money on the hotel. I was really surprised and not really thinking things through since I am generally a people pleaser, and agreed to move out for the weekend.

Well, it turns out I don't really have anywhere to go for that weekend, and I wasn't planning on taking a vacation somewhere for that specific weekend either. I have a 130lb dog who I also have to take into account when travelling so it's not easy finding dog-friendly places to stay. I figured I'd just take a roadtrip somewhere UNTIL this past weekend when I saw my dad at one of these swim meets. He started telling my boyfriend and I about where he's travelled to in the past month, and also how much things in swimming cost, like a special speed suit can be up to $600 for the 13 year old and has to be replaced every 6 months because of stretching.

This kind of got me thinking, if he can fund this sport for his daughter and travel so much, why can't he afford a hotel for a weekend and has to use my apartment? I don't want to make this tit for tat but I never asked for and never got anything from him (didn't pay child support for me) so why should I switch my plans around and pay for my own trip for that weekend? He never invites me to his place because his wife has some unresolved resentment towards my existence, I was never and am not a big part of his life, so why shouldn't I go back on my word and make him find other accommodation?

My boyfriend thinks I am NTA here if I do change my mind, but I keep going back and forth on it because it is a little too close to the date (1 month out) to find a hotel, and I would most definitely be the asshole in his friends' and wife's mind as well because I didn't leave, so their kids couldn't be in the swim competition. So, put yourselves in my shoes, and help me decide AITA here?",26,61,0.92

1289,Asshole,"My MIL has made a small ""family quilt"" for all of her kids and their spouses (5 couples including us). The quilt is really cute, has the couple's names, their kids' names, and their favorite hobbies and things all done in stitching and cute little cloth pictures. I was really looking forward to getting ours because I admit I'm a bit of a hipster and I love home-made kitschy stuff like that for our home.

She recently finished her latest one for my husband's brother and I thought we were getting ours soon since my husband is the youngest. I asked my SIL (she got hers first) and she very awkwardly informed me that no such quilt will be coming our way. I was a bit upset and asked my husband to investigate. Turns out MIL has no intention of making a quilt for us because there's not enough to put on all the squares or whatever, basically meaning since we don't have kids we don't deserve a quilt because she can't be bothered.

I message her directly about it because I'm just that kind of person. I like hearing it straight from the other guy. MIL says her fingers hurt after the first 4 quilts and she's taking a break. I ask her if it has anything to do with the fact that we have no kids (which she expressed negativity against in the past) and she says no even though I know it's a lie. I push her more and ask her when she thinks the quilt will be done after her little ""break"" and she kind of loses her temper and says there's no quilt and there never will be a quilt.

I ask why and she says she's only interest in making quilts with her grandkids and things on them and we don't have enough hobbies and kids' hobbies to fill up a whole quilt. I tell her we have 2 beautiful dogs whom we love and could be put on there and she says ""I'm not making a whole quilt for a couple of goddamn dogs"" verbatim. I hang up and tell my husband and he's 100% on my side.

But now I got a really mean voice message from my SIL telling me that I crossed the line and am acting like a huge B\*tch for no reason.

1294,Not the A-hole,"Story time:

I have 2 older sibling who are in their late 20's, they were the best siblings to me especially when growing up. They both treated me equally and made sure to take time out of their lives to help me with school or just hang out watch movies etc.

So back in 2015 during the holidays both of my siblings who live together 3 hours away in a different city came over and spent almost a week with our parents and me which was fun, but one of the worst things to ever happen to me during those days was finding out the truth, finding out my siblings deep and darkest secret that they have been in a incest relationship and since then my relationship with them has been strained but they have no idea why.

Just few days ago my Brother texted me to join them at our parents house because they were coming over to announce some big news and that big news ended up being that both of my sibling were moving to Spain permanently soon, their excuse was that they are bored of their work and lives so they want a fresh start. My brother made it seem like that originally he was the only one moving there for work purposes and according to him once my Sister found this out she decided to move there to. The fucked up part is that both of parents although not happy at first gave their blessing and it just made me fucking snap. 

I said some horrible things to my sibling which none of it were me outing them to my parents or anything like that. I don't even know why I snapped, but in the end, I told my siblings that I want nothing to do with them and to have a great future together. I haven't spoken to them since and my parents and friends keep asking me why I was and still am so angry at them and that I should call my siblings to apologize but fuck that.

Before any of you ask No, I'm not interested in incest and I certainly do not have any interest or attraction to my siblings.

Also, I do not plan to out my Siblings to family or friends now or in the future, but I want no part in it and I don't want them to be part of my life anymore. I really hope that they are truly happy, but I'm fucking done.

So, am I the asshole here? I am too fucked up right now but I am sticking to my gun.


Edit: for anyone wondering how I found out, I was staying at my parents guest room which was at the top floor. Went to the washroom very early in the morning and heard muffled noises downstairs only to catch my sister giving my brother oral. It was pretty clear what was happening.


Edit #2: The more comments I read from you guys the more I question myself.

Edit #3: some of you guys not getting why I'm so upset is the very reason I'm upset. None of you guys are in my current position, especially those who fantasize incest.

Edit #4: I am thinking of texting my siblings and letting them know everything. Good or bad idea?

Edit #5: Just texted my Brother asking him if he and my sister are free tomorrow so we can talk and he replied back instantly saying that they will always make time for me in a heartbeat and that they'll be there on time and will be bringing some food and how they both love me no matter what my decision  is and now I'm crying hard",923,3139,0.92
1295,Not the A-hole,"I (32f) have a step-daughter (17) that we'll call Ashley. She came to live with us about a year ago when her mom moved out of state and she didn't want to go.

It's been a rough year. She had a lot of mental health issues, and ended up dropping out of high school and attending a full time therapy program. She finished the program, but got little out of it. She now stays in bed 24/7 watching Netflix and smoking weed all day.

Her dad and I have been trying really hard to get her to do basically anything. We enrolled her in online school. She lied about doing her work, and got kicked out. We signed her up for community college classes, she didn't go. I helped her get a job at my work, and she got fired before she started for not filling out the paperwork.

I guess she got tired of us pressuring her, and she waited for us to leave for work, and she packed her bags and flew to her mom's house. Evidentally they have been planning this for months. I am not sure why they didn't just tell us, because we wouldn't have been mad. We were planning on talking to her mom to see if she thought she'd do better there. Instead they said nothing and we were worried sick because we had no idea where she was. They actually did this once before. She lived with us for a few years and went for a visit to her mom's, and never came back. Her mom moved and wouldn't give us the new address for over 6 months.

When her dad texted her a few days ago, she said everything is his fault and she's done talking to him forever. Honestly, he has done so much for her. He has always been there for her, so he is super hurt by this. 

When she left, she just left everything in her room, including a bearded dragon (with no food or water). I have reached out to her several times over the past week to see if she has a plan to get her stuff, or if she wanted us to ship it to her. I would just ship most of it, but just like last time, we don't have their address. She hasn't responded to any of our texts or calls.

My plan is to leave her room as is for 30 days, then pack up all of her pictures/yearbooks and anything else that looks important. Everything else I will donate. A friend of mine who loves animals offered to take the bearded dragon.

We have a small house so storing all of her stuff indefinitely would really be hard.

So, WIBTA for donating her stuff and giving away her bearded dragon? Or as parents should we store her stuff until some day she can come get it? Her dad and I are both emotional and really hurt right now. We hope to rebuild our relationship with her some day, so I just want to make sure we're doing the right thing.",349,1543,0.97

I’ve brought this idea up to a lot of people I know and almost everyone has seemed borderline appalled. They ask me why I would ever want to sell my hair when I could donate it to Locks For Love or some other charity organization. I’ve explained the financial benefit it would bring me but several people have said that no amount of money would be more valuable to me than my hair would be to some kid with cancer. I strongly disagree. Bills gotta be paid. 

I believe that since it’s my hair I should get to do what I please with it. My friends believe that instead of selling I should bestow the blessing of my hair upon some random kid.

So I was in my therapy group, like every other normal day. I was wearing ripped jeans, a zip up hoodie, and a tank top. When I went to snack, I took off my jacket because It was hot. One of the staff saw me, and told me to put my sweater back on because my tank top was ""inappropriate"" (it didn't even show my stomach and the straps weren't thin).

Disclaimer(my therapy group was for suicidal/bipolar people)

I refused and ignored her because she was being completely ridiculous. Then, she forced me to go to her office, but I refused and said no multiple times (eventually I had to go). We went in the office, and then we fought about a fucking shirt until they called my mom.

My mom didn't give a shit though, because she though my shirt was fine.

I got real mad, called my therapist a cunt, and then had a mental breakdown.

1305,Not the A-hole,"Title. Jennifer was one of my best friends. We were extremely close in our college days. She was my ride or die best friend.  I was a bridesmaid in her wedding, she was one in mine to my ex husband. We threw each other bridal and baby showers. We are both in our 30’s with small children now.

Several years into our friendship Jennifer became friends with a girl we’ll call Holly. I had always really liked Holly. She and I never hung out alone, but we were frequently together as a group. 

I went through a very contentious divorce 5 years ago. It was very hard on me. Both Jennifer and Holly saw me cry over it. 

I’m happily remarried now with a soon to be toddler. I have also recently acquired some serious health issues. I haven’t seen any of my friends that much lately because i am frequently in the hospital, live farther away from them, have a toddler, and have a full time job. 

Well today I saw pictures on social media from Jennifer’s bday party last night. I knew nothing about it. Also, my ex husband is in the pictures. That’s odd because Jennifer was not friends with him. She only knew him because of our marriage. 

Then for some reason my mom (who is an asshole, but probably had good intentions to defend me) texts Jennifer to call her out, and Jennifer admits to me that Holly is dating my ex husband.. and has been for some time. Apparently Holly planned the party and told Jennifer that she did invite me, and that I just never answered her. Jennifer doesn’t believe Holly would lie to her about that. Well guess what.... she didn’t say a word to me. I even saw her 4 days ago. Nothing. 

Both of these girls had ample opportunities to be honest with me. It may have been a little awkward at first, but I wouldn’t have cared!!!! I liked Holly. I am happily married. I hold no more ill will towards my ex.

1306,Not the A-hole,"This post requires a fair amount of context. 

I had a friend who I'll refer to as F. F has a super difficult home life. Her parents are abusive, she has untreated depression and anxiety, she lives in a house with a lot of drugs and alcohol and it's overall just an awful living situation. My living situation is close to perfect. I live alone with my Dad (who makes a really good income- enough to support a family of 4-5 easily, so we don't struggle) who I get alone with extremely well. My Dad has never smoked, doesn't drink and certainly never does drugs. I don't have any mental health issues and I truly love my life.

Recently F has been distant. A couple of days ago she was EXTREMELY rude. She followed me around for the day constantly butting into conversations that she wasn't even involved in by saying ""I don't care"". I didn't snap at her, or really do anything because I know some people have worse days then others.

I was however talking to F about how I might have to put down one of my pets soon (a rat, but this rat literally means the world to me.) and she once again butts in with ""I don't care"".

I still didn't comment on it, because I'm more mature then that and I refuse to lose my cool over 3 words repeated over and over again. However, about 5 minutes later we were all cracking jokes/sharing funny stories and I mentioned how the day before I ""lost"" one of my rats (they all come when they're called, and if they don't, my dog loves them and she'll find them in an instant - my dog would never hurt them, she just likes to watch them). Pretty much she jumped off my table because I left them and she went after me. Before I could finish the story (she had jumped high onto my tv unit and was licking the TV) F suddenly blurts out ""Good, I hope she died"" and continued on cracking jokes like before.

I looked at her in obvious disgust, stood up and said that I wouldn't be talking to her again and that was extremely inappropriate for her to say something like that to me, especially so soon after I was talking about my pet needing to be put down. I told her that just because she has a bad day doesn't give her ANY right to behave this way to another human let alone a friend. She responded with ""I don't care"". I walked away and I haven't talked to her since.

She found me later that day and tried to apologise but I shot that down straight away by simply telling her I meant what I said earlier and I walked away yet again.

I know she was being completely childish but I also NEVER snap at people. I don't raise my voice and I do feel I might be overreacting. My friends have told me I'm being dramatic and I'm not thinking about F's life and how she might be stressed but it still left a bad taste in my mouth.",52,76,0.89

Giving it back would be useless because it’s so destroyed that there’s no way he could ever get any data back and I doubt he lacks the knowledge to replace the screen. If i kept it I would fix it if possible and use it in place of my phone. I’m so torn.

1312,Not the A-hole,"Okay sorry guys So sorry if  this is a bit long
I met my husband when I was around 16 and we have pretty much been together since, we always talked about growing up getting married and having lots and lots of babies. Flash forward a couple years  we’re married I’m a pre school teacher who ADORES kids and  husband has a good career and we’re ready to start our family! And this is where everything for me changes. It took us almost 2 years to get pregnant, so many failed pregnancy tests and disappointment feeling like something was wrong with me practically begging to have a baby when all my friends are around me having babies getting pregnant without even trying! It was disheartening to say the very least and I became depressed. Then came the day I FINALLY got pregnant! Initially I was over the moon but reality settled in fast. 
I. Was. MISERABLE.  It was not and easy pregnancy at all. Anyhow now I have a baby boy who I love very much but I absolutely have no desire to have any more children or become pregnant ever again.  I have told my husband who is already talking about having another (my babe is only 6months) that’d I’d be open to adoption later but I do NOT want to be pregnant, I’m traumatized. I quite literally have nightmares about becoming pregnant and every time we have sex I have a panic attack about my birth control not working so much so that we hardly have sex. Anyways I told my husband I want to get sterilized as it’s the only way I think I’ll have my sanity back but he is not a fan of the idea. He keeps telling me “you’ll change your mind someday we’re still really young” and things of that nature but I really won’t.  I’m pretty sure he’s even talked to his family about it (I’m only assuming this as they’ve been really pushy about “when’s the next one coming “ or “are you hoping for a girl next time” comments like that) but anyways, I confided in some friends and my mom about it and everyone seems to be on his side saying “ you knew he wanted a lot of kids you’re not thinking about his feelings” well so did I but that was before and this is now. I hate that everyone is making me feel like I’m taking something away from my husband when we have a perfectly wonderful baby right now. So back to my question am I the asshole here is this a selfish thing to do? 
Note: I had ppd and I am medicated for it it dies not make these feelings of anti birthing go away.


EDIT: I guess in my emotional state last night I didn’t make it clear that my husband is a super loving man and kind man and I don’t personally feel attacked by him (though  I do by his family), I don’t think he’s intentionally guilt tripping me it just happens that the way he feels makes me feel bad. He does try to understand but as of now he just keeps hoping for me to say what he wants to hear and I think that in this situation that’s okay",125,292,0.93

So today while at a short trip to Walmart i found myself in an uncomfortable situation. While in the self check out cash register I over heard a mother and a daughter arguing.Some information that will be useful further on this story: I am a heavier female, I am also recently pregnant, The mother is fairly young around her early 30's and is average weight, not too skinny and not too heavy, the daughter who is about 13 years old is wearing some fairly tight booty shorts and a tank top that looked like she was wearing it since last year before her growth spurg, she was a little on the bigger side and you could tell that she was starting to fill in. The argument went something like this:

Daughter: Mom pleaseee pleasee pleaseee can i get some chocolate?!

Mother: No, we have enough snacks here you can have something when we get home

Daughter: But we don't have any chocolate please can I just have one and we can share

Mother: (Sounding more frustrated now) I said no so stop asking.

Daughter: (Sounding desperate and ready to cry) Mom please please please here we can get reasees that's your favorite type of chocolate, ill just have one and you can have the rest.

Mother: (Pulling in her daughter close) Stop asking me for candy all the damn time, you keep eating candy like that and you gonna end up looking like her. (Pointing at me)

I turned around trying to give her the benefit of the doubt and understanding she's trying to make a point to her daughter at the expense of my body image, which i don't condone but i'm not going to hop into someone else's parenting bandwagon, but when I turn around all the way to meet her gaze I can tell she was making sure i heard, like a personal vendetta and mind you i don't know this woman, i have never seen her or her daughter in my life.

Me: Excuse me? (I waited for a few seconds for an I'm sorry or something but she just looked at me like i was dumb or something so i continued) I'll have you know I am actually 5 months pregnant (I'm not that far along but i thought id use it at my advantage to make her feel somewhat bad for talking about someones body)

She then rolled her eyes at me and said ""So?"" like i just meddled in her conversation and it was my fault if my feelings got hurt so i kinda snapped.

Me: Well you're absolutely right, they way your daughter keeps going and how you're dressing her she will most definitely end up like me, PREGNANT!

She looked appalled for a good moment but she didn't anything else other than give me really nasty side eye, I already had my groceries bagged and loaded in my cart to I went ahead and swiped my card and walked away without checking if the transaction went through fine or without grabbing the receipt, while I'm walking away i hear what I think is the girl crying, almost bawling hysterically, I didn't bother to look back, i was steamed and i just wanted out of the whole situation

Am i the asshole?",228,1270,0.93
1314,Not the A-hole,"I’ll try to keep it short. 

My brother started dating a girl and about 2 weeks after they starting dating she started sleeping over consecutive nights. Fast forward 2 weeks, she has moved in a lot of her personal belongings. Including clothes, toiletries and other nic naks. She has a apartment but she has been sleeping her almost every night for the past two weeks. 

I usually leave home before she leaves for the day and come back after she has returned. And she is pretty much having her run of the house. We live in a two bedroom one bathroom townhouse. 

I usually try to stay opposite level of the house from her because I do not relate to her whatsoever. She is much younger than me and we just don’t mesh. 

I brought up to my brother after a month of her being here almost daily and nightly that she should start contributing to bills if she is going to sleep, shower, eat, use internet, cable. The works. And he flipped. Saying I’m trying to ruin his relationship and I’m being petty. If this keeps up, how can he argue she isn’t “living here”? She has rent to pay at her other place but she has told us she “hates” it and likes being here.",32,36,0.92
1315,Asshole,"My girlfriend claims to be an empathetic person but I genuinely believe she is mentally ill and should discuss this with her therapist. Here me out:

She cries whenever other people are crying. It doesn’t matter why, if she sees someone crying, she starts tearing up. She won’t watch sports because she tears up if the other team loses too badly. She won’t watch movies that aren’t comedies or children’s movies.

She also laughs when other people laugh. Not out of social obligation like a polite chuckle but like a full on laugh and sometimes she can’t stop even when it wasn’t that funny and others have stopped. She says she does it even when she didn’t think it was funny but she just did because other people were and she can’t help it.

These behaviors drive me nuts and I think she should tell her therapist about these compulsions but she refuses. She says I’m an asshole for trying to change her but I’m trying to help her. Am I an asshole for telling her this is a mental illness and not just “empathy”?",310,860,0.91
1316,No A-holes here,"I've wondered about this for a while. Looking back, I am not sure if I would have done anything differently--or what I could have done differently.

My friend Ashley came out as trans (MTF) a few months before the day I married my husband. Since she is the friend that introduced us, she had been asked to be in the wedding party, but as a groomsman, because we thought she was a guy at that point, and she had known my husband since high school. Over the next couple months, she originally said she just wanted to be out, then later she said she might transition, and basically we smiled and nodded and tried our best to support her. (This was about a decade ago, we were all in our early 30s, and it was the beginning of trans awareness trends in my area, so there was a lot of much needed learning and googling involved.)

A couple months before our wedding, she pulled me aside and asked if she could be on the bridesmaids' side and wear the same dress.

The dresses had been ordered a couple months before that, and there definitely wasn't enough time to order one for her. After thinking about it, my husband and I told her that obviously it was really important to us to have her there on our wedding day--without her there would be no wedding. We explained the dress situation and offered her to either stay in the bridal party in a suit on my husband's side, or to excuse herself from the bridal party and come in any outfit that would make her feel comfortable. After about a week, she told us she wanted to stay in the wedding party in a suit. We offered that she could change into whatever she wanted after the ceremony and pictures, but she very quickly turned that down.

When I look at my wedding pictures, they're beautiful, and everyone looks truly happy. But I often wonder if we should have made a different choice.

Some side thoughts that may or may not matter, I don't know:

The dresses were a lilac pink/purple off-the shoulder, form-fitting bandage dress (remember those?) that would have been hard to match even remotely, and Ashley was not yet at a point where her body was shaped the same way that many dresses are cut to flatter.

Also, my family loved Ashley when they first met her (when she still presented as a man) and thought that she and I would end up together, so although it wasn't a concern back then, looking back I often wonder about how much explaining I would have had to do. Again, trans awareness was on the way up in our area. (My father and brother-in-law had a lot of questions for the first year, and many were highly inappropriate.)

Lastly, she hadn't come out at work yet, so she wasn't dressing in typical female clothes all the time; it was about 50/50 I think at that point.

Anyway, this had been on my chest for ten years, so please be honest: AITA?",155,510,0.91
1317,Asshole,"So I’m fully aware this may be beyond this sub’s paygrade but right now I’m in this phase where I just want as many opinions as possible.

Anyways, we’ve been together 7 years, married for 3. We were both childfree when we met but slowly he’s shifted over to wanting kids. Our marriage over the past year has been extremely rocky as a result since we still love each other and don’t want to live without each other.

But our marriage counselor in recent months has been pushing us to find a resolution because things can’t go on without getting worse. My husband sat me down a few weeks ago to talk about trial separation. He feels that if he misses his chance for children he’ll only resent me years later and he’d rather separate now than cause more pain for us. I’m heartbroken to say the least. 

Recently I saw a friend and she suggested something I’m afraid to bring up to my therapist or our counselor because I think they’ll call it crazy. She says I should just tell my husband I’d be willing to have a baby if he promises to take over all of the childcare, from infancy to teenager. This way we can stay together, he gets his child, and I still get to live my life as I’ve always dreamed. 

I havent asked him yet but I’ve talked to my mom and sister. They said it’s feasible but they can’t imagine this system working out in the long run, and that I’ll probably get more people judging me for being an “absentee mom.” AITA for considering this option instead of separation?",990,3291,0.92
1318,Asshole,"I just moved into an HOA. I pay a monthly fee which covers maintenance of common areas and amenities, including a pool.

The pool has a number of rules and guidelines, one of which is that any resident can request a lap swim at the top of the hour for 20 minutes. For example, at 2:40 p.m., I could tell the lifeguard I would like to swim laps and they would clear the pool for 20 minutes. The pool is small so even if two children were playing in the pool with one person swimming laps, the children would get in the way of the lap swimmers.

Yesterday, I requested a lap swim and everyone had the clear the pool while I swam. A woman came up to me after I had finished swimming, and told me that it was rude to have everyone get out so that one person can swim laps. I told her it was in the rules I received and she said no one ever requests a lap swim because it inconveniences everyone else. She told me to go swim at a gym if I really want to swim laps. I told her that I pay a fee to swim here, just like she does, and I don’t want to pay to use a gym as well.

AITA for wanting to swim laps in my neighborhood pool?

EDIT: It's actually common for many pools to have ""adult swims"" where children must clear the pool for 10 minutes every hour to take a break. In our pool, we allow children to swim laps with the adults if they wish. I can only swim at certain times: 12:40, 1:40, etc. until 8 p.m. on the weekend. (Pool hours are noon to 8 p.m., Monday through Sunday.) Other swimmers may swim at any other time unless an adult or child calls for a lap swim. We don't have mandatory clearings of the pool every hour since we have two guards. This only occurs if someone (an adult or a child) wants to lap swim.",406,956,0.95
1319,Not the A-hole,"My ex-wife and I have two kids together, now 22 and 26. We divorced when the youngest was about 7. I paid every child support + alimony payment required of me.

My ex-wife and I have been on relatively good terms and share almost all the same friends. One friend, Janice, we both knew since college and was basically an aunt to our kids. She passed away from melanoma skin cancer, her health deteriorated rapidly.

Before her death she asked me to come visit her. She confessed that my ex-wife (her best friend) had confided in her that my oldest child was not mine. She Bawled her eyes out asking for forgiveness for not telling me sooner. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t angry she kept it from me, but better late than never, and I just wanted to give her whatever comfort I could. 

Anyway, since then I’ve taken my ex-wife to court for paternity fraud. I basically just went to a lawyer, explained the situation, and asked him to do whatever he could. I’ve already had an official paternity test done and verified he’s not my biological son.

I still love my kids unconditionally, and I’d take a bullet for either of them without hesitation. This is not about them, it’s about my ex-wife knowingly defrauding me out of thousands of dollars. I don’t think I can let that slide.

1322,Asshole,"So, my family and I live on the opposite side of the country from my in-laws. They are wonderful, fantastic people whom I love but we've come to a major breaking point in our relationship: my son's name. I wanted to give my son a specific name that my husband decided was too casual, but we could use as a nickname. So, working backwards, we came up with an excellent, formal name that we could use my name as a nickname for (which was great because my husband and I have long formal names but go by our nicknames). 

&#x200B;

The problem is MIL doesn't approve of the nickname. She has taken our son's formal name and come up with her own and refers to him by it exclusively. To the point that the entire side of the family on that coast refers to him by MIL's nickname. I found this to be deeply hurtful. While I can't control what people do I found it incredibly disrespectful that my MIL would tell her family to call him her own specific nickname (husband and I don't have social media so there is no other way for his family to know that we call him something different). I spoke with her about it and expressed my hurt and she said it was her right as her Grandma to give him a nickname. Fair enough, I thought, but I asked her out of consideration for how I feel to please ask everyone else to call him by my nickname. She didn't think it was something I should be upset about but begrudgingly agreed to tell everyone to call him my name. 

&#x200B;

This was about 9 months ago. I thought that we had moved past this, and that we had gotten over the bad feelings between us. We're supposed to fly out to see them in two days and I was genuinely excited to see everyone, including MIL! But FaceTiming two days ago I could heard family in the background referring to my son by MIL's name, immediately making me want to cry. It feels sooooooo unbelievably disrespectful that not only would she try to give my son her own name, but would also not respect my wishes. I can't stand the idea of sitting around his whole 30+ family members for the next week, trying to decide if I want to hear her nickname the whole time or if I want to be the bitchy daughter-in-law who keeps correcting everyone else. 

&#x200B;

WIBTA if I just didn't go on the trip? My husband can take our son to see his family and I don't want to deal with the drama, but I also don't want to be petty and miss out on a nice family trip. My refusing to go would be seen as a major slight by his family.

Edit: thank you all for your input and judgement. As someone said this was probably better suited for r/relationshipadvice, but I was *hoping* for judgement on my decision to stay home. Unfortunately a lot of you who thought I was going to be TA also thought it would be appropriate to call me names other than TA for caring about this.

1323,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I live across the street from a grocery store and we're over there pretty much every day and often together.

He was out of town for 2 weeks because his mom was sick and while he was gone, I was spending a lot of time with a couple of his friends that I get along with because I was lonely. I went to the same grocery store twice with one of them, once to grab a coffee and once to buy some stuff for dinner with him and his wife. 

My husband got back from his trip and went to the grocery store without me and a cart collector pulled him aside and told him that I was a snake and that I was stepping out on him with another guy and parading him around and that all the workers were talking about it.

I was extremely upset by the judgement and it made me feel embarrassed to go back to the store because I will be judged every time for this misconception and apparent gossip about me.

we've been married about 8 years. She's not a prude in bed, but not what I'd call adventurous. That's partly on me, I don't communicate my wants very well. I'm fine admitting I have a problem with that.  
  
I bought an oculus rift last year and of course porn is a big thing. My wife has zero interest in gaming so she's been totally hands off when it comes to VR. I got her to try out google earth exactly once. She thought it was so-so. I thought my porn was safe. i was wrong.  
  
She always calls me on her way home from work, I mean religiously.  The other day I get home and strap on the porn visor. The wife gets off work early, gets a phone call as she enters the parking lot, and proceeds to stay on that call all the way home. She hangs up in the garage, walks inside, and catches me wrangling the unruly hog. That wouldn't be so bad, but the rift is mirroring what I'm watching on the monitor.  
  
We don't yell or scream at each other or name call. She just tapped me on the shoulder and asked me what I was looking at. Her expression broke my heart into pieces. i can't even describe it. A mix of sadness and disappointment, perhaps a touch of anger.  
  
I explained it's just porn (which she knows I watch and is okay with) and, to me anyway, VR porn is more voyeuristic than fantasy. I don't pretend I'm banging these girls, it's more of a 3rd party view of what someone else is doing. It didn't matter, of course. The nuances of sexuality in three dimensional pornspace are hard to express in the heat of the moment.  
  
So she asks me to hand her the rift. I hesitate, and that pisses her off and makes me look worse than I already do. I look like I'm hiding something, which I suppose I was. I give her the oculus and she puts it on, she doesn't say anything for a few seconds. She takes it off and places it on the desk and goes and locks herself in the master bedroom. I slept on the couch and she has not responded to my texts all day. She may just be busy at work but I doubt it. She'll be home in an hour or so and I'm not sure what to say.  
  
is VR porn a *form* of cheating? is it *almost* a form of cheating? is it *bordering* on cheating? Is it a variant of *emotional* cheating? Is it an asshole thing to watch when in a committed relationship? Am I an asshole?

My dog passed about 2 months before we split, and we got a new puppy two weeks later. I say ""we got the puppy"" when I really mean I did. I paid $900 for the puppy, $600 in various vet bills and accessories like a crate, bed, etc, plus I was the only one who brought her on walks, refilled her food and water dishes, etc. Basically it was *my dog* and I was sharing it with them. We didn't have shared finances.

Our split up wasn't so amicable but it wasn't hell on earth between us. The problem is she wouldn't give me the dog. She argued it became attached to her daughter and I won't lie, they really bonded. Because of that, it should stay with her. I told her to pay for at least half of the money I put into the dog and I'll concede, but I only said this because I knew she'd say no and she did say no. Still she kept the dog.

I ""stole"" the dog back insofar we met at our old place for a chat and to pick up remaining things and I hid the dog in a box I brought to my car. She didn't even notice until the next day. I'm now ignoring all communication and she doesn't know where I live now.

Was I the asshole? FWIW, according to the dog license, it's under my name, according to the vet it's under my name, and all treatments have my name under credit card used. She has nothing tying her to the dog besides photos.

Now I’m not exactly the flamboyant type, I like to keep a low profile and am not a “stereotypical gay” ,as awful as that sounds, so they wouldn’t have guessed it first. 

J was really nice with me about it and didn’t tell anyone because I just wasn’t ready to fully come out as I hadn’t even told my family, J was the only person that knew.

He said he was fine with me being gay but was furious that I didn’t tell him sooner and asking why I told J first and questioning the closeness of our friendship.

1343,Not the A-hole,"I took my wife out for valentine's dinner a couple of years ago to a Middleton's steakhouse (UK). It was lunchtime and there were 3 tables taken when we got there. I had never been to a Middleton's steakhouse but all my friends highly recommended so thought I'll give it a go. We ordered a starter drinks and our main, the starter came in a timely manner as did the drinks. All going well so far, so we then waited 1 hour 20 minutes I had mentioned a couple of times about the wait and the waitress was apologetic. Then the food arrived and oh my god! I went for a premium steak and got the grisliest piece of steak ever. I'm not kidding my face grew a six pack after the workout of chewing. 

So I complained explained I will pay for everything else just not the steak as it is uneatable. The waitress said I can get another one for you. I replied with I don't have another hour to wait. She said she would get me the manager to issue me the refund. 20 minutes later no manager, I'm looking around and everyone else is looking for where there orders are all building up to the conclusion of me saying to my wife f##k this we're leaving. We walked towards the door and the manager was there with the waitress. The waitress said to the manager that's the man, I straight up said you had your chance to make this right and you lost it.

1345,Not the A-hole,"So this happened a few months ago but it still bothers me. I've struggled with mental health issues (anxiety, depression) since middle school (Im 18 now) and have begged my mom since then to let me go to a specialist, because it was becoming overwhelming and I was having dark thoughts, especially in my last few years of high school. My mom is very religious and always told me to ""just pray about it"", and also we are very low income so it was not a top priority for her. But after one particularly bad depressive episode, she finally helped me set me an appointment.

On the day of the appointment, I was actually very excited because i had wanted to speak to a therapist for YEARS at this point, and I thought finally, a professional was going to give me real advice, not just tell me to ""pray about it.""

Well when I got there, the therapist seemed okay at first, she was asking general questions to get a gauge on my mental state. She then asked me, ""how would you rate your anxiety on a scale from one to ten?""

When I replied, ""uhh, about a 6/7,"" she scoffed, and my heart dropped.

""6 or 7? Girl you're not even fidgeting or anything,"" she said and typed something into her computer.

After that happened i immediately felt closed off. I came into the appointment completely ready to open up and tell her everything about how i was feeling, but after that I literally just wanted to walk out the door. I feel like if she was surprised at the number she could have asked, ""Why do you feel that way?"" Or something, and then I could have explained myself better, but no, she just wrote me off.

So after leaving the appointment, I told my mom that I wasn't going back, and she of course got mad because I had been begging for such a long time, and now after my first appointment, I refused to go back. I can see where she's coming from, and I also think maybe I am making my anxiety seem worse than it is. So AITA?",69,217,0.94

That’s a little backstory to setup for the events that happened this morning...

I wake up this morning and ask GF to run to town and get us some Arby’s. She agrees and I tell her to grab a 20 dollar bill out of the gun safe and get whatever she wants, and to get my usual order. She gets the food and we sit down together and eat it, all is good. Several hours later I want to run to the gas station to get a Bang energy drink. I ask GF where the change is from the Arby’s trip...she responds with “well I spent it all there” this seems odd because two meals usually doesn’t add up to 20 dollars. So ask her two more times if she really spent it all and she reassured me that she did. So I go outside to get in my truck when I decide to just check her car and see if the receipt was in there from the Arby’s trip. Sure enough it was, the goal was 11 dollars and some change. I confront her about lying and she says oh yeah I put the rest in my car for gas. I am angry because she lied about where the money was.

1351,Not the A-hole,"*edit/info for clarification: I didn’t cancel the vacation and won’t. It just makes me want to not see her. 

I  think it’s disturbing that my sister-in-law, who has a long-distance, limited relationship with our children, had their names tattooed on her arm. She did not ask us how we felt, just posted a picture on social media once it was done.
She has no children of her own, but is still in her child-bearing years. She is not a close beloved aunt of my children- they see her once a year and talk to her briefly on holidays. They never talk about her or ask about her between those times. They like her well enough, but she likes to lecture them and attempt to parent them, so a little of her goes a long way. 

She is going to expect us to all oooh and ahh about this tattoo. I have nothing nice to say. I am not flattered, I feel violated. I feel like it glorifies tattoos (something neither I or their father have, though this isn’t about tattoos in general-it’s about tattoos of my kids’ names. To each their own on tattoos). More importantly, it glorifies her relationship with our kids. She barely knows them, and doesn’t spend time with them when we do visit. On our last visit, she sent our kids to McDonalds with her friend and didn’t join them. She later used a photo the friend took of my sons eating, and posted it as if she HAD been there. It’s crazy. Instead of the cost of a tattoo (this tattoo is huge BTW), how about a plane ticket to visit the children you claim to love so much? She talks about my children taking care of her when she’s in a nursing home... why would they? They will be busy with their own families, and taking care of their parents!

I was so mad when I saw the tattoo that I told my husband I wanted to cancel our upcoming vacation to see her (and their grandparents). I have been taking my anger out on him, which is probably unfair but I feel his lack of communication with them leads to this kind of crazy.

I(21F) had my birthday 3 months ago. A friend of mine (24M, we'll call him Jim) gifted me an awesome silly hat I've really wanted for a while for cosplay reasons (I'm a huge gaming fan/nerd and love cosplays). I was really excited and grateful.

Yesterday my boyfriend(21M) was attending a gaming event (I couldn't go because of work) and asked me to borrow my hat, which I gladly let him wear. 
Turns out Jim was also at the event and he met my boyfriend there. They didn't hang out much, but later that day after the event I got a text from Jim and he was PISSED. He asked me if I gave my hat away to my boyfriend, and I explained that I simply let him borrow it for the event. However he was still upset and said it was a gift for __me__ and not my boyfriend, and sharing gifts like that is extremely rude and inconsiderate. 

I apologized if I [unintentionally] hurt his feelings but also asked, don't I have the right to decide what I do with the hat, as it has become my item after he's gifted it to me? To which he responded yeah whatever, but I was still an asshole for giving it to someone else. I said if his gift comes with so many conditions, I would rather give it back to him. He got defensive saying that wasn't necessary and I'm overreacting.

Scott and I come from very different. He is a tradesman, but is skilled enough to earn a very good wage. He left school at 16 and spent all the time working and developing his skills. His family are very working class and are proud of their roots. 

I come from a very different background. My parents are both professionals. I was privately educated and have been to university, and now work in finance. 

Scott's parents themselves worked incredibly hard to build a better life for themselves, and they instilled that work ethic into Scott and his brother and sister.

The problem is that Sam and Charlotte (his brother and sister) see him as a sellout for marrying someone from a different sort of background to them. It's never been said but I know they consider me to be a spoiled brat who has always got what I want. In the past Scott has been made fun of for being with ''one of *them*'' as though my background makes me different.

1360,Not the A-hole,"First post, so I'll inadvertently f\*\*\* something up here--but here's my story:

I met my ex-wife around 9 yrs ago, when her son was 4 mos old. We got married 2 yrs later and he has called me Dad his ever since. My daughter was born 2 yrs into our marriage, when he was 4 (just keeping continuity in the story here). I taught him how to ride dirt bikes, skateboard, and of course be a competent gamer lol. He was my son.

We had just finished building a house and moved in about 8 mos ago. We had lived in the house for a month and that's when my ex-wife told me she planned on showing horses with this family she had met last year, it seemed strange but ok. The first time, my stepson went, who also loves showing horses, and I'll never forget what he said to me a couple days after their trip. ""Dad, is it ok for another woman to talk and hug another man if she is married?"". I didn't know what to say to this other than, ""Sure, adults have friends and they talk and hug"". I didn't confront her about this, as she told me she earlier they were doing several more horse shows.

The last weekend she came back, she said she wanted a divorce. That's when I asked her about my stepson told me. She got absolutely furious and stormed out and said she needed time.

I think she must have started to think that I was going to turn her son against her, because her disposition changed.

During the divorce several times she stated that I don't get custody and I can only see my stepson if she lets me. Another 2 mos went by, I was trying to find ways to get close to each of my kids but it was proving hard. SO, I had found a couple of local events going on, the first for my daughter and the second being my step-son. When I asked my ex-wife if she could keep my stepson, she threw an absolute fit and said she wanted all his belongings (this house was already sold and I was renting a 3bdr in town). Thankfully, I talked her over it and she didn’t take his stuff.

About 3 mo. ago, my stepson told me that I wouldn't be his stepdad anymore...out of nowhere. I told him yes, but “I'll always be your dad and I will always love you”. For some reason, he felt compelled to argue: ""yeah, but you don't get any custody”. I knew for sure someone had told him that, and when I asked my ex-wife she threw another fit and said she didn't say that to him. Something changed with his disposition, he started not listening to me and then several times told me I'm not his dad...At this point I didn't know what to do and was starting to question whether or not my stepson wanted to be with me at all. Then my ex-wife finally told me she wanted all of his things and I obliged, as I saw this coming. 

AITA for not trying harder to keep my stepson in my life? At this point (3 months not seeing him and enrolled in another school 70 mi. away), I have written-off any possibility of having him back in my family. I now have no way of contacting him at all and wonder if I should have made better choices.

EDIT 1: We have joint custody of my daughter. I did hire a lawyer and tried to get her to let me adopt him b4 finalizing the divorce, but she didnt want to strip his bio dads rights (even tho he pays no child support and has no license or vehicle).",71,405,0.96
1361,Not the A-hole,"I’m sitting in the quiet car of the train right now and I was trying to get some sleep like I’m sure most other people were. We made a stop and someone got in with an older child who is clearly nonverbal for whatever reason (I cannot see the duo but I can hear the interactions). The child is making a lot of very loud moaning/cat like sounds. This bothered me a little bit because while I understand the quiet car may make things a little bit easier for the child, the child is one person out of 40 people in the car and he is the only one making (very loud) noise. The other cars aren’t even loud so I don’t see the need for him to be in the quiet car where people specifically came to be quiet and be around quietness. I was bothered enough by the moaning noise but now the mother (I think) has played music for him or a video for him without headphones on two occasions. It only lasts for about 10 seconds, but it’s just annoying me because again this is the quiet car. And it’s not like she doesn’t know this is the quiet car, there are signs everywhere and the conductor tells you before you get on the train. I don’t want to be rude about it because I understand that the mother is in a difficult situation and I do empathize with her, however I just don’t think it was appropriate for her to bring her child into the quiet car knowing that he wouldn’t be quiet.  I just want to tell her that maybe next time she could consider another car because all the other cars are generally quiet but the difference is you can make noise without people feeling really annoyed. Idk I probably won’t say anything either way but WIBTA?

Update: 

First I just wanted to thank y’all for your input. I didn’t end up saying anything to the mom or handing her a note or anything. I was highly considering going the note route but at the end of the day I figured she had her reasons for being in there and I didn’t want to be the catalyst to something negative. Several people mentioned saying something to the conductor but unlike some people are thinking, I’m not an evil person and I didn’t want to have to make them move because undoubtedly that would have upset the child even more. I am considering contacting the train network and letting them know what happened, maybe they’ll be stricter about noise in the future or hopefully they’ll be able to make more accommodations for special needs people! 

I think the main point some people are missing is that it’s a quiet car and everyone in there has a situation that leads them to sit in the quiet car. I might not be special needs but like I mentioned in some comments, my situation is that earplugs/headphones give me really bad headaches and I choose to sit in the quiet car so I won’t come upon a scenario in which I will have to use them because...who wants a headache that lasts all day? The point of the quiet car is for it to actually be quiet, people are not allowed to bring screaming babies in there unless they are just passing through, people are not allowed to play videos which the mom was doing, people are not allowed to be talking to the person next to them, it’s just not allowed because it is supposed to be a safe haven for the people that need quiet.",72,280,0.95

1363,Not the A-hole,"Basically, my roommate has a two year old. Overall he’s a great guy and generally takes great care of his daughter. She’s at our place half the time, and the other half is at her moms. Overall, she’s very well behaved. However, I’ve made it very clear I don’t want to be responsible for watching his kid. It’s not that I don’t like children, it’s more about responsibility if I’m watching her and something goes wrong. 

My roommate works two jobs, and to be honest he works his ass off trying to provide and be a good father. Recently, he has started asking me to watch her while he away at work. I’ve told him I’m not comfortable watching her and out of courtesy I let him get away with leaving for an hour or two. 

About a week ago, I arrived home from work after a significant amount of overtime. He asked me to watch her for a couple hours while he ran out for some postmates runs. I said no a couple times, and reluctantly agreed to watch her because I was sympathetic. 

Two hours turned into well over three and passed her bed time. She was being a brat (probably really sleepy) so I took her to the crib and hung out with her for another thirty minutes until she was asleep. I went back downstairs to my couch and fell asleep watching a movie. I don’t know the time frame but I heard her screaming at the top of her lungs and pulled myself out sleep to check on her. She somehow managed to climb out of the crib and walk through the baby gate id accidentally left open. 

She fell down the stairs and was holding her head with a little bruise. I was panicked and took her straight to the hospital while calling my roommate over and over. He never picked up. Fortunately, the hospital is only five minutes from my house so we arrived quickly. I threw all the medical expenses on my credit card - she had broken finger and few bruises. 

I frantically called his ex, who also didn’t answer. Guess where they both were - fucking together. I told them what happened and apologized repetitively. We got into a massive fight - leading to me telling both of them they were terrible parents and I wasn’t paying for a fucking thing. Friday, I found he and his ex filed a complaint with our landlord for negligence or some shit on my part for falling asleep while watching the kid and are going to dispute the hospital charge with the court.

1366,Asshole,"We're both mid 30s, less than 6 months post divorce, and have been dating for 6 weeks. We see each other 2-3x per week and usually alternate whose house we go to. When we go to her house, we typically go out for food since she's in the process of moving so she's never cooked for me before. I've made dinner for her 4x at my place, not huge productions but I am a damn good cook so I don't mind cooking for other people.

The issue came about after dinner, she had not offered to help me clean up after we finish eating. I didn't say anything the first 3x, just chalked it up to her having a good time or wanting to play with my border collie. The 4x after I was done cleaning, I was severely annoyed that she had yet offered to help clean up after I had cooked really delicious meals for her four times. She's a really kind person, and I would never have thought she was doing this maliciously or to use me, but when I put myself in her shoes I was astonished how she thought watching me cook and then clean without offering help was ok.

A little background, I'm was raised in NC and she was raised in MN. So when I confronted her I asked if it's considered rude in MN to not offer help cleaning up after someone cooks for you. She said it's not, and that when she cooks for someone, she doesn't want anyone in the kitchen at all.

&#x200B;

My boyfriend (James\*) and I have been together for 1 year. Birth control is for both our benefit. For him, it's not having to wear a condom and for me, it's reducing the risk of pregnancy. I've been on the pill for a few months until I started getting breakthrough bleeding so I figured I should just get an IUD which would provide more efficacious, long-term control. I was still nervous about the insertion itself and the side effects (irregular bleeding for the months to come, cramping, hormonal effects) and expressed them to James who told me it would be fine.

&#x200B;

Next week is the actual insertion. James said nothing more than ""it'll be fine"" so I asked explicitly for more support such as being there to get me and spending time with me after. He has no classes that afternoon, no exams for the next two weeks, and a vehicle to drive. 

&#x200B;

He asked me when my appointment was again and I said Wednesday. He agreed, but then said, ""Oh Wednesday, that's the Game 3 (basketball) isn't it?"" I asked him if he had something going on and he replied, ""No, but I feel like my classmates/friends *might* want to do something."" 

&#x200B;

I asked him if these plans were concrete and he said no, he just has a sense that some kind of party/social event will take place since they missed the last game. He'd like us there, but I said I might not want to go, and that I'd rather us do something since we haven't had an actual date night in almost 2 weeks. For comparison, he'd gone out to the club with his friends twice that week. He was intent on going and asked me, ""Does it really make a difference if I go and leave for a few hours?"" 

&#x200B;

I got quite upset when he said that. He wasn't happy either, saying he's trying to balance going out with me and seeing his friends. I book the appointments, get the medication from the pharmacy, go through the side effects and he knows this. I know an IUD insertion can vary in terms of pain from woman to woman, but I feel crummy for a non-concrete event taking precedence over something that's both our responsibility and more so mine.

1369,Not the A-hole,"Background: My mother is deeply in debt, I don’t know how much but I assume well into six figures, due primarily to poor choices. Five years ago when my father died, she inherited $160k and a paid off house in good condition. She spent about $25k on various necessary things. The rest was gone in 9 months, on we don’t know what. Fast forward to now and her only income is Dad’s SS, which would be more than enough for her to live on if she were debt-free. However, she routinely borrows hundreds of dollars from me and my brother. Furthermore, she has four large dogs (75-90 pounds I’m guessing) and she chooses to feed them EXPENSIVE dog food. Like $70/bag expensive. It is not prescription. She will do this even if it means going to the food bank to feed herself. 

So here is the situation. My mother stands to inherit approximately $200k from my aunt’s estate. Part of the estate is a piece of land worth approximately $100k, with six donkeys living on it. My aunt LOVED these donkeys and my mother would like to receive them and the property as part of the value of her inheritance.

My brother and I would like to present her with an ultimatum. If she accepts the donkeys and property, as opposed to letting them be sold and getting cash to use towards her debt, we will cut her off from ever lending her another cent and will not lift one finger to care for the donkeys. Even if it means she winds up homeless. Even if it means the donkeys starve and die. Before you ask, yes, we are willing to lose our relationship with her. It is already strained at best. I barely speak to her outside of birthdays and Christmas, etc. 

If we do this, would we be the assholes?

Edited to add: we do not want any harm to come to the donkeys and would call a rescue if it actually came to that. However, I feel it’s necessary for us to be that dramatic when we speak to her, because she is *going* to assume that we will bail her out if it comes to that. She has to understand that this time, it is not going to happen.",39,97,0.94
1370,Not the A-hole,"When I was 18, I had a nice amount of cash from a car accident and offered to help my parents out with things they needed for the house. They told me to keep it for university
 So I wanted to use it for things I'd need. However , my parents summon me into the living room and told me that they wanted half of the car accident money. I asked why? They told me it was only fair. I told them no because they didn't force my older brother (who was claiming dole at the time and would just do what he wanted and smoked weed despite my dad being in the police) to pay anything. I was kinda upset that they would just demand the money, so I asked to go to my friend's house and talk to him about it. 

 He said that if I didn't want to stay at home, stay at his. But I needed some essentials and went back. But my mistake was telling my parents that I was staying at his for the night. 

I was then chased downstairs and my mother threw herself against the door. I raised my arms thinking she'd smack me (she's done it before) and then I'm grabbed by the collar of my coat and thrown to the floor by my dad. He proceeds to scream and yell in my face about how I'm a horrid ungrateful cow I was, and my mam did slap my face when I didn't respond. How could I? I was a tiny 18 year old paralysed with fear, clutching onto my bag terrified of what my parents were doing. Eventually my mam grabbed me, pulled me up and threw me out. I was left wailing in the street and went back to my friend's house to cry to him and his mam. They told me to just stay permanently. 

I tried going back a week later, but they both demanded an apology of me and after sitting there listening to them yell at me, I decided I didn't want to stay there anymore, and I left with my friend. 

In the 7 years since, I moved into a place with my friend, we've been dating for 4 and a half years but the family affair hovers around. Everyone except my dad have tried to talk about moving on, putting it past us and all that. My mam and I have had arguments were she still thinks that they didn't do anything wrong, and I've called her out. I've told her what I want which I think isn't unreasonable. I want her and my dad to apologise to me for their over reaction. That's it. But she told me that ""oh well I don't think he'd apologise"". Then what's the point? 

So what I'm asking is that am I an arsehole for not wanting to deal with them anymore? I've decided that for my mental health, no. I don't, but I'm concerned that they're gonna go around to the rest of the family, call me the arsehole and blame my boyfriend for the live I lead now

1371,No A-holes here,"tl,dr: wife used $1300 worth of credit card points to book 2 nights at a hotel for a milestone birthday for me. I upset her by saying that it was way more money than I felt comfortable spending. 

So I was reviewing my credit card activity like I do about once a month and I noticed that my chase rewards points total seemed lower than I thought it was. I took a look at recent activity and saw that 85,000 points had been used to book 2 nights at a favorite hotel of my wife and I. This is almost $1300 worth on the sapphire reserve card. 

We have never spent more than $400 on a hotel room, so I assumed it was a mistake. I thought maybe one of us was looking at rooms and accidentally booked it. It never crossed my mind that it wasn’t a mistake. So I started calling for my wife.”hey Fred’s wife, were you looking at rooms at such and such hotel?”

She comes in with a sad look on her face and explains to me that it was a surprise for my birthday. I immediately said that it was way more money than we should be spending for 2 nights somewhere. I said that we could stay somewhere for a week for that many points. She says that it’s for my birthday and we can afford it and it’s the best room in the hotel (somewhat famous hotel in a somewhat exotic location, BTW). I say that I thought we were saving all those points to fly our daughter to and from college. She gets upset. Now we’re not talking about it. 

The booking is cancellable and I want to cancel it and use the points for something that offers more bang for the buck. AITA?

Update. Talked it through with wife and decided to cancel 1 of the 2 nights she booked at fancy hotel, but extend the trip to 3 nights with 2 of them at a more reasonably priced (but still very nice) hotel nearby. We will spend less overall, but get an extra night and have the experience she wanted me to have. She’s a wonderful, understanding woman. As I said, I’m a lucky man.",31,79,0.95

Suddenly, this guy rolls into the outpost and completely destroys their galleon and killed the one guy who was still on it then starts attacking ours. We all get in my crews galleon and start chasing him down. We lose the first fight cuz the kids offered to do repairs on the ship and well... Sucked at it. 

We sink and then get a message from a guy. He knows the streamer and fucking hates him and offers help. We have my hubby leave cuz he was getting tilted and losing his shit. I just wanted to kick this guys ass. After he tells us about this stream my hubby starts watching it and this guy is fucking flaming us. He's calling us all kinds of names and all that. I lose my shit when he starts shit talking about me for being a girl. I load up the stream on my phone, comment calling him to quit being a pussy and fly the PvP flagand we will settle this. I kept the stream going in the background listening to him talk shit cuz I wanted to hear him rage when we got to him.

We finally catch him and we sink him 4 times and the last time we are on his ship dancing while killing them as they spawn. His team and fan base are calling us assholes for spawn camping.

I still live in a different state. If I were to look after her, either I move to her state or she moves in with me (I'd have to move to rent a 2-bedroom place then).  
If no one takes my sister in, I guess she might go to foster care?

My girlfriend and I recently moved into a rental, she has a son around 7, that she splits custody with the father who lives nearby, like ten minutes away. He has him during the week and we have him on weekends. 

Already though I’m having some difficulty with it since either we have to find a sitter or one of us has to stay home by around 7 on the weekends. 

There was a miscommunication recently this weekend where I thought we had plans to go out to Pride and she thought I wasn’t interested this year and couldn’t find a sitter- so it didn’t happen. 

I asked her if there was a chance we could tweak the days like the father has the kiddo Tuesday-Friday and we have him Saturday-Monday. She said she brought up that to the dad at first, but it was shot down since the dad didn’t want the weekdays split up. 

There’s always the option of a sitter, but I thought we could ask to edit the days first...

1375,No A-holes here,"A little background, my husband has 5 siblings and grew up in Brazil and I grew up in USA. He lived there his whole life and when we got married (5 years ago) I moved there to be with him while we applied for his residency in the USA. Our ultimate goal was to move to the USA and find work, start a family, save money. 

About 3 years ago, his 80 year old father started to feel tired. It began with him not moving around as much and asking his family to bring him everything to his room. During this time, I also got pregnant and had a baby boy.  We raised our son in Brazil for about 2 years until my husband got his green card. Once he got it, we planned to move to the USA within six months. Well, his father’s health kept declining and for the past year we put off our move to take care of him. I mentioned my husbands siblings because I always felt they didn’t put in as much work as my husband did to take care of their father. My husband was basically his primary care taker. As you can imagine, this is very hard and constant work. His siblings would help out, but most of the responsibility landed on my husband. We found out a few months ago, his father has stage 4 cancer. 

Although this news was heartbreaking, we couldn’t put off our move any longer this year. We had to move to the USA or risk losing the green card and all the money we invested. We made arrangements and my husbands siblings took over the care-taking responsibilities for his father. 

We’ve been in the US for about a month now. Our move was very emotional for my husbands family because they grew accustomed to having us around. My husband is also feeling very guilty about leaving when his father is on his death bed. 

As expected, it’s taken a lot to adjust to life here for all of us. I am currently 7 months pregnant and working. My husband is looking for work but hasn’t been successful yet. On top of that, his family sends him messages saying how much they want him to come back and how much they need him. 

He wants to go back for a couple months and I can’t help but feel exasperated. I love my husbands family and I can understand the absolute stress everyone is under, but I feel like our children and I are being pushed to the side lines. Also, this complicates his residency application.

I have been completely supportive of whatever my husband decides. I always tell him I totally understand what he’s going through and this is his decision to make. But I keep thinking if he goes back, it will only cause more work and stress for me. I basically have to work, raise my son and prepare for birth on my own. On top of that, I would truly just miss my husband so much if it wasn’t here with me. Thinking about him leaving makes me feel so sad and lonely. 

I’m feeling so resentful of my husbands family and that makes me feel guilty. I want to tell my husband that he shouldn’t leave me, but I feel it would sound selfish. AITA for wanting my husband to stay?",36,55,0.87

I am the second of four children. Myself and all my siblings have children of our own. My son Adam and daughter Maria are 13 and 11. My sister Claire and her husband Matt have one daughter, Rachel. 

Rachel is 15 and she is a massive bully to the other kids. Since she is the oldest all the girls look up to her, and since she was little she has a few cousins who she has enjoyed excluding and making them feel left out. Every family gathering for as long as I can remember has ended with someone in tears and the problem usually being traced back to Rachel. Yesterday Maria came up to me crying because Rachel told her that she was stupid and ugly. 

I had a word with Claire and said that while she and Matt are welcome, I don't want them bringing Rachel here since she is a bully and troublemaker. 

There is a problem however. Rachel was born with numerous health conditions. Type 1 diabetes, asthma and life threatening allergies. She also has very poor vision and even with her glasses cannot see perfectly. 

Claire tried to tell me it wasn't fair to exclude Rachel given everything else she has been through. I do understand her perspective. Rachel is constantly in and out of hospital and her health is understandably a huge worry for her parents, but even so, she comes here and teases her cousins until they cry, and Claire and Matt insist that their pretty princess is just joking.

This happened a couple of hours ago during dinner conversations. My younger brother (11) started a conversation about how he had seen a cat being walked, an usual thing from where we're from that sparked a nice conversation. During it our mother said along the lines of ""what does it matter, you don't have a cat"", which instantly resulted in my brother shutting up.


A couple of minutes later when conversation was dying down I decided to ask our mother ""What does (brother) owning a cat have to do with a conversation about him seeing one walking?"" She could come up with a valid reason so dropped it but just gave me a stink eye occasionally throughout dinner.


Dinner is finishing up and the partner of our uncle who is staying with us spoke up and said I was disrespecting my mother, which in all fairness I understood, and how I should respect her more. I asked her to elaborate which resulted in the typical ""she gave birth to you"", ""she provides for you"". After the spiel I asked to explain my side and said that by dismissing my young impressional brother that she could be harming his future social skills by not speaking out of fear that his conversations will be rejected or dismissed. It ended there after our uncle motioned for her to drop it and I didn't want to bring it up and cause a fight.

Her ""Dad"" (quotations because he isn't a blood relation but if I get into it, it will be obvious if someone she knows reads it), has hated me from day one, how do I know she told me he did. He was her ""dad"" early on in our relationship and he has just hated me, nothing was said to me that wasn't rude, mean, spiteful, hateful, you get the point.  I've talked to my ex and she has just said that's what he's like, but he has loved all her ex's even the ones that have assulted her.  Something which I have never and will never do.  You may think this was an exaggeration but I promise you, he has NEVER been nice or friendly towards me, NEVER.  I know I am saved as ""Dickhead"" on his phone and he regularly insults me to my son which my son later tells me about.

So she lived with him for a while and I had to see him regularly, in order to keep a good relationship going with her while she was there.  I was nothing but friendly and nice despite his continuous comments that insulted me and just generally rude. But she has since moved away from him so I rarely see him but each time I have done I simply pretend he doesn't exist.  I don't look at him I don't speak to him I kiss and hug my son goodbye see he gets through the door way and I just walk off, not a word to anyone else.

So I dropped my son off today with him as he lives closer to me and was driving to my ex's anyway and my ex asked if I could drop him off there to save me some petrol (she lives quite far away) which I obviously said yes too.  Come time to drop off my boy I hug and kiss him, tell him I love him and just walk off after he enters the house.  As I'm leaving I get a ""Your fucking welcome!""

I know that if I talk to him again I will let loose and knowing his volatile, ugly and angry personality we will end in physical violence which I really don't want. I don't think this one act makes up for the years of misery, years of biting my tounge and remaining happy and pleasant while he is rude, crual and vindictive towards me. 

Now my ex is upset I was rude to her ""dad"" and can't seem to understand why I was being so rude.  Because despite reminding her of how he treats me she still thinks I should have been nice to him.  I said I wasn't being rude I am just refusing to acknowledge he exists.

Seriously guys my feelings towards him are that of pure hatred.  I have been bullied relentlessly most of my life and only till I met this vile human being did I know true hatred towards someone.

Sister had an unexpected and complicated pregnancy, and our parents both passed away when we were teens, so they lived with me for the first 7ish years of her life, and they still have ""their rooms"" at my place. They live one block away.

I was briefly married, it ended very amicably. 13yo knows and loves him too.

I gave her honest answers to each question that boiled down to: girl I just don't want to. That really surprised her, and she kept asking ""But don't you have to?"" and ""But everyone else does."" and ""but don't other people make fun of you?""

Finally, I told her something like, ""You don't always have to do what society tells you. Like yeah, you have to obey traffic laws, and don't go around being mean to people. But shaving? Nah. Getting married? Lot's of people don't! Having kids? You don't have to if *you* don't want to.""

We hadn't made reservations and there were 5 of us so we knew it would be a bit of a pain but we asked at the restaurant and they managed to fit us in at a shared table with a couple who were being seated at the same time. We all place orders at the same time and the appetizers for both groups came out at the same time. After finishing appetizers the couple next to us receives their main courses. Since there are 5 of us and we are ordering different things we know it will be a bit of a wait but that was fine. We continue to wait as the couple finishes their main course and moves on. No one comes to check in on us but regularly stop at the tables around us. At this point, we have been waiting for an hour. The crazy thing is, this restaurant is a hot plate concept meaning that they bring you raw meat and a hot plate and you cook the meat on your own plate. We have now been waiting an hour for raw meat and some pasta. Since I can't flag anyone down I go up to talk to the staff. I ask how long it will be and they go back and forth with the cooks before telling me another 10-15 minutes (our theory is that they misplaced our order or forgot). They ask if they can bring us anything while we wait. After consulting with my group I tell them that we would just like to cancel our order and I offer to pay for our appetizers. The lady throws her hands up and me and flips her notebook to our page crossing everything out dramatically and tells us to go ahead and leave. I've never left a restaurant without eating before and felt SO awkward. I can't stop thinking about how bad I feel for taking up table space and leaving like that. So AITA?",202,2452,0.94

Last weekend she died, of a drug overdose.

I have one living grandparent. She goes by ‘mum mum’. This will be her 13th great grand child.

So last night I’m with my MIL and in the midst of general conversation she says to my husband and I, ‘So I was thinking, I really don’t want to use ‘nana’ (her mother’s name), but I was thinking of using ‘mum mum’, I know that’s what your grandmother uses but when will we ever really be around together?’

I kind of just stared off into open space and said ‘Hey yeah there is plenty of time to think about it and pick a name....’

Like really, her logic is she doesn’t feel comfortable using her deceased mothers name but she is OK to use the name that the only living matriarch of my family uses?

I said this to my husband and he said ‘I am staying out of this.’

So when my MIL is with my family again and they ask her ‘Hey what name did you land on?’ She’s gonna sit there with a straight face and say she is jacking my grandmother’s name???

1398,Not the A-hole,"AITA for not being very interested in a relationship with my mom?

This is a long one. I'll put a TL;DR at the bottom.

For background information:

I'm a girl, 15, from the U.S. My mom's from the Phillippines, so there's a cultural difference.I also know that a lot of her behaviors come from her mother, who was very demanding and abusive (I've heard stories of matches being held to her lips for talking back). Her father was also an alcoholic, and she was a witness to a lot of abuse. So overall, she grew up poor, in a developing country, with her only parental figures being abusive, to get you into her mindset. So onto the situation:

My mother and I have had relationship problems for a long time, starting when I was around 8-9 years old. We've just constantly argued and been at odds with each for as long as I can remember. I know she loves me, but from an early age she's expected too much from me: I constantly had to do chores that my little brother never had to do. I had to sweep, wipe tables and counters, do dishes, clean the stove, fold laundry, etc. etc. etc., all the while watching my brother play the X-box. This was the main root of a lot of our arguments, but as I got older, it branched off into a lot of different things. 

&#x200B;

So, in eighth grade, I started going with my dad to our family's counselor, in hopes of improving my mom and I's relationship. This wasn't easy; this counselor was across town, an hour drive from our house. This meant that every Saturday, I gave up 3-4 hours of my time  inhopes of a good relationship with my mom. I missed out on a lot of plans with my friends because it took up so much time, but I thought it would be worth it. But my mom refused to come with me. 

&#x200B;

So I begged. I begged her to try. It meant so much to me, but she dismissed all of my attempts with, ""If only you just listened to me, we wouldn't have any problems. I'm done with \*insert counselor here\*."" 

&#x200B;

Cut to present day. I've recently found out that my parents are divorcing, and in light of this, my mom's suddenly putting in all this effort to be close to me.I feel like a jerk, but I've just been really cold towards her during this. It's just that whenever she pulls this crap where she's suddenly the best mother ever, all I can remember is 13 year old me crying in her room, begging her to just please come and try to talk with me about things.  I've gotten comments from friends who say, Wow, you literally hate your mom. But I'm just so tired of trying so hard and getting nowhere. 

&#x200B;

AITA?

TL;DR: My mother refused to go to family counseling with me for years, but now that my parents are divorcing, she wants us to be really close. I'm not interested. AITA?",60,439,0.95
1399,Not the A-hole,"Sorry for how long this is, I'm just really conflicted and am having a hard time.

tldr; my mother thinks I am the biggest AH in the world because I cut her off for her behavior towards myself, my brother, our father, and her family. She blew $40k of money that wasn’t hers and got onto some really bad habits.

\-

After my brother and I moved out, my mother decided to leave my father for abuse that he did during their marriage of 30 years. She left and moved in with her bf, who she was dating before she left. She then ‘borrowed’ over $25k from my dad over the last year to ‘help get by’.

Context: They are still not divorced. She asked him for money even after she was living with another man.

'Help get by' means money to buy a four-wheeler to go camping with her new boyfriend (something she never wanted to do with us), eating out when she had a phone bill she wasn't paying her rent, and gas for the car to drive around. That’s not including the $15k that she got from my aunt because the rest wasn’t enough.

No one knows where all the money went. All we know is that over $40k is just gone in less than a year. Not to mention the drug habit she picked up from her new bf.

When she visited us a few weeks ago, I reached a breaking point. She showed up high bc she snorted a percocet in the plane bathroom and had alcohol on top of it. She did it knowing that she’d be around my 7 year old cousin who was visiting.

That night when we finally got home, I catch a liquefied pill leak from her nose. She claimed that it was for her back pain. I asked her why she didn’t just take it normally and she couldn’t give me a straight answer. I demanded that she refrain from it while in our house.

After seeing just how sick my mother was getting, I asked everyone to stop giving her money. This cascaded into my mother having a complete meltdown. She has to feel rock bottom otherwise nothing’s gonna change. We're forcing her to sink or swim.

Then my brother called me and told me that she had asked his fiance’ and her parents for money. That was it. I paid out of my own pocket to get her on an earlier flight and sent her back home early. I kicked her out of our house.

Then I got a call from a long time friend a couple days ago. Mom had gone on FB asking everyone she knew for money. Including my friend and her mom. I called my mom and ranted about how embarrassed and ashamed I was. She called my friend a coward for contacting me instead of her to get the ‘real story’.

It was my breaking point. I just said, ""The person you are now isn't my mother. When you figure out how to be her again, let me know. I love you. Bye."" She hasn't tried to contact me since, but she’s been telling people how mean I am.

It's been heartbreaking to hear all these things she’s said. I just don't know what to do.

Am I the Asshole for cutting her off after so many attempts to help her and for her lying about that much money?",32,109,0.87
1400,Asshole,"Background info: We’ve been living together for 5 years and recently had a baby, he’s 4 months old. 

A few weeks ago we were at a family gathering on a Sunday night and out of no where she got blacked out drunk. At the time she was staying home with the baby while I worked 5 days a week from 8-6. She would get up during the night to soothe the baby when he woke up crying or needed to be breastfed. She obviously couldn’t do that this night so I was pissed that she didn’t talk to me before to set up a plan for care and that I had to stay up with the baby on a Sunday night with work the next day (and other reasons, see edit 2). I asked if we could leave the baby with my parents and pick him up the next day so I could get sleep and function at work but she refused since we had not done any overnights with our baby yet (wouldn’t have be a viable solution anyway, see edit 2). I got really pissed off at the whole situation and called her an irresponsible bitch (yes I know IATA for not keeping my cool and lashing out like this). I drove home and we didn’t say a word to each other. 

When we got home she almost fell walking up the stairs. Then she took the baby, and **I urged her to let me take care of the baby that night** and told her to sleep it off on the couch. Since she was pissed from what I said earlier, she refused. At this point I was worried about the baby’s safety as she could hardly stand on her own but she refused to give me the baby saying “he’s my kid”. This triggered me and I told her that I was going to call the cops if she didn’t give me the baby, at which point she said “go ahead they always side with the mom”, so I did. The cops did not side with her, told her to sleep it off while I rocked the baby to sleep in another room. I felt like shit calling the cops on her, and we’ve never had a fight like this but as a new parent this was the only thing I could think of to get our baby out of her hands and into mine as she was doing this out of spite because of what I said to her in the car. AITA?

**Edit:** I want to say that when the cops arrived, I stressed that I only wanted to care for the baby and for her to sleep it out. In no way did I want them to take any action against her. We also live about an hour and a half from the nearest relative.

And as a new parent, I felt for the first time ever what it feels like to fear for your child’s safety which is why I think I took it to that extreme, even though I regret doing it now.

**Edit 2:** I guess it’s too late for this now, but there’s a reason why I was upset about having to take over for the night aside from having to work the next day. I already know IATA for cursing at her. The reason for the post was for calling the cops, but everyone is judging on what I said or assuming that I didn’t want to take care of my kid for the night.

That Friday I tried watching the baby alone while she had a girls night out. Turns out that when a baby is that young and spends 24/7 with their mom, they become attached and reliant on them for comfort **(I was either at work or commuting 90% of the day, obviously I couldn’t spend that much time with my child, but I seem to be getting crucified for this).** About an hour in when it got close to his bedtime, he started having a meltdown. For an hour straight, I tried everything in the book to soothe him but nothing worked. I had never heard him cry like that before, I was freaking out. My cousin, who also has a newborn and a couple of older kids was with me at the time and he even said it was time to call mom, as we started to worry about the distress the baby was in. As soon as she got back and held him, he instantly stopped crying. We were amazed but realized that we definitely had to work on him getting more comfortable with me. Needless to say I was kind of traumatized with the experience - I don’t do well when my baby cries like that (severe distressed crying), I literally start crying as well (I’ve gotten better with that since then). Then two days later, this happened. So yeah, it’s not that I didn’t want to “watch my baby for one night”, it was me literally reliving that Friday and pissed that she got drunk knowing that the baby nor I were not ready for a night without her yet. Regardless, **I urged her to let me watch the baby that night.**

**info:** Since apparently “I’m a terrible dad that should have the baby taken away from me”, we talked about it the next day and realized we both fucked up. We both acted irrationally but we’ve been going through a whirlwind of emotions as first time parents. I’ve just never stopped feeling guilty about calling the cops. She’s now back to work and I’m staying home with the baby for a month and a half and I’m glad to say he has bonded to me on a level similar to his mom.",1539,4143,0.92
1401,Not the A-hole,"Alright so me and someone had been traveling all day doing a day trip several hours away and ended up stopping at a restaurant before the drive home. I ordered a burger and asked not have their “special sauce” on it because I knows it’s just a bunch of stuff mixed up that I won’t want. I remember the waiter making s comment about it so I know he heard me and I saw him write it down. Waited 20 minutes for food and my burger comes with the sauce all over the bottom of the burger. I ask to get a new one since I really don’t want that sauce. He came back just a few minutes later and told me “sorry we grabbed the wrong burger.” So I started eating since everyone else was and we had a long drive ahead. I noticed about half way through my burger that I got a slight hint of something that tasted weird. I glanced and noticed that I could see where they had just scraped off the sauce and gave me the burger back, apparently not even replacing the bottom bun. I was pissed. Granted I hadn’t even noticed that they did that but I just thought that was really shitty of them to do. I was already full and really tired after the trip and was about to start driving for another 4 hours so I really just wasn’t in the mood or had the energy to fight with the staff or manager so I just left without tipping. I am someone who knows where to put blame, and I can probably guarantee that the waiter could clearly see that he didn’t just grab the wrong burger and the cook probably said “here wait, alright here just give it back to him.” So that’s why I didn’t feel like he deserved a tip after doing something like that. Am I the asshole?

Edit: one detail I forgot to mention that makes me believe the waiter knew what happend: after we all had finished he asked us “did everything taste alright?” While kinda checking at me more at what I would say.

Edit: ok I guess I’m the asshole for skimping a guy out of $7 after him and the restaurant tricked me and serving me the wrong food after already trying to get the situation resolved.

Edit: for those asking why I didn’t double check the second burger was because the first one had the sauce pouring out of the sides of under the burger. The second one came back and it didn’t have any visible sauce ( from the outside) so I just figured it was good since it went from pouring all over to none visible.",127,33,0.79
1402,Not the A-hole,"I am in a group of about ten friends who all met in high school. Usually about once every few months, one of us will host a party so that those who are free can get together.

&#x200B;

One of these friends is allergic to milk, but he's not *horribly* allergic. He can have some things that have a little milk, i.e. dark chocolate, buttered breadsticks, stuff like that. Still, when someone's hosting a party and they order pizza for dinner, he's said a few little things that indicate that he expects them to get a cheeseless pizza for himself. Keep in mind, we do make sure that we serve things he can eat (i.e. aforementioned breadsticks, he can take the cheese off the pizza and eat it that way, chips, other food). Also keep in mind most of us are in college and don't exactly have a lot of money to spend on an extra cheeseless pizza just for him (if I was making a lot more money, I wouldn't put up as much of a fight).

&#x200B;

He's never been particularly rude about it, but the fact that he has indicated to be catered to that degree bugged a few of my friends, who mentioned it to me. A bit later, while he and I were talking one day, I told him about that we shouldn't have to cater to him. He was kinda defensive about it, but neither of us really were jerks about it. We ended in a stalemate, though, with neither of us really yielding.

&#x200B;

This discussion with him happened months ago, and we're still really good friends (it hasn't been brought up since), but I've always wondered about which one of us was in the right. I can understand how having an allergy can be hard, and I feel like it's generally on the host to make sure everybody's accommodated, so I kinda feel bad, but at the same time, this seems a little excessive to me. So, AITA?

Edit: Let me clarify, he can take the cheese off a normal pizza and eat it that way, and it's essentially the same. It's not like we're denying him the main course.

1403,Not the A-hole,"I'm 19 years old and live with my grandmother, father, and brother. It's very stressful living with them because my grandmother often snaps at me for everything. Usually, something bad will happen to her, and then because she's mad, she'll find something to yell at me for. For example, when she found out her basement flooded, she yelled at me for being asleep when she found out. When she accidentally lost control of her bladder, she yelled at me for bringing my video game system into the house.

1405,Not the A-hole,"So me and some mates have been planning to go to a big(ish) esports event for a few months. I booked a hotel for myself and a friend for the long weekend a few months ago in preparation as rooms run out very quickly after dates for said event are announced.

Recently a few more friends started talking about the event and seemed very interested, but were not really able to cover the full trip financially  so myself and the guy I am sharing the hotel room with offered this couple to crash in our room for a night to come and hang out with us.

After making it quite clear beforehand and multiple (three times) on the night that they would be expected to pretty much sleep on the floor and not on my bed (as I have the double) they went back a little early and proceeded to get into my double bed anyway.

When I got back to the hotel room a little later and seen them in my bed I was more than a little pissed off and woke them up and told them both to get out and sleep elsewhere in the room. I even planned borrowing sleeping bags for them specifically. They pretty much said no, to which I responded sleep on the floor or leave right now.

After a bit of arguing and me threatening to get the hotel staff to get unwelcome guests out of my room, or sleep on the floor, they both decided to leave, and so did the guy I was originally planning to share the room with as he thought it to be unfair for a couple not to share a double bed. (He did offer me his single bed if I let it slide) they intended on finding somewhere else to stay but after about 15 minutes asked me if they could come back in on my original terms to sleep on the floor.

As they were leaving though, the guy sort of squared up to me and tried to intimidate me and pretty much told me I was being an asshole for making such a big deal about me wanting to sleep in the double bed I payed for.

After this I was feeling very uncomfortable to have either of them stay and pretty much said straight forwardly to sort themselves out wherever they can. The guy I split the room with eventually came back as he payed a share but was quite unhappy with my ""childish behaviour"".

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about 9 months and his lease is ending in less than a month. He was living with his ex (they were together when they originally moved in over a year ago) so renewing their lease together was out of the question. He says he can’t really afford anything in our city without a roommate and I’m currently living with my mom since I just finished college. So it would be the obvious choice us to move in together.

With our age difference, it’s important to note that I’ve never lived with an SO, while he has moved in with girlfriends in the past, sometimes out of necessity, despite only being with them for a short while. I’m a lot more hesitant in this regard, and it seems like it’s a much bigger step for me than it would be for him. One that I don’t want to rush into and possibly strain the relationship. But he’s been saying it’s either that or he’ll have to move because he can’t afford to live in our city alone.

I was considering telling him the decision for me to move in with him might be made easier if I knew I would still have my own space (ie, my own bedroom). This isn’t to say I wouldn’t still be spending most nights with him in his, but just so that I can still be alone when I feel like I need to recharge my social battery and check in with myself, since I have a history of social anxiety and depression. He also has a 5 year old daughter that he would have on the weekends, and if I had my own bedroom, it would make it easier for them to share his, when she was there (according to him, she’ll cry if he isn’t there sleeping with her.)

One time I left my laptop with my stock portfolio on the kitchen table and she saw it. When this happened she confronted me and yelled “YOU HAVE [AMOUNT INVESTED] without telling me!” I then explained to her that since I was about 19 I have been making weekly contributions to investments. She then calmed down and asked me if I have anything else in my finances I didn’t tell her about and while I was reluctant to tell her she said I needed to trust her so I told her about the apartment I own.

One thing that does kind of bug me is that she can have an immature sense of humor. Now that we've been dating for a while she's gone from keeping her bodily functions to herself to openly burping and farting around me when we're at home, which she finds hilarious.

At first I would just make comments like ""that was a pretty gross one"" and stuff like that to try to get the point across that I don't like it but honestly she found that even more funny. Well a couple days ago I got sick of it and asked her to go in the other room if she was going to do that.

When she realized I wasn't joking it turned into this whole argument about how its no big deal and that's what couples do. 
 She wants to feel comfortable at home and I should feel happy about it because it means she feels comfortable around me. She also said I was being sexist and prudish expecting women to be perfect little princesses instead of real human beings.

I can kind of see her point, but at the same time I don't expect her to be perfect or never have one ""slip"" but I just think it's poor manners and disrespectful to do that around other people.

1417,Not the A-hole,"So, I moved across the country today. Literally, from the west coast to the east coast. I’ve had this cat for almost three years. She was a rescue my ex and I adopted. She really grew attached to me, so when we separated a year later, there was no question who she’d live with.

The next two years that bond continued to grow and I knew when it came time to move that I could not abandon her. I had to get her across the country and she HATES kennels. 

I took her to the vet to get her some anti-anxiety pills, I got her a vest meant to calm her down, a face mask meant to shield her eyes and brought her favorite toy too. I did trial runs in the car and tried testing out the meds weeks out. She seemed somewhat calm, but it was a very thin line.

I took a red-eye for the longest portion of the trip (no direct flights existed) hoping other passengers would sleep through any mewing coming from her corner. 

All the way through the process, though, from shuttle to TSA to sitting down a lot of people glared at me. They all had something to say under their breath. Don’t get me wrong, some people were excited to see a kitty, but they were outnumbered. 

I was hopeful. She was quiet when we got on the plane. Then, take off happened and she went crazy. I mean, SCREAMING. I snatched her kennel out from under the seat and stuck my hand in to try to sooth her and she thrashed, bit me and cried. I cried too. It was terrible.

The person next to me reassured me that it was no worse than a baby and talked me down from having panic attack, but the people ahead of me weren’t as nice about it. I could tell they all thought I was the asshole for purchasing a ticket for my pet. 

After a while, she calmed down and my next door neighbor and I held a convo for a couple of hours until we both drifted off. So, I guess my question is, Am I The Asshole for bringing her knowing she might have a bad reaction?",328,789,0.94

It’s always on a weekend when they are going out of town for the so I get that they want some overnight supervision for the teen, but I feel like it’s super inconvenient that they ask him to do this for them because he has a stressful full time job, has limited time off, and watching the nephew takes up the better part of sat-sun. They always include me in the invite to come babysit but I usually work Saturdays and can’t. He says they pay him but I think the money they leave is basically implied money to order pizza with and he doesn’t really need the extra money anyways.

So I feel like him becoming a fiancé and future husband should relieve him from his role as family babysitter. I’m annoyed for one that he agrees to do it and two that his aunt and uncle even ask this of him.  I’ve brought it up with him and he kind of shrugs it off and says he’s just family oriented (even though he hardly spend time with his nephew when babysitting because nephew is typical 16 year old and hangs out with friends or plays video games) and says I’m being controlling for not wanting him to spend time with his family. I want to spend time with his family too. I just don’t see how I’m being controlling and I think it’d be appropriate to ask him to baby sit if he was like a college student and needed the money but not as someone with a stressful job and fiancé.

Background: My daughter bought my wife's old car from us when she was 18 (now 21) for around 3000. I told her I'd do my best (as an experienced mechanic) to keep the car running until after she graduates college in a year and a half. 

Today she returns from picking up food for my wife and I, and tells me that the car is making a few noises. I've been outside working on my wife's car in the heat all day and was irritated in hearing I'd have to work on my daughter's car again considering I just finished fixing her car's AC. Granted the car was not making these noises before I fixed the AC, but it seems as if the car is having one problem after another. 

After she describes the noises to me, I tell her ""Well it looks like you're just going to have to start saving up for a new car. Maybe the car wouldn't have so many issues if you didn't drive the car like you're on a race track."" My daughter gets visibly upset and says, ""I haven't driven my car like that in years, and it just started acting up yesterday."" Now, I did ride with my daughter the other day and she's a good driver. She used to be a speed demon on the roads and take turns too fast, so I suppose I still think of her that way.

Anyway, my daughter clams up after a little more conversation and goes to her bedroom. I can hear her crying. I told my wife that she's crying and my wife reminded me that my daughter's car means a lot to her. So, AITA?

Last year, my SIL gave my spouse and I a week’s access to their incredible lakefront property for a holiday. It was such a blessing. My spouse and I work hard, but there’s never a lot of money left at the end of the billing cycle, so we were stoked for it.

We knew the family was coming for a BBQ. We knew the teenaged niblings would pop in and out to see us. We knew my BIL was going to come by to cut the grass. What we didn’t know was that my MIL was going to come and stay the whole week without letting us know or even owning up to it.

It wasn’t hell, but it wasn’t relaxing. We couldn’t even do adult shit without having to sneak like teenagers, and we are well into our adulthood (you know... get busy). We had to feed her, too, which gets expensive when she asks you to pick up a couple boxes of wine, too. She slunk around all week with a guilty look, and we ignored it and had a decent but not very restful time. She was like some sort of camp counsellor, planning activities she wanted, and all I wanted to do was read in the lake - like, damn.

She doesn’t like me, but she doesn’t like anyone, really. I’m too young for my spouse, she thinks I’m too dweeby and weird, etc. She does like to spend time with my spouse, though, because we live far away - that was the main reason I didn’t outwardly begrudge anything. I’m not that hard hearted!

SIL wants to offer it to us again. She felt bad about not standing up for us, but to keep the peace, we didn’t say anything either. I thanked her and asked for a few days to confirm dates. My MIL texted me and my spouse to ask if we want to do it again, and I told my spouse to just not answer yet so we can sleep on it, but I really, really don’t want to do this again.

We get popcorn and wait to get seated and I can tell he's so excited to finally see the movie.

My bf (25m) is missing final exams and he's done. He doesn't need to go to uni, he studies for his exams at his house. He quit his job so he could focus on his exams. He never had to work full time and then go to uni since he finished while working part time.

A few days ago I went to his house after work. When I go there sometimes we talk and then sleep for a while until dinner time with his family, especially on days when I have migraines (I'm going to doctors on this because they incapacitate me and may last for weeks). He knows that when I have them, light, noise or rough movements hurt me and the best I can do is sleep.

When I got there, he knew I wasn't feeling well at all, but we wanted to see eachother and if we're going to nap, we might as well cuddle instead of napping alone.

I fell asleep, nothing out of the ordinary. But then he woke me up all of a sudden my pulling me towards him (the harsh movement makes my head hurt even more). I ignored it, we talked for a while and made out, but before he made a move to have sex or something I went back to cuddling and sleeping. He did this three other times until it was dinner time. We didn't fight or anything, but I was pissed AF.

He knows I have migraines, he knows what makes it hurt even more, he did it for the sake of having sex when I can't even do it on those days because the movement makes the headache even worse. Besides, he knows I'm exhausted and if I fall asleep it's because I really can't keep myself awake.

On his defence, I know he doesn't understand how much my headaches affect me other than what I tell him (being incapacitated by a headache could sound like overreacting if you don't experience it). And besides  I understand he might have wanted some attention instead of me just sleeping.

Today he met up with his friends and we hardly talked, and the last few days I have been replying to his text a bit dryly, since I'm still pissed he can't understand or respect the fact that I'm not feeling well and might not be in the mood for sex (similar situations have happened in the past and I one or two times I ended up having migraine-pain sex just so I could sleep later in peace without the nagging).

She has now owed this money for several years. My parents have property worth around $1.2M-$1.6M. As far as I know, that's all their assets. She does not work (she spent time in prison) and he makes mid/high 5-figures.

&#x200B;

My sister and I are in our late 20s. We both went to college and have not received money from them since we were 18 because of what happened, save for a few hundred here and there. We both have been very successfully professionally (think \~$150k).

&#x200B;

A few years ago, my sister and I received letters that we were named as two of the main beneficiaries on my mom's uncle's estate. When we received the notice, we shared it with our parents. We were honestly not close to our great uncle/communicated with him sparingly during holidays/birthdays. My mother was very close with him growing up, and had continued contact with him. At the time of his death, he knew that my mom was in trouble, but the full extent/amount was not yet figured out.

&#x200B;

My mother now claims that she told my uncle to leave everything to us so that we could help her out. I have no way to verify this and she initially acted surprised, but she has also taken a lie detector test that indicates that she did tell him to leave everything to us so that we could help.

&#x200B;

At the start, we were open with them about what was happening, but their tone in conversations shifted over time, in our opinion, to indicate that they saw themselves more and more entitled to the money. We never came to an agreement on the extent that we would help them, because we were so far off (we gave them very broad assurances like ""we'll help when we can"" as the estate was being worked out, while they made it clear that they thought we were morally obligated to pay the debt outright if we could). By the time that it did close completely \~1 year ago, we already had had several blowup arguments. Our willingness right before the estate closed was probably to give them a monthly stipend but to ask them to sell most of their assets. After it closed, we had a few more VERY serious arguments. As it stands now, I have no immediate plans to help them at all or be in contact with them in any meaningful way (I can go into the reasoning for that specific thing in more detail if needed, but we've had some VERY bad arguments). The proceeds of the estate were in the same ballpark of $1MM EACH for my sister and me.

He was so upset and said that I was the only woman he wants to have sex with and that he could never imagine having sex with somebody else. A couple days ago he caught me mastubating (something I do once a day) and he was even more hurt. He said how come you get horny but you don't want to have sex with me? I tried explaining what I typed above but he got even more hurt. We really love each other and have an amazing relationship aside from this, but he thinks I'm an asshole for making an executive decision about our sex life and trapping him in a lifetime without sex. So AITA for having a preference?

tl;dr have never really liked sex, decided I still want to masturbate but no longer have sex with my husband

edit: everyone seems to think my husband is going to divorce me over this, we've discussed it and divorce isn't even something he's considering. Redactors are so quick to pull the divorce card  when in reality there are so many other aspects to a heathy relationship that can't be explain in 3000 characters. Our marriage is strong, supportive and loving in many other ways. I don't feel like we need sex to still love each other",1129,1237,0.83

1440,Not the A-hole,"My parents have been divorced for over 20 years. Neither remarried until recently when my dad married his girlfriend of five years. His new wife has a relative, Eve, who she’s really close to. She is 10 years younger than me and I would say that she treats her like a niece. 

At least once a month, my dad will update me about what Eve is doing. She has a good job, knows a bunch of famous people, and all that. The thing is that I don’t care. I’ve only met his wife a handful of times so I’m not close to her. I’ve only met Eve once and that was at their wedding. The only relation I have to his wife and Eve is by marriage. That’s great he has a new family he is proud of but considering I rarely see any of them, I don’t really care what Eve is doing.

Before anyone says I’m jealous of Eve, I am not. I just don’t want to hear the humblebragging of my dad about Eve and all the famous people she knows. It’s just not something I care about and I enjoy my life as it is without needing to hear about someone I don’t even know.

1441,Not the A-hole,"am on mobile so forgive me, also hardly post on reddit so it might be confusing. 

I have a nephew who likes to get into my things, when i’m not in my room, at first he used to grab scissors and cut up my stuff but then escalated to him stealing things and hiding them, i would get mad but my mom would just tell me he’s a baby and doesn’t know better so I would just ignore it and get my stuff back/try to fix it. 

However recently he took something that was important to me, it might be silly but it’s an anime figure that my friend had given me, now this friend has passed away recently and i’m still dealing with the loss, so when i found out he lost it i became angry and yelled at him after i couldn’t find it.

I do admit that i shouldn’t have lost my temper at him, but i was so upset and it didn’t help that my mom was angry at me for getting upset over something so silly, because for her it was just an anime thing that friend gave me and it’s not something that’s memorable(?) of my friend. 

Everyone is saying that i’m an asshole for getting upset at a kid, but I had told him many many times before not to come into my room and take things but he would never take me seriously because my mom would just tell him to ignore me and that i have no say in what he does or how to raise him.

edit for some context: yes i can lock my door but it’s not that hard to unlock even he knows how, and i do hide my things in a little cabinet thing but he always knows how to find them.

1442,Not the A-hole,"A few months before christmas my girlfriend had the idea of making each other stuffed animals for christmas. I thought it was a good idea and started to work a lot on it because I really cared a lot for her and didn't want to disappoint her. I didn't even know how to stitch and stuff but I still gave it a try and I think it turned out pretty well for my first stuffed animal.
When I visited her for christmas and gave her my present I saw that she not only did not do her part, she didn't gave me anything at all. This kinda hurt me.

Well that's OBVIOUSLY NOT the reason why I want to break up with her. I don't want to get into it that much but it's basically because she totally neglected me and doesn't really care for me anymore. The christmas thing is just one of many, much bigger signs.

Now If I break up with her I'm pretty sure she will throw away my gift. Why wouldn't she? It doesn't have any materialstic or useful value and it would only hurt her thinking about me.
The thing is, I think it would be a shame if she just threw it away like that because I worked quite hard on it. I kinda want to ask it back. And I know it's a really bad taste to regift a personal gift but...I just think someone else (my little cousin for example) would deserve and appreciate  it much more

1445,Not the A-hole,"So just to lay it all out there, I'm very prone to getting UTIs. Recently I started getting similar symptoms to having one, so my doctor prescribed some antibiotics. 

When I went to pick it up at a nearby pharmacy, they asked if I wanted the pharmacist to come over and explain how to take the medication. I assumed it would be instructions like, ""take it once a day for five days after a meal"" etc, so I agreed. 

She comes over and reads the name of the antibiotic out loud. Then she says, ""For a urinary infection, right?"" also in a very loud voice. My friend was standing nearby and heard the entire exchange. I was pretty shocked and just nodded uncomfortably. The pharmacist then told me to just drink lots of water and walked away. 

I was extremely unhappy with the occurrence because while the friend I was with is one of my closest friends, I didn't exactly want her to know I had a UTI. Well, now she does. Along with everyone else who was standing in the vicinity at the time. 

Also, this is more of a personal opinion, but the pharmacist's tone of voice was really dismissive and condescending, and I got the impression she was trying to shame me. But again this is what I personally felt during our exchange, and I could be wrong about it. 

I want to call the drugstore and make a complaint. But first, I asked another friend who is actually working as a pharmacist what she thought about this situation. She implied that the pharmacist was just doing her job, and that I would definitely be making a jerk move by reporting her.  

So now, I'm not sure. Maybe I'm just being really emotional since it happened a few days ago and I am letting that cloud my judgement. However I am still a bit upset to have had my privacy divulged like that.

EDIT:

Because people were asking, my friend was standing a good distance away. Not on the other side of the store, but a few aisles away, and still heard everything. 

I haven't called or anything yet. Just wanted to get unbiased input before I did anything just in case I was out of line.

Oh, also I didn't mention this in the original post since I thought it wasn't important. Maybe I should explain why I got the impression she was judging me. The pharmacist was of the same minority ethnic group as me, and people from my country are very conservative and judgmental. They'll call me out if I wear shorts/skirts and one of them even called my mom to tell me they saw me walking down the street with a boy when I was still in high school. I could have just been projecting from my prior negative experiences, but the way this pharmacist looked me up and down (I was wearing a really skintight skirt) really reminded me of these people.

1446,Not the A-hole,"Anyone who has been to the beach in the summer knows it can get crowded. I dont mind the crowd and I do my best to avoid them but they dont avoid me.

I had been fishing this spot for a couple of hours and I was originally with a group of 4 other fishermen I had met today. As the day went on some of us left and it was only me and this other guy when a family of 6 came near us. 

At first the kids were just swimming in the shallow water but they slowly started drifting further and further which is usually fine except that they were not paying attention to how far they were drifting toward us(very annoying)

After about 30 minutes the mother came up to me and the other guy and asked if we could stop fishing since our casting area was now near her drifting kids.

I said no. I (as politely as I could stand) told her that we were here first and had been for a very long time and up until her family showed up we were staying in our own lane and others around us were as well.

Basically this became a 15 minute argument to which the mother gave up rudely said that she hopes I am proud of myself for ruining her family's day at the beach and they have now left.

1447,Not the A-hole,"EDIT: Update Below. Thank you all for your comments and advice! I appreciate your input regardless of where you stand. 

I come from three generations of jewelers and though my family is no longer in the business, I still enjoy buying and selling loose gemstones for my own collection or to be set into custom pieces. I am extremely close to my husband’s family and I have either cheaply sold or simply given them stones/rings to propose to their significant others. 

My oldest brother-in-law has been dating his girlfriend for the past six years and while they are both a piece of work to say the least, they’re family so we tolerate them in doses. While we talk to and visit the other in-laws on a weekly basis, these two only come around when an event is going on or when they need money.... and they alway need money. My pending sister-in-law, while sweet at times is mostly bratty, tacky, spoiled and loud. She usually is the source of drama and my current headache at the moment. 

Every first Saturday of the month, the family hooks up for breakfast. Things started off normally today but they announced that finally, they were ready to tie the knot. We all had genuine excitement and breakfast turned into a boozy celebration. Then near the end while everyone is waiting for the check, they ask if they can come back to the house to pick out a ring. 

Just like that. Mic drop. It shocked me because they didn’t ask, he didn’t come to me or hubby beforehand to see if it was even a possibility. AND while I do have some options, I did not appreciate the assumption that I was going pull diamonds out of my ass without any discussion and straight up said no. I’d be willing to help them find something at their price point commercially. My inner Smaug woke up. 

All hell broke loose. She straight up throws a fit and begins calling out my other sister-in-laws who did have help from me with their rings and of course they are embarrassed. It’s not something we just talk about and I don’t hang it over anyone’s head. Brother-in-law starts trying to pick a fight with my husband telling him that he needs to “check me.” All of this is driving home that my on the spot decision was the right one. 

Drama apparently wants to have it’s day because while most of the table is trying to diffuse this until we can leave the restaurant, my mother-in-law of all people throws rocket fuel on the dumpster fire by saying that I’m being selfish and that there’s no reason why we shouldn’t help. She and I have had our differences in the past (during my and my husband’s crazy/horny teenage years) but haven’t openly feuded since we’ve been adults. 

Being the superhero that he his, my husband got us TF out of there but since this morning, we have been ignoring our phones as this plays out. We’re both pissed. 

—Update:

This took up my whole Saturday. MIL and FIL came over in person to talk about what happened. FIL agreed that BIL and future SIL were out of line and apologized in their behalf. 

Once this came out of his mouth, MIL had a meltdown. She still believed that a ring was deserved and even after explaining my reasoning basically said that, “I set a standard and since they can not afford it on their own, it was MY responsibility to step up.” I nearly lost it with her but instead of giving back all the venom that I’d been choking on, I left the house. 

FIL came outside and helped me calm down while she and Hubs talked. I haven’t gone in depth of how this affected things IRL but the fallout spread fast. The family has been through a lot recently and I did not want this to add more into the pot even though pettiness was strong within me. 

Between talking to him and texting my husband at ground zero, I actually decided to compromise. I have a pear shaped moissanite that I bought out of curiosity but did nothing with after it started trending a few years ago. For those who do not know, moissanite is a popular alternative to diamonds. It’s just been sitting in my collection and I figured why the fuck not. I could actually give them something and be done with it all providing that apologies were made to myself, the other inlaws and that they got it set on their own. FIL did not want me to offer it at first but I explained why and he reluctantly agreed. 

He called BIL, shred him for a moment but eventually told them my terms. I got on the line and explained what the moissanite was, the weight and cut since I had no idea what her preferences were. Other in-laws chose stones that weren’t traditional as well so I wanted to make sure she even wanted what I offered. They did. The change in their attitudes felt like this was the right choice. I told them to just come on over. Once they got here, they immediately apologized and Hubs got MIL to do the same though he gave me the worst side eye the whole time. Showed them the stone and future SIL just starts squirting tears out of happiness. I’m a big softy. Honestly, If things hadn’t gone down they way they did, I would have cried with her. 

I gave her the stone’s certification after the waterworks and things did a compete 360. She and BIL went from loving it to being offended that the damned thing wasn’t a diamond even though I’d explained this when giving the specs on the phone! She was actively FaceTiming her HER mom showing her the stone on her hand which lead to them calling me a horrible person for getting their hopes up. BIL stops short of insulting me again as Hubs stepped in and instead says that I’ve disrespecting his fiancé the whole time. MIL actually had the audacity to demand that SHE will pick out a “real stone” and to see what else I have like I’m a fucking sales clerk; not in my own house. Here I am staring at this twilight zone clusterfuck as they start arguing and I’m just standing in my kitchen watching it all play out again.

I have reached levels of real anger before but I think this was the first time I could say I felt actual fury. They pushed me to fulfill my lifelong dream to scream at people to get the fuck out of my house at the top of my lungs. (Repressed feelings much) Things got quiet fast and in that space, I snatched my shit back so fast that I accidentally dropped the moissy and it bounced or got kicked out of sight. Cue my inappropriate, fed up laughter. I couldn’t hold it in. 

Hubs and FIL got everyone out after that and as of now, they are banned from the house. I’m cutting them all off with no remorse. As of yet, no one has called me personally but word is that the Grand Dame is livid (I still don’t know why she’s so vehement about all of this tbh) while BIL and SIL are thinking about getting tattoos vs rings. I have no comment. Hubs feels like he’s at fault for everything but I’ve explained there’s no way I blame him for his family’s actions. He thought I was too nice to offer anything. FIL and I are linking up to discuss Reddit as he’s amazed by the platform so hey, something good came from this. 

We have looked for the stone and so far we have no fucking idea where it is. Confession time: it’s slightly satisfying that we can’t locate it. Where is Sister Unella when you need her?

*For those concerned, I do not keep loads of loose gems and jewelry in our home. I have my jewelry that stays in a hidden safe when I’m not wearing it and raw gems and crystals of little value decoration my spaces like the little witch I am. Heirloom items and other things stay locked in safety deposit boxes left over from my parents. We have proper security measures in place after a break in a few years ago so I apologize if I seemed nonchalant about that subject.",525,4508,0.97

1449,Not the A-hole,"So this started today, possible spelling mistakes because I'm on mobile and have had a few pints

For context my grandad had a house in a popular holiday location. After he died my parents inherited a share of it, along with his other children. This house has a main area and a separate flat which is rented out. 

A few months ago my friends and I decided to take a holiday there after repeated offers from my mum for years. We checked that the flat was free and made sure none of my family were planning to go there that week, then booked time off of work.

Today we travelled to the house, I called my parents when we were near to check what time the previous renters would be gone so we could stay out of their way. She said that they had gone, however she and my dad would be there for another 2 days as there was a problem they had to fix, which they had known about for almost a week.

After asking why she hadn't told me she was going to be there, as I had previously said my friends didn't want to use up their holiday time if they were there, she told me ""if I said we would be there you wouldn't have come"".

After that we booked a nearby hostel until they said they the problem would be fixed, and sent a message to my parents. They sent a few responses of ""why? We're very upset"",  told me I can't stop them from using their house and said don't know why I don't want to spend more time with them.

I never complained that they were in the house, I understand the repairs needed to be done. I'm just upset that she deliberately avoided telling me because she knew we would want to cancel the holiday.

1450,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I have been married for almost two decades. We have a daughter who is my favorite person on this earth. She is so fantastic. She will be starting her senior year of high school and is preparing to apply for colleges.

I was contacted recently by another woman, who informed me that my husband had an affair with her, and when she found out about me, he arranged to pay child support for their child under the table so that I wouldn't find out. She sent me a number of documents recording bank transfers, which I was able to match to transfers from our accounts, as well as photos of my husband with their child through the years. She also provided the dates of his visits to her, which line up with several of his business trips. 

I was totally devastated and took the time to think it over and verify everything before I confronted my husband. I have decided that I am going to wait a year until I tell him that I know and file for divorce. It will be a terrible year for me but I know I can fake it since he's traveling for work a lot anyway. I have decided to do this for several reasons:

1. Our daughter will be applying to college soon and will be starting a really important year. I don't want to blow her life up with a divorce and the bombshell that her father was unfaithful and now she has a sibling that neither of us knew about. 
2. My husband has many more financial resources than I do. I am well aware that if I file for divorce while our daughter still lives at home, he will leave me to care for her and will make me fight tooth and nail for monetary support and will likely drain me with legal fees, as he tends to be litigious. I make enough to support myself comfortably, but not enough to comfortably support myself and my daughter.
3. I fear that opening this door will open others. That is, I worry that he may have other children that I don't know about, which would only magnify the hurt for both me and my daughter, and I don't think that now is the time to handle it.

My question is, does my plan make me an asshole? I feel slimy not telling him right now and faking my affection for him, but I fear for my daughter's wellbeing and my own ability to support us. AITA?

1451,Not the A-hole,"Yesterday my girlfriend and I went to Golden Road Brewery in Anaheim, CA. It was around 5 on Friday afternoon, they do serve food but this is a craft brewery and most people are just drinking. They make their money off of beer. They have a large outdoor area with yard games. There were probably 20 kids (3-8) running around unattended, zigging and zagging through crowds of people who are standing around holding beer. Kids were throwing the bean bags for cornhole around, crawling all over the area to the point where nobody could play the games. I understand this place isn't a ""bar"" but my girlfriend and I have noticed that recently parents are going out drinking at these breweries and treating them like day cares for their children. These places are drinking establishments, people get drunk and stupid. It's not a restaurant. Not a daycare for your children while the parents sit there and get drunk and laugh about their kids being crazy. It's one thing if your kids are behaved, but we've been nothing many of the kids at these breweries are not well behaved. Some of these kids were actually pretty funny to watch, I'll be honest. Only because we were sitting off to the side and not trying to play any of the yard games or stand anywhere near the kids. We did see several close calls where people were getting annoyed and almost tripped and dropped their beers or asked where kids parents were. One group was trying to play cornhole and the kids kept moving the board and bean bags every time they threw a bag. At some point someone is going to get upset, and yell at a kid, or step in a kid and it'll be their fault, not the kid's or the parent's. 
        After this, around 9 o'clock we went to a restaurant/club that stops serving food after 9. We went upstairs to where they have pool tables and dart boards. We were up there playing pool, and a couple brings their two little kids up there and let's them loose while they play pool and darts! It's 9 at night and these 5 year old kids are out around people who are playing with darts and drinking. Places that make their money mainly off of alcohol shouldn't let their customers bring their kids. Some parents can be trusted, but sadly many parents are just too irresponsible. I understand it's hard for parents to go out and have fun when they have kids... They have to bring them everywhere, sometimes they can't afford a babysitter. My parents used to take me with them some times, but I wasn't running around the billiards room of bars at 9 at night while people were throwing darts. I'd sit at the bar at a restaurant with them during dinner. When they did go have fun, I had someone to watch me. Or a play date, or we brought the party back to our house.

1453,Everyone Sucks,"Several years ago, I met a man who quickly became a close friend and mentor. We bonded over swapping war stories (both being Navy vets), and he has been an incredibly positive and supportive influence in my social circle. He's always positive and kind, and he is well loved and respected.

According to his stories, he went to medical school, but dropped out and was accepted to the U.S. Naval Academy. He graduated and became a pilot, and served in Afghanistan, where he was shot down and briefly held by locals before being returned. His plane was later discontinued, and he was able to re-designate to cryptography. He earned a Master's in computer science, then a PhD in quantum computing. After he retired, he went into IT, worked for a local power company, but then struck out on his own with his own IT consulting business.

As you've probably gathered, it's almost entirely bullshit. I had a nagging feeling about him that I dismissed because I just liked the guy so much, and because he had been so sweet and lovable. But, I got to poking around recently and learned the following information:

He went to medical school and apparently became a physician's assistant, but I can find no evidence that he attended USNA or even served in the Navy. I did find court documents that indicate that he was convicted of several crimes (theft, forgery, dealing in a controlled substance) all related to having improperly used and distributed hydrocodone. In one case, his doctor was out of town and he phoned in his own prescription (he had undergone a small procedure), in the other, he offered medication to someone he had not examined, and had no authority to offer controlled medication.

He was then convicted of perjury and impersonating a public servant for claiming to the court that he was a formal Naval officer and pilot, which the court determined was untrue. It seems that he served some time in County jail for all of these crimes.

On top of all of that, I can find no record of a PhD, and it seems that his master's in Computer Science was granted by a pretty sketchy online school. Also, according to the Secretary of State's website, his business was dissolved last August. So I have no idea what he's doing for work, because he's acting as if his business is still alive and keeping him very busy.

I hope I'm wrong about all of this. But I'm not, unless there's another guy, born the same day, in the same town, with the same unusual name.

I have only shared this information with one other person, and she promised to keep it to herself. **My question is: Should I expose him?**

He is well loved, and incredibly kind and supportive. It will hurt a lot of people to find out that he lied about his entire life. As far as I know, he's done nothing to hurt me or anyone else. I can see no benefit to telling our friends about all of this, and I can see that it would create a rift between people who supported the liar and those who don't.",23,34,0.86

1455,Asshole,"My grandmother (GM) was one of my best friends my entire life. Unfortunately, she had a lot of serious health problems so I spent my entire life unsure if each time I saw her would be the last. As I started to get older and things were getting serious with my now fiance, I began to get hopeful that she would at least be able to make it to my wedding. But, she died 2 years ago.

8 months later, my grandfather (GP) had a new girlfriend (NGF). It was a bit of a shock to everyone because it was so soon, but we didn't want him to be miserable and alone so we were supportive. The only thing that me and my first cousin (17F), who was just as close as I was to our GM, asked was for him to not bring her to our family Christmas that year. It was the first Christmas we were going to have after our GM died, and we weren't ready to see someone else sitting at her seat at the dinner table. It also would have been the first time we met NGF. He got really upset and refused to come to Christmas. It became a big fight with various people in the family taking sides. My mother and aunt (my cousin's mom) wanted us to ""be the bigger people"" but we were just grieving the first person we'd both ever lost and we weren't ready yet.

There have been a bunch of other issues surrounding her in the last 1+ year causing family-wide fights. I don't have space to go through them all but I'll give one example. A few weeks ago, my GP started having stroke symptoms so they rushed to the hospital. Luckily it wasn't a stroke, it was Bells palsy from his new hearing aid. The problem was that they thought he was potentially dying and NGF didn't call any of his family. We didn't find out until my mother saw him next and asked what happened to his face.

So basically I've only met her once, and she has been the topic of numerous family-wide fights. I'm having a hard enough time knowing my GM won't be at my wedding. I think that seeing a strange woman in her seat, especially after all that's happened in the past 1+ year is going to be too painful. All this time I've told my GP I have no problem with him having a girlfriend and I have no major problem with the woman herself. I just wanted to not be rushed into acting like she's part of the family when I haven't even come to terms with the loss of the actual part of the family. It's taking longer than it should have because he's been really disrespectful and rushing us with this big change. I don't think it's been resolved enough at this point and I don't want that lingering heartbreak to spoil a day when I'm supposed to be happy and focusing on my new husband. But, my GP would be really upset, possibly to the point of refusing to come, and I know some other family members would be displeased with me for causing problems.

He's got his reasons which can vary from not having time to learn, to anxiety (reads about too many accidents) and sustainability.

But sometimes there are situations where public transport wastes way too much time.


He says he will learn to drive when we have kids. I have made it clear he has to or at least let me for the necessity. But in the meantime, he doesn't like me driving him around because he feels inadequate. However the taxi fees are racking up whenever we visit friends or medium distance travels and I am still paying insurance, tax and MOT on the car.

1458,Not the A-hole,"Two days ago, my 16 year old son came to my wife and I freaked out. He said he’s scared for his life and he doesn’t know what he’s going to do. We had to calm him down and to make a long story short, he thinks he got his girlfriend pregnant. He said she missed her period weeks ago and he doesn’t know what he’s going to do because he’s not ready to be a father. His girlfriend is vehemently pro-life, so there’s not anything he can do.

I asked him how could this happen; why wasn’t she taking her reproductive health seriously and be on birth control, and ESPECIALLY, why isn’t he especially not taking him reproductive seriously by using condoms. He said that his girlfriend’s parents are strict, so she has no way to access them, and to condoms, he said and I quote “Condoms feel like having sex with a thick garbage bag.” Apparently, they relied on the calendar method and pulling out because “together, it’s almost impossible to get pregnant.”

I was **infuriated**. I’ve talked to him ALL the time about safe sex. We’re no prudes; we knew that once he got a girlfriend, he’d start having sex. Which is why we emphasized being *safe*. We’ve just have had this conversation so many times; I was just so. Angry. That my son would do this to his life, and potentially wreck his entire life. 

I told him that this was his fuck-up, and he has to take responsibility. Effective immediately, he is going to have to get a job and work 40 hours a week and start building a savings. Additionally, he has shown that we cannot trust him to make responsible decisions, and he’s effectively grounded until the end of the year. He can spend time with his friends at our house only, with all the doors open, and he cannot go upstairs with any girl at all. He can also only do this only when we’re home (we live in a gated community so this is easily enforceable). That means no sleepovers, no parties, no going to the pool (unless we go with him), no nothing. If he wants to go somewhere like out to eat with his friends, we’ll use find my iPhone to track him. He said he understood.

He came to us today with great news; his girlfriend got her period. He asked now that she’s not really pregnant, can the punishment be less strict, and that he promises to start using condoms now, but my wife and I want to stick to our guns on this. Though with the added stipulation that he can work 20 hours a week instead, and it can be a mixture of volunteer and actual work. But he’s shown us he’s downright irresponsible and we just plainly cannot trust him until he matures. 

My son maintains that we’re being WAY to harsh, and that he realizes his mistake now, but he’s also said in the past that he’d never have sex without a condom because “he’s not an idiot.” We just plainly cannot trust him right now. Are we being unreasonable?

EDIT: The work thing would've just been for the summer. Sorry for the confusion; we agree that there's no way on Earth he could manage that many hours during the school year.",3006,14737,0.89
1459,Not the A-hole,"Resubmitted because of character count!

So backstory: my brother has 3 kids, another on the way, and from the moment his first kid was born, he's 100% relied upon our parents - specifically our mom - financially. One of his kids lives full time with the kids mom, but our mom basically raised his second kid and became a full time child carer. My brother has lived with them off and on throughout the years, they pay for A LOT, etc. That never bothered me before, he was a single dad, I get it! However NOW, he met a woman, they had a kid (that they couldn't afford), they've moved in together, they both work, and now they're having ANOTHER because of bad family planning and not believing in abortion. When their 2 year old was born, my mom basically became full time caregiver to a newborn and his older kid when he wasn't in school. They get 100% free childcare, and it's absolutely running our mom ragged, causes TONS of fights between our parents, and now with the new one on the way it's basically unspoken that he expects our mom to watch their 2 year old, newborn, AND the eldest when he's not in school. They also routinely ask her to babysit or have sleepovers on weekends so they can do things like go to the movies, go to shows, or ""get some rest"". He gives her a couple hundred bucks every few months, but almost NEVER spoils her or does nice things for her. I've spoken with him SO MANY TIMES telling him that he should bend over backwards for her because she's saving them thousands a month, that he should be so grateful, that he's taking advantage of her because he knows she'll NEVER say no, and he always acknowledges that he knows what he's doing in the moment, and that he'll figure something else out, but nothing EVER changes.

&#x200B;

So, a few days ago he asks me if I can babysit their youngest so he or his wife don't have to take the day off of work while our mom takes his eldest to appointments all day. I say sure, but I see a teachable moment here: I'm self employed, my time is money. I'll only charge $10 an hour, so $60 for the day, and I didn't tell him, but I was just gonna give that $ to our mom. He says ""never mind"", and apparently is LIVID at me for having the nerve to charge him and making him have to take a day off of work. I take my nieces and nephews ALL THE TIME - we do sleepovers, we go cool places, etc, but he's asking me to give him free childcare so HE can make money, making it so I can't work all day, JUST like he takes advantage of our mom? I explain it as such - childcare usually isn't free, and this is reality - treat mom better and maybe I wouldn't be trying to drive this point home.

And whilst he hasn’t given me a concrete response yet it seems like hell just divorce her and I’ll never have to see her again .

1463,Asshole,"One of my coworkers came in today with a flag pin on her shirt. I asked about it at lunch since I didn't recognize the flag and she told me it was the asexual pride flag and she was wearing it in honor of pride month. I know the basics of asexuality (people who aren't sexually attracted to anyone), but I don't know a lot more about that. I asked her if asexuality is really considered part of the LGBT community since not being attracted to anyone isn't the same as being attracted to the same sex. She told me asexual people are definitely part of the community and while they don't face all the same struggles as other LGBT people, they still have to face discrimination and come out as well. I asked if coming out is really necessary since people generally don't care who is or isn't having sex and it's honestly kind of too much information. I really believe there's no reason for an asexual person to tell people who aren't their partners that they're asexual; it's a little weird going around telling people you don't want to have sex. She got annoyed at me and told me it's more complicated than that and she didn't want to get into it more, then she left to go back to her desk.

I met my girlfriend 6 years ago - she used to be very outgoing but never had a stable career due to her ill health with severe bouts of asthma as well has having a blood borne disease that have landed her in hospital over the many times that we've been together.

3 years ago her sisters asked her to help take care of their mother (suffering from dementia) but after a while they kicked her out for doing ""a good enough job"" and because of this she lost her disability benefits. She has absolutely no help from family.

As of recent her health as been better and she's been cycling quite a bit - one of her old friends suggested for her to get a part time job and she lost it and had a dreadful depressive episode...

I've been supporting her for the 3 years ever since where I am now living paycheck to paycheck as is she - my aspirations for my future are fading quickly and this is causing me to fall in to a deep depression. I want to go back to earn a degree or any form of further education/training in order to make a better future for myself ...I cannot get any financial help and I cannot save enough to go back. If I do apply for any further education/training my wages would far lower than they are now and i'd fail to support the both of us.

I won't cut off all financial help - but I've been thinking that maybe she needs to get a part time job and maybe we can both move forward - but her recent reaction when her friend suggested the same thing, has forced me to think twice, as I know she struggles really hard herself.

1466,Not the A-hole,"For context: This title sounds like we’re 12 but we are in our mid 20s! We live together and are domestic partners. 

My (F24) birthday was last week. My partner (M26) was traveling for work and got home around 10PM on my birthday. He wanted to save my birthday festivities for this weekend so we had more time.

Last week I had posted an Amazon wish list for some friends who wanted to send me birthday gifts. My partner also had access to this list. 

Last night I received some gifts in the mail from friends and decided to open them because... it’s my birthday (well, it was a week ago). I opened one in front of my partner. It was a fabulous gift! Just what I wanted. My partner was clearly upset. He told me it was a duplicate of what he got me. I said something along the lines of, “Oh no! Well we can return this one or you can return yours and save some money. You choose!” He told me not to open any more gifts until he gave me his. I don’t recall how I responded, but it wasn’t agreeing to that. 

This AM I woke up very early because I wasn’t feeling well and my partner was still asleep. I opened the other gifts. I wasn’t sneaky about it or anything — threw the packaging out but put the gifts on the counter. My partner saw it later this morning and is so upset. “I told you not to open the gifts until you opened mine!”

He is allowed to feel however he wants to feel, but I don’t think I should feel like the asshole. My thinking is that these are gifts for ME sent from MY friends for MY birthday that was LAST week. I feel like he’s being a little bit childish. I understand he put thought and effort into my birthday but I don’t see how opening other gifts first takes away from his hard work.

What she doesn’t know is that my roommate goes through women like he does beer on a Friday night. He’s been known to sleep with 2-3 different women every weekend. I’ve lived with the guy for just about 3 years (we are in our late 20s). 

So last night, we were all hanging out after work. I found myself in the kitchen with his girlfriend and she was asking a bunch of random questions. Eventually she asked the question of “How many women has he been with?” I kind of shrugged and tried to dodge the question. She refused to accept that answer and wanted an actual number. I said I didn’t know, which is true, it’s too high to count at this point. She persisted until finally I just blurted out: “Let’s put it this way, you’re just another number on his list, and that number is pretty high.”

She stayed for about another 10 minutes and then left without saying anything to anyone. She called my roommate and told him she was done, just like that. Of course she told him what I said and now my roommate refuses to talk to me.

1469,Not the A-hole,"I was having a movie night with my friend and her 5-year old daughter at her house, and all of a sudden, I hear a knock on the door. I open up the door, and it's a man I recognise called James. 

He says he came to surprise my friend (let's call her Jane) and take her out for dinner. James is not in a relationship with Jane - they've only been on one movie date and another dinner night, and for me, it kinda felt inappropriate for James to show up to her house unannounced, without even texting beforehand to know if she was free, and especially considering he knows has a 5-year old daughter who she would need to make babysitting arrangements for (I honestly have no idea where he was planning for the kid to stay). 

I told Jane I wanted to speak to her in private, and when we want to a private area, I told her I thought it felt widely inappropriate for James to show up announced and try and put ""pressure"" on her to accept his date. Although Jane was initially cool with the idea of the date, she ended up agreeing with me, and told James they could hang out another day. AITA for ruining a potentially great night?

1470,Not the A-hole,"Backstory: I came out as trans at 14. I don’t remember much of the day. But I remember she told me that while she respected this, it was too hard for her to call me by my chosen name and pronouns, and asked if she could call me a shortened version of my deadname for a bit (we’ll just say C). I respected this, and let her, but asked if she could call me by my pronouns. She said it’d be really hard for her so later. I gave up and accepted that too.

Fast forward 4 years. I’m 18 now, and have been with my identity strong, but go by a new name than my first one. My mom....hasn’t really come around. Though it’s been 4 years, my mom has still called me C “around 60% of the time so it should be fine!” 

I’ve asked her, throughout all these years, to switch up on the name and pronouns. At first, I went by Mike, but she didn’t want to call me that bc it was ugly. Then, I went by Justin, and she didn’t want to call me that bc it “reminded (her) of a cousin pair Justin and Jennifer, and (I) don’t have a Jennifer.” I got fed up, and asked her what name should I go by then? I offered Oliver, and she said she’d like that bc it’d go with my sisters name. For the 2 years I held that name, she never once called me Oliver. One time she even used my correct pronouns and then immediately apologized to me for it. I got fed up again, and went to pick a different name, I was stuck between Charlie and another name we’ll call Matt, and, not being the decision maker myself, I asked my mom what she preferred. She didn’t like either of them. I don’t know why she didn’t like Charlie, but she didn’t like Matt bc of a very, very awkward experience she had w someone of that name in high school. Instead, she offered names closer to C so she could continue calling me that, but bc of my journey with my deadname and my fight w my father, I didn’t want to be associated w it anymore. I tried to explain that to her, but she wouldn’t have it.

I picked Matt, btw, bc I felt it resonated w me more. This obviously didn’t help anything with the names bc she didn’t want to call me that. 

The pronouns never changed. I have asked her multiple, multiple times to go w he/him and call me her son, not daughter. Every time, the same excuse. 
“It’s just too hard for me to start doing it bc I’ve always known you as a girl.”
“I’m getting C down now (after 4 years), isn’t that enough??” And when I say how it’s been 4 years, she should have gotten it by now and that it’s just too close to my deadname for me to hate it, she says, “So then my progress means nothing to you??”
I’ve asked for gender neutral pronouns (they/them) and she says, “I will never see they/them as a pronoun for a singular person.”

She thinks I should give her a break bc it’s hard for her since she has known me as C for so long. AITA?",61,43,0.64

1474,Not the A-hole,"So, this happened the other day. I was out running errands with one of my kids and I popped into one of the shops in the UK know for bargains and making your pound go further.

For a little background the area I live in is probably about 50% poor and 50% OK. This particular shops staff have always struck me as being unhappy to be there. They've given me this impression by arguing with each other at the tills in front of customers, yelling for each other across the shop (it's maybe school swimming pool sized) and getting terse yells back, swearing barely under their breath etc. The manager is in her 20s I think and she will regularly berate her staff in public. I've always just got my bargains and moved on.

On this particular day I was in the cleaning goods aisle and I spotted a woman popping canisters of air freshener into a shopping bag and not the basket she had which held one cheap item. She maybe grabbed 10 before putting the basket item back on the shelf and sauntering off.

Having previously worked retail this irked me. Had it been food she was pilfering I may have ignored it (our local food bank has been taking a hammering recently due to poverty) but air fresheners?? So I decided to point it out to a member of staff and let them deal with it.

The first member of staff I saw was the manager stocking a shelf. I went over and said ""excuse me"" and before I could say anything further she muttered ""fuck sake"" and rolled her eyes as she stood up. I admit I saw red and instead of saying what I planned said ""nevermind, I changed my mind"".

Our children are both overweight, the daughter moreso than the son. At her last doctor’s appointment, I was told her BMI is in the 98th percentile. I decided that, for the sake of the kids’ health, we needed to make better dietary choices. It’s been going well while they’re at my house, but recently when I took my daughter’s lunchbox out of her book bag and saw what my ex had packed her, I realized that he’s not making any effort to give them anything nutritious. I found the remains of a Nutella on white bread sandwich, a bag from some gummy fruit snacks, two fun-sized candy bar wrappers, and a bag with some potato chip crumbs in it. And that was it. Her entire lunch. 

So I asked her what else she had eaten at her dad’s that day: a pop tart for breakfast, and plain pasta with hot dogs for dinner. Then for dessert they went to an ice cream shop. I asked about snacks, and she said she’d eaten some cheez-its. Any fruit? Nope. Vegetables? Nope. Was this a normal day at his house? Yep. 

I brought my concerns to him and told him, “I’m a little worried because the doctor said both the kids are overweight. Daughter told me what she eats at your house, and it sounds like there’s a lot of sugar and very little protein or fruits or vegetables.” He shrugged and said “I just feed them what they’ll eat.” I said “they’re willing to eat healthier stuff at my house.” He said “well good for you, but I’m not wasting my time and money on food I know is going to end up in the trash.” I told him that it was our job as their parents to give them healthy options to eat, not just junk, and he blew up and said I could give them whatever I want when they’re at my house, and he’ll give them whatever he wants when they’re at his house, and it’s really none of my business. I disagreed because what he feeds them affects their health even when they’re not with him. He told me to stop telling him how to parent, he doesn’t need my help, he’s perfectly capable without me butting in, and that it’s really bitchy of me to tell him what to do when he would never do that to me.

1477,No A-holes here,"It sounds horrible but idk.

I've been planning to surprise my boyfriend with a picnic for a while. We finally had one yesterday, where I took him to a park and blindfolded him while I set the stuff up because I wanted to surprise him in the most romantic way possible.

When we first got there, I was already disappointed as it was raining hard and we couldn't get a good sunny spot in the grass. I had to choose a small bridge with a rooftop, that overlooked a little lake with tortoises and fish. We weren't blocking the path, we were on the side.

I spent probably a good 15 minutes setting things up, pouring drinks out in glasses and putting food out nicely. I brought card games and home baked brownies. Just as I finished setting up, a couple in their wedding clothes and cameramen walked towards us. I had to make my boyfriend open his eyes and it completely ruined the surprise as i panicked and didnt know what to do. We knew they wanted to take the spot for a photo. It was raining, so the usual pretty spots arent available and the bridge was the most symmetrical and nicer places that day.

The couple and the others ended up walking away after some discussion amongst themselves, but we felt terrible for not packing away immediately. This is their one in a lifetime moment, it was already raining, and we took the prettiest spot in the park. We must have been visibly panicking or upset about this moral dilemma, as one of them had to reassure us it's fine.

We caught the bride and groom looking at us from across the lake a few times. The rest of the picnic ended quickly and wasn't relaxing or enjoyable at all, because all we could talk about or do is worry about what just happened. We felt super guilty for not leaving immediately for someone's one of a lifetime photoshoot that they would cherish and remember for the rest of their lives. But on the other hand I felt upset because *a)* I spent a long time preparing this surprise. (Exam week ended the day before, and it was the one thing we wanted to do to relieve the stress and have fun for the first time in a while.), *b)* We had nowhere else to go because rain and *c)* I spent a long time setting up.

The couple never actually confronted us but it was clear that they wanted the spot. One of the cameramen pointed at our setup and quite passive aggressively shouted to the other that ""theres a picnic going on"".

We know that it was a public space and we had the right to stay, but I felt guilty for it. This was a BIG day for them and was likely upsetting. I don't know if they returned as we left shortly. We're also pretty young (17) and I felt terrible, feeling that they probably thought of us as immature puppy love and just a much smaller deal than their marriage, which made us assholes for not prioritizing them.

1479,Not enough info,"First some background, I am a 21 year old student and live in a flat with two friends (1 male (A) 1 female (D)). I have known my flatmates for 2.5 years and we kind of gelled because we were all a bit shy and to be honest, losers. Recently, I decided to make an effort to be more social and lose weight/present myself better and have been seeing my girlfriend (S) for around 6 months now. She stays over 1-2 nights per week and my female flatmate in particular really doesn't like it. She first started staying over in January this year and D mentioned that she wanted me to tell her when S was going to stay over. For a couple of months, I did message D to tell her whenever S was going to come over. After a while, I stopped, with the justification to myself being that I am 21, D is 22, we are both adults and I should be able to have S stay over without me warning D as if I am 14 and she is my Mum. It is also important that when S stays over, we literally just stay in my room except for going to the bathroom. We do not disturb my other flatmates at all, we aren't even noisy. 

&#x200B;

It all came to a head when this morning, me and S were leaving my house to drop S home and D caught a glimpse of S, at which point D shouted 'oh for fuck's sake' and slammed her bedroom door. Flatmate A said 'Hi' to S and that was that. I personally think this is very childish behaviour but I wanted to get some opinions on this. I could understand if me and S were always in the kitchen, in the lounge etc. but D literally saw S for one second and this was her reaction...

I am graduating and leaving this flat for good in 5 days and will probably never see D again so I do not really care what D thinks of me.

1482,Not the A-hole,"I have a tomato plant in my front yard. A few times I was about to pick them, all of the ripe tomatoes disappeared. Being annoyed and curious as to what happened to them, I got a cheap security camera installed for that part of the house to see if it was an animal or a person. I wait a few days for some ripe tomatoes and I see a neighbour who lives a few houses down come in and steal most of the tomatoes. I call the police and show them the footage and the guy is given a slap on the wrist, I didn’t want to press charges. 

Now the whole street thinks I’m over reacting and have been gossiping about this in our neighbourhood Facebook. Now maybe I did over react like an asshole and that is why I am here, AITA?

Edit 1: Idk if I am the asshole or not, it seems like I am getting the same amount of YTA and NTA.

Edit 2: Well I will consider this as a NTA. But to so many of the people who said YTA, why not ESH? Does the guys who stole not suck? Thanks for the feedback skaters",409,1457,0.97
1483,Not the A-hole,"I (19F) have been friends with this guy (20M) for about a year now. For the sake of convenience I'll call him Mike. We're pretty close, but there's something he does that irritates me to no end. Everything he does, he believes has to be super top secret, so he's a little too eager to kick me out of mundane things. An example would be when he kicked me out of his room to talk to his high school friends about high school things. I'm not sure what he thought I would do with info about a bunch of people I don't know from a time that should be behind us. But as dumb as I thought his requests were, I knew it wasn't my place to decide that and left. However, there are times where I draw the line; recently was one of those times.

We have a mutual friend (22M) I'll call Dave and the three of us usually hang out in Dave's room. They're both gay and Mike has romantic feelings for Dave. We were all hanging out in Dave's room and watching a show on my laptop. As soon as Dave and I were starting to really get into the show, Mike starts dropping hints that I should leave so he can spend time with Dave alone. I refused because it's not his room, it's Dave's room and if he still wants me there I'm staying. Not only that, but as far as I know Dave doesn't feel the same way so I would be getting kicked out for a fruitless effort. Later, he told me I should take a hint and leave when asked. I told him I got the hint, I just didn't listen because I didn't think it was fair for him to cut my time with Dave short just because he has a crush. If he wants alone time, he should do it on his own time, not when it's a group hangout in a place he doesn't own.

But despite those reasons, I still feel like I was just being a defiant little shit. AITA?

EDIT: I decided to clarify something. In the past when Mike has asked me to leave, he wants me to leave for good. I assumed this time was no different, since he didn't tell me to ""step outside"", he told me to ""leave"". This was also why I was insistent on staying because I knew I wouldn't have been able to come back, and if Dave still wanted me around that wouldn't have been fair to either of us.",71,185,0.92
1484,Asshole,"AITA for not wanting to participate in mourning my boss?

Technically she wasn't my immediate boss but she was my bosses boss. She was only like 50 but had a stroke at home and fell down the stairs. She broke her spine, neck, was in a coma and was on life support for 2 days before they pulled the plug and she died. 

This death, like most, was sudden and unexpected and people at my job started wearing black ribbons on their uniforms. A coworker saw that I did not have one on mine and offered me one, to which I replied ""no thanks"" and received a few glares from other coworkers in the area. I caved a few minutes later and ended up putting the ribbon on.

I didn't have much interaction with my bosses boss, but when I did she was a real bitch. She truly was a horrible person. A week before she passed away I heard her talking to my immediate boss about a coworker who was out sick because she had a miscarriage. And this woman had the nerve to say ""Shit happens, but she still needs to come to work.""

Anyway, I don't wish death upon anyone and I'm not glad she died, but I'm not going to pretend like she was a terrific person. AITA here?",129,620,0.97
1485,Not the A-hole,"Backstory: There is a mentally disabled classmate of mine in my Latin class and I don’t really like him (NOT BECAUSE HE’S MENTALLY DISABLED). I say disabled, because I don’t know if he’s just autistic or if he has something else. I don’t know what other mental disabilities he has. I think reasons for not liking him is for valid reasons though. 

He constantly harasses/sexually harasses the girls (including me sometimes) in our class if he is sitting next to a girl. If he is sitting next to a girl, he rocks back-and-forth to subtly rub his d*ck. He claims some girls are his “girlfriend” and that he has 7 “girlfriends”. This makes all the women (and even the men) in our class very uncomfortable especially if they are forced to sit next to him.

He also gets very annoyed easily and whenever someone is joking amongst their friends, he covers his ears and/or yells very loudly at them, or just have some kind of over-the-top reaction. He constantly holds up class by trying to ask a question, but rants about what we just said before asking the actual question. However, the staff never tried to correct his behavior because he is disabled and they say “he can’t help it”.

These are the reasons why I have a distain for him.

Main Event: He has recently started targeting these two girls who are friends. He always sits in front of me and the two girls have to travel far from the previous class so they are always forced to take the two seats that happen to be next to him in the row in front of me. 

The girls, L and C, are constantly harassed by him. L has previously been harassed by him and he has said he has loved her, grabbed her hand, and he’s just been really creepy with her despite her protest and said she has a boyfriend. He has even created a timeline of them being together after she breaks up with her boyfriend (her and her boyfriend are still together). 

C is usually the one that sits next to him. He constantly tries to talk to her while she does her work, tries to touch her hair or arm, and I caught him staring at her, but not her face, he was staring at her boobs. 

After having enough of this, I told him in a stern voice, “Leave them alone. They are trying to do their work and you are keeping them from doing that. You are making them uncomfortable and it is also rude to stare.” He seemed slightly embarrassed and said sorry before leaving them alone and went back to rocking back and forth. C didn’t know he was staring at her boobs and thanked me. I have switch seats with her so she can still be by her friend and I sit next to him because he doesn’t really bug me. (He’s 17 and we are all in the range of 15-17. I’m 15 and L and C are 16 or 17).

**EDIT: Just to clarify, we have tried talking to the teacher about it. However, we were told that he’s mentally disabled, so he can’t help it.**

**EDIT 2: I am getting everyones replies and I am reading them all. Thank you for your answers. I have read them! :D**

**EDIT 3: When Reading the comments, I got the impression that you guys thought he was only harassing these two girls. Nope, he has harassed every girl in our class (including me) except for 1 (she has short hair, so I think he thinks she is a boy). The last time he harassed me was during the middle of spring, when I was forced to sit next to him and caught him staring on the day I was wearing my white Lululemon skort. I caught him and said “What do you think you’re doing?” He didn’t answer and looked away. The reason why I fell I might be TA this time is because the incident didn’t happen to me, but to someone else (L and C), and I felt like it might not of been any of my business to but in.**",140,387,0.92
1486,Not the A-hole,"So last weekend I went on a tinder date with a girl who I’ve been chatting to for a while. It was our second date and I thought things were going pretty well.

We end up at this rowdy bar a bit far out (30-40min) which I recommended. It was good fun until she sees someone she knows, this guy she went to college with, and they start chatting. I awkwardly try to join in but I’m basically ignored. I leave them to it to get some food and come back like 30 min later. They’re still chatting. I stand around like an idiot trying to join the convo but at one point the guy literally blocks me out with his back and my date says and does nothing. They back into a corner and only talk to each other. 

At this point I go out and grab a smoke. She comes out after me and apologizes, says she hasn’t seen this guy in ages. I tell her that’s cool but I’m just gonna head home soon. She asks me to wait for her bc she doesn’t have a ride and it’s far from home. 

So I wait bc whatever, night is ruined and I might as well just hang out. I wait another 20 min before heading back inside to tell her I’m going home and she can either come with me or stay. I see them in the same corner with the guy blocking my view. I try to talk to her but he keeps turning to block me away. I gesture to her that I’m going and she holds up a finger like “wait a minute” and instead of coming to talk to me she just keeps talking to her friend. 

I’ve had it at this point and I just text her “leaving now, bye” and head straight to my car and leaves. I get frantic calls about 15 min later. She asks me where I am and if I could go back and pick her up since she doesn’t have a ride and her friend doesn’t live close to her like I do. I say “no” and hang up. 

Anyways the next day I get the longest, angriest chain of texts in my life. She’s upset because I left her with no ride and she had to beg the bartender to call her a cab because she ran out of cash and can’t get uber/lyft for some reason. She calls me a POS and to never call her again and that she’ll be telling anyone she knows not to ever go on a date with me. 

My roommate and his gf both agreed that the girl sucks, but they think I should’ve just waited longer and made sure she got home. AITA for what I did?",1049,21696,0.93

1488,Asshole,"Yesterday I had plans to meet a friend at a park in her town, I brought my two dogs with me and sat on a bench for about 20 minutes until she arrived. My dogs are not well trained and bark when they see other dogs or sometimes at strangers walking close to us. The dogs grew up in a very rural area where we rewarded them for alerting us to strangers on the property. They are not aggressive at all and if a stranger approaches and is friendly they will stop barking and wag their tails. 

About fifteen minutes into my wait a woman approached yelling at me and threatening to call the police because my dogs were ""disturbing the peace"". She told me to leave the park. I tried to explain that I was waiting for a friend and it would just be a few minutes. I held my position, but now I feel like maybe I was TA because they were barking. It didn't help matters that the dogs were barking incessantly at this yelling woman.

I don't bring my dogs to other public places, they're not the types who will sit calmly outside a coffee shop, but I always felt like a park, even a crowded park was ok.  Should I have left them home? Should I have backed down and walked them somewhere else when the woman complained?",318,266,0.9

1490,Not the A-hole,"So I (28m) have been having a lot of discussions/fights with my girlfriend (29f) lately. I will have to give you some background information for this to make sense.

Roughly 2 years ago I was diagnosed with brain cancer. They also found metastasis from the tumor all the way down my spine. I went through chemotherapy and radiation as a result. One possible side effect of the treatment was that I would become infertile. So I had my sperm frozen before the treatment just to be on the safe side and I really did become infertile. 

The problem is that I don't want to have biological children. I also suffer from major depression and my early 20s were absolutely awful as a result. It took me several years just to become a functioning member of society and I still go to therapy and take antidepressants to this day. There's also a history of depression in my family. My mom and my uncle have also been diagnosed with depression and they think that my grandmother also suffered from it.

Because of that I decided that I don't want to have biological children. I just don't want to see my children go through the same problem as I did. I know that wouldn't necessarily happen, but I don't want to take any chances. A large part of my life has been absolutely awful because of depression to the point where I was seriously thinking about taking my own lifefor many years.

Recently my girlfriend and I have been talking a lot about having children. I absolutely love her and definitely want to marry her and start a family with her, but I don't want to have biological children. I would be okay with either a sperm donor or adoption. She doesn't want either of these options though and definitely wants me to be the biological father of her children.

She says that just because depression has been a problem in my family that that doesn't mean my children will suffer from it, too. And while that is true I still don't want to take a chance. The thing is she never knew me when I my depression was really bad. We've known each other for three years and have been together for two years now.

A few days ago I mentioned that I'm thinking about getting rid of my frozen sperm. She immediately started crying and begged me to keep it. I 100% made up my mind on this topic though. I'm not going to have biological children with anyone. I think it's irresponsible and I couldn't live with myself if my children had to go through the same struggles as I did. I just don't see any reason why I should keep my sperm. It costs me ~300€ a year to keep it frozen. (It's frozen at - 196° C.) We're not struggling financially, but I've made up my mind on this topic and see no reason to keep it anymore.

So, WIBTA if I got rid of my frozen sperm and make it impossible for me to have biological children?",244,672,0.96
1491,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because my husband lurks. 

My husband (26) and I (26) have been together for 6 years and married for 1. This has been an ongoing issue through our entire relationship. I truly don't mind if he masturbates because I understand that we all have needs, but I am a very light sleeper and between the light of his phone and the shaking from the motion it wakes me up. He'll stop for a minute, I go back to sleep, and then we repeat this cycle another 5-10 times until he finishes. 


I find this really disrespectful to me. I have told him many times that this irritates me and I make him aware of my irritation every time he wakes me up. Last night, however, he acted like I was being completely unreasonable about it. After the 5th time of waking up and trying to get him to stop I moved out to the couch. Like I said, I don't care if he does it, I don't care where he does it and when he does it as long as it's not in bed when I'm trying to sleep. 


AITA here?


Thanks for all the responses! It sparked an interesting debate and I appreciate all the advice given.",324,1175,0.93
1492,Not the A-hole,"I will start by saying I pay for about 70-80% of me and my wife’s cost of living expenses (necessities). She makes about 1/3 what I do so I like for her to be able to save and have extra money for things she wants, vice dump it all into cost of living.

My wife has a friend called Yasmin. Yasmin is part of some group (it has a spanish name so I don’t know what it is) that says they empower women. My wife told me about this group one day, apparently you submit $1000 (somewhere or to someone??) and become a level 1 group member, gaining levels by recruiting more members. Once you reach level 5 or so of the community, you have about 30 people under you, and you graduate from the community and receive $30,000. All the while the group is supposed to support each other and help you attain your goals by giving you that cash infusion at the end. The whole process is supposed to take 2 months.

As soon as she told me about this, the words MLM, scam, and other things came to mind. In my opinion, this is some type of MLM disguised in a veil of “empowerment of women.” Yasmin is 4 months in and still trying to recruit people because she has not seen her money yet. Somehow Yasmin has convinced my wife to join this cause. I tried explaining to her that some MLMs *do* actually work, but those stories are few and far between and only to the insider people who started the whole thing in the first place, never the grunts that join later. I told her that if she does this she will 1) never see her money again 2) become an embarrassment to herself as she begins to essentially ask all her friends and family for money to join the program so that she can get hers 3) waste a lot of time when this never works out. I think she has good intentions, at least as far as wanting to make more money and contribute, but she has somehow gotten tricked into thinking this get rich quick maneuver will work.

When she told me she wanted to join I fought her on it and told her that I will stop helping her pay for things on this main basis: I am currently doing so because I like to help her with her basic needs/necessities so she can spend her money on things she wants.  Because this $1000->$30,000 is not a 100% guarantee, she is essentially gambling her money that she will turn a profit. In this perspective, she has money beyond her basic wants and she even has enough to gamble with, therefore there is no reason for me to still be supporting her needs/necessities. 

I will admit that I feel like I am using money to strong arm her into making a decision for her. I would normally never do this to her but I just feel so strongly that she is about to get screwed over and I don’t want to see that happen to her, so I am almost threatening her to save her from herself. I did end the conversation with, I cannot make the decision for you, I can just tell you my thoughts on the matter and inform you of the actions I am going to take if you still decide to do through with this.",227,974,0.97
1493,Not the A-hole,"I was at a grocery story doing some shopping, picked up a few items and went to checkout. This particular store that I was at was packed and slow, imagine costco lines but gas station store speeds. Only four registers were open and each line had around ten people waiting.

I was in line for around 15 minutes with no one behind me, a guy in a wheelchair pulls up and only had three things so I let him go in front of me. A pregnant lady with her husband notices this and also tries to get in front of me. At this point I had been in line for almost 20 minutes and my patience was running thin. Her husband without asking tries to get in front of me so I said ""I've been waiting here for 20 minutes please don't try to cut in front of me"". Then he says ""My wifes pregnant and can't stand on her feet for too long can I go in front of you?"". At this point I'm a bit frustrated since he first tried to get in front of me without asking and only did this after I let another guy in a wheel chair get in front. Normally I wouldn't care but this couple had a huge shopping cart filled with items, the line was already moving slower than molasses and I just couldn't take it. So I told him that she didn't have a problem running around the store (I saw her walking around fine earlier not exactly running but swift walking around the store and she was at most 4 or 5 months pregnant).

Before I could even respond the person in front of the guy I let in lets this couple go in front of them. I was frustrated so I said ""If you could walk around the store fine then you could wait like the rest of us"".

this has torn our family apart and I'm thinking that most of my family will never speak to me again after this. 

so about a year ago  my brother confessed that he found children attractive, instead of attacking him I decided to help him find a mental illness place in my area and get him help. he had no photos or had ever watched any videos (that I know of) but I did search his computer and phone and found nothing. 

I managed to keep it a secret and he went to a treatment center (he is currently still there) somehow my auntie found out and told my entire family.

1496,Asshole,"Recently, my 13 year old daughter came home upset about getting into an argument with another girl over a soccer game in PE. My daughter isn’t the most athletic, but her friend plays soccer year-round. 

In this specific game, my daughter got into an argument with her friend; my daughter kicked the ball into the goal but her friend, who was the goalie and inattentive in the moment, claimed that there was NO WAY my daughter could have kicked it in. I’m guessing that’s because my daughter probably failed to do so during numerous other attempts, but my daughter thought that this girl was putting her down when she had just started to improve at soccer. 

Then, that one argument got a lot nastier and they started fighting over random things not even related to soccer. However, after a while, my daughter expressed wanting to still be friends and make things up with that girl. I told her to send an apology email, call that friend, or talk to the girl in person about it. 

Unfortunately, that didn’t work, and the girl told my daughter that she never thought my daughter would change and that they would never be friends again. My daughter started crying, but I found it very hard to comfort or feel sympathy for her. I am a very solutions-focused, practical person. At 13, I would have said, “to hell with that girl, I’m 13 and in 4.5 years I won’t ever see her again. Good riddance.” 

I told her that, and I also said, “All girls fight, and at 13 I thought you would have known that by now.” I mean, as an adult, you’re just so swamped with things that stress you out way more than some teenage drama that they’ll both forget about by the time they’re 35. 

My daughter carried on crying and came into my husband and I’s bedroom to cry and vent some more at about 10 PM. I made her leave by 12 am because it was late and I start work at 8 AM. I am honestly pretty angry about the whole situation because my daughter even missed her zero period biology class over crap like this.

I wanted to teach my daughter a different approach: that not everyone deserves your heavy emotions, like that girl, conflict resolution skills, life skills: that all women are catty (I have coworker spats with girls I work with and I never feel down because I just know all women are like that), and just how to let things go. I don’t want my daughter to pity herself when stuff like this happens. 

Instead of going to class, my kid instead spent her morning waking up her grandma (my mom) and crying and venting to her. Later, my mom called me and said that I needed to have more patience and empathy for my daughter, and that I should have given her a hug or two, even though my mom KNOWS I’m not a touchy person and don’t even hug my husband, whom I arguably love a smidgen more than my daughter. My sister even called me as well and said that I was “too cold” towards my daughter. 

Then, when she did go back to school, my kid even told her ""FAVORITE"" TEACHER about this. Why would you tell a stranger about your personal problems when you have FAMILY, like your MOM, to help you? My daughter even came home and told me that she sometimes wanted said teacher to be her mom sometimes! I don't know where that came from and why! I've been here for 13 years and her teacher has known her for like, less than a year.

I’m so confused now. AITA?",1555,4277,0.86
1497,Not the A-hole,"Some backstory first. We used to be lower middle class until my father started this company and it became successful. We all helped him put desks together and put the office together when he first started and had 0 employees, we were in our teens then. We all interned there for several years during high school and college and that experience landed us all good jobs with good companies. He always told us that he wants to leave a legacy behind and that if he died, and we didn’t want anything to do with his company, to never sell our shares because we would all still make a small amount of the profit if a consultant ends up taking over when he retires.

After high school I decided to go to college and follow in his footsteps. I ended up really enjoying this line of work. I worked for other companies when I graduated because when I was interning I never took work seriously and I was worried I wouldn’t give it 100%. Now that he’s retired, I’m CEO and he’s still the president. One of my siblings says I should share a small amount of the net revenue with each of them since the company is the family’s and not just mine. However this is my only source of income, and they already make 6 figures themselves. If they ever needed help I would help them in anyway I could monetarily or not. However sharing my income, even if it’s just a small percentage, seems unreasonable. Am I the asshole?

TLDR; My father started a company and became successful. I became CEO but a sibling says all his children should get a percentage of the net revenue because the company is the family’s and not just mine. 

Sorry if the grammar is not good, I’m on a 4 hour bumpy car ride and grammar has never been my strong suit.

1499,Everyone Sucks,"So, TL;DR is basically the title. Obligatory on mobile.

So to get into the nitty gritty here's what happened to bring me into this situation. I picked my girlfriend up from work today amd as soon as she gets into the car she tells me that she's on her period and that she needs to get tampons ASAP. No problem. Her house is about 10 minutes away, 8 if I speed. So as I'm rushing down the road to her house she sees a walgreens and the conversation goes like this.

""Can we just stop there right quick?""

Today was payday, but I know she doesn't have a bank account, she's out of cash, and we haven't cashed out her check. So the first thing that comes to mind is...

""Yeah sure, do you have any cash on you?""

""No, can I use your [debit] card?""

""Sure, if you pay me back""

As soon as I said this, she looks at me in shock.

""Can't you just cover this one time?""

""Uh... No?""

At this point I'm thinking, I have a job that pays barely over minimum wage. You get the same pay I do. I know we just got payed and I know you can afford to pay me back when the check is cashed. Of course, I don't say any of this. She then says something along the lines of

""Would you make me pay if it was toilet paper?"" In a pretty pissed off tone.

""Yes. Look, your house is just around the corner, let's just go there.""

At this point she's fuming in the passenger seat, but I know if I hurry I can get her home pretty quick. Just as we're about to get to her house she says

""Should I pay you back for all the dates we've been on too?""

I get a bit pissed off at this comment. Not gonna lie, I was not happy to hear this passive aggressive bullshit just cause I wouldn't stop.

""Look baby, I don't think I was unreasonable. It's my money and I don't have much of it. But whatever, we're almost there, it's too late to turn back now.""

We sit in the car fuming a bit, but I get her home as quick as I can and she appologises to me. I know she gets really anxious and doesn't like conflict or tension, even less so on her perios, so I don't know if she appologised because she felt she was in the wrong or if she just wanted to get the fight done and over with.

So I turn this over to you reddit. Am I the asshole?

EDIT: Just to make it clear, I never stopped, I rushed to get to where we we're going. The walgreens was at an intersection, most of the conversation toom place at the stoplight.

EDIT 2: So general consensus so far. I'm the Asshole. And talking to ya'll, here's how I could have handled the situation leagues better. I could have let her use my cash to get the tampons and let her get comfortable and then asked about the cash ordeal. Whether or not I would be the asshole after that, I don't know. But I agree with most of you after thinking it out. I'm the ass. I'll be sure to learn from the experience. Also please, tell me if this new way of thinking is flawed, I'm curious.",116,61,0.84
1500,Not the A-hole,"My husband (who is not my daughter’s biological father, but has been more of a father-figure in her life than her biological father has) and I just got into an argument because he says I am wrong for not wanting to tell her that her biological father doesn’t care much to see or speak to her.

A bit of background, my daughter is eight years old. Her father hasn’t been very active in her life since she was born. He’s been in and out of her life, only seeing her maybe 3-4 times a year. Despite this, she loves him, constantly wants to see and speak to him, and doesn’t really see anything wrong with their relationship. She’s a child, still very oblivious to how toxic her relationship with her father is. 
When he does see her, he is great to her, but it’s the fact that he makes no effort to be an active part of her life that is upsetting. 

I basically have to take the initiative, contact him, and set up a date and time for him to see her, otherwise he would never see her. I do this for her sake, as she loves him, and seeing him makes her happy. She’s constantly asking me if she can go spend time with him.

The argument between my husband and I came about after I vented to him that I reached out to my daughter’s father and asked him if he would like to spend some time with our daughter before her and I leave town on vacation for the next few months. Her father never responded. This upset me, but it’s nothing new or surprising. I went to my husband to vent my frustrations on the situation.

This is where my husband suggested I stop trying to force her father to be an active part of her life. He also suggested that I tell my daughter that her father doesn’t care about her, doesn’t care to spend time with her, and doesn’t care to see or speak to her. His exact words were “Tell her the truth that her dad don’t give a fuck about her or seeing her.” I found this to be extremely harsh and inappropriate, and was appalled that he even suggest I say something like that to a child.

I believe it to be best to just allow her to figure it out on her own when she is older, mature, and capable of having a better understanding. I believe one day she will see her father for what he really is and that it is not my place to share such harsh and heartbreaking info with her at such a young age. 

My husband disagrees and states that when she is older, she will resent me for keeping this from her. From this point on, our discussion spiraled into a huge argument where he basically kept stating that I’m in the wrong and I’m the asshole in the situation.

1502,Everyone Sucks,"My boyfriend has a 3 year old son and I started sleeping with my boyfriend about 16 months ago. He was in a relationship at the time but she had bad depression and an eating disorder and he was depressed because of it too. 6 months into our affair his girlfriend found out about us, she very tragically ended her life and I am filled with guilt because of it. I know we made a stupid mistake having an affair and he should have been honest with her, but he didn’t know how to handle the situation and now we’re left dealing with the consequences. 

My boyfriend and I made it offical and we have moved in together. His son has started calling me mom sometimes but when he says it I just get filled with more guilt and hate it. I said to my boyfriend please tell him not to call me mom. My boyfriend thinks I’m being selfish though, he said he’s lost his mother and I am now the mother figure to him and it will hurt him more to tell him to stop.

1503,Not the A-hole,"   I was riding the go-karts at a local amusement park. About halfway through, someone crashes, so the operators tell everyone to slow down, and  people do. Except for one. An older looking woman. They keep going and are ignoring the operators. It takes a dozen calls of “stop please” before they come to a stop. 
   No more issues until it was time to park. There’s three lanes of park space and everyone lines up in those. I pulled into the center lane and then a few seconds later I’m thrust forward. I look back and it’s the same person who wouldn’t stop their cart. 
   Afterwards, as they were leaving the ride, I saw they were with family members, so I said,

”Hey just so you know she (the driver) was being unsafe and I don’t think you should let her ride again” 
Around this time I realized the driver wasn’t fully mentally present and possibly had a disability. One of her family members responds with,
 “She has a disability, it’s not her fault” 
so I restate my argument. 
“She caused accidents and wasn’t being safe, her being disabled is a reason not to ride since she can’t follow directions or be a safe driver”. 

They responded with “it’s not her fault, have a nice day”
 and left. I don’t mean any hate towards the disabled woman, and I’m only annoyed with her family. My friend who I was with told me I was wrong for calling her out and asked what the point of me talking to them was. AITA? Thanks",26,180,0.93

1506,Not the A-hole,"Our daughter in grade 1 has got us complaints from her teacher and the school administration about her lunches. We tend to give her healthier stuff, stuff we eat at home anyways but try to make it more ""snack focused"" if that makes sense. A typical lunch might be a few slices from a baguette or some crackers, some cold cuts (prosciutto, salami, etc), olives, sundried tomatoes, etc. Or sometimes we'll give her things like rice pudding, sausage, once we even gave her some steak to bring to school. I'm just listing things we've got complaints over.

The school argues we're being ""abusive"" by giving her foods the other kids won't like, thus eliminating a ""sharing environment"". She hasn't been teased for her lunches and by her own admission likes what we give her. It's the teacher who thinks it's age inappropriate. I personally argue that what we normally give her is little different from a lunchable, what they suggested we give her. Once we gave her some anchovy fillets for crackers, etc and they confiscated her lunch, which prompted a big argument between us and the school.

Yesterday afternoon, I went down to see if she wanted to go the mall with me. I knocked and she answered, looking like she was really upset. My cousin was away with his friend on a fishing trip. She told me that she and my cousin got into an argument, apparently his roommate hit on [EDIT: like as in flirting with ]her while my cousin was away. She told my cousin, who didn’t believe her and accused her of cheating. She was crying and said she misses home.

I asked if I could help. She says she wants to go home but needs a ride to the train station so she can take the train back home. I offered to drive her to the train station, which is 4 hours away. She was very grateful, and asked me not to tell my cousin because she was scared of his reaction. I promised.

after she packed her things, we headed out. I drove her to the station before my cousin came home and noticed she was gone. I returned around midnight. When he asked me what happened, I told him the truth. He got extremely angry and we almost got into a fight. He told me to butt out of his relationships and to mind my own business.

1509,Not the A-hole,"My daughter is 16, and will be 17 in August.  In September, I'm going to move her across the country because she will be starting College at a very good school (she skipped a grade, graduated HS a year earlier than her peers).  

&#x200B;

Last week my daughter graduated HS.  We packed up her room (the essentials) from her Mom's house (divorced) as she wont be going back to live there...we're going straight from my house to her College dorm.  A few days ago, my daughter asks me for a ride to my friend Tony's house because she is getting a tattoo.  I was surprised because she never mentioned this to me before. It was definitely framed to me as if this was already approved, she just wanted to go with me to get it done. We stayed up all night looking at designs, coming up with colorways/shading, and deciding on location.  The next day we went to Tony's and she got a small 2"" x 4"" tattoo above her ankle.  I've known Tony since High School, he's been a tattoo artist for 20 years.  I completely trust everything he's associated with when it comes to tattoos.  He even did MY first tattoo when WE were in High School.  The entire experience was actually a blast for me.  I haven't felt that close to my daughter in years, we really bonded over the whole thing.  To see the guy who gave me my first tatt also give her her first made me shed a tear.  

&#x200B;

Of course the next day she posts pics online, and her Mom flips her shit.  She calls me screaming about how irresponsible I am.  I honestly didn't know her Mom wouldn't be OK with it.  She has tried her hardest to cut me out of all decision-making about Daughter, so the norm is they make the decisions amongst themselves and I'm just sometimes along for the ride (and to pay).  She's also cut me out of multiple milestones in Daughter's life.  Graduations, performances, games, etc.  Until Daughter was old enough to tell me directly, I was never invited so I missed a lot of moments.  

&#x200B;

Obviously Daughter was aware of this, which is why she simply stated to me ""I'm getting a tattoo"" instead of asking me.  I definitely reprimanded her for misleading me, but otherwise, whats the big deal?  Wife has been OK with her having sex since 13, picked her own High School and College, is fine with her moving across the country in a few months to attend and live by herself.  Why are we acting like she is not capable of deciding this on her own?  Would it be better if she gets it done 5 months from now from some shitty kid doing tatts out his dorm room with used needles?

Mom is livid.  She threatened to call the police.  Threatened to pick up Daughter and bring her back to her house.  Tried to make me take her to get the tattoo removed.  None of this is happening.

1510,Not the A-hole,"Hello all. This post does involve a relationship, however I am not seeking advice on the relationship itself; I'd feel the same way if it were anyone else in the same situation.

I went on a two week trip for my work recently. During my trip, I left my teenage son at home; he is old enough to stay in our apartment by himself.

My girlfriend visited with her two children while I was gone, which I have no problem with. However, upon arriving home, I certainly began to have a problem when my son informed me that after being there for a little while, she received a call from a friend at her work, and chose to invite that friend and another friend over to my apartment. The work friend proceeded to bring her own two sons as well. My son was very uncomfortable and wanted to spend time with his own girlfriend, but was not able to because of how many, to him and to me, strangers were in the apartment. He did not have the nerve to speak up about it nor felt comfortable leaving them there, and I do not fault him for that.

I was very dissatisfied to learn that she had taken it upon herself to invite people I have never met into my home. We do not live together and I do not feel that it is appropriate for her to make that choice. She feels that I am significantly overreacting and told me that she wouldn't do it again, but also felt she should not apologize because she had no way of knowing that it would upset me so much.

1511,Not the A-hole,"Hey Reddit, I hope to get some opinions here. I (27f) have a really supportive and diverse group of friends. We all get along and have been able to communicate like adults- or so I thought until today. 

One woman in our group takes very casual ballet lessons as a hobby. She always talks about how it's just for fun and fitness, and about how she doesn't really care to compete or go on to do anything serious. Today she had a recital, and almost all of us went, including another woman who takes ballet very seriously, competes, wins major awards, etc. Through the recital, she kept making whispered comments about the mistakes of the performers- including a group of three year olds bopping around to nursery rhymes. I found it to be in poor taste, but she wasn't really being disturbing and she didn't get snarky with any actual performers, so I let it go.

During our friend's performance, a few of us noticed the serious dancer taking frenzied notes. I asked if the performing friend asked her to do so, and she said no. 

After the performance, we greeted her with a bouquet of flowers (traditional after a performance in our area), and gave her some much deserved accolades. It was evident she worked hard! Immediately, the serious dancer whipped out her notes and started telling the performer all her missteps. I gently told her that our performing friend had a teacher who would correct her if she did anything wrong, but that now wasn't the time. She sulked a bit, but seemed to be okay until we actually presented the flowers. She said ""well, I don't mean to be a bitch, but we reserve those for really GOOD performances."". I was livid. This girl danced her heart out, and she had fun, and this other girl was ruining it for her! I tool the serious dancer aside and told her that her behaviour was completely inappropriate, that hobbyists can't be held to the same standard as competitive dancers, and that she was ruining the good mood for everyone. She stormed off and said that most dancers woud be happy to get free instructions. I told her not to bother coming to our post-ballet BBQ. 

I think I was in the right, and my performing friend was grateful, but her husband and a few other people in the group said I was the asshole, and if someone wants to perform, they open themselves to critisism, and that the performer needed a thicker skin.

1516,Not the A-hole,"I’ve been married to ss’s father for 4 years. We are both from an Indian background so the marriage was an arranged one which meant I had only known him 8ish months prior to our wedding. Obviously this meant that I didn’t really get to integrate into knowing my stepson beforehand or anything. I will say I entered into this marriage freely of my own will, I wasn’t forced or anything. 

We are both born and raised in the US, both fairly successful, and I’d say are more American than Indian. 

I try really hard to get to know my SS, I sit with him as he plays video games, try and take him out to parks, try and be a friend to him first and foremost as I know he didn’t ask for any of the adults in his life to make new bonds. However his behaviors really irritate me and I find I am depressed and resentful of his presence. He is rude to me, rude to his father, calls me a very very disgusting word in hindi that basically equates to ‘prostitute/whore’ and it’s just drained me. He is fat and eats too much food, demands pizza and steak everynight, even though I cook from scratch and prepare food (not even just Indian food, we love Italian so we have that a lot) literally every night also. He’s basically demanding and spoiled because divorces are rare in Indian culture and family try and coddle him because of it. 

I absolutely love love love my husband and I do believe he’s a wonderful man. He disciplines his son when he is rude to me but at the same time I’m starting to feel more and more trapped and like I want to leave this marriage. Recently my husband bought up the topic of kids and I just burst out crying and said to him I don’t want any of my future kids near my stepson.

1518,Asshole,"This happened today and I'm a bit annoyed. My wife and I are heading to LA for the weekend. Our flight leaves tomorrow at 7am so we figure we have to leave the house around 445am to get to the airport in time. I was originally planning on driving to the airport and paying to park in the long term lot. The closer the trip gets, the more annoyed I'm getting about paying to park. I frequently drive friends and family to the airport, any time of the day or night so they can avoid to pay for parking. I finally break down and decide to ask my best friend. This guy (31) has been my best friend for about a decade now. I was the best man in his wedding, his daughter is my God daughter, etc. I've let him borrow a lot of cash and personal property over the years because he isn't as well off as we are. He drives my truck to work almost one a week to pick up stuff (stone, mulch, furniture, etc). I've also taken him and his wife to the airport twice, and picked them up both times. I don't recall the time of day for every time, but I do recall a couple of the trips being very early in the morning on the weekend. And I've never asked for a dollar or anything in return.
Back to the story at hand, I ask if he would mind and he immediately replies ""I'd honestly rather not."" I didn't even answer right away. I was kind of dumbfounded and kind of thought he might be kidding. He finally writes back about an hour later and tells me that on the weekends he usually feeds their baby in the morning so his wife can sleep in a little. Mind you, I never even mentioned what time we needed a ride to the airport. I got a little annoyed with this and asked him when he was going to be done with my mower (I had lent him my old mower about two months ago because his broke down and he is very tight on cash). 6 hours and he has yet to reply.

I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn’t all poor, it’s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn’t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.

Last week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn’t in an unsafe area, it’s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn’t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.

The next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought “the projects” (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn’t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn’t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could’ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother’s, which I’ve done in the past as I know her mom well).

I don't even know about that move, but whatever. The woman's S/O was waiting in line to order. The smallest child (approximately 2) starts letting out blood curtling screams.

Here is where I have a problem, this woman did absolutely nothing to stop the child from screaming. She didn't ask her to be quite, or take her outside, absolutely nothing. Just let her continue screaming at this ungodly pitch. I developed a migraine and I guess I made a grimacing face because the woman then proceeded to tell me to ""get over myself.""

The minute he gets home from work he hops onto his xbox or pc and just wants to play video games until he goes to sleep.

This all started after he got a promotion at work and according to him it's upped his workload drastically and he just doesn't have any energy to do anything else after. Even on his days off he seems to just want to sit at home and game instead of doing anything with me or the kids. I've honestly been super stressed about this all and it's really taking a toll on me.

Last night I reached my breaking point. I wanted to go out for dinner with him when he got home and he said he was too tired. He got right onto his xbox and I pulled the plug on it and told him. He flipped and we started fighting. In the end I told him that either he gets rid of the games or I leave. He called me manipulative and unappreciative of him.  According to him, because i only work part time as a volunteer and have a nanny to help with the kids i have no idea what stress he is under.

However, during the majority of our friendship, she was in a boring sexless relationship. When she broke up with her boyfriend recently, she moved from Boston to Brooklyn, right in the center of Williamsburg. She seems much happier even though she was going out and partying a little too much. 

I hadn't ever seen this side of her but I liked it. It seemed like she was genuinely enjoying her life now. Great. I hadn't seen her in almost 6 months so I went to Brooklyn last weekend to go out with her. We drank, danced, had a grand time. But, she drank too much. She was so drunk that when we walked into the last bar, she fell and the bartender wouldn't serve her. 

It was around 3AM now and she met this dude, started making out, and told me she wanted to take him back. Ok whatever, my drunk logic was ""well, she wants to fuck so I'm not going to be a cockblock. This is the new Mary. Let her do her thing"". The guy looked harmless enough so, I walked them a few blocks back to her apartment, made sure they got inside, gave him a condom I had in my wallet, and got a car home.

A few days ago, I told my (slightly conservative) friends about this night and they are PISSED. They don't think I should have allowed her to go home with a random guy, when she was that drunk.

I have 8:30 classes which require me to get up around 5:00 every day to shower, commute etc. I am in a very intensive program which requires long hours of studying. Sometimes all I do is get home, eat, study, repeat.

My sister is 10, but still very young for her age. She gets frightened easily and reminds me more of a 6 year old than 10 year old. Very frequently she wakes up scared of monsters or bad dreams and wants to come cuddle in my bed until she falls asleep.

This has been going on for months and it is heavily affecting my school work. I am often sleep deprived and unable to listen in my classes. I asked my parents to do something about it and they simply said that I should have some compassion for my younger sister and they used to do the same for me when I was little.

I told my sister that she cannot wake me up in the middle of the night anymore because it is affecting my sleep. I told her I would read her a book to bed if she wanted me to comfort her, but she could no longer wake me up.

After reading her a story, I locked my door so she could no longer come in. She sat outside my door crying hysterically, waking the whole house up. My parents yelled at me, calling me an asshole and a terrible brother, when in reality I wasn’t trying to be rude. I am sleep deprived and my studied are suffering, but AITA for not being more understanding? 

TLDR locks sister out of room in order to get better sleep, upsets parents

I see her 3 to 5 times per year. But never speak to her. She is just there. Christmas and thanksgiving which she hosts in her Mcmansion and ruins by being fucked up on pills or booze every year. Or my sons or niece and nephews birthday. Which she may more may not attend.

20 years ago. She left me and my sister and my brother to fend for ourselves. I was 13 she was 12 and he was 5. I stole food to feed us. I walked to the library to use the pay phone to talk to my middle school crush. I ended up selling drugs for money. I did not finish school.

Fast forward to today. She has a rare form of bone cancer. She is dying. She has been getting chemo for months, she lost all her weight and she is sick.

1532,Not the A-hole,"Okey Reddit,  

Obligatory long time lurker,  first time poster nonsense.  English is my first language and I am on mobile,  but any mistakes are probably just because I try to type faster than my little hamster brain can go.  Feel free to poke fun and correct me gramaticals,  I'll probably laugh with you. 😅

So,  backstory (quick I promise): I am a mom of 2 girls one elementary and one middle school aged. I've always been rather crafty and I have a bad habit of picking up strays. My daughter (12 hens forth known as DD) had a 70's bash for a pep rally and asked me if I would make her a ""hippie shirt"". Any excuse to craft! So we tie dyed her shirt,  I broke out my Cricut and made her a glitter vinyl iron on that said groovy in a cute font and had her schools name and the year on the back.  (I do this for a living so I'm pretty dang good at it and they look professional.  Because I AM professional.) 

DD comes home and says everyone LOVED her shirt,  but one of her friends (DF for Daughter's Friend)  was really sad and said she wished her mom would do things like that for her.  Well,  dang it,  right in the feels.  So I tell DD to ask DF what she would want on a shirt.  Typically I charge $25 for custom shirts (vinyl is NOT cheap),  but I feel for this kid. 

DD comes to me with this text list rivaling the best r/choosingbeggar I have ever seen.  DF wants this shirt custom tie dyed,  a huge design with 8 different colored vinyl plus glitter accent vinyl.  Oh and she wants it in 3 days for their Friday bash. 

I told my daughter there is just no way I'm doing all that for free.  DD understands and tells the girl she has to pick a solid shirt color and we will put the schools name and year along with DF's name.

DF and DF's Mom come unglued saying how I got this girls hopes up for something nice and I shouldn't make offers I'm not willing to follow through on. I'm so in shock I just say forget it,  I'm not making anything! 

Other parents in the friend group are split,  some say I should still make the simple shirt for the kid,  others say I didn't do anything wrong and this kid asked for way too much. DD (luckily) agrees that DF went overboard and was a brat about the whole situation. 


So,  AITA for resetting her expectations on a free custom shirt and then saying no when attacked about that?




**Edit** ok,  so I've read all of your posts and I have to say,  some of them stung a bit,  BUT.  I needed that brutal ""tough love"" So,  I have decided to make this girl a shirt exactly like DD's shirt.  I mean...  That's probably the most reasonable thing I can do.  I get where everyone is coming from in managing expectations.  Perhaps I was a bit rough in cutting the girl off due to the moms actions.  This was definitely a learning experience for me,  hopefully DF can take from this and learn the grace her mother has not shown.  

Thank you all for your comments,  the supportive,  the critical,  and the funny! You have truly helped me find the middle ground and I heart you all! 

Ps,  I'll try update with a pic of daughters shirt,  I'm not sure I know how to do that mobile lmao

So I've decided to stop dating women with children, I am 24 years old so I don't think that's unreasonable, but I acknowledge it slims the pickings. 

I announced this to my friend group, all of whom are either in serious relationships (with kids) or married (with kids), and they all called me a douche for being petty. 

I have dated two different women with children, and I got attached to the kids in a way that I never thought was even possible for myself (my experience with stepparents runs more along the lines of wicked stepmothers)


The first one cheated and the second one left me with no real explanation other than ""It's not you it's me.""

The first one sucked but I got over it, even though i felt like I lost my child. (Me and the gf were losing interest in eachother at this point, she was just turning into a vile person.) The second one, I turned into a mess because I feel like I lost my whole family and it absolutely kills me. I went back to drinking briefly after, I did manage to pull my head out of my ass before it got out of hand, thankfully.

She is the first woman I've ever actually dropped my walls for and let in, but I feel like she just used me at this point. Losing the kids is probably the worst thing because I cared for them when they were sick, taught them colors, stars, I showed them pokemon (which they loved), I taught the older one to count to 10, I potty trained them, we would fistbump and do the rocket power woogity shake thing and it was awesome. Now it's all gone, as if nothing ever happened.

 I don't want to put myself through that again. I honestly can't take getting close to someone and their kids only to have them walk out of my life again and I have no say in the matter, so I refuse to date women with children now because of that.",258,535,0.92

Not in a bratty ""I hate you because you didn't let me get McDonalds"" way, but a more subtle way. It's been like this since the beginning. His first word was ""mommy"", and it took him another year to say ""daddy"". When mom comes home from work, it's always ""I missed you so much! How was your day! I saved you some crackers!"", but when I come home from work, my son doesn't bother even coming down from his room to greet me. If I want to know ANYTHING about my sons life outside of home, I have to learn it through my wife. I've tried everything to get him to like me. I took time off of work to spend more time with him, buy him gifts, etc, but he acts like I'm a stepfather trying to force my way into his life. My wife knows how I feel, but aways tells me that I'm reading too much into it, and that he's just a ""mommy's boy"".

I've had to deal with this for 9 years, and it's starting to get to me. It just makes me sad that my own son doesn't love me as much as his mom. I can count on two hands the number of times he's hugged or kissed me, which should say a lot. Two weeks ago, I told my wife I wanted to have another child. She agreed immediately and actually seemed really excited about it, until I said I wanted a child that actually loved me. She did the whole shtick of ""Oh, thats not true, he's just a mommy's boy."", and laughed it off. I laughed with her, too, but the next day she seemed really distant. She seemed uncomfortable around me and spent the day avoiding me. I think she might be reconsidering having another kid.

I get home after work, walk into my sons room, and see my son with a safety pin through his damn eyebrow. I freaked out thinking it was some freak accident, and they told me that no, they decided to pierce his eyebrow, and since they didn’t have a ring, they just left the safety pin in.

I can’t say I was angry, just dumbfounded at how stupid they were being. I pointed at my son and said “dumbass 1, we are getting that thing out of your eyebrow right now.” And I pointed at his friend and said “dumbass 2, get your ass home, you’re grounded from my house until the end of the weekend.”

&#x200B;

I'm seventeen, the birthday in question is my eighteenth birthday.

&#x200B;

My place of employment is understaffed, and it is hard to get time off work without giving ample notice.

&#x200B;

A few months ago my girlfriend had asked if I wanted to go camping with her and her friends on my birthday weekend. I was really excited so I told her sure, let me just request the time off.

&#x200B;

I requested the time off and it was approved! We began to put the plans together. Growing up my mom has always put her foot down on plans of this nature, so I was glad that since I would be 18, I'd finally be able to do what I wish.

&#x200B;

So instead of ""asking"" her like I usually have to, I more or less just told her that we had been making these plans for a while, I will have graduated the week before, and since I had taken the time off work, I thought going on this trip would be allowed.

&#x200B;

Nota, nope.

&#x200B;

Turns out my birthday is also the day of my little sister's graduation. Not high school, not college, middle school. I hated my middle school graduation, and being forced to sit in the sun for 5 hours for a middle school credit reel doesn't sound very appealing for my 18th birthday.  The angle my mom uses is that family will be in town, but they will all be in town the week before for my graduation, so I don't know why I need to attend to this, as long as I acknowledge her accomplishments at a big dinner or something.

&#x200B;

EDIT MORE INFO: I go to a tiny school, and my graduation will be no longer than an hour, hers will be an all day affair. 

&#x200B;

We won't be able to get more time off work until the end of summer, and I'd feel uncomfortable for my girlfriend to go without me, but I don't want to ruin her plans too.

1540,Not the A-hole,"Using a throwaway since money is involved here. Lots of background and doing my best to keep it under 3000 words. 

I was born in South Africa but emigrated when I was just a few months old so I am totally American. I come from a family of full on Apartheid supporters and when it ended, basically everyone bailed for America. My parents and aunts and uncles eventually were educated and came around but my grandparents, while being very sweet and loving to me, were true believers in what apartheid stood for. They made a small fortune in South Africa by literally investing and owning businesses in the apartheid era. To be totally fair, they also made a ton of money in the US, but still the money because they were white and well connected in South Africa. 

My grandmother died recently. She lived pretty lavishly up until the day she died in a very exclusive retirement home in SoCal so I figured there wouldn't be any money left and maybe I'd get some family heirlooms. My head about popped off when I saw the number me and my cousin will split (it's about $725,000 each). Money that will literally change my life. 

My parents business failed so I wasn't nearly as well off as my cousin. She's also now married, lives in Rancho Santa Fe (google it if you aren't familiar) and will be just fine without this money. She claims she's going to donate 100% of it to charities in South Africa. She is seriously chiding me that *if* I plan on keeping it, then I am taking advantage of blood money built on racism. 

I have student loans I could pay off, I could actually have a down payment on a house, I could invest, I mean...I know where this money came from but it could literally mean my life would be better. I understand where it came from but I also can't possibly imagine giving it away. I have no idea what charities are like in South Africa and family friends we have that still live there say that corruption has taken over everything from government to charities and I'm better off just keeping it. 

I understand my cousins point but man is it hard to say goodbye to that much money that will change my life.",3802,19013,0.9

1542,Not the A-hole,"We've just entered the planning stages of our wedding, and my lovely fiancee thinks I'm an asshole for suggesting we get a bouncer of sorts, for the reception. I want to hire a security person to admit people who are on the list of guests who have RSVP'd, and turn away anyone who isn't on the list. I can see how I might be an asshole, but hear me out.

We plan to invite about 60 people, but we will only have plates for those who RSVP (probably about 40)- so I do not want to risk somebody coming in and complaining about not having a plate or a seat at a table if they do not RSVP. Additionally, there will be other favors customized for each guest, so it would be embarrassing to have someone go home empty handed and pouty. This is, however, the most superficial of reasons as to why I want a bouncer.

A lot of our friends have children, and the reception is going to have an open bar, most likely. We are not inviting any children, but at weddings in the past, we've seen those friends bring their children even when they did not have an invitation that included their kids. I do not want the liability of children around alcohol- nor do I want the distraction at my event. I want my friends, not their kids, to celebrate with me. I have a few younger cousins who we're conscripting into being babysitters for out of town friends with kids who want to attend but need someone to watch their children, so this shouldn't be an issue.

I have a few members of my extended family that are, to put it kindly, a bit troublesome. And by a bit troublesome, I mean some of them are addicts of every kind, they've been to jail for any crime you can think of, and they're generally just horrid people. And they believe they are invited to every family event, regardless of anything. There is no way to convince them they are not invited, they will show up anyways. I want to make sure that they cannot crash the party, because I do not want to risk illegal drugs or violence happening on the dance floor at what is supposed to be the happiest day of our lives. And yes, if they show up, which they will (they've shown up to other weddings in my family they weren't invited to), there will be drugs and violence. It's not an if, it's a when.

Finally- In the past, I have suffered abuse, and bullying, from exes, from my childhood classmates, from clients at work, etc. A fair number of them are actually dangerous, and I'm afraid of them showing up. For my safety, and my SO's, I don't want any potential of them arriving and destroying the day. \[Edit: The abuse stems from me being targeted for my disability as a child, unhealthy relationships, and your standard wedding horror stories, as I run a wedding venue. Not from me being an abusive person myself, as some seem to assume.\]

1550,No A-holes here,"My friend introduced me to Reddit, and I really need an outside perspective on this. First post ever so please be gentle.

I’m 26 and my sister is 15. Our parents died in a car crash 4 years ago, and since then, I have been her legal guardian. It’s been tough; I went from a single man, freshly graduated, great job (for a single person’s income), and complete freedom to having to take care of a grieving child while I was grieving myself. I make enough for us to get by, but not much more.

My sister came crying to me today. She admitted that she’s pregnant. She said they didn’t use birth control but “he pulled out”. Apparently, it’s some kid in his class. I comforted her, told it was going to be okay, and that we’d get through this. Then she dropped a bomb on me: she wants to keep it. She wants to raise and nurture it and give them the childhood she never had.

I told her she can’t be serious. She’s way too young to care for a child; hell, she’s too young to get a job in most places. That if she keeps the child, I’M the one who will be bearing that responsibility. Sure, she can make minimum wage, but at least where we live, it’s simply not enough to get by, and I’m simply not in the place in my life where I can afford to take care of another child.

She told me that she doesn’t expect me to be the parent and I told her that it didn’t matter what she “expected”; the bottom line is that as her legal guardian, I’m the one who will be responsible for the child, by law, until she turns 18. That I’m the one who’d be awaken to a 3-month-old throwing a tantrum at 3 AM regardless of what she expects. That I’m the one who’s going to have to babysit when she works/goes to school because there’d be absolutely no way she can afford an external babysitter.

She then got angry and said “well I’m keeping it, whether you like it or not.” I told her she very well can make this choice, but then I'd have to make my own choice, and that I will no longer be her guardian. I’d give her up to our grandparents (they’re VERY strict Christian, and would have no problem forcing her to give her kid up for adoption, then making her life a living hell for premarital sex. It’s the reason she begged to live with me over them; they’re not great people).

She’s been distraught, telling me I’m a horrible person and that she hates me for trying to force her give away the one thing she loves the most. I tried comforting her; I know she’s going through a fuck ton, but I just can’t raise another child. My life was already put on halt when my parents died, and another halt when I had to take care of my sister. I just can’t afford, financially or emotionally, to take care of another kid I didn’t ask for. I just can’t. And I don’t want to either.

Am I being unreasonable to want her to NOT keep the baby, and sending her off to her grandparents if she chooses to?

EDIT: Just wanted to specify that my grandparents are NOT good people. They're not physically abusive, but they scream a lot if they don't get their way, they're very old-school, they much believe in spankings if a child is disobedient, my sister would likely be forced to do all the cooking/cleaning because our grandmother is old and they both have the sexist mentality that women belong in the kitchen. So she's essentially choosing between giving up her kid or living with her grandparents (who would force her to give up her kid). Just wanted to reiterate because if they were good people, I would have no problem making this choice. But they're not.

1551,Not the A-hole,"My (f26) mum died of cancer when I was 15. For the most part, I have come to terms with it, but occasionally my grief does rear its ugly head.

I was on my way home from work when I noticed some protesters outside of the Cancer Research Charity Shop, calling for a boycott because of animal testing. They were holding up some pretty graphic signs (mutilated rabbits etc) and handing out leaflets. The moment I clocked this I started to get angry about it (for obvious reasons)

2 people tried to hand me leaflets as I walked by, when offered the first one I said ""No thank you"" and made a point of not making eye contact as I was obviously angry, but I am a believer in free speech so whatever.

The second guy saw this exchange, and tried to hand me a leaflet. I said ""Leave me alone"". I was possibly a bit aggressive about the way I said this as I was a bit emotional and I'm not a big fan of interacting with strangers. The guy then says (pretty loudly, I might add) ""She obviously doesn't give a shit about animals"". He was clearly trying to draw attention to me.

I'm not an angry person by nature, I tend to avoid confrontation, but I honestly saw red. I turned around, and said to him that I love animals, but I would personally slaughter a thousand fluffy bunny rabbits if it would bring my mum back. I called him an insensitive piece of shit and told him to do something more constructive with his time.

His fellow protesters started shouting things at me but I just walked away cause I couldn't be bothered to argue with these people.

Now that I'm home, I'm starting to think that maybe I was a bit overzealous...

1553,Asshole,"So I’m seeing a guy, who I really like. A couple years back I had unprotected sex and in return got the herpes virus. I have learnt my lesson and will never have unprotected sex ever again, unless I’m dating someone who’s fully aware of the situation. I would also never ever have sex with someone unless they knew about it. Anyways, back to this guy I’m seeing right now. Things have been going really well, and I see serious potential with him. My plan is to not tell him until the time comes where I sense sex is about to happen. The way I see it, I’d like to continue getting closer to him before I say it. I think that if I told people too soon, I wouldn’t really be getting any opportunities to become romantically close with anyone. They would opt out before a deeper connection has formed. My friend says I’m that I’m just luring him in and that I should be upfront and honest with him from the start. She says he should know what he’s getting himself into. But this is also something really personal, and I wouldn’t want to tell this to someone unless I really trust them. 

So am I the asshole for waiting until the last minute to share this with him?

Edit: I don’t mean until clothes are coming off, just when I notice we’re taking a step in intimacy which could potentially lead to sex

Edit: just want to say thank you everyone for the honesty. I’ve been going over and over in my head about how I’m going to tell him and I gotta say I’m a nervous wreck about it. However, I understand that the sooner the better. It’s a tough pill to swallow. I headed over to another subreddit for advice on the matter because to do this the right way is very important to me.

1554,Not the A-hole,"My brother is a student in India in 8th grade. He isn't a terrible student,  but when it comes to english, he is for sure below average. 

His vocabulary isn't any better than a 4th grader,  and he sometimes has issue reading texts because he is unable to pronounce the words correctly (he is not dyslexic) 

Every year students are assigned a holiday homework for each subject which the kids need to do over the summer break and hand it in. For english they have a basic analytical+comprehension text,  article writing and letter writing. 

About 2 years ago,  he asked my dad to buy him complete edition of famous five books(all 21 or something). To this date he has read only 2.
 
I really want him to improve his english so I basically told him that he needs to read 1 book to 'earn' 2 hours of Netflix which he uses to watch TV shows. 

Here's the thing.  He's been whining how it's unfair that he needs to read a whole book for just 2 hours of Netflix. The famous five books are for the 8+ ages and he's 13. I don't think he should have an issue finishing a book in less than 4-5 hours. 

I really feel bad that he feels bad,  but I feel like I need to have a heart of stone in this matter or else he will have severe issues in his life.

1555,Not the A-hole,"I have been married for 25 years. We have a son (19) and daughter (17). When our children were born we lived three blocks from my MIL. She’s an extremely self absorbed person. She has never had any interest in my husband (her son) or my children ( her grandchildren). 

When DD was born, I asked her to keep DS while I was in the hospital giving birth. She let him stay at her house, but she hired a baby sitter to take care of him. That’s the only time DS has ever stayed with her in his entire life. DD has never stayed with her, not once. When DD was only two weeks old, DH got shingles. The doctor said it was dangerous for a newborn to be exposed to shingles. I had to pack up DS and DD and leave our home and leave my sick husband by himself. I went to MILs house, explained the situation, and asked for her help. She refused to help us. After my husband got better, she laughed at me and rubbed my nose in the fact that I asked for help and didn’t get it.  We told her how hurt we were by the way she treated us, but she refused to acknowledge our feelings and refused to apologize. Needless to say, I never asked for her help again. 

She moved out of our area a couple of years later, which was a relief for me. Since then, she has completely ignored us other than Christmas cards for the kids with a check inside and late birthday cards for the kids. That’s how it’s been for the last 15 years. 

Well, she recently moved back to our area. She didn’t even tell us she was moving. My husband got a text from his sister telling him when and where to be to help with moving day. That was the only communication. 

Out of the blue, MIL started showing up at my DDs school events, uninvited. You have to realize, she’s a stranger to DD. My DD is shy and introverted. She’s the kind of person that you have to win her trust. It creeped DD out when MIL started showing up at her events. It made her nervous and self conscious. I didn’t think it was fair for her to just show up after all this time and make DD uncomfortable. 

So........I explained to MIL that my children had never in their life had a support system other than me and DH. I told her that she was making DD uncomfortable and that she shouldn’t just show up at events without an invitation.

1557,Not the A-hole,"**TL;DR-** Grown man followed me out of a pizza place for not tipping, after I came in to pick up my pizzas.

For reference, I'm a big fan of tipping for a service well done. I tip 20-25% to ubers, servers, delivery drivers, etc, and have worked in the service industry. 

The other night, I ordered four pizzas from a local chain down the road. For whatever reason, they weren't delivering that day. No biggie. So, I called an uber to go pick up my pizza, because we had been drinking (not a lot at this point, but enough that I didnt feel comfortable operating a vehicle). It was like a ten minute trip there, and a ten minute trip back. $15 total for the uber. 

I get there, pick up my $90 worth of pizza, pay, and walk out to get back into the Uber. I *did not tip.* As I was getting into the Uber, the guy who made the zas chased me out of the store, and with arms spread wide, yells ""really!?"" I just sort of stared at him in shock for a moment, before shrugging and saying ""yeah,"" and getting into the uber as his coworker pulled him back into the store, waving me away. Went home, continued on with out night. 

Thing is, the more I think about it, the more heated I get. Why on earth would I tip someone who made my food, when that is the express purpose of their business? You don't tip the chef at restaurants, or the cook when you order delivery, or the person who rang you up at the grocery store. You tip the person who provided the service that went the extra mile. There was no extra mile here. I ordered pizzas. He made pizzas. I came to get them. He didnt deliver my food, or serve me my food, nor did I do like a tasting in the store to see how it tasted. I paid for a product, and picked up what I paid for. No service provided.

My friends are pretty evenly split between that I should have just tipped him, and that in no way was I socially obligated to tip him. 

Am I being an asshole here? WIBTA if I went and spoke with him or wrote to corporate?

Anyways, happy Friday, sorry if this comes off as a validation post.

**Edit:** Wow, this blew up. Unfortunately, I'm not gonna be able to respond to everyone. Thanks to everyone for responding!

**Edit 2:** Guys, sorry I thought this was clear by me saying it was a pizza place, but this was not a restaurant with servers and stuff. Think like Dominos with 3 tables. There were no servers to ""pool"" tips. It was straight up like McDonalds pizza place.

**Edit 3:** Holy hell. Guys, I was not wasted or even drunk. I just like being responsible when drinking anything. We had a very brief, and polite interaction. Sure, theres a chance that I somehow unwittingly did something rude, but I'm telling you (in a biased, subjective way) that it's extremely unlikely. 

**Edit 4:** It was **NOT** a sitdown restaurant, and no servers were ""pooling"" tips. There were no servers. Think Dominos or Little Caesars. Also, **he was absolutely making minimum wage.** No delivery and no servers = illegal to not pay him minimum wage. I'm not gonna respond to comments anymore of people saying that he probably makes $2.13 an hour. No. He doesnt. 

**Edit 5 - TAKEAWAYS:**

I'm **not** going to complain about him specifically because I dont know who depends on his paycheck. That was a great point. I **am** going to write corporate and tell them what happened using non specifics when it comes to the employee. 

For future reference, it seems that most people in the tipping camp believe that 10% is appropriate for take out, which seems reasonable. That is my new rule of thumb. 

Thank you to everyone who took time out if their day to weigh in, especially the people who said YTA and helped me to think more critically. 

Everyone enjoy your za. Peace.",910,2403,0.95
1558,Not the A-hole,"I went tubing on a river yesterday with some friends. I had brought my waterproof phone bag along to keep my belongings in. I saw a girl (who I had just met that day) trying to think of ways to keep her phone safe since she didn’t have any waterproof containers so I offered to let her share mine. She has an iPhone7+, which is waterproof to an extent. I asked her if her phone had ever been damaged just in case, as if a phone is damaged/repaired, it can reduce the water resistance and I told her that I would not trust it. She said no. 

An hour into the trip, i checked our phones and it turned out that the bag failed and had filled with water. She saw this and got worried but decided to keep it in the bag anyway because it was probably better than nothing. Both of our phones still worked at this point. 

After the trip, her phone wouldn’t turn on but mine was completely fine, as mine has never been damaged in any way. It was at this point she decided to inform me that her phone had been cracked and she had the screen replaced, which can compromise the water resistance, as I said earlier.  

Today, the day after, she asked me to pay for a new phone, to which I told her no, but offered to let her use my old iPhone 7 as a replacement until she can get a new one for herself. 

Am I the asshole for not paying for a new phone since it was my bag?? Or did I do my due diligence and I’m in the clear?

Tl;dr: Friend shared water proof phone bag. Bag failed; water got in. Her phone is ruined, mine is not. Didn’t tell me her phone was damaged even though I asked. She wants me to pay for a new phone. I said no.",40,47,0.88

1560,Not the A-hole,"Hi Reddit. I'm posting on a throwaway since I'm active on a wedding board and don't want to bring  this there until I've made a final decision.

I'm 28 and getting married later this year. My brother (4 years older than me) and I grew up with extremely religious, conservative Christian parents. Church Wednesday and Sunday, family Bible study almost every night, Christian schools and camps - the whole nine. My brother is gay and has known since he was a young child. It tears me up to think of what our homophobic environments - which encompassed home, church, school and social lives - must have been like for him. I'm no longer religious, and my brother came out to my parents when he was 19, away at college. It didn't go well - they didn't speak for years, but got back onto pretty warm and loving, terms, but didn't really discuss his sexuality. 

My brother got married 3 years ago (to a man, obviously, lol). My parents flat out refused to go or refused to even hear of anything to do with the ceremony or their relationship. My brother was heartbroken and it again took a hugely negative toll on their relationship. It strained mine with them as well, but my grandmother is ill and lives with them. We're very close so not seeing them when I visit her is impossible. My brother sees them for the same reason but it's mutually strained. My mom is 100% all into my wedding stuff, constantly forwarding me articles and photos.

Anyway, I truly don't want to invite them to the ceremony. My brother and his husband are groomsmen, and I know it'll break his heart all over again. I brought this up to him and he cried out of gratefulness at the fact that I don't want to hurt him by having them there all excited and socializing with everyone when they refused to do that for him. But I've brought this up to some close friends and family members, and have gotten a very 50/50 response on it. If I don't invite them, my grandmother is moving into assisted living soon so I'll still be able to see her. I truly don't want to hurt my brother.

Thoughts - Am I (or Would I Be, I guess) The Asshole for not inviting them?",110,395,0.97
1561,,"For some background, I've been 95% vegetarian for the last 3 years, and rarely eat dairy (meat only on special occasions) I was raised in an omni home. My spouse is vegan, and was raised in a vegetarian home. Our household diet was 98% vegan, with eggs and butter for me. 

We have one child, who we had planned to raise vegan. As it turns out, our child is allergic to soy and has oral allergy syndrome. This means that if she eats soy, she could die, and if she eats any other food that doesn't agree with her, she'll be puking within the hour. 

I'll admit that we have anxiety, so keeping the house soy free is a major source of anxiety. We can't rely on any kind of mock meats, including those that claim to be soy free because the risk of cross contamination is too high. Both my spouse and I work full-time, so making our own isn't an option. 

These issues have made her terrified of eating a n y t h i n g. Even if we say it's safe, she's still hesitant to eat it. It's also very hard to find vegan meals that don't set off either a medical issue or just don't work for a toddler.

She was having panic attacks at mealtimes and was losing so much weight that it was becoming dire. After urgent, deep discussions, we had to relent and start giving eggs and dairy. This didn't work fast enough and we were about to be reported to CPS, so we started giving her poultry and fish, which is now a regular part of her diet. I also started eating them around her as well to normalise it. She's now on the growth chart and is healthy.

Our extended family and friends are now judging us, and I'm over it. Our child was being raised to have severe food issues, and was on her way to being in the eating disorder ward before she reached kindergarten. Neither my spouse or I are willing to sacrifice our child for the animals, and I honestly don't regret not ""trying harder"". They say we're raising her to ""eat corpses"" and ""feel entitled to use other species as she wants"".

I don't disagree, and it is a hard question. Since she's already grown up with the animal rights sentiments, we've started telling her that these animals wanted to be food. I don't like that, but we had to get her to eat and a lot of plant foods just aren't safe for her like animal products are. We make sure she gets plenty of fiber and safe fruits and veggies, but for medical and mental health reasons, she has to be an omnivore.

I've learned that a plant based diet isn't for everyone like I once thought. Hopefully when she's older, she'll be able to understand things and approach a more plant based diet in a rational way, but that isn't an option right now. Am I wrong here?


Edit: here's the full list of foods that are triggering:

* Beans (mostly psychological as she remembers eating a (soy)bean and then starting to die)
* peaches
* tomatoes (unless cooked)
* oranges
* melon
* Broccoli (unless cooked)
* Bell pepper
* Spinach (general toddler thing)
* Soy
* Any mock meat",586,987,0.88

1564,No A-holes here,"This happened a while back. I was planning on having lunch with an old friend of mine when she asked if she could bring a friend.I was totally ok with it since I'm always excited to meet new people. She arrives and my friend has to leave due to an unexpected family issue (she wasn't playing matchmaker, it was a real problem) for about 2/3 hours. The mutual friend and I have a great time and get to know each other and we exchange numbers in order to go out sometimes as friends

Fast forward no less than 5/6 months when I get a notification on my phone from that mutual friend asking if I was free that weekend to go out. I was taken aback since we hadn't talked in forever but I agreed.

We get there and after some small talk she ""confesses"" that she wanted to go get dinner with me because I'm a great listener and seem like a level headed person.This wasn't the first time I heard that, but I was still wondering what she had to tell basically a random stranger to whom she talked to once.

Then she goes off : apparently she hadn't contacted me in months because her bf did not allow her to make new friends, especially dudes. They were on a break now which is why she, and I quote, ""Had the nerve to go out alone with a boy"". I was shocked.She goes on to say he constantly hurt her physically, emotionally toyed with her, threatened her,broke things in her home, would not let her go out, etc. I explained how she was in a VERY dangerous relationship and that she did the right thing by leaving him.

Then she said in very sad tone ""Doesn't matter , I love him and we'll be back together soon"".Her situation was deplorable: she knew what kind of a relationship she had, however she was convinced by him that he was all she needed and ever will deserve. I tried talking her into going to the police , or her family. She bluntly refused and told me she just wanted to talk to someone, that being me, but not doing anything about it.

I didn't personally knew the guy, I had buddies who did.I asked her if she was ok with me talking to him about all of this to which she firmly said ""no"". She told me how he has HUGE anger management issues and that he'd beat me. First of all, it wouldn't have got to that, and second, even if it did and I had to defend myself I'd have no problems (The guy was an absolute joke). After a bit more of her telling me what an ass the guy was, telling me about his threats of hurting her if she didn't act as he wanted, we both went home. I tried contacting her to see how she was doing after about 1 week and I received a text telling me they're back together and that she HAS to block me. I contemplated talking to the guy but I figured all of that'd go back straight to her and so decided I had no way of doing anything, after all, we were all adults and I had no real connection to any of them.

1576,Not the A-hole,"This is basically what the title says. It was my sister's birthday recently, and for it she had a potluck style dinner where everyone brought a dish and people just picked at stuff they liked. Myself, my partner, my sister and my brother in law all really love spicy food, and I know a number of her friends do too, so I made ghost chili buffalo wings and took them along. I knew there were gonna be kids at this party, but my sister made signs to put up next to each dish saying what they were, so everybody would know what was what. I made sure she added a warning on the sign for the wings, just to make extra sure that people were aware of how spicy they are. However, in the hustle and bustle of people going to the food table, I guess  some of the signs got knocked over/off the table and things got a bit confused. 

There were kids at this party, namely younger cousins and some of my sister's friends' children. At one point, after the sign for my wings has been knocked down, three of the younger cousins (all under age 12, youngest was 5) grabbed some and tucked in. Immediately, they began complaining that it was too spicy, with the 5 year old fully screaming and crying in pain. She ended up having to go to the hospital as she was puking a lot, and it turned out her stomach lining had been damaged by the spice.

1580,No A-holes here,"I've known my partner since we were 7, though we didn't start dating until college.

&#x200B;

He's got a lot of baggage: depression, insomnia, abandonment issues, etc. I love this guy, but he's got a lot of ""down"" days. Little things set him off because he puts so much pressure on himself to make his friendships work. He doesn't want to have to experience a major schism in his friend group like he has in the past; so, he thinks that by organizing events and being more vital to the social network of the group, he won't lose them. It's very stressful and leaves him incredibly sensitive when plans fall through.

&#x200B;

My general response has always been to listen and help him find solutions. He's expressed an interest in therapy and medication in the past, but he always cites money as an issue. I've tried to share resources with him for state-sponsored healthcare and low-cost mental health support, but he keeps brushing it off as ""just a mood.""

&#x200B;

The moods do pass, but while he's in the middle of one, even he will openly admit that they come too frequently and too intensely before resorting to self-blame and denial as it fades.

&#x200B;

Things are going well for us, and while nothing has been explicitly said yet, I can sense based on the flow of conversation that we've both got finding a house or apartment together on the mind. Thing is, I suspect that he finds this option appealing largely for the opportunity to separate more cleanly from his friends and family and the issues that created the fear of abandonment. I do think a clean break could be good for him, and I do want the chance to advance our relationship just a little further. However, at least from my own experience, you take yourself with you wherever you go, and I'm worried that if we do move in together that he'll be losing a whole support network (albeit a flimsy and sometimes toxic one) with not enough to replace it soon enough.

&#x200B;

So, if the conversation about moving in together comes up, I would like to present therapy as a stipulation on the agreement. I want him to seek professional help for everything he's been through and everything going on inside him. I want our relationship to be healthy and stable, and I personally feel that this means taking care of ourselves both mentally and physically.

So, WIBTA for making therapy a condition of us moving in together?",22,44,0.88
1581,Not the A-hole,"Ok so first of all I hate that I feel like I have to throw that card out it’s very immature because my whole life I’ve had to deal with it, 
He married a prositute  from Cuba and brought her over here many years ago ever since she has tryd to make my life a living night mare and he knows that. 

So I told him she wasn’t invited to my baby shower because there’s no solid reason for her to be there. on top of that she just got done last month calling me and my brother parasites etc etc when we showed her nothing but respect. 

Now she pulled the whole it’s him or me card on my father and my sisters supposably if they go to the baby shower they’ll be disowned. They are 14 and 17. 

She has pulled this card before on him with his mother,  him and his brother, him and his best friend,  him and many people, like his sisters etc and he hasn’t spoken to them in over 8 years.

 they just started talking because one of my cousins passed away and it seemed like a right time to talk to the family again for him. 

Now I want him to know if he doesn’t show up to the baby shower that he won’t get to meet his grand daughter, because I don’t want this game being played either you’ll be there for her from the beginning or just don’t be there at all. It’s either your grand daughter or your wife. All I’m asking is to make an appearance that’s it. Let me know thanks",30,30,0.85

1587,Not the A-hole,"Okay, I know that needs some explanation. My twin brother and I have been raised by our grandparents (Mother's parents) and our mom has been in and out of our lives the whole time. She is a felon, thief, addict, has no job, sells drugs, and uses the government assistance to live.

She is the main reason my twin brother and I became addicted to opiate pain killers. We have fought hard and are recovered from that. Within the last month though, my brother started using meth. Of course, after he told us that he was using, our mother let it be known that she uses it as well. During a time where I was weak and being a fucking cry baby, I used my circumstances as an excuse to try it. I have hated myself since because of the hold it has on me.

My best friend let me stay with him for a whole week, being a supportive friend. He held me when I was upset, gave me advice, and went above and beyond anything my family has ever done in regards to emotional support. It did put a strain on our relationship, and when we fought and I went back home, can you guess what was right there in front of me waiting to make everything worse? Yeah, my brother and The Devil himself.

I've made it abundantly clear I don't want to be around it or brought in to their drama concerning it. My brother's mental health is declining at a rate that is scaring me to death. His common sense is gone, he is so fucking angry all the time, and the only time he is happy is when he has a pipe and a lighter in his hand. When there isn't any, everybody is against him and a liar. He constantly makes threats and shows violent tendencies.

I know that right now I could call the police and have them go where my mother and brother are, and they would go to jail for possession. My brother doesn't have a criminal record like my mom does, and the charge would ruin the future he has planned for (teaching). But this other shit is going to ensure that he doesn't have a future to ruin because he's going to end up dead.

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm getting myself out of the situation. I'm going no contact with them. Should I try and save my brothers life by having him arrested, or hope and pray the he comes to his senses?",113,517,0.96
1588,Asshole,"So I work 2 jobs, and yesterday I did a double shift from 10am to 11pm. After, I met up with my friends at a club/shisha bar to have some drinks and so on. I didn’t let my girlfriend know about these plans. 

I sent my girlfriend a snapchat from the club, and she reacted strongly. She was at her apartment where she lives alone. She told me over text that she wished I had told her I was going out. So I tell her sorry, it’s a boys night and carry on.

I then get a long message. I’ll transcribe it here. 

“Not cool! I thought you went out and didn’t tell me because you didn’t want me around. I thought I was being excluded purposely. Just say it’s a boys night and it’s all good. Go have fun, do whatever. But now I’m the controlling girlfriend who bothers you on your night out because I’m really upset You didn’t say anything. Fucking sucks being that bitch, feels awful”. 

So I replied “I texted you when I just got here and I had a busy day, it was a spontaneous get together”. 

She then replies “I didn’t know any of that, I’m sorry”. 

I then tell her that she’s great and I love her, she reciprocates my words and it’s all quiet from then on. 

The next day I find out that she was sobbing for hours over it all. I tried to comfort her but I’m not very good at that. She asked if I planned a spontaneous night out with my friends over text, I could have texted her too. She’s still pretty emotional over the whole thing and I’m getting irate about it. 

I feel like this is a major overreaction on her part and she says that I blindsided her with the club picture and she was shocked and confused at why I was there before I told her the details. She repeatedly says that I should have told her I was going out and that she didn’t expect to be invited just updated on what my plans were.

1589,Not the A-hole,"I live in an apartment building. And there is a lady who cleans the halls, vacuums, cleans the windows, doors, mop the floor etc. And we make monthly payments for her. But my next door neighbor got in a huge fight with the woman who hired the cleaning lady back in January. She is the apartment super. And since then nothing gets cleaned in our floor or the entrance and the cleaning lady only cleans the other floors.

We live in a 1 floor below the entrance, and nobody lives in entrance floor so they don't touch there since January. And the super said this is an unfortunate situation for me, but there is nothing she can't do and she won't let the cleaning lady clean our floor because of my neighbors and said you don't need to pay. And I didn't so me and my neighbor clean our floor and the entrance since January.

So the super called today and ask me to pay the cleaning fee since January. And said the cleaning lady was an elder woman and she needed the money and there is a holiday coming up so it would be a nice thing to do. And she said be bigger than your neighbors.

The cleaning lady is a really nice person and she is really old. But I will be paying for nothing. But I don't want to get in a fight with my super because I rent unlike my neighbor they own the house. And I don't want to make an uncomfortable situation in the apartment. But I'm not in a good financial situation right now and I'm not sure I can pay someone just because it's nice.  But I don't know the consequences of my action and I don't want to lose my house. And if I pay, my neighbor might resent me because I'm paying someone else for the job she does. I'm really conflicted. I honestly don't know what to do. I don't want to refuse to pay a nice old lady before holidays but I just don't have the money. So will I be the asshole if I refused to pay? Or maybe I can pay partially, I'm not sure.

Please excuse the mistakes in the post. English isn't my native and this was the best I can do in a short time.

Update edit: Well, seems like I underestimated the situation. She (my super) called again and said you don't have to pay the full amount you can pay for the 4 months instead and I will let her clean the entrance. And she kinda threatened if I don't she will tell my landlord. And my contract renewal is really close I'm not sure if I want to ruin that. And my landlord and my super are pretty close. Well on the other hand cleaning lady is 82 years old and I was already feeling bad. I guess my bank account will suffer. I though I had a choice in this, I guess I was wrong.

Update edit 2: As everybody suggested I talked to my landlord before she did and he and I agreed that I don't need to pay. And I told my super that I will not be paying and she did not take it well. Everybody in the apartment seems to hate me now. 3 of my neighbors came and said how they are disappointed by my behaviour for refusing to pay an 82 year old woman in need. And said that I ruined her holiday and she just wanted to buy new clothes for her grandchildren and how I'll go to hell. I don't know how the word spread that fast.

My ex boyfriend and I broke things off for the final time this February, we have not chatted at all since. He has a new girlfriend.

Back when we were dating, we took some slightly risqué Polaroids to hold onto. It was all in the name of fun but when our relationship ended I expected him to throw them out.

A few months ago I asked him if he did. He replies, “Of course.”

He runs a private spam page on instagram in which he posted this risqué picture of me tonight.

A friend alerted me and I immediately called my ex and told him to delete the picture now because I didn’t consent to it being on the internet and it was supposed to be kept as a private thing which happened in our relationship, which ENDED months ago. He also lied about throwing out the pictures?? 

To top it off the caption was about how he misses his exes or some bullshit. 

I am creeped to say the least and don’t know why he thought it was okay.


To end the phone call, he asks me if I would come to his gig this weekend because it’s all he cares about in this world. I sarcastically tell him I will not be there (because I have no respect for him now) 

However, my friend proposed that we DO go, and crash my exes big concert night. 

The crash part has not been decided but just something that will fuck up his night and teach him a lesson, mostly harmful and mostly for fun

1591,Not the A-hole,"I moved to New York for work a few months ago from Ireland, about two and a half weeks ago a new person started from Ireland. I've been showing him around and helping him out in work cause it's just nice to be around someone from home. We get along great. Both of us have conversational Irish and from time to time we speak in Irish to have private conversations that are not work based in work. Nothing major, just like asking if the other will be going for a drink later or what the other is doing for lunch etc. People talk about these things all the time in English in work, no one cares about personal conversations between colleagues so long as the work gets done. It's nice and relaxed in work. 

Yesterday in work while my new Irish colleague and I were talking and laughing about something in Irish, a colleague of mine made a comment about how people aren't completely comfortable with us doing this. No one in this office speaks a second language to each other in work. plenty of them have a second language, just no shared second languages to the best of my knowledge. We apologised but thought it was a bit strange, we spoke about it in English at lunch. I didn't think what we were doing was wrong. It was just private conversations in a somewhat obscure language. The intent wasn't to make others uncomfortable or anything and that's why it seems strange. AITA or are we the assholes for doing this? Is it poor show to be doing this in work with someone who shares a language with you that others do not?

EDIT: I should clarify that Irish is not our first language, it was something we studied as a second language in school and him in university. We like speaking it because it's fun for us to try and use a language that in everyday life is almost never used. We use it effectively just for cultural or heritage reasons

EDIT 2: I feel as though I wasn't specific enough about when we speak in Irish 
We never speak Irish for anything that involves actual work, so never in meetings, if it's at either desk it is about something casual like just asking what's up or how's the day going. In the break room we would only talk if we weren't in a group setting, like it it was us at one table doing our thing and there was a table with co workers doing their thing, we would speak in Irish for our private conversation. If it's at the water cooler then it would be asking if either want to go out for a pint or two after work. We never speak Irish when we are in groups, like it's just one on one conversations that some people might walk by or be within earshot of, which is when this colleague spoke up saying it made them uncomfortable. For the most part everyone gets along just fine and as a whole people in the office are all civil at least, but overall just friendly carefree people for the most part. Does that help?",568,1317,0.95
1592,No A-holes here,"My husband recently got headhunted for another company. The job is the same as his current job and they said they would match or increase his current salary, but this new company is a multinational and has bonuses and benefits that his current company don't offer. He got through to the final round of interviews and then just casually told me that this new place does rotating shifts, so it would be 7am to 4pm for 2 weeks and then 10am to 7pm for 2 weeks.

&#x200B;

They're not crazy hours, but the issue is that we have a 18 month old who goes to daycare. She's in daycare right next to my husband's office so he drops her and picks her up on his way to and from work. This new company is on the other side of the city so it would mean that I take her on the weeks he works early and he collects her, and he takes her on the weeks he works late and I collect her. We don't have a car so we're on public transport, which means it will add 45 minutes to my commute each way (my commute is already 2 hours). This isn't so much of an issue on the weeks that I would collect her after work, but the mornings would be really difficult for me.

&#x200B;

I said to my husband that it wasn't going to work and he got really angry with me for not supporting him. I'm angry with him because he didn't discuss it with me and just expected that I would take this on. If the salary was way higher then maybe we could look at getting a private nanny or something, but it's not, they just have free lunch/gym and all those perks that multinationals have. We just moved out of the city recently so that he could have a shorter commute (he was commuting 2 hours and I was cycling to work in 20 minutes), so I'm mad that I made the sacrifice of a longer commute for him, but he thinks it's not a big deal that I'm going to have to increase my commute even more.

&#x200B;

* Can't you move your daughter's daycare?
   * If we move her next to our apartment then I won't get back home on time to collect her before it closes
   * If we move her next to his job then they won't be open for him to drop her off
   * I have her on waiting lists next to my job since she was born, but nothing has come up yet

&#x200B;

* Why is the morning commute such a big deal?
   * I take (vital) medication at night that makes me drowsy so I need to sleep it off. When we lived downtown I woke up at 8am and felt ok, but now that we moved out of the city I wake up at 6:30 and feel shitty all day. I would have to wake up at 5:45 and I don't know how I would cope physically

&#x200B;

* Can't you just go to bed earlier?
   * I get home at 7:30pm, by the time we get the baby to bed and dinner ready, I would have to go straight to bed. I just don't think that's a good quality of life

Maybe I'm being selfish, but this new job isn't going to improve our family's financial situation, it's just going to be a cool place for my husband to work and I'd be happy for him if it didn't mean turning our life into a logistical nightmare. AITA?",212,572,0.91

1599,Everyone Sucks,"Today, my daughter worked late, until 9:30 PM or so. She does educational consulting and tutoring part time. She left her charger at work, so I had to drive back and get it. She said that later than she could have, so I had to drive further in the dark. I have also recently had cataract surgery.

My wife has always been anxious and tends to overexaggerate the negative, so she started screaming at my daughter, ""THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TAKE A GAP SEMESTER. GO TO [COLLEGE TOWN] AND NEVER COME BACK! IF YOU HADN'T COME BACK WE WOULDN'T NEED TO DEAL WITH THIS!"" I assume she was probably nervous about me driving in the dark after recently having cataract surgery. Moreover, my wife witnessed a horrific and fatal car accident on the way to work. 

While I understand that my wife was overreacting; like c'mon; it's just a charger, and we didn't have to drive that much further. It's pretty harsh to tell someone (your own kid) not to come back home just because she forgot her charger. 

However, I wasn't pleased by how my daughter responded by bringing up stuff from the past and ways that her mom had previously wronged her (my wife has always put a ton of pressure on my daughter to succeed academically and outside the classroom, so my daughter became very anxious and stressed all the time), so I didn't stand up for her. I instead told my kid to stop talking back to her mom and to stop speaking in such a bratty, entitled tone. 

The next day, I told my daughter to just discount everything her mom says when she's angry and to just think independently for herself (i.e. whether or not what her mom says is true or not). I believe that I'm instilling solid conflict resolution and confidence skills in my kid this way. I firmly believe that she needs to learn that sometimes, you just can't change other people, including your own mom, and that she needs to stand up for herself. 

Admittedly, it was also hard for me to choose sides and to tell my wife her faults because I honestly love my wife more than I love my daughter. While my kid has brought a lot of joy to our lives, my wife is my equal and has the capacity to be much more supportive than my kid ever could. But I didn't want to bring this type of bias into THEIR argument.

However, when I relied all of this to a friend, he told me that I should have stuck up for my daughter (who only forgot a charger and didn't do anything worse), or at least told both my wife and daughter that they needed to work on their communication skills.

Currently I live in a low income housing project as I had my daughter after graduating with a certificate but things did not work out as planned and I did not get a job in my field. I am currently working and start university in the fall at the ripe age of 35 so I can move out and make a better life for my daughter.

It was great at first, quiet and peaceful until I got new neighbors to the left and right of me. It started sporadically, and then became a nuisance.

I will be on the treadmill at 9am and get a knock at the door from the old lady asking for a cigarette. She does this like clockwork every end of the month when she runs out of social security. She paid me back with cheap brand cigarettes I don’t even smoke so I put them in my freezer for the next time she asked. I won’t even take the quarter she offers me, I’ll just give her one because every smoker knows it’s more of an inconvenience when your down a cigarette and that last one can save you from a late night ride to the store.

My other neighbors do the same, ask for cigarettes and even send over their young kids to ask me for them. They ask to borrow my boyfriends PlayStation controller, and owe us money from months ago.

My daughter is three and I will get random knocks on the door for her. I was getting ready for my final earlier this month and got a knock on the door asking if she could come out and play. First off, I never let her out unsupervised, as she is 3, otherwise if I wasn’t busy I would have obliged. I sternly said I had urgent plans and she could not come out and play at that time as she was going over her grandmothers.
They knocked again the other day and as I had plans I just didn’t answer.  

I have lived elsewhere, and in my hometown it was considered impolite to knock on the door to ask for anything repeatedly.

I want to ask for my money back, politely tell the older lady and the other neighbors I can’t afford giving out cigarettes to them, and tell the kids I will bring out my daughter when I am able to sit out there and watch her. I just want to be left in peace until the time comes to move without any repercussions.

I'm an 18 year old guy and I have a twin sister. I've been best friends with my best friend (we'll call him G) since kindergarten, so G and my sister have always been pretty close too. They've kind of had a ""thing"" going on our whole lives. For the longest time, they never officially dated for a bunch of different reasons I won't get into, but they were always really close and really into each other.

A little over a year ago, when we were all 17, they finally started dating. Everything went really well for like 13 months, but then long story short, G cheated on my sister and I was the one who figured it out. He swore it wouldn't happen again and begged me not to tell my sister but I told her anyway. I was mad at him and he was mad at me so we didn't talk for a month and a half, which was honestly the weirdest month and a half of my whole life. G's practically like my brother, we've been inseparable since kindergarten, so not having him around was kinda....unbearable honestly lol

After our streak of not talking to each other, G invited me on his family ski trip as a way to make amends (I've been on lots of his family's ski trips through the years). I accepted and ended up forgiving him and letting him back into my life because it was way too weird without him in it. I can tell he's genuinely sorry about what happened. He literally cried cause he felt so bad and I've only seen him cry like once before in my whole life

Anyway, G and my sister broke up as soon as she found out he cheated and they're still not on speaking terms, so my sister obviously isn't happy about the whole situation. She's making me feel like shit for still being friends with G, and she doesn't seem to understand how big of a deal it would be for us to lose our 13 year friendship over her. I know G made a huge mistake, I hate him for it and I'll never 100% get over it, but I'm not gonna let it ruin my best and longest friendship. I think about it like this: if your best friend cheated on their SO and then felt like shit, would you end your friendship with them? No. So why is this any different just because his SO happened to be my sister? G and I are going to the same college in the fall (a different college in a different state than the one my sister's going to), so none of this is gonna be something that we even think about when we're living in different places

Well while shes out she never texts me over the course of about 3 hours. I shot her 2 texts and never got anything back which is really unlike her. I understand she was with her friends but the fact that she had told me shes getting drinks from guys and never responds to me for that long made me feel kind of uneasy. 

She finally calls me about 4 hours later after dropping her friend off and says the guys that were there bought her and her friends drinks and she had 4 drinks paid for and a desert. I say wow that's kind of weird and I asked her if I went out and was with friends and a girl bought me 4 drinks and a desert if she would be mad about that? She says I cant believe you would think of me like that. 

Now shes mad at me and she insists that she didnt even talk to the guys and the only interaction she had with the guys was saying thank you when she left. Which I find very hard to believe. I can understand her accepting one drink and saying thanks but I'm engaged whatever but to accept 4 drinks and there was no interaction what so ever? 

I'm not accusing her of cheating I dont think she would do anything like that. I've been out with her when guys have bought her drinks she tells them shes with me and I'm cool with it sometimes hell the guy that approaches her might even buy me a drink and take off.

1606,Asshole,"Throwaway as my gf knows I use reddit and could probably identify me easily if I give out too much info.

Anyways, me and my gf both have grown up with the same language being our first. Overtime we both became bilingual due to schooling and generally being around English speakers. Where we kind of split off at is that my girlfriend is not as fluent anymore as I am. She can speak and understand it and it isn't anywhere near having ""lost"" it, she just has issues with grammar and a slightly less lengthy vocabulary. 

&#x200B;

Recently, I have asked her if she can speak to me in our language more often because we both are very proud of our culture and it is a very big part of our identities. She shot me down and when asked why she told me that she feels uncomfortable knowing that I would be able to tell when she messes up and that she already feels judged enough by her family who constantly tease her for being the most ""whitewashed"". I told her I didn't care about her little mistakes and just want to have this between us. She still refuses and says that I teased her similarly before, which I have but never thought more of it since she just brushes it off or jokes along with it. I still bring up the request from time to time and her response hasn't changed.

&#x200B;

WIBTA if I keep this a thing I ask of her? I feel very connected with my culture and want to include my gf as well. I'm a little hurt she doesn't trust me in at least attempting to speak to me. Of course, I'm not forcing it upon her or considering it a dealbreaker. 

&#x200B;

As an extra note, she does speak the language to my family and to hers when talking to them, just not towards me and her closer relatives that speak English.",24,32,0.87

1608,Not the A-hole,"My dad had some sort of stomach issue going on yesterday. It was bad enough that he seized up getting into the car for my mom to take him to the doctors, but he got released with them saying hes fine after giving him a CAT scan.

That ties into today because, with my dad being notorious for acting goofy when hes sick (overplaying his symptoms), he was telling me that he had ""the worst pain you can imagine in your body"" somewhere near his pancreas. I was trying to see if he REALLY needed to go, because hospital visits are money, when he just keels over. Now, unbeknownst to me, he apparently seized up right there, but he looked so goofy falling down that I didnt take it as serious as I could have.

 So I go downstairs trying to find an ER that isnt busy (found out that was a dumb thing to do) when my youngest sister comes downstairs panicking...everyone thinks my dad is dying. I go upstairs and tell him ""hey, unless you respond I'm calling 911"" and sure enough, he doesnt respond. So I call them, they get to us and they do all their stuff. They determine that his vitals are fine and so is his blood sugar (hes diabetic) and he finally comes to and doesnt even know where he is. He gets put on a stretcher and they take him outside.

Now, here's the part where I might be TA: they asked him when was the last time he has had a seizure. He tells them six months ago. I got pissed because: 1) I dont think you should EVER lie to a paramedic because you dont know what is critical for them to know; 2) we were JUST recovering from thinking our dad died 6 months after our fucking brother died. With that, I went to one of the paramedics and I told them, ""I know he said six months ago, but that's a lie: he literally just had a seizure yesterday.""

I knew that it was going to get his license revoked, but after what we just went through...idk. I didnt want to risk anything. My mom is pissed because this is undeniably going to put a lot of stress on her in regards to getting the kids to school when that becomes relevant again, but I really wanna say I did the right thing here. It doesnt feel like I did, but idk.

1610,Not the A-hole,"Context:

My (16f) mom works from home as a stylist & has a salon in our basement. I don't mind this because the stairs are right by our front door, so I can avoid awkward conversations by going into our kitchen when her customers are around. I don't do this out of rudeness, I am just not very social.

However, my mom recently picked up new customers - mother & her two very autistic sons (both in their early 20s, around 6'2 & probably near 300 pounds - I am 125 lbs & 5'6). I go to public school where there are a lot of autistic students, so I am comfortable around people with mental obstacles & do not have a problem with working with them. 


However, my mother's new customers are violent & very invasive. They have never actually harmed either my mom or myself, but they shake their fists (threateningly) at my mom before she does their hair & yell because they don't want their hair cut. (According to her, once she begins doing their hair they settle down.) One time when I was home, I was sitting in our dining room, which is upstairs and a ways away from our stairs, & all of the sudden I hear footsteps and one of the boys is walking into the kitchen. He asks me for a glass of water. No big deal - I'm often asked to bring my mom's customers a glass of water or a can of pop, I'm used to it & don't really care. I get him a glass of water & he downs it pretty quickly, puts it on the counter, & heads back downstairs. A few minutes later, he comes back upstairs with one of those Ring Pops (a plastic ring with candy on it, for anyone who doesn't know), shows me & tells me that he was going to marry me. I was slightly taken aback, & he insisted again. This made me uncomfortable, & I made some remark (kindly) along the lines of, ""I can't marry you, I'm still in highschool!"" He kept insisting until his mother came upstairs and they left. 

The most recent time they were here (2 days ago), he saw me when he came in the door & immediately started talking about marrying me. No specifics, just referring to me as his wife, etc. I grew more uncomfortable, but he went downstairs and I shook it off. While they were downstairs, I was in the dining room again doing homework. I hear footsteps coming up the stairs, but this time they dont come towards me. I wait a few minutes, & then go see what he's doing. He is standing in the doorway of my bedroom, just looking around. I know for a fact my door had been closed. My level of discomfort rises significantly. My mom tells me that when they get their hair cut & I'm not home, he asks about me constantly - my mom is under the impression that I'm okay with it, she is not TA as far as I'm concerned.

I would like to talk to my mom & ask her to have a conversation with the mother about not bringing them to our home anymore because it makes me very uncomfortable. I don't think the boys are intentionally making either of us uncomfortable, but I am worried about our safety.

1611,Not the A-hole,"My GF has been living with me for 6 months. I own our house. Before my GF and I got together, it was just me and my daughter living here. My daughter is 19, in college, and works. I do not charge her rent. She pays for her cell phone and car. 


Some time after my GF moved in, her son from out of state decided to move down here. He asked if they could stay with us for a week or 2 until they found a place to live. They being him, his girlfriend, their toddler, and their infant. 



When the 2 week mark was nearing I encouraged them with apartment searching and extended stay hotels. I even gave them some contacts of trustworthy landlords I know. 



The son asked GF if they could stay longer. She asked me and I said no. That’s when the argument started.



She asked if i was really going to throw out her grandchildren. I told her if it came down to it, the grandkids could stay but I’m not budging on her son and his gf. 



She got mad and said it’s not fair that my pot smoking daughter is allowed to live here rent free and take up 2 rooms while her kids get thrown on the street.

1615,Not the A-hole,"I bought my little cousin a very nice and very generous piece of jewelry for her high school graduation a few weeks ago. Our grandmother recently passed away, and had given me, as well as my sisters, the same item (a watch) for our high school graduations. So in my grandma's absence I gave her the watch, a simple and classic style Movado that set me back \~$500USD. It was significantly more than I have ever spent on a gift, but felt that this was an important occasion and this tradition was important in my family. 

&#x200B;

About a week ago I'm checking my online banking, and I notice a chargeback on my card from the store for the full amount of the deposit (I financed the watch and would be making payments). Thinking it was a mistake, I called them and asked to speak to the manager. Wellll..... It turns out my cousin came in the very next day and returned the watch. The manager also added that the greeting card I had given with it was still in the bag and my cousin had left it behind asking if we wanted that back.

&#x200B;

I felt so hurt. I didn't even know what to say. I felt hurt that she couldn't be honest with me about how she felt, I felt hurt she clearly didn't value my generosity, I felt hurt that she returned the item the next day.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to yesterday: My aunt calls me up. She explains that my cousin had returned the watch as she felt uncomfortable with how much I had spent on her, and felt that she had no need for such a nice piece on jewelry in college. I said I was hurt but that I understood. My aunt proceeded to say that, however, she has a lot of things she needs like new clothes and dorm stuff and she could really use the money. She proceeds to say that she's talked to my cousin and it would be great if I could just Venmo her all of the money I spent on the watch.

&#x200B;

I was so floored. If I had wanted to give her a cash gift I would have, but the only reason I spent that much money is because my sisters and I have all gotten that same watch from our Grandma and I didn't want her to feel hurt or left out. I thought it would be a nice surprise, but it was a lot for me and I had financed it, and it would be really financially uncomfortable for me to cough up such a large amount of money in one month. I let her know this.

&#x200B;

I told all of that to my Aunt, and she proceeds to call me an Indian Giver and say that's disgusting, that I can't just not give my cousin a gift because she didn't want the watch, that I was ridiculous to give such an expensive piece of jewelry to a teenager, and that I should be proud of her for being responsible enough to want to spend the money on things that are more practical for her in this stage of her life. She said that it was incredibly tacky and selfish to get her so excited like this but then change my mind.

1616,Not the A-hole,"I’m a high school junior, and not the type to demand to “speak with the manager”. I work part-time as a server (minimum wage) so I sympathize with customer service workers. But today was an exception to that.

In my Spanish class today, we had a fun competition to help prepare us for finals and I won a gift card to a popular Mexican chain. I won’t name it since doing so might reveal which gift card company I had this issue with. My teacher told me he didn’t know how much was on the card, but that I could check online or over the phone (there’s a # provided right on the card to call and check the balance.)

Eager to find out how much is on it, I called the number during our break period (didn’t check online, cause my school’s wifi’s kind of shitty.) A guy in his 50’s answered, and when I told him I’m calling about a \[restaurant\] gift card he very snippily told me that his company does not manage cards related to that company. Honestly, he did this in a tone as though I’d called asking for condoms or hookers.

I was pretty puzzled, so I politely pushed him, telling I was sure that I called the right number and this restaurant is represented by their company. I started to give him my card number, but he kept snapping at me very rudely that “we don’t do that company” and that he can’t help me. In the midst of me reciting my code to him one last time, he hung up on me. I went back to class, very pissed off and disgruntled.

A quick check of their site reveals that said restaurant is, in fact, one of their most popular and available gift cards. There is **no way** an employee of the company could not know that they sell cards of that restaurant; that would be like me not knowing that the restaurant I serve at has burgers or beer on their menu. The guy was just being a dick and refusing to do his job.

I’m not trying to sound too negative/entitled, but all I asked this guy to do was plug in a code and tell me a number. Would’ve taken him 30 seconds tops. How incredibly lazy does someone have to be to choose rudeness/lie/argue with their customer/risk being reported just to get out of **typing in a code?** I can’t ever imagine refusing to serve a customer or do my job, and trust me, serving is a lot more draining of a job than plugging in a 9 digit code.

I called back during lunch, and the same guy answered. I called him out, not aggressively or rudely, and he apologized, saying he was having a bad morning. After he gave me the balance on my card, I asked him to connect me to his manager; he sighed wearily when he heard this request. He apologized again; I told him I appreciate it, but I need to speak to his manager, and requested his name and employee ID, which he gave me.

I reported his behavior (but did tell them that he apologized the second time around), and the manager seemed very concerned and thanked me for telling him. Should I have let this go, being that he apologized and eventually got me the info, or was I in the right?",70,317,0.93
1617,Asshole,"We were both working at a convention. My work covered a room but it had two beds so I offered to be roommates, so he didn't have to pay the full price of a room alone. Basically I paid for the room and was reimbursed by work ( the arrangements were made before I knew he was going to be there). 

The room was around 500 for our stay and I told him to pay 250 (a bit less than half). I thought I was doing something nice by helping him pay only half a room instead of the full fee. But he found out my room was covered and is offended. I realized after that maybe he felt swindled; he was willing to pay his share when he thought I paid, but when he realizes I was getting reimbursed he decided he didn't want to pay since it was unequal. 

We are good colleagues so we haven't fought, he just has asked ""whether he really owes the money."" I'd like to tell him that yes, he still owes his share, because I could have roomed alone or with someone who would pay.... but it has made me wonder if perhaps he is right. AITA? 

Also, we are both journalists, so we're not super rich lol.

ETA: I guess I wrote it wrong, bc it maybe was confusing , but I paid for the room. My work is reimbursing me. They will reimburse me the full price if I pretend I didn't have a roommate (what he wants me to do, and I see his point), but I would prefer he pays his share and I get reimbursed my share. nowhere am I making a profit lol

ETA again: maybe I'm bad math (totally possible haha) but I already paid 500 and work offered to reimburse me. They have not yet !!! So the option is either work pays me 500, and he gets a free room. Or else he pays his half and work reimburses me half. Nowhere am I making money, unless my addition is way off here.

Also, to be clear, he has not paid yet. The only one who has paid money is myself.

Last edit lol, since I am making too many of these. And a lot of ppl are in agreement I am in the wrong ! I accept that but just ask WIBTA if I lied to my work?

1620,Not the A-hole,"This actually happened when I was 21 and my brother was 27, but he has brought it up a few times now, talking about how terrible I am and how upset it made him. Something tells me that this will continue to be brought up, so I'd like to know if I actually do owe him an apology.

My brother served in the military for 6 years, 4 years of which he was stationed in Europe. He met a European woman, married her there, and they lived together during the last couple years of his deployment. After his time in the military came to an end, they moved in with her parents in her home country. She worked, he didn't, and they lived there for another year. 

My brother eventually ran out of money and moved back to our hometown to get a job while his wife remained in Europe and applied for her green card. He moved in to our grandma's basement, which didn't offer a *ton* of privacy, but at least she had sprung for a new queen bed for him. 

My brother hated living with our grandma. He claimed that she didn't allow him to use her laundry room or take long showers, and that she complained too much. I actually recall visiting once and his clothes were strewn all over the entire basement, as well as random papers and wrappers. According to my grandma, she asked him to do 2 things for her the whole time he lived there, and he didn't. When he made no attempt to find a job or return to school, she kicked him out. 

Right at that time, I was preparing to move out for the first time, into a one-bedroom apartment with my boyfriend. If I recall correctly, my brother helped me move some of my stuff in and then privately asked me if he could stay with us for a couple weeks. I told him I would have to ask my boyfriend first, since it was our first week living together, and his name was on the lease too. 

My boyfriend said ""no"" with zero hesitation. I was unhappy with his decision and tried to talk him out of it, but I had to respect it. I even asked my parents what they thought, and both of them said that my brother had other options, so it was okay if I didn't want to do it. I broke the news to my brother and *at the time* he said it was fine. He moved in with my grandpa until he found a job and got his own place.

Everything was fine for a few years. His wife moved here, everything was great. But a few times over the years my brother brings it up. Technically he is my *half*-brother, and when his biological father died last month, he uninvited me from the funeral, on the grounds that I didn't offer him a place to stay however many years ago.

1622,No A-holes here,"So the backstory: 
about a year and a half ago my cousin got married. It was a lovely wedding and she seemed really happy but it had a bit of a sour note for myself and my family: my boyfriend of three years was not invited. I was a bit upset about this but tried not to make a big deal about it as he’d been invited to the late reception which seemed fair. Until I got to the wedding and saw that all my cousin’s other 2nd and 3rd cousins etc (I’m 1 of 3 first cousins) had plus ones who were in no sense “close” to the bride or groom. It then became apparent that other plus ones coming to the later reception had been sent proper invitations, my boyfriend had been sent a link to their wedding website with the message “you’re welcome to attend”. 

Maybe I was being over sensitive but it just seemed like such a slap in the face. Other relatives - also my age and with similar relationship lengths - were allowed plus ones. The bride herself had only been dating the groom for 4 years at this point so excluding my boyfriend from a family event seemed so dismissive of our relationship to me.

I haven’t seen my cousin since then - not because of this event (there was no fallout) we just haven’t connected since.
Would I be the asshole if I didn’t invite my cousin and her husband to my own wedding next year because of this?

1623,No A-holes here,"This happened 4 years ago, my(19m) girlfriend (19f)at the time was a D3 college cheerleader. The team she was on won many back to back national titles. They were arguably the best in the country for their division. 

My girlfriend never saw the mat. In her 3 active years as a cheerleader she competed one time in a 2 minute long routine. She received all the rings and prizes that came with being a champion without really earning it. Even in practice she sat the bench. 

She hated everything about it. The coaches played favorites, the girls were absolute scum. Completely toxic environment. When my gf got a chance to take another girls spot on the mat, the girl she was competing against tried to get in my pants as a way to destroy my gf emotionally. These girls were awful. 

Everyday my gf would come home in tears, literally crying about it not being fair. I tried to give advice but she just wanted to be heard. Which I completely understand. 

Everyday for 2 years, the same thing. I eventually started to talk her into quitting. Seeing as she wasn’t competing and it was emotionally taxing on her, it didn’t seem worth it. She quit our junior year and regretted it, went back her senior year and hated it just as much.

I met up with her a week ago and the topic worked it’s way into the conversation. She blames me for talking her into quitting the team and regrets it. I think I did the right thing. She was emotionally drained from the whole experience.

1626,Everyone Sucks,"I am an 8th grade student, and this event happened about a week ago, on Wednesday, 5/22. I was riding on a school bus, and since I was a bit late getting on, and this bus usually fills up quick, I had to sit on the floor in the back, as that was where there was the most space. One of the kids that was there, a popular student who also happened to be Class President for my entire middle school, was sitting directly next to me. During the bus ride, he yelled such profanities as (and the following will be *quite* vulgar) ""HOW DO YOU SPELL NIGGER?"" He then follows this by spelling the n-word, hard r, letter by letter at the same volume. He does this around three more times throughout the beginning part of the bus ride. Later on in the bus ride, someone complained about it being hot, and so he yelled, in the direction of the bus driver, ""HEY BITCH, TURN ON THE FUCKIN' A/C!"" The bus driver had earbuds in, however, and did not hear it, or, he simply chose to ignore it, due to a similar event that happened last year in which a bus driver got fired for yelling at a kid who was bothering and distracting the driver, which was extremely dangerous. My friend, who was sitting next to me, whispered, ""Hey man, what \[the guy we are talking about\] said wasn't very cool, and that isn't right, him being the representative of our school."" So, I decided to take action. I told one of the teachers, the one who I knew would react the harshest to his actions, about what he said, and he asked me to write a ""detailed report."" I did so, and turned it in to him. The next day, said kid comes to me and asks me why I did it. I told him, and he said that since I also said ""Nigga,"" that I should get into trouble as well. However, I was simply using it to a similar way that someone would say Bro, and not in a hateful way, like him. However, I see his point. He was supposed to do one of the speeches for graduation, and so am I, however due to my reporting him, he is no longer able to perform said speech. In his talk to me the day after reporting him, he mentioned how he has been avoiding trouble all throughout the year, with not a single detention, write-up, or suspension, just so he can do this speech, and now, thanks to me, he can't. So, his logic is that I should not be able to do my speech at the end of the year either, because I said something similar. Now, what he told me has given me a bit of regret and guilt, and I feel bad for him. I am starting to feel as if I never should have never reported him in the first place, and I wouldn't have, if my friend hadn't encouraged me to. I am also afraid that he is going to report me as well, and although I have at least two others that will back me up, I am afraid that I could get into major trouble as well. 

So, I just want to know if I am justified, or if I shouldn't be able to do that speech at graduation after all. Everybody I asked had a bit of a biased opinion in one way or another, so I would just like the input of an impartial party. Thank you.",66,56,0.82

My cat has been missing for almost 4 days now. The last time this happened he was 40 feet up a tree. I had to climb up and get him. I have searched within 100 yards of my house and can't find him. He has never been an outside cat but we are in the woods in rural Vermont so I have let him go outside supervised occasionally making sure there were none of our other cats or the dog to spook him.

My girlfriend first said it was our fault for letting him go outside. Then she said it was our fault for going on vacation. I feel like it's their fault for not closing the door when they go outside. The kids are 6 and 8 years old. They have been told over and over again to close the door they go outside but they rarely do. They are not held accountable for when they don't do what they are told.

While my girlfriend was making excuses for them last night I blew up and said those mother fuckers killed my cat. I am livid. Two other people in her family are dope heads and constantly cause drama in our lives. 

I'm about ready to leave her because of all of this. I moved 8 hours away from where I'm from and it will be hard to get my life back together.

Am I the asshole?

TLDR My girlfriend's family let my cat out and it's probably dead among other drama and I am just about done.

Edit : thank you for all the responses either way. The main thing is I spent a couple of hours looking for my kitty and I won't stop before I find him. I am going to look some more.

Edit : A little back story on my cat. He is not an outside cat at all. He is daddy's boy. I rescued him from the animal shelter. He went in at 6 months and spent 18 months there. No one else wanted him. When I went to the shelter he hid in the back of the cage while the other cats begged to get adopted. I said I want him and they told me to pick another cat. I said no I want him and they said ok good luck. He hid under a towel in the bathroom for a month before he came out. Soon after that he started greeting me every day when I got home from work. He knew when I was going to get up for work and would lay on my chest to stop me from leaving. He clings to my clothes when I am getting out of the shoer to stop me from leaving him. He is more dependant on me than most cats. I am crushed that he's out there alone and waiting for me to save him and I am failing him.

EDIT : OH MY GOD HE'S BACK. ONE OF THE OTHER CATS WAS STARING OUT ON TO THE DECK SO I TURNED THE LIGHT ON AND HE WAS JUST STANDING THERE. THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU THAT ENCOURAGED ME TO HANG IN THERE ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Sorry for the yelling it's out of excitement.

Thanks for the awards. I don't know what I'm supposed to do with the coins.",593,2867,0.96
1631,Not the A-hole,"SO (33M) and I (24F) have been together for over a year and half. We've been living together for a few months. His family is religious and every time there's a family event they always ask ""when are you getting married?""

They all make hopeful comments about me getting pregnant soon (not the right time), always talking about how great it would be for us to wed. They're a bit invasive, but at least they're supportive, I guess? (shrugs).

I'm a part time student and work, SO works about 60h/week and doesn't make a lot of money. Plus, the following:

We checked his credit score a few days ago, and it's bad. If a score went from 1 to 1000, his would be 10.  Meaning: he can't buy a car, he can't open a business, he can't rent a place to live, he can't order a credit card; he can't do a thing involving banks and credit. He was going back to university next year for a degree he's passionate about, but guess what? He can't even get approved for school loans!!!

His mom owns a small business that is neck deep in debt. She owes banks about $100.000 in loans and interest. She gets angry if anyone tries to help figure it out. SO is listed as a partner in the business, and he can't legally get out without the debt being paid off... 

Besides that, his parents have taken multiple loans throughout the years in SO's name, which they never payed back. So picture how badly a few $2k loans can grow with interest added. Then picture it over a few years span... Yeah. That bad. Plus... Telephone bills unpaid in his name (his mom's phone).

So basically he's fucked. He confronted his mother about this mess, and all she can say to him is: ""it's being handled"" - in a very dismissive way. And we know for a fact it's not, and will only get worse.

I am thinking about next time I see her and she asks about weddings, babies and shit, I'll flat out say: ""I will not marry your son if he doesn't have a credit score. I will not put a child in this world to inherite over $100k in debt. I will also not mary someone and risk getting that debt either. So, until you figure this mess out, don't bother asking me.""

I want her to know how badly she's fucked her son over. I want her to feel it. I want to make her take responsibility and make her realize what's at stake here.

1632,Not the A-hole,"My girlfriend and I had been together for roughly 2 years, and we had a baby on the way.  Naturally this was a smart time to get a new vehicle.  Up until this point we had been using my fathers car for appointments and such which was obviously starting to cause a strain on everyone’s nerves.  Around this time my girlfriend had gotten a rather large sum of money from Medicaid (my girlfriend is on disability for bipolar disorder), for back pay if I remember correctly, which she decided to start a savings account with.  So she found a car online for $1800, it was an amazing deal, we could not believe our luck.  She asked me if I thought it was a good deal, I told her it was, so we test drove it and took it home that night.  She paid for it out of her savings.  When we got home we discussed the financial aspect of this, and we agreed that I would pay insurance and all maintenance fees because she put the money up to purchase the vehicle.  This worked out great for about 6 months until one day I get a message while I’m at work.  My girlfriend claims that she had been talking to a few people and everyone tells her that I am taking advantage of her by not paying her back for half of the car.  This really did not sit well with me, especially after spending $70 to replace a wheel bearing assembly, then another $60 to replace the ac blower motor.  My reasoning is if I had bought the car, I would not even think about asking her to pay half of it back, especially if all I planned on doing with the money is sitting on it.  So I refused, told her how I felt, and she is standing by me paying her back $900, and she wants $200 a month.  I feel like this is insane, especially considering the fact that I give her $300 a month, and pay all the bills the car entails. So reddit, am I the asshole?",65,29,0.91

1634,Not the A-hole,"I live close to an elementary school. Every day a small parade of children walk in front of my house on their way to and from school. My girlfriend and I just finished building a small retaining wall of brick along the sidewalk and have noticed it regularly being walked/climbed on. The wall is about three feet tall.

Originally we were going to plant a lot of flowering bushes along the top of it but we're pretty sure they will be destroyed slowly by the daily coming and going of the kids. We also don't want to be liable for anyone falling and getting hurt. We were at Home Depot to buy flowers the other day when we saw some neat looking bushes that are also a bit pokey. That's when I got the idea to use them as a deterrent. So, will I be the asshole if I plant them along the top of the wall?

**Thank you for the different plant suggestions! Keep em comin! I live in a zone 7 climate.

** There seems to be a minority rising that think I'm out to fuck these kids over and that is very much not the case. I just don't want them climbing all over the wall, which is already happening. I used the term ""pokey bushes"" intentionally as I just want a *deterrent*. Something that is more scary than damaging but will be effective if they actually try anyway. (lol, the people suggesting cholla catus!)

Need more fabric to stop weeds and we are going to put something over it(mulch or my GF wants some small black rocks). As for the pokey plants, the plant nearest to the camera is *wild rose* and following the wall we planted a few *lantana*. Both of which should grow out over the wall in the next two years or so. Behind those we have some random white flowers, some salvia and lavender. We then planted a little fig tree and two lilacs on either side of the front door. In the background to the right we planted a jasmine to grow alone the fence. If someone wants to remind me, I can take pictures again next year for some plant growth progress.",1444,11995,0.94

My boyfriend is 20 and his sister is about 10, and his entire family lets her behave however she wants. He especially treats her like she can do no wrong, and makes excuses for her bad behavior all the time. She whines constantly, talks back to everyone, and is just generally annoying to be around. That's terrible of me to say, I know. I have never said anything about her to him, or anyone else for that matter. It isn't my place to tell him, and I KNOW it would not be received well. So, I've been sucking it up and dealing with it. But recently it became a bigger issue.

He lives at home still with his family, and I spend the night sometimes. His sister has now gotten into this habit of throwing a fit when she sees I'm there. She screams and cries and locks herself in her room because she's ""just jealous"" according to his family. It's frustrating, because I've been nothing but nice to her. The first time she threw a fit like that I bought tickets to an amusement park for her and her brother, so they could spend some time together. I felt bad for taking so much of his time that she missed him so much. Then I found out that she has been telling his mom lies about me being mean to her, or calling her names. This is an incredibly frustrating situation, and I just don't want to deal with it anymore. It's beginning to affect my relationship, and personally it makes me feel really shitty. I told my boyfriend I don't feel comfortable spending the night at his house anymore, but I didn't tell him it was because of his sister.

She just bought a house and seems to really want to move in together in her new house. The pro's for her are obvious, she gets a ""roommate"" she knows she can deal with, help paying her mortgage, and we both get to take a step forward in our relationship.

The cons for me make it complicated. I'd have to start commuting half an hour to work, I'd have to sublet my apartment as I just signed a 1 year lease, and a lot of my social opportunities would be more limited.  

The ""pro"" that I'm contemplating is this, we both each pay half her mortgage, but my portion payed is tallied, and if we ever break up (just being a realist here), I get it all payed back.

My ex and I got into an agreement. I offered to be her sugar daddy jokingly at first but she agreed to my surprise. Our arrangement was every so often she'd send me NSFW pictures and I would send her money in exchange. It was completely consensual for both of us and she initially made it seem like it was something she wanted. We also engaged in brief flirty and sexual conversations as well.

A few weeks later I discovered she was using the extra money to support he fiance with his legal troubles and that it was the entire reason she agreed to be my sugar baby. I wont go into detail about what they were, but due to the legal issues her fiance was out of the picture giving her free reign to send me pictures whenever she liked. Initially I felt bad about it since I should just offer to help without getting any pictures from her in return, but she assured me since she felt bad about having to come to me for money in the first place that sending me pictures was the least she could do so we kept our agreement going.

So fast forward, she asked me for money and I of course obliged as I always have, but this time she did not keep her end of the deal and send me pictures as promised. 4 or 5 days passed and I tried to give her time and space but she blatantly ignored and avoided me during that time. She then blocked me on facebook when i messaged her asking if she was still gonna send the pictures, and she later blocked me on snapchat.

So i went to instagram since she forgot i followed her there and messaged her to either send me the pictures or send my money back or else I would send the screenshots of our sexual conversations to her fiance, who at this point was back living with her and his legal case was over with.

She  then sent them to me almost immediately afterwards and I havent talked to her since

She was the one who came to me for money in this instance and I fulfilled my end of the deal. I only threatened her because the way she handled it. She blocked me and made excuse after excuse. If she had told me straight up that her fiance was back living with her and she wasnt comfortable with sending pics anymore I would have been entirely understandable, but she handled it completely wrong in my opinion and this was the result.

&#x200B;

So AITA? Again remember this was consensual, she was the one who came to me for money and she agreed to send pictures as she always has in this case.

EDIT: Thanks for the feedback. Just from the comments alone the general consensus is that we both fucking suck, but I also win the prize of being the asshole here since I blackmailed her and threatened to ruin her relationship. That was my initial belief all along and you all helped me confirm it.

So I owe her an apology and even beyond that I will delete her pictures and our conversations and just let her live her life from now on. We both handled this situation poorly but I know now more than ever that I'm the ultimate asshole on this one. So that's that.",99,88,0.86

Some background on me: I’m not a big partier. I hate loud bars, clubbing, big parties in general. I’m more reserved and would much rather have a nice meal or hang at someone’s house with my close-knit friends. I’ve known my friends (now bridesmaids) for years and I’ve always been the wet blanket friend, but they all seemed fine with it.

As one does when they are engaged, my bridesmaids threw me a bachelorette party. I’m super grateful that they planned this event for me, and they’ve made me feel so special for the duration of my engagement. But to be honest, I thought they knew me better.

Months before this bachelorette party, I mentioned that I’d rather not do the traditional bar hopping/strip club/getting plastered type of weekend, and that I’d much rather go to the beach, drive into the nearest city for sightseeing or shopping, go to a spa or even just a BBQ at someone’s house. However, the actual bachelorette night was exactly the opposite: pregaming, bars, more bars, and to top off the night: a karaoke bar. I know I sound like a huge buzzkill and this is the default for bachelor/bachelorette parties and most people are probably reading this thinking “that sounds like a blast!” I’m happy for you, but that’s not me.

I spent the whole night trying to get through it. I was miserable, and my friends noticed how much I hated it. The next morning, they asked me if I had fun. I tried to lie and say that I did, but they could tell. I admitted that it wasn’t fun for me and I thought that they knew me well enough to know that’s not my style. A big fight ensued where they accused me of being a bridezilla and that they “spent so much money on this night” and I accused them of using my bachelorette party as an excuse to get wild and slutty and that they didn’t care about what I wanted.

I wasn't religious when I started, but I had some stirrings lately and as corny as it may sound, I can't look at my daughter as NOT believe a higher power gave her to me. And she's only 3 but I want her to have some spiritual grounding in her life. So a few months ago I sought out a church. I found one I like and feel pretty welcome at and have met and talked to some people there, and have been open about being a single mother who has never been married. But not my job.

I've been talking to one of my friends at the club who's been a regular churchgoer for awhile. She told me just be honest if they ask. She goes to a women's prayer and Bible study group and says everyone there knows both that she's a stripper and bisexual...and no one cares. She only gets asked about it from women seeking tips on dressing up or dancing for their husbands. She says Jesus would hang out with us (truth!) and unless the church is Catholic, fundamentalist or full of old people not many people will care, say you are going to hell or anything of the sort. 

I recently went to a young adults meeting at a restaurant after church when I didn't have to worry about my daughter who was with her father that weekend...but felt a little ashamed. I met nice people but they were all rather ""do gooders"" when we discussed our jobs introducing ourselves, most seemed to work for non profits or in some sort of service job.

He's now messaged me individually saying he's bought the item so can I transfer him my share. Again which I'm happy to do, but I'm thinking of asking for a screenshot of the receipt first. Would this be an asshole request?

Just as a bit of a background, this guy has a bit of a ""wheeler dealer"" history. I'm not questioning so much whether he has the gift, more his method of gaining it and/or how much he paid for it.

UPDATE EDIT: So as was the consensus on the post, I casually asked him for the receipt alongside his bank details. He asked me why I needed it and I just said it's for my own budgeting records. Low and behold, it turns out he hadn't actually bought it but was ""planning on buying it once everyone had chipped in"" which contradicts his original request but ok. He then calls me saying he's having second thoughts about the gift as everyone's being long about getting the money together and saying it's too expensive. So we just say fine forget about it...

All of it sounds very shady to me, and I suspect he already had the gift (maybe was a gift he received himself), that he was planning on re-gifting and possibly profiting off. None of this is surprising from him, but it's still disappointing that my suspicions look to be justified.

1657,Not the A-hole,"During the moving process of finding an apartment, my roommate's parents were single-handedly the most difficult people to deal with. The following events all took place in chronological order. 




- I originally wanted to move in April in order to avoid having to move during finals. His parents shot down the idea and told him that he was not allowed to sign the lease until May. 


- We prepared a complete list of furniture together without our parents' involvement. (Keep in mind that we are both 19. My parents who live abroad simply gave me a budget and told me to sort it out myself). My roommate's parents vetoed the list of furniture and told us that everything had to be cheaper. Ok no worries, I proceed to sit on my own and recreate an entire list of furniture and then send it again. For a second time, It was rejected because the “couch was too expensive for no reason” (Keep in mind this couch is being bought used)


- Sensing an approach to the move in date and the fact that I still was not given the ok to buy the furniture. I tell my roommate that I need to buy the furniture because he is leaving for summer and I do not want to be stuck building it all on my own. For an entire week, my roommate then avoids me completely telling me that he has finals and not to bother him.


- His parents refuse to allow me to purchase the furniture and tell me to wait. (It is now May 1st, I have the keys to the apartment and no furniture I managed to convince my dorm to allow me to stay a couple of extra days)


- Since the delivery date of the furniture would now be after he leaves I asked him if his parents would be willing to split the assembly fee so that I would not have to build everything on my own. His parents said no. They would not pay for someone to come assemble the furniture because it would be an extra 100$.


- May 3rd I receive a call from my dad. My dad has always been more of the strict type, he berated me on the phone for not having been organized enough to sort out buying furniture for an apartment as a 19-year-old. I was told to just buy whatever furniture I want out of my pocket rather than wait on my roommate to respond. My mom had also forced my dad to buy a plane ticket to fly 18 hours to come to assist me in moving. 


- After my dad flew 18 hours to come to assist me and my roommate in moving and building all of the furniture my roommate told me that his parents were coming to our city for the summer and that they wanted to stay in the apartment for a month and a half. He wanted them to sleep in my room.



After my roommate left I hired a carpenter and installed a key lock on the door of my bedroom. Since I paid for the TV, Couch, and pretty much 60% of all the furniture my dad wanted me to put the couch and tv in storage.

I was surprised to see her as a new starter. She avoided me during her first shift and one of my other colleagues gave me the details. Apparently she has been kicked out of uni and has been made to get the job as some sort of ''tough love'' punishment from her parents. 

Now, I wasn't going to continue old grudges. She was being trained by somebody else but if she was working with me I'd tell her everything she needed to know and wouldn't try to make things difficult for her. Our drink machine is dodgy and I warned her of this, and said she didn't have to do it if she didn't feel comfortable. She did so anyway and got splattered, and I did laugh at her even though she cried. 

Last week she came to work blatantly stoned. I could smell the weed on her breath and I didn't think this was appropriate and informed the manager who sent her home and put her on an official warning. I don't regret this at all. I don't like my job but I would never turn up to work drunk or high. 

One thing I do regret doing is telling my friends that she is now working with me. I didn't tell them to do anything, however they decided to come to the shop were basically quietly mocking her at the counter. This happened yesterday and she had a panic attack and had to go home. I had a word with my friends about this and said the shouldn't have done it, and they all agree it was wrong. 

I feel like I'm turning into someone I don't want to be. I have never picked on someone at work before and don't want to start, but I feel like I haven't acted appropriately towards her.",25,44,0.85
1660,Not the A-hole,"Hello,
So I am a student and I have a part time job. I work long hours and I have important standardized tests to study for to prepare for grad school as well as balance an internship. I work a lot of hours sometimes up to 12 a day. One day I worked 7 hours and I got a call from “joe” in the office . He works in scheduling and asked if I wanted to pick up a  6 hours shift. I said “no, I am tired and I have some things to do after this shift .” He responded with : “well what do you have to do that you can’t pick up the shift.” 
I got annoyed, told him
I don’t have to explain myself . And hung up. The same instance repeats for weeks ... I pick up shifts frequently but I’m human for goodness sakes ! I need a break and have a life outside of this “part time “ job!


So a few days ago I do an on call shift . At my job the moment you clock into on call you are paid regardless . If you are on call 8AM-6PM, you are paid 10 hours even if you were only called in for 1. I called him and reminded him I am working on call Saturday . He agreed and said he would note that in my portal. I got called in for a 2 hour shift. I called Monday to clarify that I get my 10 hours and he says no I “picked up a shift I was not on call”
I lost it . I got bat crazy and tell him I need my extra 8 hours. I cleared my day on call waiting to get called in and got called in. Picking up a shift would be me calling in before or getting a choice to go in. I complained to HR , he was scolded and I got my full 10 hours and an extra 2 as well as a bonus. They apologized . A few weeks later he was pulled from scheduling to another position as they said a lot of people have had issues with him
In the scheduling section of the office. I still feel bad though. I feel like I tipped the cup over. AITA?",37,80,0.78

It is a very good school, but I am tired of being around girls all the time. It is very cliquey and while I have some friends, I always feel like I’m missing out. I want to attend a normal school, at least one with both boys and girls. It will be good to have male friends as well as female.

I raised this with my parents last night, but they refused to hear my points. They said that this school is one of the best in the country and I should be grateful. They said that it has been proven that single-sex schools produce the best results, and that I should be focusing on my studies and not boys. 

I argued further but my mother got mad at me for talking back. AITA? I know I’m only 15 but shouldn’t I have a say in these things?",62,67,0.89
1667,No A-holes here,"My wife is usually a uk size 6-8. So really really slim.  We just had our first baby 6 weeks ago and right up until before she gave birth she kept excitedly telling me she couldn’t wait to lose the baby weight and she was going to go HARD on diet and exercise as soon as she could. She still looked tiny even at full term, her bump was tiny and she’d only gained around 30 lbs (if that) 

Thinking I’d surprise her a couple days ago I bought her a shit bunch (easily around £500 worth) of under armour, Nike, Adidas sports gear which is the sort of fashion she favours, and I got it in her regular size thinking she’d be offended if I got it any larger especially since she’d been talking so much about wanting a new wardrobe and wanting to be back to her usual size. I kept all the tags on and got gift receipts for everything, and when I presented it to her she had a full on meltdown and started crying and crying and telling me that I don’t value her and I think she’s fat. I admit it wasn’t my best moment either and I started crying too (just mega overwhelmed with my new little dude and we are both running on 0 sleep) and told her I didn’t mean to make her feel bad and I was just trying to help. 

The bags of clothes have just been sitting in the hallway for the past 4 days and I feel immensely guilty and upset every time I walk past them.

1668,Not the A-hole,"When I was 17 I moved out of my mom's house and went to live with a boyfriend. I wasn't on bad terms with my family or anything- I just loved my bf. Anyway, at the time my mom didn't cover anything for me financially. There was a solid 2 years where I just ate ramen because my bf was struggling and I didn't want to burden him. I asked my mom several times especially within the first year if I could have some money for food, or for something I needed for school and told her how we were struggling. She sent me $20 twice but just told me that I was moved out now and had to make it work.
 
Fast forward to January of this year, my boyfriend died and I move back in with my mom for the time being while I try to figure my life out and get back on track. I asked her if she wanted me to pay rent or anything and she told me that she did not and she'd feel weird taking money from her kids. 

My sister(she's 24) decides that she wants to move out and live with her boyfriend and his mom/brother. My sister doesn't work and instead of going to her boyfriend/his family for things she comes back to my mom. My mom buys her clothes, shoes, pays for her phone service, pays for gifts she can give to her bf and his family for holidays/birthdays and when my sister told her that she only eats sandwiches, spaghetti and hotdogs- my mom decided to start giving her food money. 

Because of this she's started needing money to cover bills so in turn she comes to me. I'm working part time while I adjust to my medications/life in general and trying to just build up savings. Depending on what my sister asks for, one month she wanted $200 but lately it's been nearing 350-400 bucks. 

I'm definitely annoyed that she's still covering for my sister after she cut me off when I moved out. I spoke with a friend and she says that maybe my mom realized she made a mistake with me and didn't want to do the same for my sister and she just told me that family helps out family. I'd still be a little annoyed but I feel that she should at least cut back and not spend so much on her.

When we got home my fiance got annoyed and asked me why I wasn't going to wear one. I don't think I should wear one since I'm not Scottish and I wouldn't really be comfortable in one. She says that since I am marrying a Scottish woman and the wedding is in Scotland then it's acceptable and it is a tradition so I should follow it and it would mean a lot to her if I did. I have been to 2 of her relatives weddings and not all the men were wearing a kilt, it was probably about 50/50, although both grooms were wearing one. Even if I felt I should wear a kilt I still wouldn't want to and would be much more confortable in a suit. My fiance is pretty upset about it but I am still against it.

1672,Not the A-hole,"I've been seeing Kelly (names changed) for two years. She became pregnant very early on and gave birth to twin girls. I was adamant in not wanting children and she expressed similar ideas. We mutually agreed on a plan in case of accidental pregnancy but she didn't follow through when the time came. I'm not going to mince words about pro-choice or whatever: it was her decision and while I gave input, it was completely up to her.

Kelly decided to bring the twins to term and I would at least attempt to be a father. They're six months old now and I don't think this is the kind of life for me. I was vocal to Kelly about my thoughts and feelings and while she was upset, she relented it's a life I never wanted and she wouldn't stop me from leaving. It would be amicable.

I don't want to be a deadbeat dad, though. I'm speaking to a lawyer now about organizing a lump sum child support payment which will cover 25 years (the law here is 18 years plus 4 for college if necessary, the additional 3 is extra). Whether or not they use that extra 4 years for college is up to them. I'm paying more out of choice, not legality. Spousal support isn't on the table because it depends on coliving (we didn't), marriage (we didn't). At every point in the child support calculation, we've considered the high end for my income to benefit Kelly and our children the most. We're talking normally I'd be on the hook for $350,000\~ when I'm putting forward $530,000\~.

I know parenting isn't about money but it's all I can really do. Maybe in the future I'll change my mind and rejoin their lives if they'll let me, but this isn't the path I want for my life, at least not now.

Am I the asshole here? What can I do to not be the asshole?

edit: for some extra context and to quickfire get out some facts: I travel 40-50 times a year to remote places like Russia, Bermuda, Hong Kong, Australia, 20-30 times a year to the US. I'm in Canada. I am maybe home 20 days a year. I make high six figures and my girlfriend makes high five figures. Regarding rejoining their lives, it would only be if every party consents and terms are agreeable. If they don't want me involved in 10 years, I won't push it. I'd like to be a part of their lives, I just need to focus on work right now. I could retire in 5-10 years and be set for life as well as my children set for life. I just don't want to be a father *now*. I'm 26, she's 25. She used the patch and we used condoms about 50% of the time. The children are indeed mine as confirmed by third-party testing. If I were to rejoin their lives, I wouldn't ask for the child support back.",1607,2420,0.93

I was hesitant at first because I'm not really into letting people, especially strangers, touch my phone. But her story made me stressed so I told her yes, but (And I said it beforehand) I'll put my phone on speaker and hold it.

So after she made the call she suddenly turns to me and asks me all annoyed why I didn't let her hold it and I didn't want to get into it so I was like ""oh you know..."" and she says ""no I don't."" So I just flat out told her ""I don't mind giving a call but I don't want to give strangers my phone"" so she says ""I don't know what you thought I'd do but thanks"" all coldly.

I told my friend about it and she says she gets the woman and that i was rude because I must've offended her and insinuated she's either dirty or a thief. But I just tried to be nice and helpful within my boundaries because it's my phone after all and I can't afford the option of it being stolen.

1674,Not the A-hole,"A little backstory, we've had ferrets my whole life.  I had a ferret, Perry, she was the love of my life pretty much. Last year, in August, I had to leave her at home to go to college where my mkm took care of her. Thing is, my ferret didn't like anyone but me. She didn't bite or anything, just super judgey and would not listen to the person. She had a thing for fortune cookies. I would feed her a small (very small) piece maybe every month or two (not good for animals I know but she really got me with those eyes). When I left, my mom wanted to get my ferret to like her so she fed her WHOLE fortune cookies everyday for TWO WEEKS. I came home for a weekend to find her very thin and frail. Soon after my ferret died. She was 4 years old. To give context, ferrets generally live around 7-9 years (we've had one love to ripe age of 14). To try and ""make up"" for this happening my mom got me a ferret last Christmas. I intend to take him to college with me this time because I feel I can't trust her enough to take care of him properly. We had an agrument about this and I effectively told her I can't trust her enough to take care of my animals. Am I the asshole?

Edit:
Saw a comment about why I didn't take her with me in the first place, I wasn't able to get her registered as any kind of support animal because the year had already started but I have gotten him registered so he can stay in the dorms with me. I have bad anxiety and getting her registered wasn't something I thought of when I first started college. 

(Edit 4: see a lot of people mentioning that me registering him was wrong because it's illegal and yatta yatta yatta. I did not go online and get a piece of paper. I talked to my therapist, my animals acually help me to calm down when I'm extremely anxious or having panic attacks. This only applies when I'm at school. I can't take him to work, I can't take him in public, it is simply for having him in my dorm.)

Edit 2:
I didn't leave her any instructions on care. With 19, going on 20 years of caring for her own ferrets, I figured she wouldn't need any kind of guidelines on do's and don'ts.

Edit 3:

She never texted me to tell me she decided to come. The game ended up being cancelled because the fields were soaked from rain. Since my girlfriend never texted me to ask where the field was, I just assumed she didn’t plan on coming and so I never told her it was cancelled. She drove an hour just to discover no one was there. She sent me a salty text saying “thanks for letting me know it was cancelled”. I replied by explaining that this wasn’t my fault since we agreed that she would let me know if she was going to come.

1676,Everyone Sucks,"Ages are all late 20s early 30s.

A few weeks ago my friend came over to try on some clothes. My husband came home and walked in on her changing, seeing her nearly naked. It was embarrassing and awkward, but we all got over it with some nervous laughter. Or so i thought.

My husband will not drop it. Constantly making comments about it to me, and to them whenever we get together.  So I invite them over to clear the air and for my husband to apologize. He does and we have drinks and play some games. My friends husband was winning and makes a comment about it, and my husband brings it up again! But this time it felt like it was to be hurtful. 

We've all had enough of it, and I certainly have too. So I whipped off my top and bra and say ""Now everyone's seen my tits so you can finally DROP IT!"". 

That was this weekend and hes been pretty upset, but I don't think he realized how upset he has been making everyone else feel. I'm starting to think I went too far but I also think I had to do something.

I left out a lot of details but that's the gist of it. So am I the asshole?

Edit: It was pointed out I should add some info. We have talked about it, many times. Little fights and big ones. He just says stuff like ""oh i'm just joking"". He has made comments to me in private about it, and in front of the other couple. He thinks hes just being funny or something i'm not really sure. He's always been a bit crass but never insulting like this. We're doing okay, we are both upset and both realizing we messed up and I'm going to suggest we see councilor to mend this up.

And I don't think they were really offended about seeing me, probably more mortified about the blow up.

Edit 2: okay so... This has got to a point where I can't really reply to each comment. And maybe I should have posted this in r/relationship_advice? 

Well anyways here's a little more info. 

To the people saying I ""forced them to see my boobs without their consent"". I've known her almost half my life and feel I know her husband well enough to have a pretty good gauge on how they would feel about it. And you can see boobs out in public in some places, I didn't masterbate infront of them, Jesus. 

This isn't the end of our relationship or friendship. Yeah we're both pissed at eachother, but some of you are making it wayy more worse than it sounds. I've been talking to my friend and we just want everything to be water under the bridge. 

I definitely come to the conclusion with a lot of your comments that there's something more here going on that we will be talking about. 

I know it's hard not to judge a person based on this post, but it's only been the smallest portion of our relationship. This is out of character for him. The best way I can describe his normal behavior is like the brother in law Hank from breaking bad. He can be a ball buster but he obviously took it too far this time. 

I'm not going to post my tits. 

I'm going to talk to him tonight and I'll make a final edit. 

I don't really know what the verdict here is, but yeah two wrongs don't make a right. I don't normally do this sort of thing and I was embarrassed the next morning. A lot of people called us immature, and yeah I'll have to accept that as the whole thing was pretty childish.

Final Edit: Well is not as insightful as I was hoping, but we did talk tonight. We both apologized to each other (again) and he's going to apologize to them. He knows he took it too far and acted childish and regrets it. I showed him the post and we read a few of the comments, some of which were really helpful and we both felt pretty embarrassed. As to why he was so obsessed, he really didn't have an answer. I asked if he had a crush on my friend, if he thought I didn't look good anymore, if he was jealous or resented them. He said no to all, but admitted he may be a little jealous (i guess). But we didn't go too far into it. When i brought up counseling he pushed the idea saying we didn't need it. I told him don't think of it like therapy more as getting out your thoughts with a mediator present and he eventually agreed ( we did pre-marriage counseling before).

After seeing him do it to multiple machines, I brought him his own sanitizer doused paper towel and told him he can use it to wipe his stuff down after. He gave me a weird look and rolled his eyes, said “Ok” and that was the end of it. A few other people looked at me funny too.

They argued a lot and my sister would bitch to me about him all the time. I really liked the guy, he seemed like a decent person. We got along etc. 

My sister would say things like - I hate him, he’s ugly, he smells so bad, his d*ck is so small. And that she wanted to go back to her ex (that she cheated on before) she would go into a lot of detail about this and it was never just a one off comment. 

I would tell her straight up that she shouldn’t be with him if she feels like that, and she would just put it down to in the heat of the moment but she would say these things *daily* 

One day I’m driving in the car with them in the back seat, and my sister creates an argument with me over the pettiest thing and becomes really hostile, so I lost my shit and blurted out everything to her boyfriend to tell him what she’s really like. 

He is clearly angry about it all and thanked me for telling him, but my sister was absolutely infuriated and didn’t speak to me for 4 months because ‘we’re family’ and it should be kept secret. 

To this day she cheats on every guy she’s with and I still get called a ‘snake’ for doing what I done. She makes me feel so bad about it but I feel like it needed to be heard.

There are three children, elementary aged, that live on my street, two a couple houses down from me, the other across the street from them. They are constantly running into the road to cross, or after something, or riding some toy down the middle (bike, three-wheeler, scooter). As such I creep down my road past their house to get to mine. Like, 10-15 mph with the clutch in and my foot hovering over the break. 

Well, about a week ago I am creeping along as the kids are riding bikes down the middle of the road. The youngest is in the middle of the road heading for me, but looking behind her to her brother. I realized that she isn’t going to stop so, with cars on either side so I couldn’t pull over, I come to a stop in the middle of the road. 

As I am putting my car in reverse, she turns around and sees me. She swerves around me, and lets out a “Whoa.” I wait for the others to clear the road, and move past and park in my driveway. I was getting out of my car when the girl rides up behind my car. “You almost hit me!”

I calmly told her that no, she almost hit me, and that she and her brother are the reason why I got a dashcam. (There are other benefits, but the kids were my primary motivation.) She didn’t understand, but then asked about my daughter (high school age) and if she was still in school because she’s so old. 

I answered, and went inside thinking nothing more of it. About an hour later there is a hammering on my door. My husband answered to see the girl’s mom. She sees me and starts screaming about how horrible I am that I told her daughter that I got a dashcam because of her and her brother. 

My husband closed the door in her face and locked it. 

I recounted this to a coworker, and they said I’m an asshole for telling the kid the truth even if it didn't bother the kid. I don’t think so because the kids need to learn to have more awareness around the road. So I will accept my judgment.",842,10030,0.94
1685,Not the A-hole,"My aunt sends me money on a monthly basis and she personally said that money is for me to buy the things that i want since i have the tendency to impulsively spend money i asked my mother to keep it until ive got enough to buy a good PC or laptop, since for some petty reason she wouldnt let me get my own debit card,she said yes she would keep it. 

After a year, now that my college life is demanding more and more i have decided to finally buy the laptop(because i dont have one) i wanted and when i asked her where the money is she said theres no money. I asked again but i got the same answer until she said that she had used the money to pay for my college bills and such but the thing is, my aunt sends more money for those bills which is separate from the money shes giving to me. Obviously I got mad since i badly need a laptop but then she also got mad because im being demanding and calculating about it, she reasons out that the money my aunt is sending for my college bills isnt enough when shes paying more than half if not all of it. then she started to say hurtful things such as ""im the one sending you to college, you dont have the right to question me"" but at that point i thought shes not the one sending me to college and unfortunately i had verbalised it enough for her to hear and got kicked out of the house.

1687,Not the A-hole,"So recently my school has done their annual talent quest. One of the girls in our year went and audition but didn’t make it into the finals. 

She apparently was rather sour to one of the head students who congratulated her on giving it a go and that she did well. She later went on in our group chat about how the judging was unfair. 

“Sorry me and my fam are pissed off with the unfair judging.” 

While I didn’t see her full performance, I did see part of her singing. And I could barely hear her. 

Meanwhile the ones that did move on in our school level, did have really good acts. Although there were a couple I didn’t get to see. 

WIBTA if I mentioned that I thought the judging was fair, if the conversation came up at school tomorrow? Mind you the talent show at our school is very relaxed, so you do have a few people taking stuff for shit and giggles, such as a full year piss take, which I had taken part in as well. 

Now I do give her credit for getting up there and giving it ago, as I don’t think I could have by myself. But I just found her comment to be rather unfair, and downplaying of the people that were moved into the finals, as some were quite talented.",17,30,0.89
1688,Asshole,"Throwaway as this is a very sensitive topic.

One of my students hasn't done their homework a few times in a row, and per school policy, I have to email their parents about the problem and give them a detention. When I told the student this, she immediately started crying. I was quite shocked, as she's usually quite calm, collected and just a confident student overall. She ran out of the room, and I sent her friend after her to calm her down. Later, I sat her down and talked to her about what was upsetting her. The poor girl was offering to do the detention but was pleading that I wouldn't email her parents. Her reasons were very scattered and did not make any sense, but from little snippets of what she was telling me, I could tell that there was some sort of domestic abuse going on at home.

I am an Asian woman, and I have also experienced this type of violence at home from when I was growing up. While it was painful and unfair, I do believe that the aggression did not come from a place of hate and is a common disciplinary method for Asians. I also could not imagine someone taking my parents away for them beating me, because although I hated it, I truly felt like my parents loved me and we have good relations to this day. They are definitely not narcissists.

This girl is from the same country as me, so I suspect that what she is going through at home is also a cultural, disciplinary thing. However, I don't want to take any chances with a topic as sensitive as this, especially since she was driven to the point of tears from the mere thought of her parents hearing about her detention. I am at a total loss for what to do. On the one hand, I could give her a secret detention, but that would not be following school policy. On the other hand, I could email her parents about the issue, which would probably result in violence at home. Or, I could not give her any punishment at all, which I feel is too lenient. WIBTA? I hope to get lots of different perspectives.

EDIT: I was asking for advice on whether I should send an email home for the child, but yes, I have informed my supervisor. I do not live in the United States, and I live in a country where corporal punishment at home is not illegal. My supervisor has arranged for the student to meet with the school counsellor to work through what she's facing, but legally, there is nothing we can do. Please stop telling me I deserve to lose my job, it genuinely hurts.

EDIT II: We have not emailed the student's parents, nor have we given her a detention. Instead, we've decided to call them in to talk about the situation that happened and clear the air. After talking to the child again, she was much calmer and told me that she cried because she couldn't handle the workload and that she didn't want her parents to be disappointed in her. When I asked her if any sort of violence was happening at home, she denied it with a very straight face. It could be a lie, which is why we've called in the parents to make sure that there is not abusive behaviour. We've also decided to cut down on homework for the whole class.

Also, fuck off. I am not justifying abuse, and maybe I worded it wrong when I said 'abuse' in my original post rather than 'corporal punishment'. I meant that, from my own experiences, I could not imagine authorities taking my parents away because they beat me. A lot of you don't seem to fucking understand that no-one in the school could give less of a shit about this due to the fact that it's very common - no-one is helping me because they don't think it's a serious issue. As well as this, not punishing this student is controversial in my school because the school head assumes that this happens to everyone.",131,234,0.85
1689,Asshole,"My ex and I had been together for 3 years, living together for the last 7 months. Things had hit a bit of a lull and I discovered evidence she had been cheating on me with a colleague (inconsistencies in story, a mutual friend mentioning they saw her in town with this person, etc) and found nudes confirming it when she left her email logged into my PC. I wasn't sure how to approach her with this information and I was in a bit of a fugue state between wanting to (emotionally and to my shame, physically) hurt her and just wanting to stop the pain. I thought maybe there was a reason why but couldn't understand so when I seemed to lose interest/be cold I just said I wasn't feeling in the mood, spent more nights working overtime so I could avoid seeing her. When she was out I fit a lock to my bedroom door and discreetly moved her stuff into the spare room

However, what really sank things for me was when she came to me not even a week later to inform me that she was pregnant and acting like this was the chance to start 'our' family. This didn't make sense however as we always took precautions so I knew almost immediately it wasn't mine. I didn't say anything, didn't express emotion or anything an 'expectant father' should, I just said 'okay, we'll talk about it tomorrow' and went to go play some RE2 much to her dismay. She confronted me in tears expecting more response and then I just snapped and completely tore into her, telling her that I knew she'd been cheating on me and when she denied it showed her the trail of nudes I'd saved between her and colleague. Ultimately that night I made her sleep on the pullout sofa bed while I tried to make sense of things, started work early the next day and worked from around 7AM to 6:20PM

Over the next few days, my ex tries talking things out with me, I shrug her off and just disconnect her as much as I can until eventually she begged me enough to give her a second chance and part of me decided to hear her out. Eventually after some deliberation I agree to consider it if she'll terminate the pregnancy (I told her we weren't ready), simply because A - it isn't mine, for the sake of the child (who I was afraid I'd grow to resent, nobody deserves that) and B - even if it was mine the cheating leaves me doubting we could offer a stable childhood. My ex soon goes through with the abortion and terminates her pregnancy, after which I still can't move on so make it clear that I just can't see us with a future together and tell her I'm no longer interested. I told her to get her things together and leave (house is mine, inherited from grandparents - all she paid was her share towards shopping and one or two bills). I offered to keep some of her stuff in storage until she can make arrangements but for both our sakes I don't want her under the same roof. Had other issues but cheating was final straw. She bawled as I made her pack her things and go. She is living with her parents now and  although I get shit I feel better now",299,156,0.83

1691,Not the A-hole,"Long time lurker, desperately need outside judgement on this because all my real life responses are so mixed.

I (22f) have been with my boyfriend (30) for a few months now. He moved to England just over two years ago. I really like the guy but he has so many issues regarding English 'culture'/norms and he's making no effort to change them.

We went out with my friends for dinner last week at a really popular British chain. Two of the people we went out with work at other branches of the same chain. We all ate our meals and had a great time, but after we all left my boyfriend was in a real mood. We were heading to a bar to get some drinks and out of nowhere he just snapped 'I think it's absolutely disgusting that not one of you left a tip, do you know how much those wait staff earn?'. One of my friends who works at another branch said 'Over £8 an hour?' (a couple of pounds above minimum wage) and he just sulked. When we got home that night he was still moody, and I tried to explain to him that we just don't really tip here very often because the servers get paid hourly. He thinks it's disgusting.

He also has an issue with me just being on the pill. In England, people in committed relationships with no STDs tend to just use one form of contraception **(note: I'm not looking for judgement on whether these norms are right or not)** and for me, my preferred one is the pill. He went crazy about this, saying that we have to use condoms (changed his mind later that night when he wanted sex) and where he's from taking just the pill is 'begging to be pregnant'.

He does things like this a lot. There's smaller examples, like getting pissed off when my brother (who is 18, legal age to drink here) drinks alcohol in front of him. My sister is at university and he refuses to call it anything but 'college' when college here is something you do before you're able to go to uni (and is typically, at least in my part of the UK, seen as something less academic students do).

I know that he's being rude and I'm not the asshole for that, but we recently had a fight about it in which I declared 'if the only thing you like about this country is the free healthcare and that they speak English, you should fuck off'. Since then, he's been really upset. I don't think he knows how annoying he was. AITA for shouting at him rather than speaking?

Edit: he said we have to use condoms alongside the pill and went on a rant about how one form isn't enough. I don't have an issue with condoms.",3711,10591,0.86
1692,No A-holes here,"This is a big one and it’s been bugging me for months now, so I figured I’d let Reddit judge my case. I’m using a throwaway because the guy in question knows my Reddit and well, he still doesn’t know why I stopped having feelings for him.  (TL;DR at the end)

Alright so a year or so back, I was speaking to a guy I had met on a discord server almost every day. We had the same interests, we liked the same things, had the same humor, etc. In short, we got along amazingly well and we grew to be the best of friends. 

Then, over the months, friendship kinda evolved into something more. We had crushes on each other, we started speaking about dating and even though I’ve never been sold on long distance, I was genuinely ready to try it with him. 

The problem appeared once we started to share selfies. Now Reddit, I’m no idiot, I know how physical attraction works and I had already seen pictures of him before all of that happened (as he had of me). The thing was, they were rather old pictures, from a while ago. I didn’t think much of it, he was cute back then so why wouldn’t he be now ? 

Well boy was I wrong. I don’t even really remember how it happened, we were just speaking and I asked to see a picture of the new beanie he had bought. So he sent me a picture of himself. And as much as I immediately hated myself for thinking that, he was not attractive anymore. Not to me at least. In the time lapse between the pictures he had sent me and now, he had become a man I could never see myself dating. 

At this point, I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t even know if I still liked him. So I started pulling away. At first it was nothing : thinking « oh I’d reply later » when he sent me a text, not calling him like I did everyday, etc. Then, over time, I realized I didn’t feel anything romantic for him anymore. He was still a great friend and person but I couldn’t fool myself into thinking that his looks hadn’t been a game changer. 

After a while, I called him to tell him that my feelings for him had drifted away, that we had rushed into things because of how well we got along and that we were better off as friends. He was hurt but he accepted it and we simply moved on from it. I never told him the truth nor did I tell anyone else because I felt disgusting for judging someone I liked so much based on something as stupid as looks. 

Even though it’s been so long, I can’t help but feel horrible because I know for a fact that I broke his heart and I had no valid reason besides my own shallowness. So, AITA ?

tl;dr : i genuinely liked a guy I was flirting with until I saw his face and realized I found him unattractive

1695,Asshole,"I hate when discussions get emotional, which is why I am trying to get some ""outsider"" point of view on the situation. 

Backstory:
A friend and I both right now live in a student residence. I pay 410€ for a 11sqm (square meter) room and he went for the bigger one with 440€ and 14sqm. 
We both have been looking for an appartment quite a while now to open a shared flat with other students. Mostly because of the reason that the residence is pretty expensive for the room size. 

We also already found the 2 other students we will share the appartment with. Together we were all looking for the right flat for us. We found one and next week we want to sign the contract. 

The problem or discussion now is how much does everybody pay. Obviously a pretty heated topic. 

Main topic: 
The appartment we found is really beautiful, everything looks awesome and the location is exactly what we wanted. There are 4 rooms, 3 have ~25sqm and 1 has ~13sqm. (1 room of the 25sqm has to be gone through to get to a second 25sqm room, which we agreed to not consider in the rent calculation). The 13 and the other 25 sqm have a separate entrance. 

Now the 2 other students know each other well and agreed to take the 2 rooms with the entrance situation. 
Me and said friend agreed that I take the bigger room and he takes the smaller one, because for him the money is a bigger ""issue"", since he also always complains about the price of the residence we live in. 

Now to the price calculation. If you calculate the price exactly with the amount of sqm used we get to a price of 441 for the 25 and 274 for the 13 sqm rooms. The discussion we all have now is, that in the city we live in you will never get a room with these sqm, this location, this beautiful kitchen, bathroom etc. for a price of 274. 

So we said we want him to pay 340 (a price built comparing other flats with sqm, location and so on (which we would get if we looked for someone else on the internet to move in with us)), which brings the rest of us to a price of 419. 

Now he feels like we try to make him pay more so we get to pay less and believes he is treated unfair. 
We feel like he is trying to push down prices so he gets to pay less and we have to pay more, because in no other flat would a price like that be possible for him. 


Something to consider aswell is that, none of us can afford the appartment on their own, since we are all students and no one works on the side. Therefore our parents will pay the rent. 

I hope I described our situation appropriately, from a neutral point of view and everything is understandable, if not please ask. 

So reddit, tell me AITA / AreWeTheAssholes?





Edit: Some mentioned the shared space. The Rooms we all share: kitchen, etc are distriputed equally. Combined solely with the sqm of the individual rooms we get to the 274 and 441.



Edit2: First off, thank you all for your contribution. I realise that the prices are fair if calculated the way we did (despite many thinking we made a mistake, I am sure the calculation itself is not off). My point though is (and i feel like some did not get it or we are bigger assholes than we thought). If we decline that appartment and look for a similar one, it is very likely that we get an appartment that is 1. not as nice in the shared rooms, 2. has same sized rooms (because obviously we cant handle different sizes). Then all of us would probably have to pay around ~380 - 400€ for between 12-15 sqm all that changes is: We have to be in a smaller room and pay less, he is in a almost same sized room and pays more. That would be fair, but still a lose for him and ~ok for us. While taking this appartment and adjusting the rent would not be fair as of sqm but still a win for him because of very small rent for very nice flat and yes (an even bigger) win for us because of same reasons. 
I am considering taking the small room for our calculated rent because i am neither willing to give up a friendship nor to give up this appartment.",92,178,0.94

1697,Everyone Sucks,"My family has an ""unlimited"" data plan that goes goes into reduced speeds after 8 GB. There's 4 people on the plan, and after 8 GB the data becomes practically unusable. My parents don't use the data hardly at all and I always restrict my data use to 2 GB or less per month (my phone shows how much I've used per cycle). My brother uses over 6 GB per month if I don't use my 2 GB. He's 17, so he's old enough to know what he's doing. 

This past month, we get a text saying that we were in reduced speeds only 10 days into the cycle. And when I say reduced speeds, I mean that dial up would have been faster. Searching anything online became impossible, and my apps that use internet won't work properly. After what happened, I'm going off my family plan to my own plan because nothing like this can happen again.

Where I live, we recently had some very strong tornado producing storms. I was staying at my friend's house. None of us knew that there were storms coming, let alone dangerous ones.

The internet at my friend's house got cut out, and we saw lighting in the distance. I tried turning my data on to see if there was anything bad coming, but couldn't get anything to load. Neither of my other friends had cell service due to their cell towers being knocked over. None of us heard tornado sirens going off either, but the lightning was so loud and constant that it was hard to hear anything over it. 

We all got emergency alerts for a tornado warning from the National Weather Service, but by that point the storm was already on top of us.

We took cover immediately, and luckily the tornado didn't hit us. But we were about a mile east of where it stopped, so we were very lucky to avoid it.

I kept trying to get radar on my phone to load, or at least something that would tell me what was going on while we were in the basement. The reduced speeds made it impossible to search for anything, and the internet was still out.

I want to tell my brother that him using so much data could have put my life in danger, but I don't know if it was something that I should talk to my parents about first.

WIBTA if I told my brother this directly?

Edit for clarification:

My friends have a different carrier than I do. Their cell towers were knocked out, but mine wasn't. 

By the time we got the emergency alerts that there was a tornado, it had already touched down. I don't know why we didn't get them sooner than that.

We went to the basement as soon as we got the alerts.

As far as I know, emergency alerts will go through any cell tower available (like how 911 will work even if your phone isn't active). However, you may not be able to connect to the tower for calls or data other than emergency services.

The tornado warning was set to expire at 2:00 am. We went to the basement at 10:30. We had no internet, my friends didn't have cell service, and I was the only one able to use my phone. I didn't just want radar, I wanted to be able to check and see what was going on and if it was safe to go up at any point.

I'm not blaming the tornado on my brother. That's insane, nobody can control the weather. I'm blaming him for the fact that I had wasn't able to look up and find more information on what was going on once I had taken cover.

We were not at my house, we were at my friend's house. She lives alone, but doesn't have a weather radio. This is her first storm season alone, so we weren't as prepared as we should have been. That is not my brother's fault that we didn't have a weather radio, but I should have been able to use cell data to connect to the internet to find out what is going on.

My parents have talked to my brother numerous times about using too much data. However, it's never been a major issue until this point. He knows he uses too much and doesn't care.

For the people saying that I'm being too dramatic: this was an F3 tornado that caused major damage to the city I was in. You don't mess with anger clouds, especially when it's 11 at night and you can't just look outside to see if it's clear or not. People existed before radar, but people also died from not knowing there was a cloud about to destroy their house in the middle of the night. 

We have meteorologists and a ton of technology that can detect tornados while they're still forming, and I was unable to access information to continue to keep myself safe once I knew I was in danger. That's why I'm mad at him for using all the data.",155,287,0.91

Beyond that, he insists that we are physically together when we're home. He doesn't want to be in another room 20 feet away, he wants to be on the same couch as me, all day every day.

I am an introvert and I NEED some time alone every once in a while or I genuinely start to malfunction. A few months ago I started to get terrible insomnia and told him ""I need some time alone, a little bit every day, I can't sleep at night"" etc.

Nothing changed.

i.e, yesterday I spent all morning with him. Then I went to work. I got home, exhausted, and went to go sit on the couch while he was on the bed. He told me ""why don't you come to the bed?"" and I said that I wanted to be alone for a while. He got sad and made me feel guilty about sitting semi-alone 20 feet away from him.

I haven't been sleeping again, and I know it's because I'm not getting enough (any) alone time. I've had to take sleeping pills for several nights now, and it's getting worse.

Today I was on the couch and he was sort of pacing around the room ""cleaning"" as he always does for an hour or two a day (but really he's just fidgeting with things, walking back and forth and back and forth 50 times, etc) and he asked me if everything is okay. I told him honestly that I am not sleeping well, I need more alone time.

He got offended and said ""so I can't walk through the living room?""

So. I’m 14.  We (me mom and brother) technically are the original owners of our dog.  He was my dads dog, my dad adopted him from the shelter about six years ago as a puppy. My dad tragically died two years ago.  When he died, he had a roommate/close friend who was really really attached to my dog.  She had been living  with my dad for a year up until he died. At the time my mom couldn’t keep my dog at her house because of her landlord, so my dads roommate kept the dog.  After a few months we tried to get him back after our landlord let us to have pets but the roommate REFUSED to give him back and had apparently register the dog in her name and took him to the vet and stuff and said he’s her dog now. We were all very upset because this dog is the last piece of my dad I have left. My mom called the police and told them the roommate technically stole our dog and they threatened to arrest her.  The roommate eventually gave in after fighting us for WEEKS because she decided she didn’t want to take us to court because she felt bad for us (my mom doesn’t have a lot of money and like come on my dad just effing died...) and so she gave us the dog back with all of his paperwork and everything.  But She was NOT kind about it at all.  I felt kind of bad because she was crying the whole time when we went to pick up my dog and she just said to take good care of him and my dog seemed to not want to leave.... But like he’s our dog. She only knew him for a year but he’s known us his whole life. 

It’s been two years now and we’re moving and my mom just told us we can’t keep the dog.  I’m devastated. I found my dads old roommate on Facebook and begged her to take the dog back because no one can take him and I do NOT want to take him to the pound.  She blocked me.  My brother tried to message her too and she blocked him as well.  My aunt said that we are being terrible people and harassing this woman and that we have no idea what her situation is even though we are just trying to do what’s right for our dog. and this person literally almost took us to court for this dog and only gave in because she was trying to be sympathetic, so I don’t understand why she’s being this way now when she obviously cared about him enough to try to sue us for him.  Also, she had the dog registered in her name, so she’s responsible for him anyway.

Now she found out and she's telling all our common friends that I'm a backstabbing bitch. I feel really bad for hurting her feelings. But I wasn't about to watch this poor guy's entire life go down by marrying a partner who cheats on him. What should I have done? AITA?

**Edit:** by ""cute"" I meant he's a really kind guy and not half as manipulative as she is. He's what you'd call a ""simpleton"" of sorts. I also want to come out and state I have no romantic interest in the guy. I cut off all contact with him after that talk. I also want to say that the girl was a good friend, and I was more shocked to see her behavior coz I really respected her before that.",147,389,0.92

1704,Not the A-hole,"Hi guys, this happened a few months back but just want to share a situation that happened to me and see if I could’ve handled it any better? I’ll try and be as unbiased as possible as I know there are two sides to a story.

Basically, I was running late (my fault entirely) and I managed to get to my train station with 10 minutes to spare before my train set off. If I didn’t catch this then I would be late for work. I needed to buy a month pass as it worked out cheaper and unfortunately the automated ticket machine does not sell these. 

Anyway, I queue up and I find myself behind a woman who was buying her child a ticket. I’m not completely sure what the issue was but I think it was to do with the ticket price and how unhappy she was that it had risen. After a minute or two of moaning she purchased the ticket and I thought that this should be the end of it. But no, she carried on moaning about how inconsiderate this is, all while ignoring the fact that I was waiting to be served. The ticket lady seemed empathetic with the parent’s issue but no matter what was said, the parent was having none of it. I was patient for 5 minutes but I knew I really had to make a move or I would miss this train and have to wait another 30 minutes for the next one, so I stepped forward and politely said “excuse me, do you mind if I just buy my ticket as I really need to be on this train.”

The parent flat out apologised, looked very sheepish and left the train station probably realising no matter how much she moaned, it would not change the national rise in train ticket prices. I walked up to the ticket office only for the lady behind the till to ask what I wanted. I asked for my months pass and as this was printing she said “can I just say that what you did there was extremely rude, if I am speaking to another customer then never interrupt me.” I was taken aback because I thought I had been extremely polite about the whole situation. I said that I didn’t mean to be and that I just needed to get this train. She then repeated her point about being rude and wouldn’t hand me my ticket.

By this point I needed to be on my train and I lost it, I snapped at her and said something along the lines of “to be honest I don’t care and if I don’t get on this train then I’ll be speaking to your manager.” She jumped as if she wasn’t expecting my reaction and handed my tickets straight over. I got on my train just in time as well. I hate being rude to customer service workers because I’ve been there and it’s a tough job but I would’ve acted differently if I was in her shoes. Also, I bought a ticket from her the other month and she didn’t greet me and she threw the tickets on the counter - why carry it on? I’ve obviously thought way too into this but yeah, was I the asshole in this situation?",15,30,0.85
1705,No A-holes here,"My wife and I are both Chinese and have 3 kids together.

My kids have always looked mixed (white + Asian) and it’s only become more apparent as they’ve grown up. Their skin is much fairer, they have freckles (no one in our families does), there is a brown tinge to their hair. Two of my kids have brown eyes, but the youngest clearly has a mix of brown and green (I know mix isn’t the right word, but it’s not solid brown like 99% of Asian). They also have white looking facial features... Especially their eyes and nose.

Honestly once you see it you can’t unsee it and it’s driving me crazy. I want to get a paternity test done behind my wife’s back on the youngest (that looks the most mixed) just for piece of mind.

1706,Not the A-hole,"This is a throwaway, my friend had stage 4 cancer. So many things happened with her and I to her final peace. I love her, til this day so much. Her husband was someone that I spoke to so much. We would cry together. We would reminisce about her, just being her! When she was passing and passed everyone was hit quite hard. 

He and I without  meaning to became close. We were around each other a lot, texting and talking on the phone when we weren't  face to face. I should probably mention. We are neighbors in an interesting village, if you may. 

For a longtime, we tried to be secretive. Our personal relationship was pretty soon and intense to my friend passing away. I had very intimate conversations with her prior to her passing.  So there was a majority that made me not feel extremely wrong. Although, there was a part that I was still mourning so confused. He and I would speak about it. As many years of her being sick went by. For him, there was a slight relief. I understood that from the hope and prayer, to no avail she would just be herself again. That time never came. It was very intense for everyone involved the final days still didn't feel final. 

Long story short, we connected out of a space I would never think of. With that happening, people we know have now told me witnessed us together. I have been called names, and asked was I dealing with him while my friend was still alive. 

Out of confusion and hurt I have dealt with the situation very gently. Also a way I would never let anyone speak to me.

1707,No A-holes here,"So a little background: I graduated 2 years ago from university and for my graduation present my mom bought me a beautiful corgi puppy named Ralphy Pickles. He has been the light of my life who brings me so much happiness in the world. However, last November I left America to travel to Australia on a WHV only intending on staying out of the country for maybe a year tops and coming home to my precious Pickles once I got traveling out of my system.

&#x200B;

Anyway, during my stint in Australia I've met someone and now I plan on staying in Australia long-term, less on a vacation basis but to try and build a life here. I've really missed my doggo during my time away and I FaceTime my dog with my mom who's been watching him throughout.  Well, now that I want to relocate, I can't imagine my life without Pickles but Australia has some VERY strict rules about allowing animals into the country and they must be in quarantine for minimum of 2 weeks before they get clearance and it costs more than $2000 for this process when you add up the cargo shipping, vet visits to get proper paperwork, and the quarantine. In addition, my mom lives alone, keeps to herself aside from working a lot still, and Pickles has really helped her since I've been gone (we're very close). 

&#x200B;

So basically, is it selfish of me for taking Pickles to Australia when I know my mother isn't physically capable of visiting Australia due to health reasons? Also, poor Pickles would have to fly as cargo, go through quarantine for 2 weeks MINIMUM and that's a lot of stress on a dog as well. I don't really know what I should do, but I miss my dog so much yet I don't know if it'd be worth the whole process and plus, my mother has grown to really love him as well in my absence.  PLUS, if I did decide to move Pickles to Australia, it wouldn't be happening until a more permanent visa is finalized and that wouldn't happen for another year or so.",41,27,0.92

From pissing wars to physical destruction. All ruined. The set cost me 1200 total and was brand new. They've agreed to buy me a brand new couch but are looking in the 500-600 range. 

When asked if they would pay me the difference for the value of the couch one agreed. The other refuses. Saying getting me a new couch is enough. I told him that I'm out the value I put in and he needs to take responsibility for his poorly disciplined dogs destroying my property. (This is not the only items they've destroyed or pissed on, just the only thing I want replaced with the added difference in my pocket or the full amount.)

But ive talked to a few friends and they basically said yes call him out about his use of the N word becuase hes a dick for saying that, but dont call him out for the stories becuase its clear he enjoys himself and id be ruining his fun for no reason.

1710,Not the A-hole,"I have a friend. She has a kid that'll be turning 8. We've been in and out of contact but we remain a good friendship. I actually like her kid, though she's a bit like her mother - no filter and tends to blurt out inappropriate questions that she knows makes people uncomfortable, along with being a bit spoiled. I've done some baby sitting for my friend for her kid but really, I'm just not cut out for that kind of job. Or rather I'm not cut out trying to lay down the law with someone else's kid.

This year, I'm turning 30 and I hadn't given to much thought what I wanted to do. For the first time in my life, I'm employed for my birthday which means I got money to spend, and I've worked hard to get myself to a place I never thought I'd be. I'm really happy and my boss has given me the 7th off so I could have a three day weekend. I want to do something exciting, something I've never done. And there is a lot that I haven't done!

My friend came over two weekends ago, insisting we do something ""combine"" for me and her daughter's birthday. I immediately felt my heart drop. I normally wouldn't have done it, but without a second thought I kinda laughed it off and told her no way. She immediately grew angry and defensive, asking why not - did I not like spending time with her daughter? Didn't I want all of us to be together during this special time? I was caught by surprise by her anger and just blurted out ""Because I would like to do what I want to do on that weekend, thats why."" Apparently that's not acceptable.

My birthday falls on the 8th, her daughter's falls on the 6th. I asked if maybe we could do the weekend before the 8th, she said that's not possible because of so-so reasons, something about funds and how it just wouldn't be right. I asked her maybe the next weekend between the 15th or the 16th - she told me I was being unreasonable, selfish and a bit of a bitch. I told her that if she wanted to have a birthday party on the 8th or 9th, I was going to be unavailable and that was that.

She left after we had that fight and she's texted me a couple of times, repeating that I was being selfish and that I broke her daughters ""heart"" because I didn't want to have a shared birthday party. I've been thinking about this for awhile because we never really had such a big fight until now and a part of me is wondering if maybe I'm being unreasonable? I don't mind her kid, but I really don't want to spend my birthday weekend with kids. I'd like to make my own plans and set up something for myself.

As for little tidbits of random information; The kid just met me like 3 years ago. We've only met about 15 or so times, including the times I've babysat her, and the first shared birthday party. I never thought I was one of those people that left a lasting impression on her.",159,334,0.94
1711,Everyone Sucks,"Just to give you some background .....I’m 24, just moved back with my parents, don’t have a car, and pretty much just starting my career fresh out of college. So I’m in a very dependent position myself I will admit. He’s 28/29, married, and has 3 kids under the age of 4.

So my mom and brother have this weird pattern going on where....she’s basically like the second wife.  Any and every problem he has with his family...he comes running to her and she solves it. Wife needs a nap? She will watch the kids. Kid needs to see the doctor? They bring the kid straight to my mom. Car missed up? Calls my mom. Has an argument with his wife? He will complain to our mom about it. I could go on...


It puts me in this weird position because not only does my mom refuse to ever deny him I look like the crazy person for getting upset/uncomfortable.

So here’s what happened today. Me and my mom had to take a 2/3 hour drive so I could test for my license. (I passed) Then we take the drive back. I have to include I’m pretty sure she used her last few dollars to make sure I had Burger King on the way back. While I’m thinking about how grateful I am and kind of feeling guilty because she had barely gotten anything for herself and I was kinda being a brat about being hungry ....my brother calls.

  First thing thing he says is not “hi” or “ how are you”. The first thing he says is  “ why didn’t you bring me food?” I’m think in my head oh my god if he were talking to me I would just hang up right there.

 As always I’m sure he doesn’t have groceries and his wife works nights. That leaves him stuck at home with kids. Not unusual but even more reason you should probably make sure you have groceries at home right???

So I try to hold my tongue, mind my business . Then my mom goes “maybe your sister...” Before she could finish I answered with a strong hard “NO! He needs to come get it!” That’s when my mom starts doing the whole

 “ really....he would do it for you” 
“You might need him one day”
“He has kids...now if it were you”
“You might need him one day”

My brother was just silent and just says “ Y’all must forget I have kids. I’ll be waiting whenever someone decides to come.” Then hangs up. Oh yea mom I would love to ask someone like that to help me one day.

So of course he didn’t have to wait long I’m sure my mom brought him food and they talked about how “mean” and “bipolar” I am. It’s just getting a little ridiculous almost like a co dependant thing going on.

If this makes me an asshole I’ll take it. It really makes me realize that I’ve probably taken advantage of my mom too. Like if I’m anything like that I want to change right now.",42,47,0.94
1712,Not the A-hole,"I know it sounds kinda stupid and petty and it is.

Today is my birthday and because I'm a minor I still live with my family. My parents always give me and my brother money for our birthdays so we can save and get something we really want. They will also give the other sibling money ahead of time so my brother and I can get each other small gifts. 

This morning I got a ton of birthday calls from family and a gift from my brother. He looked quite apprehensive about giving it to me and quietly explained he wasn't happy with the gift and didn't think I'd like it. It was a necklace that isn't the sort of thing I'd particularly like at all. In front of everyone I acted like I liked it but later on the way to school I talked to my brother about it. Turns out it was supposed to go to my brother's gf but they broke up so our mum made him give it to me instead even though everyone knew it'd be the sort of thing I'd hate. 

I messaged my mum letting her know I knew about this situation. I politely told her I was unhappy with the gift and I would prefer if it was given to someone else or returned and that my brother gets me a birthday present by himself. I made sure my message was a polite as it could be and that I didn't sound accusatory because I didn't want to start a fight over a bad gift. Well, that's kinda what happened. My mum messaged back defensive and annoyed because from her perspective it was a beautiful necklace that would go nicely with my dress for going out (it wouldn't at all for a plethora of reasons), it was more expensive than the allocated amount so I should be grateful, and it was bought overseas so they have no way to return it.

Now, I had no clue about the last few things. I just knew it was a necklace that was supposed to go to someone else and my brother tried to convince my mum I'd hate it and he should get me a gift in the price range that I'd like. My mum thinks I knew about the whole context and was being a spoilt brat about it all. Even though I didn't know about everything, I still kind of feel like TA for confronting my mum about a birthday gift I didn't pay for that cost more than normal and can't be returned but on the other hand I feel like my family (excluding my awesome brother) was being TA for forcing my brother to give me a gift I wouldn't like instead of letting him get me something himself.

1713,Asshole,"I've been working for a fairly large software company as a software engineer ever since I graduated from college 2 years ago. I'm based in San Jose, CA. Recently we wrapped up a huge project for a company in NYC and they flew us out for a week to install the software at their HQ and make sure everything was working smoothly. The first night they took us out to a very fancy steak restaurant and treated us to dinner. I should mention that there were 3 representatives from their company as well as 4 people from my company, including myself and my boss.

During the dinner, I did not eat anything. I simply ordered several sparkling waters and sipped them the entire night. Every two months I have a 5 day span where I do not eat anything and only drink water and take multivitamins and electrolytes (this is called a water fast). It ended up that this business trip was during the week I was supposed to do this.

Anyway, I felt that during the entire time both my coworkers and the company representatives were very uncomfortable that I was not eating anything. Since I don't like to tell people that I fast every two months, I just say that I am not interested in eating right now or I am not hungry. People have tried to lecture me how it is extremely unhealthy to fast in the past and it's just easier for me to avoid the conversation.

Anyway, after the dinner my boss called me when I was back at the hotel and he told me that it was extremely disrespectful that I did not eat anything the entire time. He said it made the company look bad and that he had never been so embarrassed in his life. He said that he will discuss it with the director of engineering when we get back to the office next week and that he will need to speak with me in person about my inappropriate actions.

To be honest, I do not feel like I was the asshole in this situation, but I also am not known for knowing social cues all too well. I did joke around and converse with everyone at the dinner, I just did not want to eat. That said, it was a 7 course dinner and we were there for over 3 hours so it was a long time.

I am kind of dreading meeting face to face with my boss and the engineering manager next week...

What do you guys think? AITA in this situation? To be honest, I have already asked my parents and my best friend and they all said I was the asshole. They told me that it is very unprofessional to go to a suit-and-tie dinner and not eat anything.",81,105,0.89
1714,Not the A-hole,"I want to clarify that it's because I plan on wearing pale blue as my dress - I fell in love with both the look and price of a pale blue dress, I look better in it that white, and I'm not exactly pure so I'm okay with skipping that wedding tradition. My understanding of the ""no white in a wedding rule"" is because the bride is supposed to stand out, and so I figured it would apply here; when I sent out the email to the guests asking that no one wear pale blue, I did explain why and also said I was totally cool if they wanted to wear white. Sent out an email that said that, didn't think it would be a big deal.

Then, my fiancee told me his family was confused about the rule. He framed it as ""they aren't sure what shade of blue to not wear"", and also kind of made a little fun of me for being a ""Bridezilla""; him and his friends have been making those jokes because I made my husband get ballroom dancing lessons with me for our first dance to ""Strangers in the Night"".... he didn't really want to do dancing lessons but I wanted to make sure we both looked like we knew what we were doing in front of a big crowd (his friends also lightly tease me about being ""high maintenance"", but I'm okay with that because I am, I'm okay with that, and I know my fiancee loves me enough to do all the romantic things I secretly crave).

Anyway. Sorry to go off on a tangent, but that leads into the issue; I send out a second email saying ""I heard some people were confused about what color to avoid so here is an example!"" with, like, a screenshot of a paint swatch similar to my color. I figure I've clarified the issue, but then my fiancee is a little more honest. His parents, and in particular, his sister in law, all don't like that I'm banning them from wearing a certain color. Their stance is that ""no white in weddings"" is an unspoken rule for society, not just something that they would be willing to ignore because I said it was okay, and they don't like the idea that I'm trying to control their wardrobe. Apparently ""they aren't sure what shade of blue to not wear"" was more along the lines of them saying ""what if she's mad if we wear ANY blue"" (which, I wouldn't even be that upset if someone wore pale blue, I'd think it was rude cause I asked not to but like it's not something to worry about). Hence, my second ""clarifying email"" seemed to them like I had heard their sarcastic comments and was returning my own sarcastic comment - an unflattering shade on their youngest son's bride to be.

His older brother has a nice powder blue tie he wanted to wear and now he can't. I feel like, it's a tie versus a fancy dress, you can make the sacrifice, not to mention it's *my wedding*. And, his family feels I am banning a color from their wardrobe, and they don't like it. I don't plan to send out a THIRD email saying wear whatever you want because that's a lot of emails over a silly drama and also, you know, I don't feel like backing down on my rule.

edit: I want to stick up for my in laws here and say it was actually the sister in law who had the biggest problem (fiancees brother's wife, and they've been married for like 20 years so she is a big part of the family). Brother too because of his tie.

I’m at a low right now as well, I lost my job and my mental health is extremely poor at the moment. I was working a full time job that broke my soul into pieces. This morning I had an accidental overdose and was having heart palpitations and violent vomiting, instead of checking on me they shut their door. That made me feel absolutely worthless. 

One of the roommates had quit his job and it’s been a month. He has not attempted to do ANYTHING around the house. Today he went and poured FRESH litter over extremely soiled litter, and that was my breaking point.

I told them that I’d be moving out the middle of next month but after tonight I’ve had it.

I really tried to open up about parts of my life he doesn’t know about since he complains he doesn’t know enough. I told him about the first time I drank alcohol thinking maybe we could bond over crazy teenage stories(I was underage) and all he did was talk about how my moms a bad parent and he was a perfect child.

Halfway through the two weeks I got super homesick, depressed, and anxious. I told him this and he said “why don’t you tell me the real reason you want to go home” as if I was lying. Of course I wasn’t, but this leads to a big argument about how he doesn’t accept anything I do. He denies saying it Bc he’s an asshole but he said “so you’re a faggot now” when I confirmed I’m absolutely without a doubt gay. He takes me home the next day (not before guilt tripping me and giving backhanded apologies) and I swore I’d never talk to him again.

I got one of those DNA sequencing test done a while ago (when I still believed I came from plain good old sex). It also matches you with family members. It doesn't show who the donor is, but I've got enough family members on his side that I'd probably have a fair chance of finding him if I were to dig a bit deeper. 

I've talked about this with my girlfriend who, in nicer words than this, believes I'm being an asshole for wanting to find the donor even though he was promised anonymity.  

I think that's unfair -I had no say in what my parents did, after all. If I contact him and he doesn't want to talk to me, that's his right. But I don't think I should abstain from finding him to spare his feelings.

1721,Not the A-hole,"Just recently, our local Walmart and Target have begun to ask for receipts as patrons are leaving the store. At first I would oblige. I thought ""Whatever, it will only take a few seconds, NBD"". But as it happens more and more, I'm starting to realize not everyone is being asked to do this. Often times I'm having my groceries checked against my receipt as I watch multiple people walk right past us.

I thought maybe they were just looking over receipts whenever possible. But one time the ""greeter"" wasn't busy with anyone else. I watched 4 or 5 shoppers walk right out without a word from her, but as I was about to leave, she asks me aside.

At this point I start thinking, I'm a young male shopping alone, maybe I'm being profiled. So, after she asks politely to see my receipt I respond with ""No thanks."" and continue out of the store. She looked a little puzzled, but...

Wow, nothing happened. That's an awful lot more convenient than being ""nice"". So, that's been my default response for the past few weeks. A greeter asks me to provide my receipt and I say ""No Thanks/No/Nope/Nah/Maybe next time/etc."" with no issues. That is, until last night.

I was on my way home from work, when my roommate asks me to pick up a jar of peanut butter. So, I get to the store, find the peanut butter, ring myself up, pay, and make my way to the doors. As I'm leaving, an older man says ""Hold up! Let me see your receipt."", to which I respond ""Nah."", and continue on my way. He stands up from his chair, raising his voice just a little, and says ""You need to pay for that!"", and I respond ""I did, have a good night!""

This is when it gets a little weird. He's clearly unconvinced, and begins to yell ""YOU HAVE TO SHOW ME YOUR RECEIPT!"" while following me out into the parking lot. I stop, turn around, and say ""I paid for this, it's my property now, transaction complete"". He just gets even angrier, demanding that I show him my receipt, yelling ""You have to pay for that"" and ""You have to show me your receipt"" non stop.

Eventually I make it to my car, which he proceeds to stand in front of. Now, he's saying he's going to call the police, yadda yadda. I roll down my window and tell him ""That's fine, you can call them, I don't mind. Can you get away from my car?"", and he responds ""Like hell I will!"" while slamming his hands onto the hood of my car.

At this point I just want to go home. I look around my car and there are no people or cars anywhere nearby. So I quickly reverse my car away from him, and high tail it out of there.

After recounting this story to my roommates, they said I was a total prick about it. They think that since it would have only taken a second to confirm that I paid for the peanut butter, that means I should have just shown him my receipt and been done with it. 

But I think that's bullshit. These stores shouldn't operate on the assumption that I'm a thief by default.

So, what does reddit think. AITA?",2544,9727,0.94
1722,Not the A-hole,"So I (F23) told my boyfriend (M24) that I am not attracted to him anymore because of his weight.

&#x200B;

Backstory: I have been dating my boyfriend since I was 14. When we were 16 he started gaining weight but it wasn't really noticeable. He was chunky but not round.. When I was 18 I went to college we both gained some weight. I gained about 25, he gained about 60. At 20 he decided to lose some weight and he did but he winded up gaining it all back plus more. Since then he's been half assedly trying to lose weight for four years. It's been a bunch of empty promises from him trying to lose and failing.

&#x200B;

January 2018 I decide to workout in order to deal with my asthma (which doctors can barely detect now!). I work out 3-5 times a week, I track what i eat, etc. I'm not at my goal yet but I'm getting there. He loves the changes I've made, constantly telling me how good I look, etc. I invite him to work out with me all the time. Sometimes he does but the second he has an excuse to not, he doesn't (i.e. finals week). Mind you, the gym I use is in his basement. So often times he is sitting in there with me while I workout.

&#x200B;

Today, he told me that after ""eating good"" this week and the two bike rides we went on he didn't lose a pound.  I told him we should talk about how much he's eating because it's probably not as little as he thinks (an issue I had a few months ago as well so I know from experience). He decided that he didn't want to talk about it. Later he also told me that he was not going to work out with me today because he had something to do TOMORROW.

&#x200B;

That got me fed up. I told him that I was tired of this half assed bullshit. I told him I wasn't attracted to him anymore because of his  weight. It's not the features he can't change (his face) it's the features he can change (his weight). I told him that it wasn't fair that I had to workout to ensure I don't die at 40 (genetic high blood pressure plus the asthma) but he for some reason gets a pass. He has diabetes in his family but he does nothing to prevent it.

&#x200B;

He was upset. We fought. After about 2 hours we talked again. Turns out he was far more ignorant about food and nutrients than I thought. He was eating 500 more calories than he was supposed to. He started looking up the foods he normally eats and was completely shocked how many calories he was eating. Friday I'll be teaching him about food, coming up with alternatives for snacks/meals, etc. He seems to realize that his weight is affecting not only him but us and that he has a lot to learn.

&#x200B;

With all that being said, I feel like a complete piece of shit for calling him out like that. AITA for telling my boyfriend he's no longer attractive to me?

&#x200B;

Edit: This was NOT the first time we talked about his weight loss (or lack thereof). I've tried every approach you could possibly think of. If you've thought of it, I've tried it. Over the course of four years I empathized, I helped him come up with many plans, I've acted subtly (""Hey, I found this new healthy place to eat wanna try it with me?""), I've emphasized how his life was going to be cut short, I've come up with reward systems (ranging from me cooking for him, to taking him out on dates my treat,  to other couple things ;)), I invite him to every single workout, I've moved my entire schedule around just to workout when he wanted, I've supported his goals, etc. None of that shit worked. None of that shit made him even think that he could possibly be doing something wrong.",69,28,0.85
1723,Not the A-hole,"A few years back, I was the recipient of a organ transplant. I have been uber lucky because most don't got the transplant in their lives and I got one due to \*not disclosing for privacy reasons.\* One thing that happens with organ donations, is you are required to have your immune system suppressed for the rest of your life because otherwise your body will attack your new transplanted organ.

&#x200B;

A few months back I learned that a coworker of mine was a firm believer of the antivax crap. They found the kool aid and got drunk. I mean WAY off the deep end here. At first it didn't bother me. But one thing you learn to recognize as a donation recipient is how to respond to your bodies natural reactions and make immediate necessary changes.

Normally, we don't even share the same work space, but we had a big change in the company protocol recently and everybody is scrambling and working with people they don't normally need to work with.

&#x200B;

Today, CW came in and started asking some really hard and specific details that needed long winded explanations. I responded to go talk to somebody else. I didn't know the answer in the first place and I was trying to shorten my time with CW.

&#x200B;

It became clear I was limiting my time with them and they got huffy and puffy and left the room. The tension was palpable in the room but nobody said anything. I feel bad. I'm pretty non-confrontational to a fault. They didn't do or say anything wrong but I honestly felt threatened sharing the same breath as them.

&#x200B;

So fellow redditor's... Am I an Asshole?

&#x200B;

Edit: To clarify to some: Transplant can be serious in terms of getting sick. If I have a cough for more than a week, I need to call my doctors with a list of symptoms so they can decide if they need to run blood work. Something like the common flu could last me a month if I contracted it later on. Bigger and harder to treat infectious diseases can put me out for a heck of a lot longer than the normal person. If I don't drink between 3 and 5 liters of water a day, my organ starts slowly shutting down due to the meds I am on.",107,281,0.9

1725,Not the A-hole,"I have this coworker and we are pretty close, in the sense that we share personal stories and exchange birthday gifts. I’ve known her for about 10 months. Last month her car was in the shop, so seeing as though I pass her exit on the way to work, I offered to give her a ride. Keep in mind my commute is 30 mins to work and about 40 home. Picking her up didn’t add any time however, dropping her off added 15-20 mins to my already long drive. Anyway, she appreciated the 8 total rides I gave her. 

Last week, her car was back in the shop. She said “I’m going to need you to pick me up and drop me off next week....”. I asked how many days? She said 7 days. I told her that I’m happy to pick her up in the morning but to be honest, dropping her off adds 15-20 mins on my drive and I couldn’t commit to dropping her off for all 7 days. I looked up the cost of an UBER and said that I could drop her off a couple of days.

Well this set her the fuck off! The next day at work she seemed fine, but then when I got home, she sent this looooong text saying that she doesn’t want it to be weird at work, but I’ve essentially betrayed her and we must not be as close as she thought. And she’s going to start “pulling away” as not to be fake. She also said looking up an UBER was a “slap in the face.” This text went on and on.

After my fiancée and I started to work on wedding planning, she decided that now was the time to begin her wedding planning and set a date the year after mine. I'm not upset about that because maybe my engagement just gave her that kick in the butt she needed to get things going. However she recently called me and told me she planned to elope instead the same week as my wedding and have an after party the following year. I really don't want to be a dick, weddings are happy times and i really want to support my sister ( who is my maid of honor) I'm just really not sure why she made this decision and it honestly seems like she just really wants to get married before me.

When I sleep over I like him to drive me to work (I have sleep issues) and the bus that leaves from his house is inconsistent with times. However, this causes an argument very often. He says I am expecting him to drive me instead of asking and that he has trouble driving because he feels dizzy, like he will faint and nauseous and hasnt slept. My issue is that he often says that he will faint or throw up related to mental health but ive never seen him do it. 

I just dont see how driving for 10 minutes a day to help my busy life when he has nothing on is such an inconvenience especially when it's at like 11am to argue about but if he is that mentally unwell AITA?

The recovery time is 4 to 6 weeks so sadly she would need to quit her job.

1735,No A-holes here,"TL;DR: Dogs are 13 (here called X) & 16 (here called Z). Z is barely able to move on her own anymore, she’s still mobile but only with help. X has a hard time breathing due to a neck tumor, but he’s still kicking.       

Long story, short: ages are approximate as both were adopted. Z is a boxer mix, her mobility is next to nothing, she has to be helped to even stand up & it’s only recently (in the past few months) gotten this bad. I feel like it’s time to let her go & without letting her get to a point she’s suffering. She doesn’t finish her food anymore, she struggles to walk, she accidentally pees on herself. I know it’s time to let her go, and that’s hard enough to admit.      

X is a jack russell, he’s got a fair amount of energy but he’s got a tumor in his neck that’s growing at an exponential rate. His collar doesn’t even fit anymore, and the vet said it’s inoperable. He LOVES Z, as in his whole life is dependent on hers, I swear she’s the sun & he just orbits around her.     

Maybe we could give X another month or two, but my husband insists that it’s not right to let X be put down with Z, though the vet said X had maybe 2 months left in him. I worry that X will be so depressed without Z, I don’t want him to be getting worse AND be without his “sister”. I just don’t know what’s right to do here? And my husband insists I’m not doing what’s right by X, and that hurts me, because I’ve only been with the husband since June 2018, but I’ve had both dogs since X & Z were each 3. I know my husband means well, and I know he loves them too, but I get the ultimate say. AITA if I have X put down at the same time as Z? (We’re going to the vet on Friday.)

1738,No A-holes here,"I've never posted or even had an account on reddit before, but I heard this page is a good place to solve moral dilemmas so here I am I guess. 

A little bit of background on me: I had really wank parents who kicked me out when I came out as gay at 17. That was 2 years ago, I'm currently living in a different city and getting my life together slowly but surely. I've made quite a few good friends here, I've got a decent enough job and rent a place with some awesome flatmates. 

Now to the situation: I recently met this guy via grindr who I thought was super cute and funny. We initially exclusively hooked up bc you know, Grindr, but after a couple of times and some conversation we realised we actually have a lot in common and we're now kind of in that awkward 'seeing each other but not really in a real relationship' phase. I really like him, he's super kind to me and super gorgeous and he's honestly treated me nicer than anyone has since I left home. Fast forward to yesterday, and I was showing his pictures to one of my friends who I hadn't seen in a bit. He immediately got kinda uncomfortable and said that this guy used to bully him when they were at school. He said it was nothing major/physical, but my guy and his friends used to make fun of him for being super short and wearing glasses and that obviously had very negative effects on him. I asked my guy about it and he was mortified, admitted he'd done it but promises me he was just a shitbag kid and that he'd never dream of doing anything like that now. Edit: forgot to include here, he did send his apologies to my friend and try to mert up for a chat in person, but my friend declined.

So herein lies my issue: my friend says he has no interest in being amicable with my guy, that he won't be comfortable around him and that if I stay with him it might put a strain on our friendship. I don't want that, he's a good friend and I love him dearly, but I also really like this guy and believe that he is sorry and he has changed. I feel caught between a rock and a hard place.

Background: My girlfriend (25F) and I (27M) have been together for a little over 9 months. She is black. I am white. 

Yesterday, I was spending the night at my girlfriend's place. She lives in a duplex and has lived beside the same neighbors for two years. They aren't friends but are friendly. 

The neighbors had people over and were playing loud music and we could hear them. It wasn't a huge issue but it went on past 10pm. I told my girlfriend that I was going to talk to them but she told me not to because they had actually come to her a few days before to ask if it would be alright for them to host a birthday party at their house, knowing it would go late and she'd be able to hear it because of how thin the walls are. GF is a hard sleeper when it comes to sound so the noise wasn't really bothering her. I'm a light sleeper. She forgot about the party when we discussed me sleeping over. 

She told me she wouldn't be upset if I chose to go home but it was late and I didnt want to drive. I told her I was going over to speak with them. She decided to go herself. She comes back and they turn the volume on the music down and quiet down to a respectable level. 

Midnight rolls around and they volume has slowly risen back to it's original volume (the music stayed low but I could hear their conversation). GF doesn't wake up so I decide to call the police since they'd been warned. They show up about a half hour later. The flashing lights of the police car through the windows wakes up girlfriend.

She asks if I called the police and I confirm that I did. She gets incredibly angry and tells me that as soon as the officer leaves, I need to get out of her house. I ask her why and she tells me that she and I have had the discussion before that she doesn't believe in calling the police on other black people if no one is in danger and that, as a guest in her home, I should have respected that. She was also angry because she says I had the opportunity to go back to my own place earlier in the night when it was apparent the noise level that they had already cleared with her, was going to disturb my sleep. 

I told her I would leave but that she was being ridiculous and that if her neighbors couldn't be quiet after she asked them to then the next logical step was to get the police involved. 

She refused to have any further discussion with me and, once the police left after making everyone who didnt live in the other side of the duplex leave, she made me leave around 2am even though she knew I had work this morning. 

I've tried calling and texting her but the only response I got was a text telling me that she needed to evaluate if she could trust me to take issues in her community seriously and she needed some space to do it.

I still think I was right and it was inconsiderate of her to make me drive back to my own place so late.

Back in January last year I started hooking up with the sister. She was in my class and we got to talking. We remained (exclusive) FWB's until April. We cut things off because she caught feelings and I did soon after, but we were not that interested in a relationship. She was moving away to a different college far away too. We stopped all contact (texting and snapchat) in April and haven't talked since. 

I wasn't necessarily looking for someone else, but in August I met my now girlfriend. I was at a bar with a buddy, she was with some friends and we felt drawn to each other. Buddy left, and she came up to me and we were basically dating right then and there. It was strange. I felt so comfortable and at ease, we vibed off each other. Amazing chemistry, and we went official 2 weeks later. That same feeling is still here and it has only gotten stronger. We're ridiculously happy in our relationship right now. 

Okay, back to last Saturday. It's my girlfriend's and her dad's birthday, and her sister is flying back for it. I have never met nor seen her, but my girlfriend has talked about her a lot. Together with the same last name I had some suspicions, and well she comes in and it's my former FWB. We were very awkward together, because we didn't acknowledge that we already know each other. We met up somewhere private where we said we would keep this up for now. But it was still weird and a bit awkward between the two of us. My girlfriend later mentioned I was acting strange that night so it was visible apparently.

Talked with that same buddy about it, he says I should tell her ASAP and that it's an asshole move from me and her sister. I don't feel like that's my decision to make though, because it could mess with the family if I told my girlfriend. If her sister wishes to keep up this act I will. She's coming back permanently in July, but I don't need to see her often. Outside one text we haven't talked after that night. I avoided her until she flew back today. 

So, is it a dick move to 'hide' this from my girlfriend? I don't see anything well coming from telling her. It will at the very least put a strain on their relationship, because she's been dealing with some jealousy issues (nothing bad really, but worth mentioning) about the girls in college being younger as her, she's insecure about her age.

She was moving out of town, however, so after a couple weeks we talked about what we were looking for and she wasn't interested in either enjoying things while they lasted or trying to do long distance, while I was. I pushed too hard in trying to convince her of my point of view and she told me to stop contacting her- this is what I feel bad about.

Then the other day (a couple months after we last communicated) I was on the dating app we met through and her profile appeared. For better or worse I sent a message saying sorry I was an asshole for not accepting her answer and that I would resume no contact. I know for sure that the situation is that she deleted the app from her phone but her profile still exists (which is why I saw it in my area and it had no changes from when we initially matched) so she will never see that message.

Now, I’m tempted to text her and say that I was thinking about her because her profile popped up and had actually apologized but that after realizing she wouldn't see that apology I wanted to apologize more directly

Would this make me a bigger asshole for contacting her after she said not to? Or is there an exception for apologies?",28,37,0.93

1749,Asshole,"I’m married with a husband and 2 kids. The husband and I started a business 5 years ago and now we’re pretty well-off. He grew up in a poor environment and now that he’s successful people from his childhood have taken notice.

He dated his high school ex-girlfriend for 3 years. When she was 16 she was pregnant with twins and miscarried at 6 months after an accident. This really traumatized them and their relationship was broken after, he left for college a year later and they broke up. 

Since then life has been very difficult for her (their mothers are family friends). She’s been through some bad shit including depression, drug addiction and yesterday she called him after years of no contact, to say that she is being kicked out of her apartment. She asked him for some help, namely enough rent for 2 months ($1000). He said that unfortunately he cannot help and that she’s essentially a stranger to him.

I berated him for his response and told him to have some empathy. Yes she may have problems but she’s a human who he used to have an intimate relationship with. He should help her because that’s the good thing to do. He said if I cared so much then I could write a check and “never expect to get it back”. 

AITA for expecting him to lend his ex $1000, which really would be a drop in the bucket for us?",58,37,0.8

The friend’s family owns a beach house in Hilton Head, and that’s where they are headed for 5 days. These boys typically spend their weekends at our house swimming in our pool, watching movies, etc. We always provide pizza/wings or cook a meal for them when they come. So naturally, our house has become the popular place for them to hang out several times a week. Yesterday, the friend’s mom put all of the parents of boys on the trip in a group text and requested we Venmo her between $175-$200 each to cover food, a rental car to fit all the boys, a “nice dinner out”, and her housekeeping fee. I texted her separately to ask what this budget included, as I was surprised that she anticipated spending $1000 over 5 days for 5 boys. She basically just said the groceries, dinner out, and housekeeping fee. I found it odd that she would request we pay her in the first place since she invited the boys to be their guests. I sent her the money because I didn’t want to start anything, but it really rubbed me the wrong way considering how much we have provided her son over the year without even considering charging them.

1754,Everyone Sucks,"Long story short, ex lives in another country. Son (12) normally spends 1 month summer and 1 week Christmas and 1 week spring or fall with ex. I really don’t mind the visit other than the fact that I have reservations about his standard of living- quality of food etc. but I just let it be. Pick my battles. 

He is now $3,000 behind on child support, approx 10 months behind. I sent him an email telling him that if he doesn’t get caught up by at least $1,000 (1/3 of what he owes) then son isn’t going for summer. 

Ex has been consistently behind because in his view, the amount is optional, he will pay “when he has the money” not as much as part of his responsibility, like utilities or car payment. So he has a very callous view on the whole thing. 

I understand the perspective that I am an asshole because I am limiting my son to see ex bc of money. But it isn’t about money, it’s about accountability and responsibility as a parent.


UPDATE:  Thank you everyone for your input.  I agree with most of you:
YTA: to my son specifically, it isn't fair for him to have to be punished because of his father's irresponsibility,  Going to see his father is more important for him than the other way around.
NTA: to my husband, he needs to step up his game and needs to be a responsible adult and he needs to know that support should be priority.

- After several angry emails back and forth, he has agreed to pay the monthly support amount, plus $100 for the next 3 months, and then support +$200 until he is caught up. This is the result I desired, for him to ""step up to the plate"".  Still, I do believe I shouldn't have used my son as leverage.  Next time, I am going straight to threatening to hold him in contempt.",129,214,0.92
1755,Not the A-hole,"UPDATE:

 Well these family members thought I was the asshole. I sat down, asked then what was going on with their house, they said they didn't know and immediately asked if I wanted them to move out. I said no. I didn't want them to move out, but it's been a long time and I was going to have to raise their rent to $1000 a month. The boyfriend sits up, chuckles and says I'm not paying $1000 for two bedrooms and she says we'll move out. I said I would never tell them they had to leave, but I thought it was fair because of the wear and tear on my house and it went from 3 people putting in wear and tear on the house to 11 people. She then said that she does all the cleaning up after my kids and the dog and she is the only one that cooks and that my kids never pick up after themselves. Soooo...the talk went badly. I told them to get out and agreed to let them pay a daily rate based on $1000 per month until they are able to move. I ended up crying and we ended up yelling and she called me a bitch. So I feel like shit and am really wondering am i the asshole? 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

ORIGINAL:

I have two kids and a 5 bedroom house and a dog.

&#x200B;

My kids are older and self sufficient.  My family member that has 5 kids and a boyfriend and his one kid needed a place to live while their house was being built.  They said that they would be with me about 6 months at most.  My family member offered to pay $600 a month in rent.  I accepted thinking it would be short term.  The $600 pretty much covers the increase in the lights, water and gas bills.  They took over the other two bedrooms and one of the kids shares a room with my younger child.

&#x200B;

Its now been 13 months that they have been with us and their house is nowhere near being done.  They haven't updated me on the timeline, but driving past the development its going to be at least another 6 months before it may be finished and ready for move in.  The wear and tear on my house has been noticeable since they moved in.  Rather than the wear and tear from 3 people its getting the treatment from 11 people; doors slamming, gates opening and closing, washer and dryer use, bathroom steam paint damage/mold, carpet being dirtied, walls being touched and written on, etc.

&#x200B;

They buy their own groceries as do we, but everything gets placed in the same kitchen.  The same goes for household items like toilet paper and paper towels, etc.  So some things are shared.

&#x200B;

Money isn't an issue for them.  My family member makes more money than me from their job and her boyfriend also works so there is his income as well.

&#x200B;

Am I the asshole for wanting to raise their rent to $1000 per month to help cover damage and upkeep that I now have to address because the wear and tear on my home has come about faster with so many more people living there?  I haven't discussed this with them yet, but if I'm wrong then I will just keep things as they are.  I just really don't want to be the asshole.",42,123,0.95
1756,Everyone Sucks,"I've lived in my townhome for a little over a month and in that span of time it's been a nightmare! First off, my neighbor leaves pile of trash in backyard and just lets it stack up when the waste disposal are no more than a 45 second walk away , she lets her dog just run around the area unleashed and crap anywhere, and worst of the worst is her unruly kid. Gah, I have no idea if that kid is possessed. The kid can't be more than 8 or 9 but he is loud, bangs on the walls, back talks his mother (I heard him tell her to shut up one time because he didn't want to come indoors), and it's just awful.

&#x200B;

Now, to be fair I did try to be nice about all this. I don't know what it's like to have kid but I know it can't be easy when you are a single parent. I gave her letter informing her of the noise and to her credit she sent me a letter back telling me she is sorry. Now I'm thinking everything is fine and it's all good right? No, her kid is still the same way, banging on the wall, screaming ,and hollering. I gave one more note and this time did not get a response. The same thing kept happening.

&#x200B;

I finally had enough and reported her to the office. A couple of days go by and I come home to find she is moving out. She looks at me and says ""I hope you feel proud of yourself evicting two kids!"" to which I respond ""well maybe if you learn to control them this wouldn't happen"". Next thing I know she's got her male friend and girl friend all in my face calling me all kinds of names out of the book.

1757,Not the A-hole,"I still can't believe I'm about to write this but here we go. Some information, my boyfriends likes to cook. And he cooks extremely well. Whenever he cooks for me, I tell him how much I appreciate it and how good it is - because I firmly believe so. Another important thing to remember, I'm a picky eater. Some foods I dislike but I can still eat and not mention it. Some foods, on the other hand, make me feel like I might puke because of the taste/texture. I'm not sure why.  


Now, for every Christmas my boyfriend makes a recipe. According to him, this is his absolute best dish and what he is most proud of. This happens to be stuffed pork tenderloin. It has feta cheese, red onions, parsley and raisins. You see, I don't like raisins. At all. I've had bad experiences with it, and usually dishes that have it will make me feel a bit sick. So I asked him if we could substitute it with anything else because I would still really like to try this. Everything besides the raisins are right up my alley. The only other option is cranberries, which sort of fall under the same realm (thanksgiving is definitely not as exciting for me lol). I ask him if mushrooms could be a possibility, and he says that's not what he does. I figured that maybe he meant that wasn't something that could be done, so I found a recipe to show him that hey! Maybe there is another option. This... is where things sort of fell apart.  


He got aggressive with me, telling me he'd rather shoot himself in the skull than change the stuffing for the one i had suggested (mushroom and bacon, I don't know much about cooking but it sounded yummy!). After that, he told me how bothered he is that I would try to change the recipe, and that if his own mother tried to change something he would pick up the pan, toss it in the garbage, go back to his room and not eat (I'm copying word for word). I let him know that he was being aggressive and unpleasant, and then he basically ""left me on read"". Today, I had to reach out to him to see what the hell was going on because I still can't believe we're arguing over this. He proceeds to tell me that I was being extremely disrespectful and that he has nothing to apologize for. 

&#x200B;

So, AITA? I honestly just wanted to switch out the raisins because they make me sick. Even just taking them out after it's served would make me feel ill because I guess the taste doesn't sit well with me.

So there are a few rules the gave us, most of which I am 100% willing to follow because it’s their house and they are being very generous by letting us stay with them for an extended period of time and they aren’t charging rent. But recently they asked that we not have sex while people are home... the problem is that they are ALWAYS home. My mom works from home and can go 5+ days in a row without leaving the house and if she’s not home dad is home or my brother. I think this is ridiculous. He is my husband, we obviously enjoy that part of our relationship. I understand they don’t want to hear us (I don’t really want to hear them either but I do and deal with it), but I offered to trade rooms with my brother because his is on the other side of the house so they probably wouldn’t hear us as opposed to ours which is literally across the hall, they said no. It’s not like I’m trying to jump him in the middle of the afternoon on the weekend when everyone is awake, just at night after they’ve gone to bed or if my mom is all the way downstairs working (which is 2 floors below our room). We aren’t loud but it’s an old wooden bed on old wooden floors, they creak, nothing we can do about it. 

So AITA for arguing with my mother about this rule?

Edit: about the ttc thing since I’ve gotten quite a few comments on how it’s irresponsible. My husband has a job offer that starts in October, which is around the time he was going to be getting out of the military (so we were told). Obviously he got out much sooner than expected so now we are broke and we are hoping he can find a different job that starts sooner. But we are living with my parents to replenish our savings, and he will have a job when I gave birth. We should be living in our own place by then unless the wait list for apartments get double the length they are now (possible but unlikely) and even if we still are with my parents when it happens, they knew what we were doing when they offered to let us live with them, they knew it was a possibility.",129,49,0.79

They are pushing me to identify as pansexual and I am not comfortable with this.

Sometimes from 6 inches way sometimes from a foot. This has been ongoing for roughly 3 years now, consistently. If i want to use my computer I basically have to sit there until the dog goes into another room to be able to get up without being attacked.

The day that animal passes on will be the best thing to have happened to me in the past few years. Again I could never harm an animal but I've lost all sense of compassion for it's existence. 

My parents don't give a single fuck though. Their solution is yelling at the animal to ""stop"".

1766,Asshole,"I saw the post about the mom & daughter, and it resembles my situation a lot. Previously, I hadn't even considered that I'm the asshole but now I am second guessing.

I have three kids, my oldest daughter (11) my middle son (9) and my youngest son (7). My youngest son has had many developmental delays and we're currently getting him diagnosed, but suffice to say he is special needs. He is verbal, but does not express himself well even on top of just being 7 years old. He has a lot of behavioral things that need to be managed carefully.

My wife's best friend (my kids' ""aunt"") has been taking my daughter and my son out a couple of times a month. We can't really all go out as a family because my youngest son is VERY prone to tantrums/outbursts if he doesn't get his way or if his normal routine is broken. We eat at a limited list of restaurants, and we might go to the zoo if he's in a good mood or something like that, but yeah, fun outings have come to mostly a halt with all of us there.

My older son is getting his own interests, so he recently said he'd rather just go on their trips once a month and spend the other nights with his friends/activities. It was suggested that my daughter just spends the weekend there herself. My wife was overjoyed because she felt like my daughter has been unhappy at home and LOVES her aunt.

Well, my youngest son has begun to realize that he's getting left out. I think he has picked up on how happy his sister is when she comes back. Their aunt does come with us to outings so we have an extra pair of hands just in case (my youngest son behaves a lot better with her) so we haven't stopped taking him out and he does get to see his aunt but he's been throwing fits every single time both of his siblings leave during the weekend. And these fits last the WHOLE weekend.

Their ""aunt"" refused to take my daughter and youngest son for reasons my wife didn't really tell me (but that she agreed with). I didn't appreciate that. She also refused to take just my youngest son as she says she is ""not equipped to handle him on her own in an unfamiliar environment."" Disagree, as he calms down for her faster than with us, and is MUCH BETTER behaved around her than with me or my wife. When I told Hayley she lost it and sobbed about how she can't have anything of her own and it's the one time of the month she's happy.

My wife told me that I am wrong, but honestly it's not her real aunt and also how can we let one kid do something that is hurting the other one? My wife asked if we would stop letting our son do his sports and activities if our youngest son became jealous, but I think that's a completely different thing since he CAN'T do those sorts of things on the same team as his brother, but he COULD go with his aunt. Then she called me ungrateful to her friend. AITA?",105,132,0.85
1767,Not the A-hole,"I went shopping in a popular makeup chain store yesterday, and when I shop I like to take my time and spend a while in the store holding on to products and deliberating before making a purchase. I held three small products in one hand that I was not sure I was going to buy, and a large product in the other that I was definitely buying. After browsing for a while, I placed two of the three products back on their correct displays as I was not going to purchase them.

When I got to the checkout line, I decided against the third small item, so I placed it on a display at the front temporarily so I could return it to it's correct position on the way out of the store. As I was checking out (only buying the one large item), the sales associate looked me up and down and stated ""So I see you won't be purchasing the items you were holding?"". This caught me off guard so I replied, ""No I put them back"" and grabbed the item off of the close display to show her. She then said, ""That's one, but that does not account for the others. I saw you holding three and I did not see you put them back"". Throughout this interaction her tone was nasty, and she was looking at me like I was a rat that scampered into the store.

She finished checking me out and then immediately went to the back, presumably to check the cameras. The interaction left me feeling icky, so I reported it on the customer satisfaction survey. I could leave it at this, but my question is WIBTA for escalating the issue by contacting the manager of the store and reporting this, and then escalating to corporate if management does not do anything? She did not directly tell me that she thought I was shoplifting, but she said all of this publicly in front of other customers. Right now this is a hill I'm willing to die on because I spend a lot of money at this store, but I don't know if I would BTA for escalating this further than my online report.

Edit: This might provide context for my anger so I'm adding this here. A girl I know caught a misdemeanor charge from this location due to being falsely accused. The cameras showed her briefly speaking to someone who was shoplifting, and both girls were charged despite my friend being unaware of the other's actions and having no stolen merchandise on her person or in her bag",170,1011,0.96

Essentially the situation is as follows: My mom and sisters' have an annual girls-trip they do, usually to the beach or they'll rent a cabin and spend a weekend out there playing board games, reading, relaxing, just letting loose. The whole idea is to get away from the grind and have nothing to worry about for \~3 days.

Last year, they invited my girlfriend to come along for the first time and they had a pretty good time. This year they are continuing the tradition, except my oldest sister recently had a baby and announced about a week ago that she would be bringing her along so as not to overburden her husband who will be taking care of their 2 year old twins at home.

&#x200B;

That alone was bad enough. Now today, 3 days before they are set to leave, my other sister decided to bring her 4 year old daughter along.

If our situations were reversed I'd 100% back out and would just be honest about it, but maybe I'm an asshole.

When the girls started school, I sat twin b down and explained to her that her gymnastics is going to change a lot and she’s not going to be able to heaps of the competitions anymore. She still trains 6-10 hours a week after school. A lot of the competitions for her age group are during school hours, which I said no to.

For competitions her coach sends out what competitions she recommends twin b to do and my ex and I send back what comps we will do for each week we are with the girls.

If twin b does not do a certain amount of competitions per month, she does not qualify for more elite competitions (which would be held on the weekends) and the only reason she is qualifying for them right now is because my ex is taking her to these comps. 

Twin b loves gymnastics with her whole heart and competing makes her so so happy. Even though she’s only 5 she knows she wants to be in the olympics and her whole life is just gymnastics. I would feel horrible if I somehow kept restricting her from doing these competitions. The other complication is that if my ex is trying to take them out of school for an actual legit reason, and I’m in a meeting etc. he won’t have the option which would cause more problems. 

So WIBTA if i took out this order on him?",39,35,0.9

1777,Asshole,"My boyfriend and I have been dating almost 2 years, and I've been unsure about our relationship for a few months. I've talked it out with my therapist because I can be kind of a commitmentphobe, but the truth is that I just wasn't excited about him the same way he is about me. The old ""I love you, but I'm not in love with you."" There's other stuff too (he wants kids, I don't, we don't get along with each others' families, etc.) but that's the main thing.

My birthday was last Friday, and I decided to wait until after my birthday to break up with him. This wasn't because I was expecting a generous gift, but because two of our friends were coming to town from overseas for my birthday party and I didn't want to ruin their visit (for them or for my bf).

At my party, my bf presented me with a $1500 check to pay off my tuition balance for my final semester of school, which may not sound like a lot to some people but it would have taken me almost a year to save up this much and would delay getting my diploma by a year. I am really grateful for the gift.

But... I broke up with him that Sunday once our friends left, because he again started a conversation about our future kids and I couldn't hold it in. He was devastated and I feel terrible but it was the right decision.

He says, ""Keep the money, it doesn't matter.' Half of our friends say, 'Give it back, he wouldn't have given you that gift if he knew you were dumping him.' The other half say it was a gift given freely and to keep it. WIBTA if I kept it?

EDIT: I've gotten a couple of replies and a few vulgar messages with sexist language, and just wanted to point out that my ex and I are both men. 

I will listen to advice and tell him I'm not cashing the check; I don't want to just tear it up and have him watching his bank account waiting for the $1500 to come out.

SECOND EDIT: After sending him a text telling him that I appreciate his generosity but realized it would be wrong to keep his money, and I was tearing up the check. He then told me to stop being ridiculous and to let him do this for me since he 'apparently didn't do anything else right' and sent me the money on Venmo. I am unsure what to do here because he clearly is still upset. I'm thinking just keep the money in my account and send it back to him in a couple of months because I feel like it would be antagonistic to keep sending the money back and forth while he's upset, and I've also never used Venmo for such a large amount and am not sure if they'll take fees from his money if we keep doing that?",411,3058,0.95
1778,Not the A-hole,"My husband was with his ex wife for basically her daughter's entire life(he is not the bio father) ~5 years. They also have a son together. When my husband and I got together, both kids would spend time with us and stay over, I'd babysit them while their mom worked, etc. Their mother stopped bothering to communicate, dropping the kids off whenever she felt like it, be it 10 hours early, or 2 hours late. She began not paying her bills and telling family members we were not paying her child support(untrue, she gets it automatically the beginning of each month. When I spoke with her about it, I let her know she had to let us know what she was doing because husband and I cannot make any plans when we have no idea when the other kids would show up. She began screaming in my face in front of my mother and father in law that I wasnt their mother and that she would be coming for my paycheck. Again, I just literally told her she needed to let us know if she was going to be dropping off the kids at any time other than the agreed upon time. After this, she began accusing my of trying to harm her daughter. She has told all of my husbands family that I have tried to push her daughter down the stairs, that I ignore her, and that I have purposefully been phasing her out of my husband's life because I'm jealous. At this point I wrote it off as crazy, but then she began threatening to get restraining orders against me and that she was going to be going to the police and cps because I am abusing her daughter. I went out town and she texted me saying she bet I was stupid enough to come back and other thinly veiled aggressive comments. When I returned, I told my husband that i do not feel comfortable with her behavior and I felt until she stopped threatening me and telling people I was trying to hurt her daughter, maybe it was best that her daughter didnt come over any longer. I hated to do it because her daughter very clearly preferred to be at our house, but her mother has been getting increasingly aggressive. Now my in laws are telling me I'm the one who is wrong in this situation, that the mothers behavior is ""just how she is"", and I need to get over it. Honestly I'm just at a loss here and the only loser right now in this situation is her poor daughter. However, a family member went through a similar thing where the mother DID follow through on threats and was dragged through a lengthy police process for it(family member was cleared because they didnt do anything). I feel like my husband should be firmly telling everyone that the mother is wrong and cannot act this way towards me, but he claims he doesnt want to start arguments.

Edit: I should have specified she CAN still come over, I just told my husband for my own safety I will not stay or be in the home while she is. Her mother, when we said that her actions toward me were not ok, is the one who is now keeping her from coming over at all. Sorry for not explaining that more clearly, I am very upset.",58,63,0.91
1779,Asshole,"So my left arm is amputated from the bottom of the elbow down due to an accident a few years back (I’m right handed, if that matters). Anyway, I’ve been struggling to find a job after college and finally landed an interview for a desk job. Based on the job description, it seems like the job involves a lot of clerical work on the computer (creating spreadsheets, sending emails, etc.). I am proficient at using a computer but of course, it’s a bit more difficult without a second hand. I don’t really use a prosthetic because it’s uncomfortable and I can’t really type with it anyway.

Fast forward to the interview, I decide to put on my prosthetic that I rarely use and I put it in an arm sling. I also wrap it up like it’s broken. With the fingers part, I kind of kept it tucked under my blazer. Basically, it just looked like I had an injured arm. One of the interviewers looked at my arm and something like “how’s your arm?” and I replied with a slight joke “‘‘tis but a flesh wound.” The interviewer laughed and asked if I needed any accommodations before we start. I said no and we began the interview. It went really well and I was called for a second interview the next week.

I told my friends about this and they all more or less said I’m an asshole for lying about my disability. My thought process was that a company shouldn’t be biased in hiring people based on their disabilities anyway, and I’m confident I can do my job well (albeit I could do much better with two hands), so I don’t think I did anything wrong.

1781,Not the A-hole,"My family are on holiday at the moment, at an all-inclusive resort.

Last night at dinner, my sister ordered food for the entire table to share (7 people in total). It's hard to describe the sheer amount of food she ordered so I'll attempt to list what I can remember:
• 3 large portions of fried rice
• 3 large portions of noodles
• 3 large portions of vegetable curry
• 3 portions of tuna carpaccio
• 2 large salads
• 7 soups
• 12 portions of fish
• 2 lamb shanks
• 1 osso buco

As she was ordering, the waiter told her there was already a lot of food coming already, but she ignored him and continued to add to the order. My brother and I also tried to tell her to reduce the order but she insisted that the portions were small, and refused to remove anything from the order. 

Once the food started arriving, it was clear that we had ordered way too much. We couldn't finish the first few dishes and left half the fried rice and almost all the noodles. As the food was arriving and despite not being able to finish what was already in front of us, my sister was still continuing to look through the menu and add to the order at this point.

By the end of dinner, we had 6 main portions completely untouched (6 fish, 2 lamb shanks, 1 osso buco and 1 salad), plus the rice and noodles we were unable to finish from earlier.

My husband and I were absolutely horrified by the amount of food that was going to waste. My sister has always been greedy and wasteful with food but the all-inclusive resort seems to have brought out the worst in her, as she can order anything she wants and it is ""free"".

At the end of dinner, she wanted to order tiramisu for dessert. Nobody else on the table could eat any more at this point but she insisted she wanted to order 1 portion just to try it. I told her that we had already ordered way too much food that had gone to waste, so she shouldn't order dessert.

My sister blew up at me and accused me of ""judging"" her, and said that she didn't know the portion sizes and it was the restaurant's fault for serving such large dishes. Which was untrue because we have already been here for 3 nights and were aware of the portion sizes, and earlier the waiter tried to warn her she was over ordering.

My sister now isn't talking to me and some of my family think I shouldn't have said anything, as it's caused an argument and spoiled our holiday. But I felt I had to say something as I was so angry about all the food waste.

So, AITA?

Update: We just went to dinner again tonight and this time everyone ordered their own food, and we didn't let her order any extra food to share for the table. Everyone had a great time and we finished everything that we ordered!",132,833,0.95

1783,Not the A-hole,"This guy and I were best friends growing up, he always said I'd be his best man. 

I flew across the country to meet up with him and his two friends for the bachelor party. We each spent several hundred on hotels, food, etc for him. On the last day we met up with my friend's dad who I was really close with growing up. We walked off on our own for a bit and he brought up how his son had had a hard time deciding to pick his other friend as his best man. How his son has grown closer with his friend the past year or two. My heart sunk in my chest and I wanted to cry, I wanted to fly back home that minute but I had no money. Luckily I'm a quick with conversation so I played it off like my friend had already told me. I later told my friend what his dad had told me, he was pissed at his dad and apologized for how I found out.

A fucking text would have sufficed. I walked around like an idiot with him and his new friends for 3 days before HIS DAD told me, assuming I'd known a long time ago. I pretty much stayed drunk until I could go home after that. Acted like nothing was wrong. ""Yeah, man, I get it."" That's about all I could muster. To be fair his new friends are pretty cool, successful guys. Nothing against them. His best man comes from money but is a very down to earth, practical kind of guy. We got on pretty well. My friend told me he had wanted a destination wedding, that him choosing a new best man was ""just financial."" I'm assuming he helped out with the costs of the wedding then?  I was so hurt and I just had to put on a happy face. My dad is about to have open heart surgery so he asked me about that, I wasn't really in the mood for conversation at that point. I was tearing up and I couldn't tell if he knew because it was raining. He asked me if I was alright and I just said I want to go home.

We got back to his place, just me and him. We had a quick dinner with his fiance, he and I watched tv for a bit while I drank his liquor, then he went to bed and I passed out. They went to work in the morning and I flew out the next day.

I sent him a facebook message 5 days ago politely asking for an explanation on why he chose a new best man, and more importantly why he waited so long to tell me. I was literally the last fucking person to know. I don't even know if his new best man knows I was originally supposed to be up there. I can't hold anything against him, no bitterness there. My friend has yet to open my text but I know he read it. He'd never take 5 days to reply to me. So am I the asshole if I don't go? There's no groomsmen, just a best man. No one's problem but mine, but I'm an alcoholic who struggles with anxiety and depression. I will be imploding with anxiety from the moment I get in my car to drive up there until the moment I get back in my car to leave.

This would be fine, but she started off with saying ""Since mom and dad didn't teach us how to clean."" She does this with everything. Parents didn't teach us to clean. Parents didn't teach us to cook. Parents didn't teach us to manage money. Parents raised us to be passive. Some of this is true, and some isn't. 

I just get really frustrated when she says stuff like this. We are grown women in our 30s, the time for blaming or parents is over! Lots of people have shitty parents and get over it.

Last Memorial Day, my family went to my aunt’s house for a family gathering. I have an uncle who was in the navy, for more context. Anyways, I tell her and my family to not thank them on this day as it was for “thanking” and memorializing the dead.  All of them get it, and my sister nods. She then goes up to my uncle and thanks him for his service, bla bla. I tell her stop, don’t do that! She listens, and goes with my cousins outside. Since I have nothing to do, I go outside with them. That’s where it really goes downhill.

Outside, I see an old man with my uncle. My uncle tells us that he is his friend, also a veteran. Guess what my sister does? Yupm she keeps thanking him.

The reason why I am upset is that she has told all of the other bridesmaids her plan and left me out of it. Normally, this might seem like a younger sister upset that she's not getting her way.

But the main part that I am upset is that I currently work in the bridal industry. Every time I try to offer help or advice towards certain elements, she ignores me. Being in the wedding industry means that I have the timeline for when you should be booking certain things and most importantly buying the dress.

I found out through a mutual friend who happens to be the MoH, who mentioned the trip to me when we were talking about planning the bachelorette party, and she was shocked that I knew nothing of it. She also mentioned a designer that my sister is looking at, and that is a big seller at the bridal studio I have connections at. I know my sister is trying to keep costs low due to her and her fiance paying for everything themselves, so I don't understand why she wouldn't want to use my connections to get a lower price on the dress.

IDK, I just don't understand why I am being left out of this, like she's left me out of a lot during our lives.

Being in high school I understood money was tight and they probably wanted to make sure my little brother had a good Christmas. I made one simple request, some new mesh for my lacrosse stick (about $30) they said okay.  Christmas came and everyone had gifts under the tree. We opened the gifts one at a time so my parents could take pictures, explain the gifts, etc. When my older brother opened his and got a PlayStation game I got a little confused but I wrote it off as that being his one big thing. My first gift was a hand me down pair of sunglasses that my dad had been wearing for month. The loop happened again and my older brother opened up a brand new tackle box. The pattern continued with me getting hand me downs and dollar store gags while he got much more expensive things. By the end I was pretty pissed and I yelled at my parents which started an argument prompting me to stay with a friend until after New Years. While I was really pissed at the disparity the thing that really set it off was that they didn’t even get me the one request I had after having spent well over 300-400 on each of my brothers. They later explained that they wanted my older brother to have a memorable Christmas since it was his last one before he turned 18.

My wedding was over a month ago, and husband and I didn't want people to spend money on us, we didn't put a wedding gift list,and to the people who asked what to give us, we told them there would be a box at the reception for them to put cards and some cash if they wanted to (we're living abroad and traveled to have the wedding at home, so it wasn't easy for us to receive gifts), but the amount we asked for was what their granny would give them for a 10th birthday. 

Now to my friend, I've known him for +15 years, he's pretty well off and has the annoying antic of bragging about how generous he is with his friends in a way that makes it looks like you're some kind of gold digger. The thing is, the expensive gifts he brags about never arrives. So he'll brag about how he's gonna pay for your vacations and never does it. I've NEVER expected to get anything from him, and when this happens, I usually nod and smile awkwardly. Btw, he's lost friends because of this.

At my wedding, he mentions SEVERAL times how his gift is going to pay for our move to Europe next year (husband and I want to pursue our master's there), he specially did it in front of my in-laws and husband's family. It got to the point where husband's cousins asked him if he knew I was a gold digger (I'm not). Anyways, as I expected, there is no gift from my friend.

I texted him the next day thanking him for attending. He mentions how he ""forgot"" to give me his ""big check"" (his words). I tell him I'll be there for a few more days before going back to my duty station and we can meet but he says he'll be very busy. I then mention he can drop his gift at my mom's house, but he says he wants to see my face when I see it, as it's the BIGGEST gift he's ever gave me (for the record, he has never gave me anything more than an ice cream invitation on my birthdays).

Fast forward to last week, I'm back home for work stuff and we met. He didn't say anything about the gift. I honestly don't give a crap about the gift itself, but I think he crossed a line with what he did at my wedding and I should teach him a lesson by putting him in a situation in which he *has* to give me the gift he bragged about, or admit he didn't intend to give me anything and apologize for how uncomfortable he made me feel.

Husband thinks that's an asshole move, bc we're not entitled to any gift, and I should just let it go, but cut ties w him. So WIBTA for setting my friend up, so he has to give me a wedding gift?

EDIT explaining the set up: I basically thought about meeting with him and other friends we have in common next time I'm home, and casually mention how thanks to xxx gift we were able to buy a coffee machine in the country we're currently living in. I know he'll take the bait and brag (specially bc he's done it before but I've said nothing). In that moment, I'll say he didn't gave me anything, thus forcing him to admit he didn't plan to give anything or just give me what he bragged about out of embarrassment, knowing I won't stay quiet if he dares to brag about it again.

Hey reddit community,

first of all I´m sorry if I do some rookie mistakes in my post. It´s my first reddit post ever and I´m not a native speaker.

A few weeks ago I visited a girl I was already dating over a short time about two years ago. It didn´t work out because I went to Australia after we finished school and she left our hometown to study. Anyway recently I saw some Instagram post from her being back in town so I wrote her and she invited me to visit her in the city where she´s now studying.

The visit was great. We went out, had a lot of fun and hooked up. I didn´t really expect our connection to be that good after having no contact for two years. It really felt like we were on the same level on everything. We also had some really deep talk about live and so on. I never thought she was the kind of person who you could talk to about stuff like that.

Therefore after I came back I thought a lot about her and I talked with some of my close friends about her. Of course I was asked if we had sex. And I just didn´t have the mental strength to deny it. I don´t hook up very often and that weekend was very special for me. I didn´t brag about it, but I didn't want to lie to my friends either.

Last saturday she sent me a screenshot where a friend of her, and I thought of me too, sent her this:

**""LOL, didn´t know that \[my name\] came up to visit you and fuck you. xD xD""**

&#x200B;

I told her I never said to anyone that I only visited to fuck her and that I´m really sorry that she got a message like this. I asked my friends who told that rumor around and one guy tells me that he was at the same party as the guy who sent the text. He told that dude that I visited her, but not that we hooked up. Apparently he guessed that by himself. The shitty thing on top of all that is that another guy visited her and told everybody they hooked up although they didn´t.

She didn´t answer me for three days so I sent another voice message explaining that I only talked with close friends about the weekend and never braged about it public or stuff like that. I told her that I´m really sorry and that it would suck if we never had contact again beacause of this shit. She didn´t even listen to it.

I know I´m kind of the asshole here because if I had kept my mouth shut there wouln´t be any rumor at all. On the other side I think the real dickhead is the guy who sent her that text. Who talks to a close friend like that? ""He visited you to fuck you lol"". Seriously?

Is it justified for her to ghost me forever? I mean we are not 16 anymore and it shouln´t be such a drama if people know we hooked up? I really understand that she´s pissed, and I told her that I´m angry at myself for that shit that happend but in the end it´s just others people gossip is it? And she doesen´t even live in this city anymore and said that she´s not in contact with these people anyway.

*I´m really torn apart if I´m such an asshole here that she´s justified to break up contact like this.*

Thanks for any constructive comments.

Edit 1: Concerning the motive of the guy who sent her the text: He actually knows her very long and I think she considers him as a good friend. Once at a party He told me: ""If you want her go for it, when she's that drunk it's so easy. I know him since two years and we played online games together a lot in the past. He has a girlfriend since two years. I  can't really explain myself his motive except complete ignorance about beeing such a dick to her and to me.

Edit 2: Concerning how she talks about sex: She was very open, you could talk with her about anything.

For a grand total of 10 parrots will be in my house for the next 2 months at least. Last time my grandma stayed with us she was an absolute nightmare to deal with. Never wanted the animals out of their enclosures and would demand I put them away and at the time we only had 4 pets. And most had cages. And now i have one bjrd that views his cage as a sleeping area and he spends most of his day on a stand. And nearly all of them fly. My grandma has threatened to and actually tried to smack my pets out of the air before. Am i an ass if i don't want her to move in? If i tell my parents this? It's been suggested she stay in a nursing home but it seems like that's not happening.

She is NOT gonna be happy about the baby bird set up and the fact they'll be out a TON bc i have to make them like people enough to either sell them or keep them as pets.",149,71,0.9

A bit of context: My girlfriend has severe anxiety disorders and she can't go home by herself or she'll have a panic attack. Our school is hell and she might be transferred to another school (which she doesn't want to). Her friend who has been friends with her since primary is applying to move schools.

We were walking home one day and the subject of schools came up and they were talking about how she was going to walk home if her friend got accepted. She asked me,
""Will you walk home with me?"" 
and i said,
""Of course"" as she is my girlfriend.
But my mental health has started to go downhill with all of the stress the school has been putting on students (my school doesn't have the best image right now either) and my mum suggested ( she doesn't like my school either) i apply to the same school as my girlfriend's friends because this school was putting too much pressure. Me and my mum had a talk about this and she said you have to put yourself first but i still feel like she's going to be mad at me and i'll have to deal with her friend for the rest of my school life if i get accepted.

Two weeks ago, I went on a long weekend break with some of my friends. There were 8 of us in total, five guys three girls, and we rented out a cabin at one of those holiday parks where they have pools and spas and that. Of the 8, two were a friends brother and his girlfriend, neither of whom I know very well but they always seemed a good laugh. The booking was made in my name as I'm the ""dad friend"" of the group and the one everyone trusts to be most responsible. 

Background done, midway through the weekend I got food poisoning and was out for the count for the last two days we were there. On the final night, everyone went to the onsite bar, while I was at the cabin in bed. They came back and continued drinking, and while I could hear that they were being really loud and rowdy, I thought it was just regular young people partying and went back to sleep. Not the case. I discovered the next morning that they'd *trashed* the place. I cleaned up as best I could and had a massive go at everyone, so a couple of them helped me with the cleaning. However, there was a mirror that had been broken, two cupboards who's doors had come off and a sink had come away from the wall. These were repairs that would cost a pretty penny to fix, and I was issued a bill, which I sent to everyone who went. 

When my mate's brother chimed up with ""alright we'll just split this 8 ways, yeah?"" I flat refused to pay for it since I had no part in what happened. I also have it on good authority that he and his girlfriend were the main perpetrators in the damage, so it was especially annoying that he would be the one to ask me to chip in. He told me I'm being an arsehole, that everyone who was there should pay and that as the bill is in my name it's my responsibility so if anyone should have to pay it should be me. I'm still not willing to pay, and don't believe I should have to, and support is divided more or less 50/50 in the group as to if they're on my side or his. Am I being unreasonable by refusing to pay,  or am I justified?",64,245,0.96

We have been dating for 2 1/2 years and he wanted me to come with him. For the first time, because he thought I could handle it, and wanted me to see what it was like. The weeks leading up I felt a little uneasy, probably because I was nervous what to pack, and the conversations that would be discussed. I am in a different industry and sometimes get anxiety in social setting where everyone knows each other, and I don’t. We went Two days before the events started so we could spend some alone time, and he could show me around. Those two days before the events were great! Sunday night I went to his company’s party and it was definitely what I expected...lots of people socializing, and drinking. Monday night we had a dinner, and a poker lesson for another firm, and Wednesday we went to another dinner, then a club where it was featuring one of his favorite Dj’s. This company got a table where there was bottle service, and limited guest list. I understand the importance of networking, and saving face by attending...but we had just done a dinner with this company the night before. I felt like that was enough and we don’t have to do everything with them.

1804,Not the A-hole,"My \[25M\] ex-Gf \[24F\] (together for 10 months, 1.5 month after a break up) asked me to delete the entire conversation between us on facebook. It's a whole lot of messages.

She wants it deleted because there are some nude photos she send me. I said I will delete photos (not sure if it's possible but I guess it is - I'm at work atm so can't really check it) but refused to delete the rest.

There are few reasons for me not to do it and to be honest I could but don't really want to.

So she accuses me of being an asshole. Said some nasty stuff about letting her down and being wrong about me the whole time.

Shortly after a break up (she cheated on me) I assured her I'm not gonna use these photos in any way - her response was ""It didn't even cross my mind for a second and I know you will not do anything"".

Now - I want to do what she wants - delete photos (which makes very little sense since I could just have a copy of them on my laptop - which I did at the beggining) and yet somehow she still calls me the asshole.

There was no drama but by an accident I found out about the fact that she is in a relationship with a guy I suspected she was cheating on me as well (I didn't want to believe it - I convinced myself that this one time was a huge mistake). I don't know if it changes anything but I do not feel good about it as it changes my perspective on her as a person (she stuck to her lies - feeding me more lies when I didn't even ask and it wasn't even necessary).

Me and my family have a big country house and my parents decided to have my uncle, his wife and their son (who we'll call Tom) over this last weekend as the weather seemed quite lovely. Tom isn't blood related to me as he was adopted one year before I was born and he knows this. We're both of age. Neither mine nor his family has enough free time to travel much so this was a good opportunity for us to catch up.

I recently broke up with my boyfriend and am going through a rough patch. Nothing serious, just a lot of negative emotions. I was excited to spend some time with family and get my mind off things. We catch up, have a fantastic dinner, drinks are flowing and I got quite tipsy. Me and Tom were snap chatting each other and making fun of our drunk parents. Suddenly our convo got a bit more playful. I put down my phone and tried to pay more attention to the heated Brexit debate that was taking place. I couldn't be bothered to listen so picked my phone up again and started downright flirting with Tom. We keep chatting over Snapchat throughout the entire night. It got quite late and everybody went to bed, me and Tom kept texting each other. I tell him to come to my room so we can watch a film. He did and as you can imagine we never got around to seeing the film.

&#x200B;

The morning after, Tom and his parents were leaving early so I got up to say my goodbyes. I went back in to have breakfast and enjoy the rest of the weekend. My parents came in the room and started shouting at me. My mum is a light sleeper so when she heard movement upstairs she woke up. She proceeded to hear us have sex. And God was she upset. I got called pretty much every name in the book.  She said that she will not get over it and even if she does she will not forget it. Both mum and dad are not currently speaking to me. I am not sure if they will tell my uncle or aunt and I really hope not.

&#x200B;

My argument is that he isn't related to me, and there were no strings attached. We both made that clear when we woke up in the morning. My parents said I am a disgrace to this family.

so my neice is a spoiled brat, she gets whatever she wants whenever she wants it. 
her dad did a 10.00pm  bk run because she wanted a ice slushy and homemade ones are not good enough. imagine that with everything.

now onto her birthday. 
she opens my gift and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is, oh I've never heard of this pallet before must be crap. she then proceeded to throw it on the floor and kick it under the chair, I was livid and her parents made an embarrassing laugh and moved on. 
she then opened aunties gift, it was a 40$ clothing voucher. she then kicked a fuss because it was not 50$, so it also ended up under the chair with my eyeshadow pallet. 
my auntie looked like she was going to cry. 
she then opened the present from my parents, it was a kyle Jenner lip product. turns out that they got the wrong shades and so she refused to put it on her lips. 

I got fucking pissed and stood up and called her a fucking spoiled brat who does not care about the effort the family put into the gifts, I then went on about how ungrateful she is and that I regret spending my money on her, and that I hope one day she understands how lucky she is.

&#x200B;

Over this last weekend I got a chance to try out a game console for three days, it was the first time I've had fun playing video games in quite a while (even though I'm a pretty dedicated PC gamer, I mostly only do it to pass free time these days, what little of that I have). I decided that I wanted to buy one, came up with a savings plan immediately, and discussed it with my wife, who was on board with with me saving up for one.

&#x200B;

Cut to yesterday, apparently in my excitement I've massively annoyed and offended my wife by bringing up the console several times since Friday. Gadgets and electronics are a hobby of mine, and I haven't spent a large chunk of change on myself in a few years, so I was more than a bit giddy and looking forward to this, and I'll admit that maybe I did talk about it a bit too much.

&#x200B;

The straw that broke the camels back though was after I finally found a buyer, and sold my old car (note, my car specifically), I used 3/4ths of the proceeds to pay down a debit, and made an offhand comment about using the rest to buy the console, which was the wrong move apparently.

&#x200B;

My wife, i don't want to say exploded, but was pretty upset with me, saying, and this is just a summary, that my comments made her feel like I was whining until I got what I wanted, that I need to just wait to save up for it, and the one that took me by surprise, that I cant just let her enjoy surprising and spoiling me. Now, i'm the kind of person who takes what people say at face value if it comes from someone I trust, and my wife's vehement agreement that I should save made me believe that nothing else was going on.

&#x200B;

She went on to explain that the day after I decided to start saving, she and her mother were going to get me the console on fathers day, and that she hates how I can ""never let anyone spoil me"", then told me to just go and buy it.

&#x200B;

 After we talked about it a bit more she calmed down and we decided to order the console on amazon instead of waiting for fathers day. I now feel like an a-hole because in my excitement to talk about something that really interested me I've annoyed my wife, ruined a surprise she had in mind, and didnt let her just have her fun (even though i knew nothing about what she was planning).

one of the guys makes a joke about the Australian government/ election as he is Australian, we laughed and made some more jokes, that was untill one of the guys went on a rant about the Australian government and how bad it was and killed the mood. we moved on and just made more jokes, but every slightly political joke or topic we switched to we made was meant with a rant that killed the mood immediately. 
I was talking about a YouTube video where a guy made a prison burrito, this guy decided to then explain how the prison system is corrupt and how it feeds on minorities.

1813,Not the A-hole,"So I really need advice on what to do here guys, I need a boys opinion. 

I have been dating My boyfriend for about 3 months now, and I have a chronic disease called FND that he knows about. I live a mostly normally life apart from intermittent muscle spasms, twice which has involved my intercostal muscles and effected my ability to breathe. The first time it happened at his house and I drove myself to the hospital and everything so as not to worry him, but he didn’t talk to me for 4 days afterwards. He himself had childhood cancer which he beat, so I assumed that it hit too close to home and reminded him of when he was sick. I actually took a break from us dating because I was so hurt, but we got back together after he apologised. He’s also said other offhand comment about how he’d “never date a bald girl” and “never date a girl in a wheelchair”. 

That being said, he’s amazing to me. He tells me he’d do anything for me, and when I had another attack of these muscle spasms he looked after me at home and he actually took me to the hospital and sat with me for hours and rubbed my back etc. He’s very accepting of my FND now, though I do try not to let him see when I’m feeling really ill. 

Since the episode last week I’ve had difficulty eating without throwing back up, and intense pain in my stomach, and when I went to the doctors he said he could feel an “epigastric mass” (unknown mass/lump in my stomach/gut) and is sending me for an ultrasound tomorrow morning. 

I haven’t told my boyfriend how sick I’ve been all week, and I didn’t tell him when the doctor found this mass yesterday. Am I the asshole for not telling him because i don’t want to upset him again and make him go silent for days? Also, I’m scared he’ll break up with me for being sick. Or would he be more angry that his girlfriend, who he loves, is keeping a secret about her health?

1816,Not the A-hole,"Okay, so. 

I bought this apartment (on my own) last August for 4.000.000 NOK (+/- $460k) at the time I bought it using saved up found and a bank loan. (The loan was for 3.2M or $365k)

I’d met my girlfriend when we were 18 (we’re 22 now, I was 21 when I bought the apartment) but she went to university across the country and so our relationship was long distance. She had her own place I had mine. Cool.

Now my parents are very rich, they made some great investments in the early 90’s that really paid off for them. They’re not billionaires but they have a wealthy wallet. 

My parents have been saving up money for me and my brothers to buy homes when we got old enough. They had originally decided to gift me this money after I finised my Masters degree, but due to some circumstances that aren’t relevant and I won’t go into they agreed to give it to me now, on the promise that the money went to the apartment only. 

After the money I got from my parents my loan is down to 200nok or $23k. My girlfriend (let’s call her Jane) has finished her degree, she started earlier than me and is now a fully educated High School teacher, yay! 

We’ve been talking about Jane moving in with me for a while now, and she’s gotten a job and everything. However she wants to be equals, which I absolutely love. She wants to be written into the mortgage agreement, whoch is fine to me.

Here’s the thing though I feel like the money I got from my parents is mine and mine alone. So I’ve told her that she can buy 50% of the apartment off of me, I’ll return the remaining money to my parents as the money would no longer be in the apartment as originally agreed.

Jane can’t afford to pay me 2M out of pocket and would need to get a loan.  Which I completely understand, but here’s the thing though. She wants me to help her pay back the loan. I told her I’m not going to do that as I’ve ealready paid my half. I’ll split the bills and food and everything else 50/50, but I’m not going to pay her loan for her. Same goes with my (our?) car on a smaler scale.

Few things to note in case it comes up:
- we’re both 22 (‘96) she’s older by six months
- we both work, me part time and her full time, I study as well.
- we’re both girls.
- neither her parents nor her are particularly well off, nor poor, jus kinda middleclass average.
- also I’m not entirely sure what this would mean if our relationship got to the next step, I think a wife is different than a girlfriend, but even though we’ve been dating for years we’ve never lived together.

1817,Not the A-hole,"I recently joined my company's Systems Engineering team. My company doesn't pay overtime and my manager doesn't want to give out TIL. The arrangement for if you work out of hours (weekend server maintenance for example) is:

* You can come in a bit later or leave earlier if you had to work more than your regular hours.
* This time isn't 1:1.
* I am discouraged to leave earlier because I am the only engineer based outside of the US time zone and I need to have an overlap with them.
* You must email the team if you plan to come in later or leave earlier but you shouldn't specify why this is (which feels dodgy to me) 

The problem with this is that my job responsibilities make it difficult to come in a little bit later. Given my role I am of course expecting to have to work late from time to time however the work life balance is so far off, last week I worked an extra 25 hours due to a multitude of issues, project deadlines etc. the burnout was real and because of the frequency that I was having to work late it was causing me issues in my personal life and impacting mental health. At the end of that 65-hour week I was sitting at my desk feeling miserable and un-motivated and underlying feeling was that by working so many un-compensated hours that my time value was decreasing.

Anyway, fast forward to the issue this week. I am making a conscious effort to leave work on time so I can go home and relax and spend time with my girlfriend, work on my side-business and study. However there is project this week that came back to me after a few issues came-up and because it's a related to a specialist platform that my team isn't trained on only I can really resolve the issues, instinctively I thought about working late to plough through it which is my traditional approach but I know that I won't get any sort of appreciation or acknowledgement for that and I'll end up just making myself miserable and because of my core proactive responsibilities I only really have 1 hour or 2 that I can work on this per day and this is the kind of project where I need to be able to lock myself in a room and give it my un-interrupted attention - I am keeping my team posted on this but I feel like they are expecting me to work late on this. 

I can't shake this feeling that I am being unfair for not putting in the extra effort, so please keep me in check, am I being an asshole for not giving up my personal time to get this project completed?",20,28,0.9

My now wife used to work in another state and she has two daughters. We dated long distance and I would see her every other week when I travelled for work.

My son has met her and her daughters many many times and we moved slow. We only married after the kids were ok with it.

My wife finally got a new job here three months ago and we bought a house together in the same city my son and I live in. Her kids are still adjusting to the move and are not thrilled.

The problem now is with my ex, my son and my wife's 6 year old German Shepard.

My son has met this dog many times before and has had no issues before.

Well, after we bought the house and my wife brought the dog here permanently, there has been a whole disaster.

Remember that my son has seen this dog many times before with no issues and there is no known history of dog allergies.

But now it seems he's having a mild reaction to the dog all of a sudden. It's some redness around his eyes and sniffling. An allergist has confirmed this.

My ex has gone absolutely crazy (more than usual) and refused to let my son over unless the dog is removed. She is also not approving the use of anti-histamines if the reaction is bothering him.

I ended up spending 40k to renovate our basement so my son would have a living space that is totally separate from the dog. I also bought several air purifiers and vacuum and scrub everything every single day when he's living here. It's exhausting. But the moment he complains of a possible reaction my ex takes him back to her house even though it's my custody time.

Now it appears my son is listening to his mother and making ultimatums that he won't be coming over unless we get rid of the dog.

You can see why this is difficult for me. My wife and stepdaughters are completely attached to their dog. My wife is beside herself and is now saying she regrets buying the house together. But we are stuck with the house for a while because of financial reasons.

I really thought the separate living area was a good compromise. It's much nicer than the rest of the house. And I'm down there the entire time he is.

I'm just so sick of my ex constantly trying to run my life and I refuse to put my wife and stepdaughters through something as traumatic as giving up their dog. 

My ex told me yesterday I was putting the dog over my son's needs and it broke my heart. That is not what I'm doing. And it's killing me that he's hearing this from her.

To avoid the vultures circling when I eventually pop off, I decided some years ago to choose the children of a particular cousin as beneficiaries in my will.  I thought this made sense, as that cousin was the hardest-working of the lot and the one I was closest to as a child, but since cousin is older than me and not in great health leaving my estate to her is probably pointless.  

Fast forward about fifteen years, and to say I'm disappointed in how these kids turned out is an understatement. They're not evil or anything, but they've fallen into the lifestyle many people in this area have - first child by sixteen, another one every year after to different mothers/fathers, not working for periods longer than a few weeks.  I never intended to make my will conditional on everyone getting a degree or anything, but I thought they'd turn out more like my cousin - a good, hard-working working class mother.

I have a piano. It's not special or anything, but it is mine and I take good care of it. I've been playing the piano for about 4 years now.

The piano is in my grandparent's house (I live there too), right next to the living room.

I also have loads of cousins who like to visit my grandparents during holidays or whenever they can. Most of them are cool, except for my uncle's family - their kids are super loud and messy. Their oldest kid is cool, but their younger kids are a handful. The youngest kiddo, who I think is about 2-3 yo, really likes to 'play' my piano, when in reality he just smashes the keys for 20 minutes couple times per day. His mom doesn't do anything about it, besides laughing and saying how cute and talented he is. I hate it.

So last year I asked my dad if it would be possible for him to make a lock for the piano. Since he works with metal, he was able to make a small lock and place in to the side of the keyboard. It worked wonderfuly. The next time my uncle's family visited, the piano was locked 24/7. The youngest kiddo tried to pry open the piano, but got bored after 20 seconds and went to play with something else. 

Now for the problem:
My other cousin, this little girl, visited us few months ago. Her family lives in a different country and visits us rarely. When they do visit, they are treated very well. Anything is available for them and everyone has to always listen to them. (I really don't like it, so I just stay in my room). It turns out that the little girl (who is maybe 7??) is taking music lessons and was really interested in my piano. It was locked because I forgot to unlock since the last time. The girl's mother told me to unlock it, so I did. The girl was playing softly at first, but then it turned into smashing again. I got up, walked over to the girl and said 'play more softly'. She got scared and went to her mother. I locked the piano again, since noone was using it, and went to my room. The next day the girl wanted to play again. She played for about 15 minutes and went somewhere. I got up, locked the piano again and went to my room again. Few hours later I go downstairs again and the girl's mother is looking angry/sad/nervous. All my family starts yelling at me for locking the piano and not letting the girl play it for longer. It turns out, that she went to the bathroom and when she came back, the piano was locked. My mom made me unlock it again.

The thing is that my piano is covered with a sheet of fabric, to protect it from dust and etc. Whenever someone else plays with it, they don't cover it back up. Many times the keyboard is closed wrong, my sheet music is mixed up. I don't like letting others play it, especially when they don't clean it up afterwards. My family expects me to let any kid use it every time they want it.

AITA? (my mom paid for it 4 years ago)",19,46,0.97
1821,Everyone Sucks,"I'm 25 . My mother has paid off my student loans and medical treatment. I have been in the mental hospital twice for extended periods of time. which got very expensive, and she paid that and paid my doctors visits, therapy, everything.

I hate her. She was a good mother to me once, and I remember loving her. Then she became emotionally abusive for \~13 years. I cried myself to sleep most nights. She screamed at me in public. she screamed at me at home. I was in a state of fear all the time because i would never know what set her off. she gaslighted me. pretended she was a loving mom to everyone we knew. Hit and threw things at my dad. Not the worst of abusive parents by far, but it was enough that I feel nothing for her anymore.

I've been trying to get on my feet and she has no idea i hate her. She has treated me kindly in the past 4 years and has stopped being so horrible. I pretend that everything is fine, so she will continue to pay for my treatment while i find a way out of here. I am close. My mental state right now is very good compared to the past, and i've been making a plan for myself. I won't cut her off until I'm on my own 2 feet. 

I don't plan on paying her back for anything. I haven't signed anything or made any promises to her, but she expects me to pay her back and/or take care of her when she's old. I plan on doing nothing of the sort. Kind of like my last revenge on her.

1823,Asshole,"I saw the video of the pelican eating a bird alive and sent it to a friend. It was crude, but they didn't make a big deal about it, so I figured it was okay to pass on. I had also sent the video to another friend and her bf (his phone does not get video messages so I sent it to her). The caption was: Im the pelican and your bf is the bird. I obviously didn’t literally mean that I would eat him alive - we have all been friends for a while and joke around all the time.

She started cursing and sent several messages about asking why I would sent that video, how “fucked up it was”, told me not to send that type of video ever again, and said that she was “really fucking pissed at me”. I told her to calm down. She responded by saying I should never send her stuff like that again. I agreed and said that I didn’t mean to offend her or her boyfriend.

I also told her that a simple “Hey these type of videos freak me out, please don’t send me this kinda stuff” would have been sufficient and that I didn’t appreciate the cursing. I mentioned that I did not know she would react this way, otherwise I wouldn't have sent her the video. 

She replied saying that she “didn’t give a fuck”, that most people I know “aren’t survivors of domestic abuse”, and that I should “back the fuck off”.

I sent a message the next morning saying that I won't back off. I told her that she is not the only person who has been subjected to abuse and that being a survivor of domestic abuse should not be used as justification for telling me off. I understand that people are shaped by their experiences, but I don't believe reacting this way can be justified. I quoted her earlier texts within this message.

She responded by saying “how dare you put quotes on survivor of domestic abuse” and describing the abuse she was subjected to. She then blocked me and unfriended me from all social media.

Today, I called her boyfriend,(we were close friends before her met his gf and began dating). I asked him where we stood after the incident. He told me we were not okay. He said that I was a bitch and needed to find a way to apologize to his girlfriend. I told him that since I had no idea she was going to get triggered by this, I did not deserve to be treated like this and it was uncalled for. He then mentioned that this was the ""tip of the iceberg"" and he and his gf had apparently been having issues with me for a while, which I had no idea about. They had never mentioned this before. He insisted that I think about my actions and apologizing to her. I refuse to apologize for this.

Edit: Her ex was abusive, but her current bf is my friend and he's great. Also, my friend has a history of being belligerent any time she gets even a little upset. She expects everyone to say sorry to her, which is why I didn't apologize.",24,45,0.83

Later she texted me and told me she thought I liked her for more than sex, she got the impression that I wouldn't date her without sex. I texted her that I do, but I can't risk even being accused of anything. She said just ""ok"".

I am 100% pro-choice, and even though I only want two kids , I'm not sure I would be able to abort our fetus... when I said as much he said that if I didn't abort this hypothetical pregnancy he would leave me, as he only wants 2 kids. 

Okay, I said, in that case, why don't you get a vasectomy then?

After a bit of humming and hawing he eventually said he wouldn't want to get a vasectomy in case we split up and his potential new wife wants kids, and he would want to be able to have a new family with her.

While in my rush the only toilet I managed to find was a disabled one, which I decided ""this is an emergency."" I took care of business, no worries, right?

Wrong, I step outside, an individual in a wheelchair is waiting to use the bathroom, and the feeling of shame instantly washes over me. They absolutely let me have it: ""how dare you use the disabled bathroom when this is the only bathroom I can use"". Obviously I accepted my lecture and sulked off with my head down.

My son (3) was laying on my legs fast asleep when my cat, chasing a bug, ran across my son, leaving scratches on his cheek, chest and arm. Don't get me wrong I am pissed at my cat, but my husband is furious, talking about getting rid of my cat and that he's gonna kill him (not in anyway literally kill him) and then gets really pissed at me when I say that he was just a cat chasing a bug, and it wasn't like he mauled our son out of anger. He's actually never inflicted any pain from anger, just being playful, or like tonight's instance, however this is the worst of the times. I've had him for 4 months and he's honestly one of the best cats I've ever had and getting rid of him makes me really sad.

He knows I love my cat and he said he would never get rid of him and I never thought for a second he'd actually hurt him.

1832,Asshole,"My girlfriend and I have been going out for about a year now. Great relationship overall. We've hit a major bump though. Here's what happened:

So I'm not into Game of Thrones. It looks cool, but I've never gotten into it. My girlfriend is a huge fan though. She's read all of the books and has been watching the series since it came out. It's by far her favorite show. The Sunday before last was the huge finale. It also happened to be my birthday. Now I'm a huge birthday guy. For her birthday, back in January, I took her out to one of the best restaurants in my city (Seattle). I also got here a necklace with real gold... and it's not like I have a six-figure income either.

Well, when my birthday came around, guess how she greeted me in the morning: ""OMG the game of thrones finale is tonight. I'm literally dying!"" Not even a happy birthday to me. It wasn't until we went downstairs that she realized it was my birthday. She made me toast, so that's something, I guess.

Well, I was pretty damn disappointed she had nothing planned for me that day. Not even a gift. She's told me before she's ""not a birthday person"". I think that's kind of a shitty excuse considering what I've done for her birthday, but okay.

That night, she went to her parents' place to watch the finale with her family. She invited me along, but l wasn't going to watch a show I had no interest in on my own birthday when I would have rather been out on a date with her. But whatever. I was pissed at this point, so I went online and found out what happened. Just as the show was going to start, I texted her this: ""Hey babe, tell me how the show goes! Especially the part where >!Jon kills Daenerys, the throne is destroyed, and Bran becomes king!!<"" Well she sent me a very heated response, basically telling me what a ""fucking asshole"" I am. An hour and a half later, she calls me, in tears, and asks why I spoiled something she's been waiting for several years for? We didn't have sex that night- in fact she decided to stay at her parents' for the next couple of days. Things have been very shaky since.

1835,Asshole,"Dear All,

Apologies for any wrong formatting as this is the first time I am posting here. Basically, I've informed my wife a few times we are not moving out of my parents house due to the fact that one, it doesn't make any financial sense as the house has been fully paid for and our income would not be able to afford buying another house as the current marketplace has been inflated.

Two, I have spent most of my adult life away from the family, working out of state and offshore. A few years ago, I found a better paying job in my hometown and was looking forward to spending more time with the family. I also married my wife after getting the new job. I value my time spent with the family as we've missed out on each other's company and after a few incidents, we would like to strengthen our bonds together.

Some further info on the house is that we are in a 2 floor, semi detached house with 4 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. one room is for my parents, one room is for my aunt, one room is for my brother and his wife and one room is for us. Currently, my father is waiting for one of his construction projects to finish up or for one of his major assets (a row of shop houses) to be formally? sold. Then, he will do his planned Trans America trip on a motorcycle on which sometimes, my mother will follow him around. In the mean time, my mother and aunt will go back to the hometown as my father has completed his small townhouse there and my mother will be very close to her mother and siblings as well.They will also move there after the trip and will come to current town once in a while for business. My brother and wife are currently waiting on their home application to go through and the housing project to be completed.

Third, the house has many sentimental values to me personally, and i  would like to keep it. I have informed and discussed with both parents that i would like to take over the house, and they have both discussed/agreed with the same points. The current house is in a good location and we have recently renovated and upgraded the houses' sanitary and electrical wiring system.

The issue has been brought up time to time as my wife feels we need some privacy, especially now that we aree impatient I guess? She has an expectation that we would have property on our own and not some handed down? (very common thinking in asian countries like us)

p/s: I also don't want to imply that I am rich by any means. My father has his own construction company but my brother and I do not work for him. I work in an engineering company while my brother is in the armed forces. We all currently live under the same understanding that the household expenses will be split into equal parts and each have our own budget and contributions .

My graduation ceremony is in less than 24 hours. Before we walk into the floor, we’re given a card with our full legal name, and a pencil in case we want to be called another name or to help out the announcers by writing the pronunciation out. 

My legal first name is Kaitlyn. However I’ve been going by the name of “Kay” for the last 4 years, nearly no one knows my full/real name and always calls me Kay. During practices I’ve been writing “Kay” on the card over my legal name, and without the confrontation of my mum that happened less than an hour ago, I would’ve continued to do this for the real thing.

My mum refuses to call me Kay even after I have asked her to and that I’ll always be “Kaitlyn” to her. I’ve  respected her decisions since they don’t effect me in any big way until now. However, she wants me to go by my legal name for MY graduation ceremony. I believe it’s my choice, and it’s reasonable since I’ve 1) been going by this name for years, so it’s not out of the blue and 2) isn’t anything ridiculous and still resembles my birth given name.

1844,Asshole,"This is my first reddit post outside of my regular subreddits so I hope I am following all of the rules. I am happy to edit if necessary. 

There is a long history regarding this necklace, it's an Opera length necklace my great grandfather purchased for my great grandmother when they were in Europe in the early 1930s. They were quite wealthy but lost everything because of the depression and war and the necklace is pretty much all I have of their legacy. 

I have never gotten along with my Daughter-in-law. She has been a continuous pain in my side since the day she sauntered into my life and she has done a spectacular job of turning my son against me. The only thing she has done to benefit me is give me my beautiful grandchildren but we are on what she calls ""limited contact"" because I feel it's a grandparent's job to spoil the grandchildren and she won't allow it. I know for certain my daughter-in-law is a gold digger because she continuously complements me on the things that me and my late husband bought (our home for example) and derides me for the way I spend money with my live-in. But I can tell from her tone of voice, it's a ""grabby"" type of compliment and not genuine. 

Of course one of the things wants is the necklace. Against my better judgment I let her borrow it once and she could not stop talking about how it ""made her outfit"" and the most phony thank you I've ever heard from a person. I vowed with my live-in that day she would never get the necklace. I am planning on giving it to a friend's daughter-in-law who is much more loving and gracious then the disaster my son decided to marry. 

My son is furious with me. He thinks I'm giving away a family legacy and they ""worst"" that's going to happen is my granddaughter is going to get it. What he doesn't see is that my daughter-in-law is going to sell it for scrap the second my back is turned. My son accuses me of being ridiculous but I just don't see it like that.

1845,Not the A-hole,"I feel like I was too harsh and even my husband thinks I could have done it better but I feel like that's partly because he hasn't felt the full weight of my father's micromanagement. 

Growing up I had certain interests, I was VERY into these activities. Around the time I was in the 8th grade my sister got jealous of the success I was having in this area. After that point I was strongly ""discouraged"" from taking part in these activities unless it was at school. Instead they pushed me to work with children. They told me it was my gift (super Christian family) and that I shouldn't squander my talent. 

So there's the background on why I think I responded so strongly. My youngest daughter is tall and always has been. She's 11 years old and 5'6"" and is still growing. Starting at about age 5? My father has pushed me to make her do basketball. Because she's tall, I mean let's ignore the fact that she inherited my clumsy gene, that she's a very shy girl, that she hates crowds and noise. Ugh.

Anyway a few days ago I made a rare visit to my parent's house, I felt it was safe because family friends were there. I was bemoaning the utter lack of art day camps or just evening classes. All three of my girls love art so I'm looking for something that they will actually enjoy. 

My father brought up fucking basketball again. ""You need to get youngest daughter into it, who cares if she doesn't want to. You're the parent just tell her she's doing it.""

Honestly it brought up a lot of really shitty feelings that I didn't realize were still hanging around. I got up grabbed my purse and told him he could fuck off and left.

1846,Asshole,"So, for context, this is the final year of school and we are both 18. This girl joined the school a couple years ago and is very popular in groupchats because she's genuinely smart, helps people out with notes and with understanding class material a lot (which I have taken advantage of admittedly), and can be quite a laugh, but she only has friends over text. In real life she's quiet, avoids sitting with people unless they specifically approach her, and she doesn't have any close friends which I think is because our school puts a lot of focus on sports and she says she isn't fit enough to do any (she is probably obese). Also she has quite poor hygiene - she often smells like she is trying to cover up that she hasn't showered and her hair's always greasy, she never wears makeup or does her hair, or puts any effort into her appearance at all. She's been spoken to about this and each time it improves for a little but she apparently has a lot of stress and she quickly returns to a slightly below acceptable level of hygiene.

Exams started recently and in one of my exams I had to sit behind her. I found the smell slightly distracting but soon got used to it. However her hair was full of dandruff and I couldn't help staring at it, then she scratched her head and lots of flakes came out, 1 hour into a 3 hour exam. I felt very disgusted and distracted from the exam I was meant to be doing. I called over an examinator and asked to be moved elsewhere because I was distracted by the bad smell and the dandruff. I did try to be quiet about it. I was moved further back, but a few minutes later, she started quietly crying, which distracted more people, and she had to leave the exam.

Later on in the groupchat someone asked her why she'd left because they had only seen her leave and not heard what I said. She joked that she was so distractingly sexy that she had to leave, and I was annoyed because people knew she'd left because of me, just not what I'd said, and I didn't want them to believe her. So I told her in the groupchat that it was actually because she was distractingly nasty, though I didn't go into detail. Then she left the groupchat and blocked me everywhere.

People are now saying I need to apologize for making her leave the exams, as they are quite difficult to get resits for and she might not pass because she had to leave early. But it wasn't my fault that she left the exams, it's her fault that she didn't handle stress well, didn't take care of herself, and couldn't control her emotions when she was called out on it. Also I can't really apologize as she blocked me, and she won't be going to prom so I won't ever see her in real life again. I do feel a bit of an asshole though and I don't know if I should feel guilty or if people are just making me feel like I was an asshole.

So should I feel like an asshole?",58,47,0.64

1848,Not the A-hole,"Backstory real quick: (20M) I’m a ginger (orange hair, freckles, and I wear glasses as well) and have been made fun of for it for basically my whole life; I’ve had to hear just about every term in the book from firehead, red, carrot top, firecrotch, etc. All of it really pisses me off but I try to keep it to myself b/c god forbid people think I “can’t take a joke”.

On several different occasions a professor I had in one of my tech classes this past semester made “jokes” about it. Second week of the year he says after forgetting my name “I’ll remember you, you’re the guy with no soul” and third week “Oh that’s right EverywhereForever, you’re the ginger with no soul”. Most of the class laughed, I was pissed and too embarrassed to say anything. It stopped for awhile after that though. Towards the end of the semester though he did it again, and I straight lost my cool and said “It’s not funny. How would you like it if I called you baldy every day I walked in?” He didn’t say anything, class was quiet and he just continued with his lesson. I left for the bathroom b/c I was embarrassed and just got it together and walked back into class like nothing happened. The next day a kid talks to me outside class and said I was a dick about it and I just shrugged. Far be it from me to think something as arbitrary as my fucking hair color would be beyond juvenile and insulting remarks in college. AITA for the way I had reacted to this? This was mostly younger kids who had just graduated last year I think so I guess it may have influence on how they think but I wouldn’t expect it from a professor.",25,36,0.89

1850,Asshole,"As the title says, I have a friend who has OCD. When out in public she never forces anyone to follow her rules, but her house is another story.

Whenever I go over to her house, I always see rule pages all OVER the place. Specifically on every door leading into another room. These rules are in place to prevent her from having an ‘OCD attack’. She’s said they’re not just for others to follow, but just as a reminder to herself. It’s ridiculous. 

These rules are like; don’t sit down anywhere without telling where. Wash your hands after coming inside. Wash your hands after eating before touching anything. Don’t sit down anywhere without permission, etc etc. It’s really annoying.

Of course I always tend to forget about the rule pages around, I’m used to them there so I pay no mind. Because of this I had forgotten some of the rules, and sat down on the couch (which had her clean laundry on it so I just moved it to the side)  while she was in the bathroom.

Needless to say, she was panicked when she saw. Apparently she didn’t know if my hands were safe or not, and since I had moved her laundry it is now “infected” and “unsafe” which gave her a TOTAL breakdown.

She started crying, asking me why I would do such a horrible thing. I find her behaviour absolutely ridiculous, overdramatic, so I tell her to just get over it! This pissed her off even more. She told me to please leave and that I was an asshole because she can’t help it.

1851,Not the A-hole,"Okay so hear me out. This guy Sam (18) really likes my sister Maddy (17), but she doesn’t really give him the time of day. Sam asked her out to prom, and she rejected him because she was hoping one of her crushes asked her. When none of them did, she begrudged took him to prom (Maddy asked him days before prom). Leading up to the day, my sister constantly says she’d *never* date him because “he’s like a brother to me”. So she clearly didn’t see him as a romantic/sexual prospect, right?

So prom came around this weekend. My mom is really laidback, and let our house be the house where everyone crashed. Everyone went to sleep at around 1.

Well he came upstairs from the basement to the kitchen and we made conversation. I asked him if he had a fun night, and he shrugged and said Maddy mostly just hung with her girlfriends, and he felt kind of let down. I asked what he was doing up to now and he said he just wanted to get some water.

I asked him if he smoked (weed) and he said yeah, so I told him we could smoke on the patio. We did and just chatted and talked about prom, and just about funny stories in general. We were just conversing for 15 minutes, and we ended up close to each other. I leaned in for a kiss and one thing lead to another, and we ended up having sex.

Well my sister came upstairs (she apparently awoken when Sam went upstairs) and she screamed at me and said how could I steal *her* prom date. I said she’s said MANY times that she doesn’t like him like that, and if she really saw him like a friend, I don’t get what’s the big deal. She said I “betrayed her” and I’m a shitty excuse for a sister. She hasn’t talked to me a single time since, which hurts because we used to be BEST friends.

When we found out we were expecting our first child I assumed she would use the hospital closest to us that's 15 min away in a heavily populated city. My assumptions were wrong and now we have to drive 40 min when she's ready to give birth. This concerns me because you never know what can go wrong and to me that's a large commute. 

She thinks this was the best choice for her because it's where she feels most comfortable and it's a smaller hospital with more one on one care.

AITA because I keep bringing this up as something that really frustrates me and it has led to a few arguments/disagreements? I've even asked the opinions of family members and this makes her upset because they suggest she switches but she's adament on not doing so.",174,298,0.88
1853,Not the A-hole,"New poster, long time lurker, abysmal at grammar, sorry for any errors. 

This is basically exactly what the title says. My twin sister is childfree. And I don't just mean in the ""doesn't have kids, doesn't want them"" kind of way. I mean in the ""actively hates children, uniromically refers to parents as ""breeders"" with a tone of disgust"" kind of way.  I honestly don't know *why* she hates kids so much, but she does and that's her prerogative. I'm the polar opposite. I think kids are awesome and I have a daughter of my own who is 6. I'm split up from her mother, but we're still very good friends and co parent very amicably.  

My sister has nothing to do with my daughter. She will talk to her at family events if other people are around, but will not see her alone. It's to the point where she'll only come visit me if my daughter is a) at her mum's or b) in bed, so she doesn't have to be around her. Again, this is her prerogative and it seemingly works for her, so whatever. However, the issue lies in the fact that, even though she has nothing to do with my kid herself, she seems to feel she's entitled to comment on my parenting. Some examples of this; I still let my daughter sleep in my bed if she's feeling sick or has a nightmare, and my sister says this is bad parenting and will stunt her emotionally; I got my daughter a tablet for Christmas last year and generally let her sit and play with it for an hour or two a day while I do housework or uni coursework or whatever, sister says I'm rotting her brain; I asked our mum to babysit overnight so I could go to a friend's birthday do a couple of weeks ago, sister called me an irresponsible and reckless parent. The latter was what broke the camel's back, and I snapped at her, telling her since she has an aversion to children she can't comment on my parenting. (Edit: just wanna say this is not by any means a comprehensive list but I'm conscious of character limit, so pulled a few examples. Can go more in depth with this in comments if you like). 

She got pretty outraged at that and told me that I'm being disrespectful and that, just because she doesn't have kids, doesn't mean she's an idiot and doesn't know basic things. She ended up in tears because she felt like I was insulting her intelligence. That wasn't my intention, of course, I'm just fed up with her simultaneously hating my child and also trying to tell me how to raise her.

1854,No A-holes here,"In February she developed seizures they were bad 11-15 a day she would fall down and even piss herself and I would have to watch her and change her. We have 3 kids with another that's been staying with us because of their parents issues. I work 40 hours a week and now more now that she's unable to work. Everyday is a pity party for her and she refused to let me get a walker for her but I did anyway she barely used it until she had to take a ER trip, after that she used it more often but not a lot. Then when it got to the point where she had a hard time walking after the seizures I wanted to get her a wheel chair and she refused. Another ER trip after falling and smashing her head on tile and were sitting in the room she's unconscious.

1855,No A-holes here,"Basically, my house is messy. Not quite on the level of something you'd see on, say, Hoarders (we don't have rats or anything like that) but there's stuff all over the place and more often than not you have to walk over things in most rooms. My mom is really upset about this because no one can really come over and we can't do much of anything due to all the clutter, which I understand.

The problem is my dad, really...I'm not exaggerating when I say that he's solely responsible for at least 90% of the mess in the house. He leaves stuff EVERYWHERE and doesn't pick up after himself very much, and he also constantly brings in stuff that people throw out (he got a wardrobe thing years ago and still hasn't put it together). The only mess I'm really responsible for is my own room, and even then...multiple times now I've come home from college to find random clothes all over my bed. The same applies to my brother and his room. My mom's super organized by nature, so she's not to blame, either.

My parents want me to help clean the house, which is *fine,* if not for the fact that I've done it a bunch of times already. I can't count the number of times we've spent 3-4 hours cleaning the kitchen only for it to be a mess again within a day (my dad does most of the cooking). My dad actually wants to help get the house clean too (he knows most of the mess is his fault), but his method of cleaning is to just pick up part of a mess and put it somewhere else, making more mess. It doesn't work.

We've lived here since 2006, and the house hasn't been truly clean for at least 10 years. I've told my mom that there's absolutely no way the house will get clean again unless we hire a team to do it, because we need to get stuff OUT of the house instead of just moving it like we always do. You'd think this would be a no-brainer but she refuses to listen to me. We aren't poor, so it isn't even a cost issue; I think she just thinks we should do it ourselves, but she doesn't want to admit that none of us want to spend weeks and weeks going through everything. If we truly wanted to clean the house ourselves, why isn't it clean after all this time?

What all of this basically comes down to is that I just don't care anymore. I'm in college now and spend about 75% of the year in another state, so at this point I feel like it's not my problem and I have bigger issues to worry about. I've helped clean the house and it just gets messy again, and I've suggested a way to get it done easily and have been ignored. I don't want to waste my time cleaning messes that I didn't even make, I just feel like there's no point. It's gotten to the point where I don't even want to live here anymore, I'm tired of hearing about how messy the house is when I've given a solution on how to handle it and was shut down...unfortunately, though, I don't have the means to get my own apartment, at least not yet.

Anyway, AITA for not wanting to help clean the house?",36,37,0.84
1856,Asshole,"My 39 year old husband dresses like a child. For work, he wears a button up shirt, jeans or Dockers, multi-colored sneakers and a belt with a large buckle of an animal. On weekends, he wears a t-shirt with some sort of comic/cartoon logo/character, a comic book character logo hat, jeans, multi-colored sneakers, a belt with a large buckle of a comic book character and his comic book character logo baseball hat. The only people who ever compliment his clothes are teens.

&#x200B;

He claims that other people at his work dress the same way, and they do ... but they don't wear huge belt buckles with animals on them and their shoes are more muted - all black sneakers, for example.

&#x200B;

I've tried all the hints - buying him nice clothes, shoes ... they all get returned or stuffed in the closet. I confronted him and said I would find him much more attractive if he dressed more his age, he laughed me off and said that when we met, he dressed the same so why should he change now, his is who he is.

&#x200B;

But when we met, we were 28. And he did NOT wear these clothes as often as he does now because even then he knew that girls aren't exactly attracted to a guy wearing comic book character shirts. I think it's a combo of the popularity of the Marvel movies and now him having a wife that has basically given him license to feel like he can wear whatever the fuck he wants. It's really the combination of it all together - clown shoes, comic book shirt, comic book belt buckle and hat that are just so stupid looking, I can't stand it. HE'S GONNA BE 40 FFS.

&#x200B;

I've told him this and he just shrugs. 

&#x200B;

A month ago, we went to a party and all the guys were dressed so nicely and simply ... and then there's my husband in his Deadpool hat, shorts, clown shoes, Batman belt and Green Lantern hat. Even his mates were poking fun at his outfit. 

&#x200B;

So I took a bunch of his shirts, packed them away and hid them. He has SO many shirts (he's a shopper and sucks at doing the laundry, but that's a separate issue) that I knew he wouldn't notice for awhile. He started dressing nicer - he assumed his comic book shirts were dirty so he started wearing plain t-shirts and polos that he usually never touches. He looked so nice and handsome, like how he did when we started dating. I love it. Shower him with affection because he looks SO MUCH BETTER. Tell him how nice he looks.

&#x200B;

Well, a month later, he found the box of shirts. He's now pissed at me. I told him it was for his own good, but he's not having any of it. He left for work mad at me but I really don't think I did anything wrong. It's not like I threw them away or donated them or something. Tonight will be interesting.

&#x200B;

Anyway ... am I the asshole?

&#x200B;

tl;dr - husband likes his comic book character shirts, i hate them. Talking about it didn't work. Giving him nicer clothes didn't work. I hid his shirts, he dressed better for awhile but then found out and is pissed.",576,610,0.9
1857,Not the A-hole,"Hi folks. 

&#x200B;

My upstairs neighbors (we live in a shared unit) have been getting a number of packages lately. 

&#x200B;

We live in the city, so boxes typically won't be left by the mailman to prevent theft. 

I live in the downstairs unit, and work from home - so I'm usually around when the mail arrives. 

A few times a week, my neighbors have packages delivered - they either aren't home - or don't bother to *come downstairs themselves* and get *their* mail when the mailman rings the doorbell. 

I used to drop everything and would help 'em out and (sometimes during the middle of my meetings) go get their packages and bring them inside. 

I think they've gotten used to this, and now assume I will always do this whenever something arrives at our shared gate. 

&#x200B;

If the package is left at the gate I'll carry it in - but AITA for now refusing to answer the door when the mailman arrives, unless they specifically ask me / give me a heads up about a package they are anticipating? Would it be petty to tell them? 

I don't think it's my responsibility to throw on clothes if I'm hanging out naked / get off the toilet if I'm having a peaceful shit / stop everything I'm doing for work to deal with this.

1858,Not the A-hole,"Long story short, my sister got married a few years ago and I did not get a plus one to her wedding, despite being in the wedding party and everyone else getting a plus one.  

I specifically did not get a plus one because she thought my date would cause me to be the center of attention and not her. Why? I'm a lesbian and had only come out recently (a few months after she got engaged). If I brought a date, it would have been a woman. 

Specifically...the woman I am going to marry now. 

On top of not getting a plus on to her wedding, my sister also insisted I must wear a dress/makeup/shave my legs at her wedding (I don't exactly own or look good in dresses - short hair, hairy legs, etc). Despite my misgivings, I compiled and felt embarrassed and shoved into the closet all day at her wedding. 

It was awful, but I was prepared to forgive her until my relationship with my SO started getting extra serious and she blurted out from nowhere one day ""Don't make me wear a suit in your wedding"". 

I was absolutely floored. She totally understood how badly she made me feel and it feels like she does not respect my relationship.

1859,Not enough info,"So, long story short:

I got pregnant and then found out I was the other woman, they broke up, we (ex-wife and I) became best friends, she started dating someone new that was also a friend of mine at the time, and they moved away with my daughter's sister. 

Well, I firmly believe, because of my own past, that my daughter should not be deprived of a relationship with her siblings. So I encouraged, as much I as I could in my own single motherhood, no money position, to make it happen. As soon as she was old enough to fly by herself, I sent my daughter out to see her sister every summer for a month or so, even if I went without. I even sent her with a few hundred dollars for this time because she eats like a horse and I know they aren't exactly rich. 

Well, love of my life walks in, we build a life together, and end up moving close to them for work reasons. Pleasant surprise for everyone involved. 

Who they were when I physically saw them last, is not who they are now, and I have recently discovered that when I sent my daughter out to see them, I was subjecting her to squalid living conditions with meth addicts. It's subtle, nothing they can't hide from a surprise CPS visit. I see her bf grooming my daughter's sister, who is now 14 years old. Nothing illegal has happened (yet) so nobody with any authority can do anything. Believe me, I've tried. I've called every law enforcement agency I can find and they can't do jack shit.

 My daughter and her sister, They love each other, and are best friends, even with so many years between them. I can't end this relationship, can I???

I talked to Mom about it, she says she sees it too, and has been told by other people, but refuses to leave. 

I have sent them money whenever they needed it, supplied gifts and school clothes for my daughter's sister for years, even when I could barely pay my own bills, but I can't anymore. For a while I felt like I should keep minimal contact because I understood being in a situation who feel like you can't leave, but I would rather live on the street than subject my own child to this, and I feel that by continuing to provide support and contact, my own child is in danger. I've offered to take her myself, even just for the summer, but mom refuses.

1860,Not the A-hole,"I have been married to my wife for five of the seven years that we have been together. I have two stepdaughters, an 18 yo and a 13 yo.  

The four of us will be embarking on a 10 day Caribbean cruise which is a partial graduation present for my oldest stepdaughter. We are also going with my  in-laws and the oldest stepdaughter’s 16 yo best friend.

Now that the cruise is right around the corner, my stepdaughter’s best friend has gotten terrible anxiety about getting on a plane and leaving home for 10 days. Her mother asked that we see if someone else can go in her place. 

The cruise company will not refund our money for the girl, but they will allow someone else to take her place. When my wife gets home from work, she comes in to tell me that she has decided that my stepdaughter’s 16 yo boyfriend is coming along with us to replace the best friend. My wife called and talked to her mother and then called the boyfriend’s mom, and they’re all cool with allowing him to go with us for the 10 day cruise. 

I immediately told my wife that I did not like this idea at all. My stepdaughter might be 18, but to me, the boyfriend is still a kid. It feels really sleazy to take a 16 yo out for 10 days on what will basically become their own romantic getaway. 

After a few minutes, it also occurred to me that my wife never bothered to consult me about this decision. My wife consulted others, but she left me out of any of the decision making process.  I went off by voicing my frustration with the decision and how I’m left out of everything because as a parent, I tend to be conservative and won’t just cut loose and be the fun parent. My wife does what she wants and makes these plans that I end up having no say over other than having to pay for most of the expenses.

My wife thinks that the boyfriend is the only logical choice and that we are going to lose money if we don’t replace the best friend’s spot on the cruise. My stepdaughter has other friends, but they’re fair-weather friends and she doesn’t  want to spend 10 days on vacation with any of them. I’ve even opted for bringing one of the 13 yo’s friends, but my wife feels like this would diminish her daughter’s graduation present when she promised her that she could bring a friend. The bring a friend option was also not my choice, but I thought it was harmless at the time.

So AITA for being upset and voicing my frustration and opposition to bringing this boy with us on our trip?  I’m not naive; I know they have a sexual relationship. I just feel that’s a bit different than a 10 day cruise. I would also feel differently if the boy were also 18 and not just now becoming a junior in high school.

A craftsman has been scheduled to change our water counters tomorrow for about a week and a half now. This evening my girlfriend came home from drinks with a friend and told me that she has this meeting at work tomorrow that she wants to attend and asked me to take over the appointment with the craftsman so she would have time to care for her horse and then later to go to this meeting. I said that I can not just call my work tomorrow morning to cancel all my appointments just for her to go to her meeting at her job. This led to an argument during which I said that I will always(at least with the current setup) prioritize my appointments at work over hers as I am the one with a full time job and thus the one who is earning the money for our appartement and most of everything else. She said that this is the most hurtful thing I ever said as I (nor anyone else) do not have the right to judge someones importance on specific things like work or hobbies. 

Now for clarification: I do value her job and I know how important her job is to her. Her job makes her happy and helps her raise her confidence and I understand why she wants to attend these meetings. But I see the whole thing from the impact on our life together.

1862,Asshole,"Daughter is 18 and a senior in high school.  Last week was Senior Week.  Friday was Senior Skip Day.  She asked me to call her out.  I said no; she is an adult and if she wants to skip school, she can face the consequences for it.  I asked her what would happen.  She said just detention.  I asked her if she could still exempt all her finals.  She said yes (with an eye roll) and stomped off.

Friday came and she was home.  I have her the choice to be driven to school by me.  She declined.  I again reminded her about finals and she once again stomped off.

I got a message from her today.  Not only does she get a detention, she can't exempt any finals.  (School policy is seniors can exempt all finals during third trimester of they have a B average and have no unexcused absences.)  She begged me to ""clear it.""  I don't want to.  I told her I wouldn't right at the beginning.  My husband thinks I should.  I really don't want to hurt her, but there has to be some sort of logical consequence.  

So, Reddit, I implore you, WIBTA if I didn't retroactively excuse my daughter from Senior Skip Day?  (Which was last Friday.)

EDIT:  I have until Friday to excuse her.  She didn't call herself out because our school requires the kids to get a form from the office for a parent to sign giving them permission.  Weird, but not my rule.  She's in a lot of art classes and I'm not sure what her final would entail.

EDIT 2:  She's been accepted to college and has enough credits to graduate.  Her finals aren't exams.  (I asked a little bit ago.)  They're huge projects that she hasn't worked on at all.  She has five classes and there is no way she can get them done on time.  I'll excuse her tomorrow.

EDIT 3:  Insomnia ramblings.  We allow mental health days from school.  She's a good kid at school, but a different kid at home altogether.  However, the sum total makes her a good kid.  From our conversation last night, it sounds like she knew ahead of time she wasn't going to be able to exempt because she had an unexcused absence.

1863,Not the A-hole,"So this happened a couple of hours ago and my friend is still mad at me.

My friend (female) and I (male) were talking during lunch and she decided to browse tinder to see what she would find. After a couple of minutes I eventually asked to see her profile just out of curiosity. She had 6 pictures. The problem was with her first picture on her profile. This was a picture of her and her friend with her friend being closer to the camera and my friend basically being in the background.

I have been on the internet long enough to know that when you are making a dating profile, either have a picture of only you as the first picture or clarify which person you are in the picture on your bio. This causes less confusion for the person looking at your profile. When bringing this up to her I said ""you should maybe switch the first picture with one of the other pictures."" She instantly snapped back talking about how I don't know how dating apps work and that I dont know more about relationships than her. She then stood up and walked away. I was just still a little dumbfounded because of what unfolded and it took me a second to register what she had said

1) I have never been in a relationship. This is because of a mental condition that causes me to not trust anything related to romance (relationships, romantic gestures, flirting, flirty comments, etc.) She knows this as I told her a while ago when she asked why I never dated. But what does being in a relationship have to do with creating a tinder profile? 2) I am probably not more knowledgable when it comes to how dating apps work but I know one this which is that the first picture matters a lot when someone is browsing.

Please tell me if I am wrong at all about anything I said in my post.

Edit: some people have been asking me if she asked for my opinion. She openly showed me her tinder along with the photos and the bio. After she showed me the photos she asked how the photos looked. I said they looked good and then later followed it up with the statement ""you should maybe switch the first picture with one of the other pictures.""",63,99,0.89
1864,Not the A-hole,"I graduated high school last week. Our plan was to have a party this weekend in conjunction with memorial day since a lot of people could have the time off.  

My parents have a history of pranking me on special occasions an I begged them to please just let me have this party as a sort of symbol that I'm not a ""little girl"" anymore and I can have an event that doesn't end in me being embarrassed. They agreed.  

I also have to say that I despise whipped frosting on cakes. Like I mean I hate it. If there's whipped frosting, I simply won't eat it. If its going to be ""my"" cake, id rather go without than have a cake with whipped frosting. I could go into great lengths into why I hate but it would probably make me sound more psycho than I am, just know I hate it. I made my mom promise that IF she got me a cake it would have legit buttercream frosting or please just don't buy one. She said she knew me well enough to know that. 

So we had the party yesterday at a hotel with an awesome pool and waterslide. When it came time for the cake my parents made all my friends gather around and they did the ""she's a jolly good fellow"" song and at the end my mom stuck her finger in the frosting and wiped it all across my face and lips and it was whipped frosting. I about barfed and said very funny where was the real cake. My dad looked at me and said something like ""you're lucky that this is the only prank we are going to play on you!"" 

I lost my shit. I hate to admit this but I embarrassed myself in front of my friends and family. It was just so embarrassing to have my mom wipe cake on my face like I'm a toddler, and then to play a prank like they promised they wouldn't and to then make it prank with one of the things I literally hate the most in the world. I just hated it. I cried and went into the hotel room they got and just wanted to be by myself for 10 minutes. I was fine after but my mom and dad kept making fun of me for the rest of the night until I was just so freaking relieved that the party was coming to an end.

Throwaway account and some details changed for anonymity purposes.

I work for a non-profit organization and we recently got assigned to plan a project and distribute funds to help local schools. There were 5 local schools that were selected by a single co-worker (who volunteered for the task, and is hispanic) and I noticed that every school she picked was almost 100% Hispanic. 

I changed two of the low income schools (I randomly selected which ones I would change) to one that was largely African-American and another school that for the most part had an equal distribution of ethnicities. The list was submitted and co-worker noticed during a team meeting that two schools were changed. I told her I did it and explained that I wanted to add some diversity to the schools we are helping. My supervisor and two coworkers present at the meeting had no problem with it, but my coworker was clearly annoyed about it and brought it up to me privately, asking me why I didn’t talk to her first. She also brought it up to others evidently because another coworker came up to me and asked me about it. I didn’t think it was necessary to bring it up to her privately because I honestly didn’t think she would mind and it seemed like the equitable thing to do. Now I feel awkward and I get the feeling she thinks my intentions may have been racist. 

For the record she is hispanic, and I am mixed race African-American/German We are both women.

1866,Asshole,"My (26F) oldest friend (27F) and I have known each other since we were middle schoolers, so it’s been about 14 years of friendship. When we first met we were basically the same person in two bodies. We had all the same interests, did pretty much everything together, and practically lived at each other’s houses. I moved to a neighbouring town in high school and made new friends, but we still stayed close. 

As you do in college, I developed new interests in my late teens/early 20s. We no longer have that much in common—for example, she’s into anime, cosplay, video games, etc and I’m not all—and while we’ve drifted a little we still talk frequently and tend to go on a trip or two together, sometimes including other people as well, every year. As we’ve gotten older, I’ve found myself more and more...embarrassed, I suppose, when I hang out with her. She’s still fundamentally the same person, but I find some of her fashion and makeup choices a little cringeworthy, and sometimes feel a little bit of secondhand embarrassment when she talks to my other friends or when we’re making small talk with strangers on trips. 

I know this sounds pretty vague, so here’s a concrete example. In airports, I’ll wear a pretty basic athleisure outfit to stay comfortable but look like I made a basic effort with my appearance while out in public. Think sneakers, leggings, a t shirt and jacket, etc. Nothing fancy, basically. She’ll wear a backpack shaped like a giant pokeball, have her hair in a sort of lopsided spiky anime-inspired style, and usually be wearing some sort of slutty French maid outfit or something else inspired by loli fashion. It draws a lot of attention. She’s mentioned in the past that her mother hates her outfits and will ask her to wear normal things on vacation. 

WIBTA if I also asked her to dress a little more normally when we go on trips together? 

Tbh, I feel like I am and should just support my oldest friend no matter what, but I can’t help feeling a little embarrassed for her whenever she goes out dressed as she is.",63,150,0.94

My neighbor drives a pickup truck. Its a huge Ford Raptor thats like twice the size of my shitty sedan. And, he likes to get a little rambunctious while driving. 

At least twice a month, he will run over and destroy my mailbox. [He even destroyed my bush](https://imgur.com/gallery/B6vGTw9) last weekend. Ive tried talking to him, asking him to replace my mailboxes (which he declines) and ive even installed a camera on my porch to prove its him.

For this part, I should mention that I work in a machine shop. We use huge rods of metal everyday for various tasks. I have contacted my boss, and he gave me to ok to take some cold rolled steel from work and weld myself a solid metal mailbox. 

My plan is to make it so my mailbox is virtually impenetrable to a truck, and instead of his truck destorying my mailbox, my mailbox would destory his truck.

1869,Asshole,"I was grabbing some lunch at a drive-thru restaurant; the change I was due after handing them a $10 was $3.08. The woman at the window opened the window for a very brief moment, hurriedly handed me three dollar bills (and no coins), and disappeared. With her hurriedness, I assumed that she was going back in to grab my coins, and would be back momentarily.

When she popped her head out about half a minute later, though, I saw this was not the case. In a snippy tone, she told me I need to pull out of the drive-thru, since there are others behind me. I told her that I’m still waiting on my eight cents. She gave me a puzzled look and swore she gave me my eight cents along with the $3. I know this was not the case; I specifically remember being handed only three dollar bills and no coins.

She asked me if I was calling her a liar, and I insisted I wasn’t, stating that mistakes happen. She argued and argued. I do **not** think she was deliberately trying to scam me (8 cents would be a pitifully low amount to scam someone); rather, I think she’s one of those egotistical people who thinks she’s always right and never wants to admit defeat, no matter how small or insignificant. I asked to speak with her manager, and she said he’s not in at the moment.

I turned off my engine, folded my arms crossly and petulantly, and lay back in my seat. I told her that I am staying right here until I get my eight cents. There was a long line of cars behind me, so you would think this would be a motivator to her, but nope, she still refused. She’d intermittently poke her head out of the window and argue with me, then disappear back in. The guy behind me figured out what was going on, and started honking at me. But I just continued to sit with my arms folded, laying back, waiting calmly for my eight cents.

According to my car clock, I sat blocking the drive-thru exit for a good **six minutes**. I spent an additional minute before that debating with the lady about my eight cents. **Finally**, at the end of that seven minute window, the woman furiously conceded and handed me the eight cents. I flashed her a smug grin, and told her that the moment I get done eating my lunch I’m calling up her manager. “Eight meager cents...what a stupid thing to screw up your job for,” I said, and then pulled out.

1870,Not the A-hole,"Just to be clear, this post isn’t about whether I’m an asshole for disliking children, it is about whether I’m an asshole for refusing to try therapy. 

From the start I made it clear to my fiancé I did not want children. I have made this clear with every person I have dated. He did not have any issues with it whatsoever and said he liked pros of a child free life. 

Our relationship was going great, and last week (a couple months before our wedding) he announced he would actually love to have children. He said he realized this from having our dog (who I admit we spoil like a child). This shocked and to be honest devastated me because much my perception of him was very much based on someone who shared my desire to have a child free life, which is extremely important to me. 

I told him despite the fact I loved our dog, dogs are VERY different from children. He insisted that because I treated our dog so well I would be a great mother. He then asked that I try therapy to fix my “child hating” problem. He believed that my traumatic childhood has caused me to hate children because wanting children is a natural desire. I will not deny that this might be the truth, but I have no desire to fix my issue. 

My best friend said I’m being selfish because therapy cant hurt and I probably do have a lot of unresolved childhood issues (abandonment from parents, etc). A part of me is considering it but deep inside I really don’t want to. AITA?",1357,3934,0.93

She then tells me about a game she use to play with her friends. They named it ""Butterfly Fight"". She then describes the game like... There will be 2 players holding a butterfly (found from anywhere) & then they'll make them fight with each other ( like both player will hold the butterfly bringing them close to each other so the butterflies will eventually fight).

I was ok until then... But she then tells that the player who won will free her butterfly... And the one who loses has to kill her butterfly.

I didn't liked the idea of killing those beautiful butterflies just for the sake of fun. 
So I immediately instructed her to stop playing this game. And also did the same to her friends.

1873,Asshole,"This might be a bit long but thanks for reading. 

I’ve been a single mom to two kids since they were 6 and 4 - their dad passed away. Around that time, my son was formally diagnosed as autistic. He’s not very verbal and prone to physical outbursts when he has a meltdown. He’s been in therapies of every kind for his entire life and it’s helped somewhat.

Their dad had a life insurance policy which allowed me to stay home as my son’s main caregiver while working freelance, but money was tight and finding anyone capable of watching him has always been a challenge. 

My daughter was graduating from college last year. A week before the ceremony, she had an awards ceremony for academic achievement. I was obviously incredibly proud of her. She asked me to come to it and I said I would. 

Her college is two hours from here. I hired a trained sitter who specializes in autism the day of the ceremony. Right as I was about to leave, my son had a meltdown and was lashing out at the sitter. I couldn’t leave, and he wasn’t calm for hours. I’d left my daughter a voicemail saying I wasn’t going to be able to make it. 

She called back that night absolutely livid. She called me a shitty mother, said I had two kids but only cared about one, that I’d missed every game and performance she’d had as a child and it clearly wasn’t going to change as adults and that she was just done. She said she knows he can’t help it, but her brother is incapable of showing empathy and it made it hard to be around him without resenting him. She hung up and that was it. I’ve barely spoken with her since. She didn’t send tickets for the graduation we were supposed to go to the next week. She hasn’t shown up for holidays and I’ve heard she’s engaged but didn’t call to tell me. She’s cut us out, and in the one of three times we’ve spoken since she said it’s easier for her to not have us around than be disappointed and that being alone at events is nothing new for her, she just doesn’t have to bother getting her hopes up I might come now. 

AITA - I’ve offered family counselling and all other manner of things. I know I wasn’t a perfect mom growing up - I didn’t make it to her things, but not for lack of caring. I’m heartbroken but I don’t think me not showing up in an emergency should have lost me my daughter forever.",1868,24171,0.91
1874,Asshole,"So I’m 15 and my sister is 17 years old. We go to the same school, but usually she takes the bus 10 min earlier than me because I like to cut it a little closer in the morning. The bus stop is about a one minute walk from our house, basically just around one street corner. The street corner itself isn’t an actual corner but a used car sales yard. Since this month, the owner has hired a bunch of guys. To be honest I’m not sure what they’re even doing, I once saw them power wash the yard and the cars, but usually when I’m passing by they seem to be goofing off and generally behaving like overgrown teenagers (like punching each other and making fart sounds and stuff) (yes I know I’m saying this as a teenager myself).


Then a few hours ago, my sister suddenly asked me to take the earlier bus with her from now on. For a moment I thought she was concerned about me being late for class, but turns out the point was that she wanted us to walk to the bus stop together. When I asked her why she told me that the guys at the car yard keep yelling sexual stuff at her every time she walks by. I started to laugh because I thought she was joking. Next thing I know she bursts into tears and starts crying her eyes out. That really shocked me, of course didn’t want to make her cry and promised her I’d be walking to the bus stop with her.


However I can’t help but feel like she’s being weird and a bit of a drama queen. I feel like she can’t be serious about this, I mean we’re going to the same school and we both know lots of guys whos idea of a good joke it is to yell TITS at the top of their lungs in class. She sometimes even joined us when I’m having friends over and we’re playing xbox, which aren’t exactly occasions of politeness and church like language.

My sister has always been a “one of the guys” type of girl, and never a “princess” type who has a meltdown if someone calls her an unladylike name.

1875,Everyone Sucks,"My hubby has Reddit, so I’m using a throwaway account. Some background: we are both 27 (M/F), and we’ve been married for two years. My relationship with my in-laws is kind of complicated. I love them, but they are very opinionated people, and they’ve been known to make little comments on my weight, clothing, etc. They live three houses down, so they are around all the damn time. My husband also tends to overshare with them. 

Last week, he told them about a sexual issue we’re having. I know this because my mother in law approached and started telling me that she thinks the problem is due to my weight, and that sex would be better if I wasn’t “a bigger girl” (her words). 

At the time, I just thanked her for the advice, but I was LIVID. My husband shouldn’t share these things with his parents, and I can’t help but wonder if he complained about my weight to them. 

This is where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, the in laws came over for a barbecue. MIL and I were getting the table ready, and I “casually” brought up the sex issue again. I managed to work in that my hubby has a very specific fetish that some people would find gross (true, btw). MIL seemed shocked, but I knew she would bring it up with my husband, and I wanted him to know what it felt like to be humiliated. 

As expected, she asked him about it, and now he’s really mad at me. He’s actually threatening to leave and go stay with a buddy. I think he lost all right to be mad when he shared our personal business with his parents and insulted my body to them. But...AITA?

1882,Asshole,"My daughter has been complaining extensively about her history and philosophy classes because they are not ""relevant to real life."" She has complained about having to write an extensive amount of papers this last month but I believe that is just what you get when you take lots of humanities classes. I think she just needs to straighten up and fly right, and accept that we all do things we do not like. 

Moreover, she only has 3 more days of class left, but says that she wants to skip one day or two for no good reason. She has had perfect attendance this semester, but I have a feeling that her attendance would have been worse if I did not make her go to school. 

Her reasoning is that no one would care all that much if she just missed one day of school, but I think that if I were to let her skip a day, that it would just create bad habits, like ""oh well if I don't feel like it I don't have to do it."" I feel like it would hurt her in the workplace.

My daughter told me that she feels apathetic to school for a reason: the reason being that she feels too much pressure from us, her similarly academic competitive friends, and society, to get good grades, so school has felt like more about getting A's rather than learning/finding your passions. 

However, I don't believe that I have to listen to or understand her reasoning. You have to go to school; you have to do the assignments, and you have to get good grades. That's just life. There's no more to it. It's her job, not mine, to help her cope with those stresses. 

I frankly think she is spoiled and entitled, thanks to my SO and I's hard work, which has provided her with a comfortable middle-class existence. If we were poor, she'd be clamoring to get an education because that's the only way out. I feel resentful that she is able to freeload off of us, her parents, and has the luxury of being able to ""dislike school.""

In response to everything she told me, I told her to stop complaining and just do the work. I questioned whether she's ever thought of a solid career plan and whether she has the skills to get there. I told her, conclusively, that no one in this world owes her anything, not even us as her parents. I am really concerned about and cannot understand my daughter's apathy to school and her future. She gets...okay grades, sometimes, but I don't think she knows what she wants to do, nor does she have any marketable skills. She has had jobs before, and her supervisors liked her, but those weren't very prestigious or high paying ones.

This obviously leads to a huge problem with boosting, which is paying higher ranked players to play on your account so it gets a higher rating and you get better rewards. This is a problem because now the bad players back on their own accounts have to play with players much better than them and they end up performing badly essentially ruining the game of whichever team they run into.


Now for the moral dilemma. Yesterday I messaged a friend of mine and got a reply with a message similar to something that goes like this: ""haha you cancer autistic diamond 3 (a rank) random"" This being very out of the blue and not like the friend at all I noticed someone else was playing on her account. He got extremely agressive towards me and berating me for my rank for no obvious reason (a common problem in League's ranked environment). He then started bragging about how he is boosting that account, so now it was obvious it wasn't the same person on the account of which I only know the owner. Fast forward 20 minutes of the booster repeatedly calling me a ""cancer autist nigger"" and I took screenshots of the chat and blocked the account.

Being so toxic, account sharing and boosting are all extremely bannable offenses so friend or not, I did not want het to ruin other people's ranked games and decided to send a report ticket to the company of the game with screenshots of the insults and admitted boosting/account sharing.

A coworker recently asked me to switch contracts at our job. Her contract is 11 months and mine is 11.5m. There is quite a pay difference between our contracts (at base level, difference is $3k but increases depending on years of experience). Obviously she has quite a few years of experience under her belt (I believe 10-15ish years) whereas I only have 1 since I just started out of college last year. 

She emailed me asking if we can switch contracts, without an explanation of course. 

I responded back (I’m summarizing, obviously responded in a polite way) that I’m not interested in switching because I enjoy being busy with my contract (11.5 months means I’m busy throughout the year basically - minus 2 weeks). 

She then proceeded to call me basically begging to take my contract since she’s retiring soon (4ish years) and that the 11.5m salary (plus her years of experience) will make a huge change in her retirement fund. 

I honestly didn’t want to budge because at that point I felt like she was trying to guilt trip me by saying she needs more money for retirement. So I stuck to my guns and said no because the 11.5m salary allows for me to live comfortably - pay my bills and still have leftover for savings/misc. expenses. 

So AITA for saying no to someone who just wants more money for retirement? The more I think about it... I’m not retiring anytime soon (I’m only 22 so I’m a ways away from that) so maybe I should’ve switched contracts since she’s retiring soon anyway. Thoughts?",30,25,0.83
1886,Not the A-hole,"So in the last month my brother got engaged to his girlfriend and asked me to be the best man.  I am the closest to him compared to my other brother and sister. Now I would have no problem being the best man if I really believed they would be a good match but I am just not sold on her. This is his first girlfriend he's ever brought home.

They live together on the other side of the country (Delaware), but are both from the same hometown. When they come back to visit the area, they only visit her family and only spend time with our side of the family when they need a place to stay. 

They've been dating for a year and live together and his fiance hasn't made any effort to get to know me or my girlfriend. His fiance, my gf, and I are really close in age (early 20's) compared to my brother (early 30's). I can confidently say she's only spoken 200 words to us in the 10+ occasions we've been in the same setting. Me and my gf both agree that she's probably only in it because my brother makes really good money (6 figures). They go out to eat almost every night and I've just learned that he's had to borrow money from my parents (who make about half of what he does).  I have actually had to lend money to my parents for groceries and utilities on about 3 occasions since they've started dating. My parents won't say no when he asks for money, and I know they would do the same for me if I ever asked. I haven't spent 10k on plane tickets flying back home in the last year so I guess that's probably why I haven't asked. 

From my interactions with my future sister-in-law, she needs to have the newest purses, biggest engagement ring, vacations, and quite frankly just not grounded in reality. I can't even imagine how much the wedding ceremony will cost. 

He essentially told me that I'm going to be the best man. I am not the type of person to stand up and give a speech but that wouldn't be a problem if I truly believed they were in love.

1888,No A-holes here,"I (22F) come from a very different background than my best friend (21F). I come from a working-class, Arab household. (I am second gen, my parents were both born here, and my family is mostly non-religious if that matters). She is a white American from a middle-class household.

In my culture, and I assume in most non-white Western cultures, it's pretty standard to take care of you parents and grandparents as they age. Because of this, all three of my grandparents lived with us in their final years and I had to watch them die. They were all really sick (two cancer, one heart disease) and died slow deaths. It was very traumatizing for me. Now, my last grandfather is sick and since my mom is his oldest child and I am the oldest grandchild, we have to take care of him. It has been very difficult for me to watch him deteriorate and I am struggling with being around him. It has sent me into a very deep depression.

I tried to express my issues to my friend and she responded by saying that it was not my responsibility to take care of him and that her parents both said that she should put them in a home when they become to old or ill to take care of themselves. She said that it was not fair that I have to deal with this. She was generally trying to be supportive by telling me that this is not a burden I should have. I tried to explain to her that she does not understand my position and because of my culture/my family's financial status, I cannot just walk away from the situation. She kept arguing that it isn't my responsibility, and I told her that she is privileged by not having these financial and cultural obligations and that she doesn't understand my situation.

She ended up becoming very defensive and we got into an argument about it. She said that she didn't know what I wanted her to say. I really was just looking for support/validation on my fear of aging, dying, etc. I wasn't looking to get my culture of family obligations picked apart. I now feel like an asshole because I know she was just trying to help, but she really doesn't understand my situation, nor is she trying to. AITA?",20,31,0.91

Recently however it's come to my attention that my sister's BF, doesn't like to hang out with us and the only time he does come around is when he's with his friends and family. He never said anything to us directly and it's all hearsay coming his buddies. The only thing he did say to us that he doesn't like it when we joke about him so we stopped.

Anyway he posts things like ""I love this beautiful girl"" and ""she's the light of my world"" and stuff like that. I usually comment with ""if you say so"" or ""have you actually seen her"" and my sister will usually have some snarky remark and we go back and forth.

Last time I did this I got some notes and when to go check them and he blocked me. I messaged my sister and she said she wasn't sure what was going on just he made a comment about me needing to grow up.

It was at an event booth that posted the pictures to a Facebook album and encouraged people to tag themselves and share. We really liked how the picture turned out. It was a great family photo, and I wanted to zoom in on us before posting it to my own page. The only issue was that cropping the image would remove the watermark. Wanting to be sure that the photographer was properly credited, I asked her if she could re-edit the image so the watermark would still he visible when I cropped it. If this was too big of a deal I asked if I could remove the watermark completely and credit her in the image description, posting a link to her business page.

What I got back was an angry text about how she doesn't work for free, how she was paid very little to do the job in the first place, and that I failed to see her artistic vision if I felt I could crop it better than she could. All I wanted was to be sure that, if people liked the picture, they would know how to contact the photographer themselves.

My dad was in the military but passed away overseas due to an undiagnosed heart condition when I was a kid and so for a long time our vacations were a way to just try and forget our pain. 

She got remarried when I was 13. I’m 18 now. I’m doing a woodworking apprenticeship at my local college so I’m still living at home to try and save on costs, so I can move out and hopefully buy a place in the next few years. My stepdad is an okay guy. I don’t dislike him, but I’ve never seen eye to eye with him. As soon as I was 14 and got a part time job, he started taking rent money from me. He is respectful to me however and I am respectful to him especially since he’s allowing me to live at their home right now. I pay rent and buy my own food and stuff, but majority of my paycheck goes into a savings account. He’s very old school and basically pretends I don’t exist but he’s very very good to my mom and I don’t mind the status quo. 

Since my mom remarried, she had 3 more kids. They’re all very small and obviously she has to put in a lot of work with them. Every year she goes on vacation with her husband and kids and every year I’ve declined to go because it seems more stressful than not. I’m not into babies and I’m kind of a stranger to my mom. This year they’re going to Hawaii and it’s a really big deal for her. She’s told me that I WILL be going, and in the same breath told me that I’ll need to pay for my flights + accommodation but her and my stepdad will cover my food and drinks. 

I’ve been thinking it over but in my heart of hearts I really don’t want to go. I am not really connected to my mom or her family anymore and I would rather just continue to save my money.

To me at least, it feels like a deeply personal issue, and very clearly my own ‘problem’ (if you even want to call it that), and the reason I’m thinking of not telling them is because I really don’t know how they’ll react.

1894,Not the A-hole,"Edit-I really appreciate ALL the feedback; the ones saying I did the right thing and ones calling me a homophobic asshole. I took everyone’s advice and will use this as a learning experience. When I made the title I was not using my best judgement so I didn’t mean to come off as homophobic or bigoted. I will better select my wording in future posts. I deleted my profile and Joe made it home safe. We will not continue trying to be friends.  While I do not condone drunk driving and offered to pay for the Uber I realize I should have done a lot more to prevent someone from getting on the road. I let my anger get the better hold of my judgement. 

So to speed up the backstory I am in my mid/late 20s former army vet and working a good job. I work out a lot and try to enjoy the nightlife when I can. A lot of my good friends all either live in different states or got married and can’t do the same stuff we used to do. I also tend to be reclusive towards other people. Ive only lived in my area for a year now. 

My VA shrink dude said I should try to escape my comfort zone and attempt to make new friends (Remind me to fight him after this) so I decided to try bumble BFF mode after hearing about it on the radio (I used bumble before for trying to get hookup with local women. BFF mode is strictly for friendships) I got a few matches in the 10 minutes I played with it and met this dude who we will call Joe. 

Joe seemed pretty normal and after a few messages he told me he was gay. I told him I was not gay, but since we are just looking for friends I don’t see it being an issue. 

Joe does not like to go to bars or clubs or the gym and says he is more of a homebody. I was sorta pissed since I’m lookin for a wingman who will go to bars and work out in the gym, but I figured give Joe a chance. The few times we hung out he just had a few beers at my place while watching videos on my tv until we ran out of beer and he would drive home.

Joe keeps claiming to be able to out drink me (I was in the army and did 3 years in Korea) so Sunday he comes over and we are drinking while watching videos (which is honestly already boring me if I wanted to stay home I could be on Xbox and drink). He is on the recliner and I’m on the couch. He is just drinking beer and the occasional mimosa while I’m doing shots and mimosas. Eventually I made a comment about how I’m doing more shots and I’m handling my booze better than he can.

After more drinks Joe drops one of my mimosa glasses and it shatters and spills on my recliner. I am calm and say don’t worry about it, just pour more shots while I clean it up. After I clean up the mess Joe decides to sit next to me on the couch. Mind you I have other chairs in my place. He is a drunk mess and is talking up space on the couch. Joe keeps putting his head on my shoulder and his arm around me so I move his arm. He claims he didn’t mean anything about it. About 3 minutes later he puts his arm around me again so I almost instantly sober up and tell him to leave.

Joe is saying he is too drunk to drive and I’m over reacting. I say he can call an Uber and get his car tomorrow and I can even pay for it, or he can wait in his car until he is good. He kept apologizing and eventually left and drove straight home. 

Part of me feels I should have let him crash in the guest room instead of driving, but I don’t like being touched and I already made it apparent I didn’t want him touching me.

That is already a lot of people, and suddenly my ex called me up last night saying my daughter wants to come to see me graduate and that I should get 2 extra tickets.

1896,Not the A-hole,"I have a coworker Bill who supports his wife and 30 year old son.  Bill's a hard working guy who puts in 60+ hours a week.  Well lately Bill had some financial emergencies and basically drained his savings and is afraid that in a few months he won't be able to make his house payments. 

Bill's son Ned is my age.  We grew up together and were pretty close until a few years ago when he withdrew from a lot of his social circles.  We still talk and hang out occasionally, but nothing like we used to.  Ned hasn't had a job since he was 18 and has lived off an allowance from Bill in exchange for doing chores around the house since his mother is too physically ill to do much around the house anymore.  Bill has admitted to me that life would be so much easier if Ned would just get even a part time job to help out a bit with the bills, but Ned just refuses.

Well as Bill was telling me about his financial trouble I remembered Ned's rather large collection of Magic The Gathering cards.  We used to play a lot and a few months ago I remember going through his binder of his rarest and most valuable cards.  For example to those of you who know MTG he has a full playset of most of the original Alpha/Beta dual lands, a couple power nine cards, and a bunch of others.  His entire collection is easily worth over $100,000.  

I told Bill about this and he didn't believe me at first.  Thought I was just making a joke, but I sat him down and explained that with how well he's taken care of those cards over the years they are probably mostly in good condition and worth hundreds if not thousands for certain cards.  Bill just sorta sat there stunned for a minute before going back to his office.

Well he must have said something to Ned because I got a message on Facebook from Ned where he told me that I was a piece of shit for telling his dad about the cards and that he's now harassing him and threatening to kick him out if he doesn't either find a job or sell the cards.  I told him that he should probably get a job then and blocked him because I didn't want to be attacked anymore.

Part of me feels justified because Ned really should get a job and help Bill out, but then again was it none of my business?  Should I have just kept it to myself and not tried to help especially if it is going to cause turmoil in the family?  I'm really torn here.",1082,8092,0.96

Storytime: My boyfriend (37M) and I (29F) rented a cabin in the beautiful mountains in the northern part of our state for the holiday weekend. We live in a townhome community in Big City and wanted to get away with our two dogs. The very nosey neighbor ladies across the street (a mother/daughter pair who are both named Susan, I shit you not) caught us packing up my SUV on Friday, so they unfortunately knew our plans to be gone (but, importantly, not how long we’d be gone). We decided to come home a day early because it was just too damn hot to be hiking. We pull into our complex after 2.5 hrs of driving with 2 dogs that *really* need to pee. Lo and behold, our garage is blocked by two cars sitting side by side in our driveway! (The driveways are only one car length long, so this effectively blocked us from being able to get to our house). The house to the left of The Susans had two cars in their driveway as well, and since my bf was driving, I hopped out of the car to resolve the issue. I knocked on the door and the older lady who lives there opened it- she was obviously drunk, but I just asked if those were her cars in our driveway. She says “oh goodness!” Turns, and closes the door without another word. Frustrating, but I can hear her hollering for people to go move their cars, so whatever. Four college-aged kids come out of her house after another few minutes and slowly move the cars- first the two in the neighbor’s drive. Then one from our drive, then after 5 more minutes someone comes for the last car, takes their sweet ass time removing a car seat from the back, then finally moved the damn car. Meanwhile, the college kids were all making snide remarks about how rude we were for asking them to move their cars so we could get into our house! My bf went across the street once he was able to park, and asked what happened. She said “she’d been told we’d be gone for the weekend so she can park there if she wants!” My bf told the lady to not park on our property ever again because her kids were rude. I think we were totally within our rights to tell them not to ever do it again- especially since we would’ve let them park there in most circumstances if they had just asked us first, and our complex has plenty of guest parking. Bf is feeling like we were too harsh. So reddit, are we the assholes here?",66,244,0.89

I'm married and it's not a great situation in general, but we own our home outright & the bills are split like this: Him- house stuff for construction and maintenance purposes, electric, $100 a week for food, $50 a month for house insurance. Me: Cable($150/month) , garbage($33/month), car insurance($105/month) , food(minus the $$ he puts in), everything to do with the kids. I also don't work at the moment because I stay home with our daughter. I'm still expected to pay my portion of the bills because he is going to give me the $300 a week that we were paying for childcare. 

Ok so, the issue. Apparently our electric bill is in his grandfathers name. Husband owes about $1000 to the electric company so he asked me to put it in my name. I said no. The reason is, he has done this before. He will ask me to put something in my name, offer to give me the $$ to pay it, do it for a few months, then stop. 

I have been busting ass trying to fix my credit for the past year ish. I got it from 550 to 650 and was able to get a credit card, which I pay off every time I use it.

1906,Not the A-hole," 

My  husband was diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome at a very young age.  His birth mother was extremely young and gave him up for adoption. His  adopted parents noticed cognitive/behavioral issues from the time he was  a toddler and he was subsequently taken to multiple doctors. Once he  was diagnosed with FAS, his parents were told that he would not be able  to hold down a job, get married, or even live independently. They were  also told that he would not be able to empathize with others. His  parents are wonderful people and put an incredible amount of time/effort  in to make sure he had the best education and emotional support  possible. Fast forward to today – my husband has beaten the odds. He’s a  successful manager in his field, we have a nice house and we’ve been  married for years. He’s an intelligent, caring person and I’m extremely  fortunate to have married my best friend.

I  was raised by my mentally ill single mother. She was both verbally and  physically abusive. I spent a lot of my childhood fearing for my life,  and without a father or any siblings, I had no one to turn to. I would  spend a lot of time crying and trying to cope with my situation. I have  put a lot of effort into not becoming a rageaholic like my mother, so  when I feel overwhelmed or upset, I tend to cry rather than become angry  or raise my voice. This has repeatedly caused issues in my marriage. My  husband gets irritated/angry when I cry. At first, I tried to explain  that I wasn’t crying to upset him, but rather because it’s therapeutic  for me to cry sometimes, and it helps me not to bottle my feelings up.  This did not seem to help at all. I used to cry when we fought, but  after seeing how angry he became when I cried, I make a conscious effort  not to cry during fights. When we first got married, I was assuming my  husband would actually want to comfort me when I cried, which, I admit,  is what I became accustomed to in past relationships, particularly since  I comfort others when they’re upset. I’ve since given up on the idea  that he will comfort me, but I am in fact told to stop crying as soon as  I start. He says to stop crying, it’s not necessary, and that if it  doesn’t stop, one of us needs to leave the room. This is really hard for  me to hear, especially since it’s during a vulnerable time. He’s a  great, thoughtful person and makes an effort to tell me he loves me  often. I know this my flaw, but I do not feel loved when I can’t cry in  my own house without an argument. I also worry for the future,  particularly if I get pregnant. I am scared that I will be crying more  often and I am not sure how he will react to that. He’s beaten the odds  that were stacked against him to an incredible degree, but he has  admitted he feels zero sympathy for people who are crying, including me.

I feel like I have a right to cry in my own house without protest, despite the fact that my husband gets angry when I do. AITA?",43,33,0.74

So roomie in question (Elon) was a pretty good kid, aside from some minor drug consumption. We were splitting the rent so I was paying 50% of rent (biggest room, private bath, all home items that furnished the apt), our other roomie (Felix) was paying 30% and Elon was paying the last 20%. Also noted that Elon and I work in the same place, but worked different shifts.


The first day, after I had gone to sleep, his group of friends (maybe 6 or 7) had a small hangout. We didn't have furniture out or internet yet so I set up my TV, movies I had, and my extra blankets for them. When I woke up, Elon was rocking back and forth in the living room with 2 of his friends (one we'll call Marzio), one was passed out half naked in the kitchen. Apparently, the half naked friend got drunk, made a mess of the shared bath, started causing trouble and got caught by apt security. His ex girl in the mix was doing shitloads of coke all over his room, also her car got towed out because she parked in front of someone's garage. We only got a warning. He told me he wasn't letting half naked friend come back.


A month or so later, Marzio and Elon had a friend over. I went in my room so they could chill and do their own thing. A bit later my pups start barking, and it was a little unusual so I go out to the hallway - all of a sudden a guy kicks down the front door, stares me straight in the eye, and runs away. Scared as fuck, I knock on Elons door, both of them come out of the room looking down. They told me they knew their friends boyfriend was coming to cause trouble. We had cops come, we all concluded to not have that friend over again.


Time passes, he is having at least 3 to 4 people over every day, in and out all day long. It's a little exhausting to Felix and me as we are socially introverted. But we try to stay in our rooms instead at this point and let him kind of have the rest of the apt, since we dont have large friend groups and like spending time in our rooms. We understood this is his first ""his"" space, if that makes sense.


A month later, another one of Elons friends ended up starting to nic cigarettes and other consumables from Felix and my possessions. It was at this point both Felix and I finally got upset and told him we didn't want him to have friends over unless we knew them (this included Marzio and about 4 of the others that we knew were ok). We discussed, it seemed ok.


Later on, I found out he was telling our work that I was a tyrant asking this of him, he was paying for the space so he should have whoever he wanted over at any time, and that I was a bad roomie for imposing something so restrictive on someone with a large social circle. I feel guilty because I mostly stay in my room, and I am thinking that maybe it isn't my say, because it is a shared apt, and just because things have happened with certain people in the past, I should not ask that of him.

1910,Not the A-hole,"Hello all

I have a 5 year old daughter, who I have joint custody over (so she isn't always at my house). I let her play games on my phone now and then, and on weekends she gets an hour or so to play Minecraft or whatever else she feels like playing (age appropriate, offline only, constant supervision).

This weekend, I was having a conversation with my mother. She has entered a competition at her work where she stands a chance to win a new smartphone. She told me that if she wins the phone, she intends on giving her old phone to my daughter so that she can video call her when she feels like it. 

At first, I politely told her that I do not like the idea of my 5 year old having access to a smartphone. She countered this, saying that we will ensure that there is parental lock on the phone. I explained to her that my daughter will find her way around it, and even if she couldn't, I have seen how some things circumvent parental lock anyway. Aside from that, I just don't want her to have her own phone at this age. 

The discussion turned into an argument. I was frustrated, and it came out in the way I was talking to her. I tend to get very short and to the point when I am annoyed, and she perceived it as me being disrespectful to her. 

She kept on pushing the topic, so I put my foot down and told her ""When it comes to my child and the way she is being raised, my word is final."" She took it as a challenge and told me that she would just give it to her anyway. So I asked her if she's run this passed my ex, who also has a say, and she said no. I again reiterated that the answer is no, and that pushing me on this isn't going to make a difference. She then brought up the fact that I allow my daughter to play games on my phone and computer, and accused me of having double standards.

My final response, which ended the ""discussion"" was that even if I do have double standards, that it is my prerogative as her parent and even if my choices make no sense to my mother, that her buy-in and her acceptance of my decisions regarding my child, is the least of my concerns.

I regret speaking to her in such a direct and possibly harsh way, but I wanted her to realise that she literally has no say in this. It's not that her opinion doesn't matter to me, but fundamental decisions regarding my child are up to me and her mother.

1911,Asshole,"\*This is my first post, if I broke any rules please tell me\*

Context-Boyfriend decided to visit his family to give me, my son, and his daughter some time living together. We're not to ask for help with dealing each together unless it's an emergency. My son and his daughter are the same age, 16.

I left my phone in her room, so I went to get it. I....I'm embarrassed to say it, but I looked at what she watching, mainly so that I could bring it up for conversation (as an ice-breaker). I saw her search up on youtube ""kim eminem"". So I, being the somewhat desperate woman that I am, decided to search up the lyrics, to see what her interests are (whenever I asked, she didn't answer). The lyrics...I'll just type the chorus, because other parts of the song are more violent. If you want to know what the song is about, look it up. (I don't want to violate any rules.)

So long, bitch you did me so wrong

I don't want to go on

Living in this world

Without you

(It repeats, and then goes on to the next verse)

I was...maybe I overreacted? I...confronted her. Meaning that I yelled at her repeated as she rolled her eyes. I asked (not calmly at all) ""How do you consider that art?!""

She replied ""Well if songs about how great drugs are and treating women like sex objects are considered art, why not this? I mean, your son's favorite song literally goes ""Ayy, I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies, Man, I feel like a rockstar."" I'm pretty sure that listening to that shows more about his character then me listening to song about a guy who's obviously going insane. Listening to him isn't going to make me act like him, but listening to a guy who calls women ""hoes and bitches"" will probably affect how your son sees women.

This probably wasn't that the best thing to do, but...

""That's it. Until you can use discretion, you are banned from listening to music.""

""You obviously didn't use discretion, or else you would've fucked a guy who could pay child support. Obviously, you didn't ban yourself from men, so...""

If I didn't lose it already, I lost it then. I...said somethings that I shouldn't of, let's leave it at that. The day after, I asked my friends who was in the wrong, or if both of us were. It's pretty split, so I decided to ask reddit. AITA?

Update: I apologized and took responsibility. She took it well, saying ""It's ok. Just forgive me the next time I yell over something stupid. After all, we all yell for stupid reasons once in a while."" Thanks for the advice!",160,35,0.73

Except one jug of milk he'd placed on the bottom rack.
He proceeded to close his trunk and go to the driver's seat, all the while we looked back and forth between him and the milk he'd forgotten. 
We were towards the back of the parking lot, with few other vehicles around, so he didn't have to back up or anything, and there was still plenty of time to stop him; I even put my hand on the door handle for a moment.
Then I realized that this jerk had no intention of putting his cart away. He was just gonna drive off, leave it in the middle of the parking lot for some poor, starving college student working overtime at walmart to have to run to the back of the parking lot to retrieve...
At that realization, I took my hand from the door handle, waiting with a smile as he inevitably pulled out and drove away.
We gratiously retrieved the milk, returned the cart, and resumed enjoying our day, grateful for a little chaotic good in the world.

That these girls looked better than me and I was jealous of them, not attracted to them. She genuinely thinks it's impossible for me to be gay and never took it seriously. It got to a point where I didn't tell her if I met anyone.

Skip to when I met my wife. When I'd finally let my mom know about her(we had been together two years now) the convo went like this:

Me: we want to get married.
Her, extremely disdainful: oh you do? Well let me tell you something, throwawaygayallday, you're going to want a man. Your car breaks down, you're screwed. You need heavy stuff moved? Screwed. Two women can't make love. You're going to want a man in bed with you.

I hung up on her, I was so fucking mad. I married my wife without telling my parents.

I never told my mom we wanted a child and never told her of his birth. When I visited for Christmas, I went alone. I'm not sure when I planned to tell her or how. I just hadn't gotten around to doing it. Serious procrastination and dread.

My wife and I live a few hours from my parents. They've never visited(they don't know my address) and when we spend time together, I go to them. They do pass through on the way to visit other family though. They had stopped at our Wal-Mart to get last-minute items and that's when they saw us.

I was there getting stuff for dinner and had my son in the cart seat. We were going down an aisle when I heard ""Hey kiddo!"" from behind. I recognized my mom's voice and turned to face her, ready to do introductions. But damn man, the instant she saw my son, she gave him the dirtiest fucking look and said ""Whose kid?""

Me, now pissed: Mine
Her: what do you mean he's yours?
Me: I mean he's mine
Her: he can't be yours
Me: ever heard of IVF?
Her: So you went and spent god knows how much money to have a kid with your girlfriend
Me: Wife
Her: And when were you going to tell me about all this?
Me: I don't know, I don't want to talk about it in the middle of the store

1923,Not the A-hole,"Hi all, 

&#x200B;

My little sister (now early 20's) and my wife (been together 12 years, married 2) used to get on just fine, but in her teens my sister was diagnosed with BPD and sadly a lot of people have been written off by her because of it - my wife included. 

It's a little more complicated, obviously, as my wife and I fell out with my sister around the time of our own wedding which ended up with my sister not attending (despite trying to persuade her to). As a result, one of the defining memories of my big day is my mum crying in the background of photos because my sister isn't there. 

Since then I've managed to patch things up with my sister to a certain degree, but she and my wife will only communicate to say hello and keep things civil. 

Fast forward to this year and my sister is getting married. She asked to meet with me in the local coffee shop and when we were there she proceeded (nervously, not 'shittily') to tell me that my wife isn't invited to the ceremony or reception, none of it. 

I was expecting it tbh, and had already been over the potential conversation in my head (as you do) so as to hopefully counter any possible emotional reaction. It was all fairly civil, although I did state that if my wife wasn't invited then I wouldn't be bringing our baby either. Just me. She was fine with this. Which was slightly unexpected as she dotes over my baby whenever she sees her and I assumed she would be more upset. But I guess it just enforced in my mind that my wife hadn't been invited because my sister didn't want anything at all to potentially 'set her off' on her big day, and that not having my baby there as a consequence was fair enough. 

We're now fast approaching the big day and I've just been messaged by my sister asking if I'd reconsider and take my baby along as our mother is once again deeply upset that a member of the family not being present... obviously meaning my baby, no mention of my wife. 

My wife has no love for my sister anymore and thinks it's all bullshit to get her own way. 

I wanted to talk directly to my mother to discover the extent of her issue... but the last time I did that was what led to us falling out with my sister before our wedding - as my mother repeated some stuff I'd said to her about my sister which prompted a slanging match between my sister and I over the phone. 

Anyway, I've replied to say that my decision stands. But now I feel like I'm an asshole. Am I The Asshole?

<<<<EDIT>>>> I probably should have stated originally that my awesome wife is totally fine with me going, as there's no love lost between them and she'll enjoy a day to herself playing on her mobile while the baby naps. She even persuaded me to attend when I said I shouldn't. She's commenting as u/mrs_tumble_ , if anyone wants to let her know how awful her husband is ;)

<<<<EDIT 2>>>> A few people have asked for more info about why my sister and wife don't get along, despite being fine for many years... A few reasons really, each sillier than the last because it's all a bunch of shite tied to the BPD... The most memorable reason was because my wife took a picture of her knowing that she didn't like having her picture taken (which in my wife's defence had been fine for years, with my sister appearing in lots of photos. She just suddenly decided this occasion was too far and got shitty about it. She just started being really cold towards my wife! Although no one actually found out that this was the reason until years later)!",317,534,0.96

In my time there I have met a woman about my age. We have come to be friends and work to motivate each other. About half of the time that she works out, she brings her son along. He is about seven or eight years old. 

This doesn't bother me because he's just a child and usually just plays with his iPhone while we work out. However, while he previously would wait outside of the locker room while we showered and changed, she has recently begun taking him inside. This made me feel uncomfortable before, and when I asked her way, she said that his relationship with his father had gotten distant and that he felt anxious when he was alone.

I understand the situation, but I don't like him in there when I'm changing. Even if he is on the other side of the locker room, he could look up at any time and see me in my underwear. His mother has insisted that he is just a little boy, but I find this really violating to my privacy. Kids his age know more than she is letting on. 

Yesterday, after even rehearsing how I would tell her in front of a mirror, I explained that I really liked her son, but that he was making me uncomfortable in the locker room. More than getting angry, she got upset and after talking, she said that she would try to avoid the times that I was coming. I assured her this was not necessary, but she insisted that if her son was ruining my motivation and making me uncomfortable being there, she would stop coming if need be.

So on our way to an errand me and my mom stopped at the gas station. Its next to my house so I've been there often. Sometimes theres a woman with a cute little girl there running a scam. So a guy that is her ""husband"" is in a huge van while a woman and a child (10 ish?) goes around asking for people to get them gas because they're stuck. I assume they're trying to get your card number when you buy gas for them. A different woman also doing this scam frequents the station near my SO's place so I'm pretty familiar with this tactic.

So this lady approaches my mom while she gets gas and I'm eating something in the car. My mom hesitates because she sees the little girl. I open the door and tell her (in korean) that I've seen them doing the same thing before. My mom refuses and is about to leave it at that. Then after I close the door my mom hears the women say ""I hope you choke. Asshole"" while looking at me and is about to walk away. 

I really dont know why this women assumed my mom cant understand English? My mom's English pronunciation is bad but she clearly understood ""can you buy me gas."".

My mom's furious, the woman's trying to deny she said anything by saying my mom doesn't understand English very well. This is the last straw so I get outside and start dressing her down (I'm not yelling, yet) I get her to admit to saying what she said and she apologizes.

But I dont leave it at that, I yell (so everyone at the gas station can hear me) ""I've seen you here before, running this fucking scam. I dont ever want to see you here again or I'll call the fucking cops.""

This year, we have a big family get together where my parents and some other family live. My parents offered to let us stay with them, and we agreed. I was talking with my mom to finalize some details for the trip, and she mentioned off-hand that my partner would be sleeping on the couch and I'd be in my old bedroom. I was a bit taken aback and she could tell. There was a pause and then ""I don't want to get into this."" I let it be but I'm honestly a bit upset about it and considering getting us a hotel room instead of staying with my parents now. 

They're religious, so I think that's why. I would understand if I was bringing home a college boyfriend to meet the family, but this is my partner, with whom I live with and have built a life with. Part of me wants to just roll with it and not raise a fuss so we can enjoy our time there without any drama. But part of me is really upset that they somehow don't respect our adult relationship as a real thing. We aren't wanting to have sex or anything, we just want to sleep together for the same reason every couple does.... it's comforting to end the day in bed together and regroup, especially with lots of hectic family events happening. Would I be an asshole if I just told her to not worry about it, and got him and I a hotel room nearby?

For some extra context, cousins who are young but married are allowed to sleep in the same room, as are older unmarried aunts and uncles with partners. My partner is annoyed and thinks it's ridiculous, but doesn't care too much and is letting me make the call since it's my family.

I called my mom up and let her know that I appreciate her being willing to host us, but that me and my partner would be more comfortable just getting a hotel.

Four years ago, when my boyfriend pinned me down and tickled me, I didn‘t suppress that urge and kicked him off with my foot. I injured his wrist somehow. He didn‘t want to visit a doctor because he could lose his work licence for as long as his hand isn‘t deemed healthy.

Also, in his job, if the hydraulic system of a certain machine stops working, he needs to do straining manual work in order to compensate. This exact situation happend about a year ago and his wrist hurt for days afterwards. 


I feel sad for having hurt him whenever the subject comes up, but I feel like he himself was responsible for that and that he should accept the risk of being kicked off when he tickles someone.

So about 4 years ago my grandad died. He was the unchallenged patriarch of the family and everyone loved and respected him as much as humanly possible. At the time my dad (his son) and my gran (married for over 60 years) took it very badly, especially my dad because he was the one who had to deal with all the leagl proceedings and funeral arrangements on his own, with no help from any other family members.

Shortly after a man from my gran and grandad past started showing up at my grans house more and more often and it was explained to me by my dad that this man had a short affair with my gran and fled to a different country when my grandad found out. For obvious reasons my dad despises this man.

My gran now denies that anything ever happened between them calling my dad a liar whenever he brings  it up (he caught them), she also spends as much time as possible with him so no one wants to go and visit her as he is roundly despised by all my grandads old friends and obviously all of the family. On top of this she now tries to claim that my dad has never done anything for her and is lazy and entitled even though he took unpaid time off work to look after her and make sure she was coping with my grandads death even though he wasn't.

The things that tipped it over the edge for me was she has started to spend A LOT of money that my grandad earned (she never worked) on this man and I know my grandad worked extremely hard to keep all of his finances in order. I rang her up recently (she forgot a major family milestone) to let her know I was not happy with her behaviour and she immediately started to fake cry and accuse me of bullying her, not loving her, and disgracing the family name for disagreeing with her.

I told her that I thought how she has treated my dad is appalling and unforgivable and that, in my mind, my gran died the same day as my grandad. I said that I did not want to see or hear from her again until she apologised to my dad and stopped seeing this man.

I still love my gran, and dont want to allow this man to take all of her friends and money away but also cant forgive or forget her behaviour.

I've asked my siblings for help (I'm the youngest of 4) and none of them will help. They all say they can't afford to help and that they all have their own things going on. And yet, I'm the asshole that's out of line for not wanting to do this alone anymore? I'm almost 30 and I have NOTHING to show for it. I feel like I'm being robbed of my life and any potential value as an individual just because she doesn't take care of herself and my siblings are lazy jerks.

So, am I the asshole for considering putting her in a home and focusing on myself?",36,28,0.94
1934,No A-holes here,"Okay, this is minor, but it might start shit so I want to make sure I'm not a total anus before going ahead.

My friend runs a D&D game for us. She worked really hard on it and makes all kinda of extra materials for us- extra side plots, newspaper clippings, really going all out. Recently the game's hit a bit of a rut plot wise and it's been a struggle to continue it since I'm not having a good time. I don't want to just quit since we have had a lot of fun in the past and I'm hoping we can get out of this hole and have fun again.

However, beside this, the DM has been a bit demanding, she's been badgering us to keep a log of everything we do in the plot, which is fair enough but feels a bit like having to do homework for something we enjoy. She's also insisting we put together a playlist of music for the game, and other bits and pieces. Again, she puts in a lot of work for the game so I do get why she asks us to chip in, but it's feeling a bit much since none of the players asked for any of this.

The last straw has been that recently, she has been asking us to pay the equivalent of 2 dollars per session to cover printing costs. The printing costs are mostly for the extra stuff she makes, which is cool, but none of us ask for this and it's usually not plot-relevant. Even if it was, we all bring snacks and drinks the the game so it's not like we aren't contributing.

Basically, right now it feels like I'm paying for the privileged of being bored, and being assigned homework on top of that. Again, quitting the game isn't something I want to do just yet, but I want to draw the line at forking out cash. 

I'm feeling bad since this is the DM's first game (she's a lot younger than me) and she's clearly putting in a ton of her own time and money, but I think that's her choice and we shouldn't have feel pressured to help her out?

AITA if I keep my 2 dollars?",70,84,0.95
1935,Not the A-hole,"I (17M) have been perved on by one of my peers (18M) since around January. Let's call him John. I'd been friends with John for a few months when one of my close friends, let's call him Mike (17M) who'd been friends with John for 8+ years told me that John had been taking photos of myself and him and masturbating to them. I don't know why he chose to do this but he would send lists of who he masturbated to each week to to Mike with codenames that related to Mike's initial and places with connection to my surname. John lied to me multiple times about how far down the rabbit hole he'd gone. It's gotten in the way of my education and at this point I want nothing to do with him. I'd happily talk to the school about the things John has done but the only reason I haven't is because his parents are strong christians and he is depressed. Mike knows the parents well and told me that they'd probably kick out and potentially disown John if word of this got out. He would likely be kicked out of the school too. Would I be the asshole?

1936,Everyone Sucks,"I live with two roommates in a small student residence.

Last tuesday one of them left an open bag of food leftovers, mostly chicken and sausages on the kitchen counter. “She'll get rid of them later“ I thought. Boy was I wrong. On wednesday I texted her asking to get rid of it. She did not. Friday comes, and there's a foul rotten smell all over the place. Flies are inside the bag and it's just gross. Knocked on her door and asked her again to please get rid of it. Annoyed, she said she would, but didn't and then left to spend the weekend with her parents.

I'm done with cleaning after this girl's mess every single time so I took the bag and threw it through her bedroom window. The weekend goes by. Today (Monday night), when she came back I heard her scream. Seconds later she was angerly knocking at my door while yelling: “What the fuck did you do?!“ At this point, roommate #2 comes out of her room, confused as to what's going on. The three of us go downstairs to the first roommate's room. Oh, Jesus. As she opened the door, we found maggots taking over her floor, furniture, and walls. Roommate #2 threw up. Both of them yelled at me how bad of a person I was and demanded me to clean. I refused.

Told Roommate #1 I was done with her BS. 9 times out of 10 I end up doing the dishes she should've done, I put in the bin all the wrappers and food leftovers she often leaves at the table for several days, because of this, we had maggots in the kitchen just a couple of days prior to the beginning of this incident. She once spilled milk on the floor and didn't seem to care. When I asked her to clean, she answered with: If it bothers you so much, clean it yourself. Also, she often clogs the toilet and leaves it for the next person to take care of.

Her parents came to pick her up and also to yell at me some more. I didn't even try to defend myself but didn't apologize either. Just an hour ago I got a call from my landlord telling me we would discuss this in the morning.

I'm done with her being so disgusting, but I can't afford to move elsewhere. AITA for trying to teach my roommate a lesson?",292,1494,0.97
1937,No A-holes here,"Last week my wife had to drop what she was doing and head straight to her mother’s house because her mom had something really important to share with her... She has 3 sisters, and they were all there too.  Apparently, their mother dropped some type of bomb on them that has changed their lives. My wife won’t tell me what it is... she came home in tears that night. I asked her what happened, and she told me that he mother made her swear not to tell anyone.... My wife doesn’t hide anything from me.. she tells me everything. I just can’t imagine what this might be. She’s been crying about it for days... and she just says she can’t tell me... I asked her if if was something health related, and if someone is dying, and she told me no... I asked her if this secret is going to rip her family apart, and she said YES... But that’s all she will tell me.. I just can’t seem to figure it out... 

We usually take her mom and dad out to eat a few times a month.. Last week I asked if she wanted to invite her parents out to eat with us, and she said no. She told me some stuff went down, and that I won’t be seeing her parents for a good while. She told me that we won’t be going to visit them for a while (This is very strange because they are a very close family, and we visit them at least once per week. She says that I will not be able to visit them anymore, and that only she can go over there now) This is so strange, because they are such a close family, and not being able to visit anymore is just so strange. 

It hurts me that she can’t share something as serious as this with me. We are married, and big secrets like this should not exist. If it were the other way around, I would absolutely tell her whatever it was. She’s upset and saying that I’m making this about us, when it’s about her parents and her family.

1938,Not the A-hole,"My (34m) boyfriend (33m) and I have been together for ages, we're practically married, and we live together. He happens to have a really great phone and I have some piece of crap that serves the purpose and I don't feel the need to replace it. Sometimes, when we're at home and I don't feel like turning on the computer, I ask him if I may use his phone (for watching YouTube, going on Reddit or Instagram, just googling stuff...) and he lets me. Sometimes I don't even ask because he lets me every time, and he's right there, he sees it, and never reacts.

He also has a folder of our pictures which I sometimes go to. So none of the other folders, just that one with our photos together.

We recently had friends over and they saw me do this. Nobody said anything there and then, but the next day, two of them sent me a group message and asked me what the fuck. I said that I'd asked him and he let me, so what's the big deal. But they said: Of course he let you! You shouldn't have asked in the first place! That's like an unwritten rule that you don't go through your partner's things. He probably feels pressured to give you his phone because you're a couple.

I tried to justify myself, but they just called me an asshole and told me I need to stop RIGHT NOW. I said I doubt there is anything on his phone he'd be worried about me finding, and they said that of course there is nothing, because he knows I'll be touching his phone.

So now I'm confused. I never heard of this unwritten rule, and I think that if he didn't want me to use his phone, he'd say so. Also, I don't understand what exactly he's supposed to have on his phone that he might not want me to find. I'm fairly certain he isn't cheating on me, and I see all the dick pics he takes because he sends them to me anyway.

Am I being an asshole for using his phone, or even asking in the first place?",144,240,0.91
1939,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR GF’s son is 19 and has knocked a girl up. Now the baby momma and her mother are pressuring him to get married. His mother and I on the other hand are encouraging him to have a paternity test and refuse a marriage while he is living in our home because their typical living arrangements haven’t been stable.

Backstory... GF’s son (19) had a long distance relationship with a girl. She moved closer and he quickly got her pregnant. Questionably quickly. His mother and I have encouraged him to get a DNA test. We both believe it’s reasonable no matter the circumstances to be sure. Even if it was possible for us we would do the same so there are no potential uncertainties.

That however isn’t the problem. The issue is he wants to marry this girl to appease her and her mother. Meanwhile he’s informing us of this as he is staying at our home because the relationship has been incredibly rocky. He has been staying with us for two and a half weeks out of the last three weeks because the relationship is so rocky.

I am incredibly opposed to this potential marriage while my gf is biting her tongue even though it’s her son. She doesn’t disagree she just doesn’t think she can be decent about it. He also informed us tonight his baby mama would be visiting in the morning and told me specifically to talk to the baby mama.

This is where I’m conflicted. I know 100% I am not wrong in some aspects of this but it is also entirely not my place. Not even slightly. I am nothing to my GF’s son or the woman he (potentially) got pregnant. It truly isn’t my place however I care entirely about the success of this 19 yr old kid simply because he is my GF’s son.

1940,Not the A-hole,"This past year, my youngest sister died due to a carbon monoxide leak at her home. I took leave from work—a Christian run company as the Kitchen Manager—for the last of that week/weekend and the weekend after for her funeral, but I needed the money, so I still worked during the week in the middle. I just holed myself in my office, doing paperwork and let my second in command run the show for the most part. 

When I came back late Sunday evening that second weekend to grab my truck order that I had my SIC fill out for me to call in the next morning, an employee got up in my face and DEMANDED to know why I skipped out on a busy weekend. I got pissed off because I was exhausted from the eight hour car ride and from the events of the weekend and ended up firing her on the spot. I believe it was something to the effect of, “I was at a GODDAMNED funeral, so FUCK OFF and never come back.” She left in tears and I stormed off. 

EDIT: I should add that this was not her first instance of getting up in a higher-ups face and had multiple write-ups already and everyone was informed of the fact that I would be gone and for what reason. They all signed the card that my SIC got.

The next morning we were at the dining table eating breakfast. I have allergies and I blow my nose a few times throughout the day and a bizarre sound akin to a horn is produced. I blew my nose with a clean napkin and due to the funny noise, my friends and I all naturally laughed.

Suddenly my friend's mom comes out of the kitchen and tells me in a very condescending manner that I am being very rude and should not be blowing my nose at the table. I am surprised by this as I have never heard this before and say that ""I won't do it at your table anymore"" as completely intended to respect her rules as it's her house, but wasn't planning on running to the bathroom every time I needed to blow my nose at other tables. She then comes back and calls me a smartass and then proceeds to say, ""I told you that it's rude because clearly no one else has told you its bad manners before and that you shouldn't blow your nose when you are eating at a restaurant or elsewhere."" I took her statement offensively as it seemed as if she made a personal attack on my family. I just said ""Okay"" and she concluded with ""But that's just my opinion"" in an extremely sarcastic tone.

1943,Not the A-hole,"First post here. This just happened tonight. 

I just moved in to a new townhome 10 days ago, and I have spent the last 5 days on vacation for memorial day. My Fiance and I arrive home late tonight after a long 14 hours in the car to the sight of a car I've never seen before parked in our driveway. 

Our driveway has space for just one car on the pavement and another in the garage. Granted it's 1am so my first instinct is to call the tow company and have them towed out of there. No go. Since we rent we can't have anyone towed off the property without the landlord's signature. I wasn't going to wake him up this late because he is an older man and this shouldn't be brought up at this hour. But like I said, I just got done driving all day and the last thing I wanted to do was park at the end of my street and walk home. 

I ended up calling the non emergency line in our town to see maybe if the police could instead have the car moved themselves. That's not what happened...

The officer arrived, checked out the car and just started knocking on my neighbors doors and the wee hours of the night to ask who's car it was. I didn't want to stop him because he had already come this far for me. He eventually found the person who's car it was and the gentleman kindly removed it with no fuss. I had to go inside though so he didn't see me. I was way too embarrassed that I had the police do my dirty work. I would have done this myself if I knew that's what the police would do.

I guess I feel bad that I'm the new guy in town and here I am having the cops knock on their doors in the AM, basically doing something I very well could have done myself, I just didn't want to disturb my sleeping neighbors this late at night. Now I feel like I need to bake cookies or something....gahhh. AITA?",116,130,0.92
1944,Asshole,"Just for the record I'm Jewish, male, 25. 

I was visiting my older brother's family and some of their friends, mostly 25-35 age range, over memorial day and we were all just sitting around chatting and drinking wine, among the guest list were a slihtly older couple with a 13 year old daughter, she was the only minor there other talking with us, and I could infer from the conversation that she was smart and mature and had a pretty open relationship with her parents, so she was treated more or less like another adult, though everyone toned down most of the swearing when they arrived. 

So what happened is that another adult there was talking about a book about the holocaust he was reading, and mentioned he bought it from the auschwitz gift shop. So after that the conversation morphed into talking about trips there and the first guy said he didn't think the gift shop would let you return items and then I said too bad, since I wanted to return the old soap and lampshade my grandfather bought there. 

Everyone in that particular conversation thouht it was funny and we kept talking but afterwards my brother said the parents of the girl complained about it and were saying I was an asshole.

Today I own my own gym and my son is now 22 and going to college and works at my gym full-time. He came out to me when he was 14 years old and I’ve always been supportive of him and his identity. 

I’ve been with my fiancé now for about 2 years and while she does come from a very deep religious and conservative family, she has never had any issue with my son – at least nothing she has ever expressed to me. My son has been dating his boyfriend since he was 18 and I’ve gotten to know him really well. However my fiancé told me recently that she does not want my son’s boyfriend to come to the wedding nor does she want her parents to even get the inclination that my son is gay. That if they found out, they would have a complete fit. This really bothered me because I refuse to ask my son to go back in the closet. What is going to happen in the future? When my son gets married himself? Will they want him and his husband barred from other family events? He’s my son and will be the best man and it would be unfair to deny him a plus one because her family has an issue with gay people.

1950,Asshole,"My boyfriend is a doctor; he has no debt, and makes an easy 200k and change. We’ve been dating for 3 years now. 

Last Friday, he took me to this *beautiful*, very expensive restaurant and proposed. I cried tears of joy and said yes. When he proposed, I didn’t even look at the ring; I just knew I wanted *him*.

I’ve been wearing the ring he gave me, and I feel horrible about myself, but I just plainly don’t like it. It *looks* very cheap, the diamond is tiny, and it honestly looks like one of those rings you see in display at Walmart. Earlier today, curiosity got the best of me, and I asked him how much did he spend on the ring. He actually looked really proud and said he got it for a huge steal; the jeweler said it was worth $1000, but he got it for $350.

I’m not going to lie. I was hurt. This man has no debt, he makes an incredible salary, and he couldn’t even get me a ring worth a *day* of his salary. Not a single friggin day. I told him that I appreciated the proposal and I *do* want to marry him, but I don’t really like the ring he picked out; it looks really cheap, it *is* cheap, and it seems like he didn’t really put effort into it.

He was hurt by what I said. He said he picked a “minimalist” design because I’m a minimalistic person. I told him while this is true, this is something that’s supposed to symbolize our love. I didn’t think he needed to spend the traditional 3-months salary, but I don’t think a $3000 ring (approx. 3-4 days salary for him) would be too unreasonable to ask for. I showed him some ring designs I found online I liked in the $2000-3000 range, and told him that if he found something cheaper that I liked, I would be open to that option, but I’m wearing that thing forever; I want to love it, and I want to look at it knowing how much my (future) husband loves ME. The fact that we have multiple video game systems and other things HE loves worth more than my ring just….makes me sad.

He told me I was being materialistic, and that he’d be more comfortable saving that money towards a honeymoon or a house. He said he will get another ring if I really hate my ring, but spending more than $500 was straight-up not happening. I told him that that’s fine, but my “yes” is conditional on getting a better ring that I actually like, and he will be very hard-pressed to find one I like for less than $500. If I’m not worth the cost, then I know where he stands.

He just left at that point, and we haven’t really talked much since then. I feel just so unloved; is a ring really going to be the thing that breaks up a strong 3-year commitment. Like a $350 ring? Are you kidding me? AITA for thinking he’s being an inconsiderate jerk for spending half a day’s salary on my engagement ring, and AITA for making my proposal conditional?

EDIT: I've been told to lead with things I mentioned in the comments, such as he has spent $4000 on a Vegas trip, and he's normally not frugal with other things in his life (for example, he has wine more expensive than the ring he bought me), and I just feel unappreciated and that he values his things more than the ONE thing I ever asked for.

---

I just wanted to say that this was probably the worst post I’ve ever made on Reddit. Sure, I put a lot of costs into my OP; I’m overly analytical as it stands and I was just trying to convey the fact that he, as a doctor, can afford *much* more than he was willing to spend. 

This was taken as an opportunity to run with the “she’s a shallow gold digger who only wants his money” narrative. Never mind the fact that I never ask for anything for my boyfriend. I cook/clean the house without any help from him, we often go Dutch in dates, hell I just bought him a new $500 watch because his birthday is next month (worth more than the ring), and I do pretty much the opposite a gold digger would do. 

Sure, call me materialistic because I don’t want a cheapo crappy clearance ring, but the amount of people trying to insist I’m only after him after his money, when it’s patently false, has solidified the fact that I will never post here again. Thank you for those who commented in good faith.

**ALSO, RELEVANT TO THE POST; BOLDING BECAUSE PEOPLE KEEP COMMENTING ADVICE WHEN IT'S NOT NEEDED.** Me and my boyfriend talked. When he realized I was offended at gestures, such that he spent 10x as much on a weekend for himself at Vegas, and I feel he just doesn't value *me*, he saw where I was coming from and understood how having wine in his cellar worth more than my ring can make me feel unappreciated. He's the ""who gives a shit about a dumb rock"" person, but when he realized it was valuable to *me*, he realized it doesn't matter if we share the same values; it's important to me.

Since then, he's now shopping for a ring that he can afford, but what I'd actually like.",1384,2193,0.85
1951,Asshole,"Been with my partner for ~5 years, have children together, no intimacy whatsoever. 

Seen a post on Reddit recently regarding couples viewing each other as siblings/children after being in a relationship for an amount of time where once endearing behaviours become somewhat tiresome. She feels like my mother with how she speaks to me sometimes. 

I don't want to end things for the children's sake, we're content enough that we can get along and do things as a family together and it's still fun - but when it comes to us having alone time? The best it gets is playing GTA V together on the PS4s. 

The circumstances surrounding our relationship are troublesome at best, there's more factors as to why I don't want to rock the boat and risk losing access to my kids - she can be temperamental at times. One of the children isn't mine, and she has used him as a weapon before - I don't want to suffer the same fate until I know the bind between me and my children is developed and they're certain as to who I am. No poisonous thoughts. 

Now, I'm not saying I'm innocent by any means. I am an asshole in the regard that I can be lazy, short tempered when discussing future plans, and I certainly can be hard to compromise with. 

My finances are secure enough that the escort would not out me in any financial jeopardy, and it would be at a time where nobody would suspect anything out of the ordinary. 
I'm a young male in my early 20s and crave intimacy - I haven't been touched in months. Masturbating only gets you so far to satisfaction, you know? 

Feel free to ask more questions. This is an alt account as people know my main account. TIA.

Edit: judging by the replies here, my thought process is that of an asshole. I'm gonna leave this up for others consideration - thank you for your replies. I think I'll end things and just ride out the storm and hope for the best. I don't believe counselling can rekindle things since it feels like a codependent relationship.

1952,Asshole,"So my girlfriend an I have been dating for quite some time now (about 9 months), and it really annoys me with the fact that she has outright claimed several times that she loves her dog more than me because it’s her “best friend” (For context, she adopted him on Mother’s Day, and posed a huge story about how the dog is “her sun, moon and stars” on the “adoption anniversary” and essentially showering it in gifts and treats, instead of celebrating Mother’s Day with the woman who gave BIRTH to her)

On one hand the dog it is a therapy dog, because she does suffer from depression, so it would make sense that she would love the dog so much

On the other hand, however, she seems to love it WAY to much (see the Mother’s Day story), and again, outright claims to me that she loves the dog more than me

So in conclusion, am I an asshole for being jealous?

Edit: Yea, now looking at it in retrospect, I am a pretty big fucking asshole

Edit 2: I had a talk with a close friend of mine who is currently trying to become a therapist , and (at least according to him) the reason why I’m jealous about the dog is bc of a “fear of abandonment” which I got from past experiences

My father is inviting his girlfriend and her children despite the fact that the funeral is very intimate (closest family only, with the exception of some of Opas friends) and they didn't know him AT ALL and despite the fact that I've protested against it and that it's going to make my mother uncomfortable. AITA for not wanting them to come because of the strain it would put on my family? I feel as if they do not belong at the funeral at all, I don't want them there and neither does my mum, and if they wish to pay their respects they may do it in another way.",93,307,0.93

1955,Everyone Sucks,"So, I've been with my ""wife"" for 17 years. I put wife in quotes cuz we've been together for 17 years but never got married even though we both wear rings.

 So, she was raised by an alcoholic father and when i get drunk and lose my cool i can yell sometimes. She has told me many times that it triggers her when im drunk and yell... Not even yell at her just, get loud as a result of drinking. I try to curb it but im excitable..

The past weekend, she has very soberly yelled at me about minor things and ive very calmly asked her to lower her voice and to please not yell.

 Today i confronted her by saying id like to talk about something that is bothering me and told her that if she expects me not to yell, id appreciate it if she didnt yell also. 

 She lost it on me telling me she has too much pent up anger towards me for the times i yelled and because pf that she can yell at me as much as she wants because i am in deficit. I told her that was unfair as the only times i yell or get loud is when im drinking....

Idk... Am i wrong? She is so quick to point out my wrong doings and hold them over my head for days yet when i bring up this thing just to talk to her about it,  she makes me the asshole... 

I had to buy 3 tvs in one year because she was drunk and angry and i never held it over her head the way she holds ANYTHING I do wrong over my head.",45,34,0.92

1957,No A-holes here,"A friend has overbooked guest rooms at a resort for a wedding. I was offered a room, that was not originally meant for me. Here's the following conversation that presents my dilema:


Groom: There is a room available for you guys all weekend if you want to come.

Me: Thanks man, I'm down. what are the details? But if someone needs it later, girlfriend and I are in (a nearby town) for the week, anyway.

Groom: Basically it's a room that we are going to pay for either way. It's 180 a night so if y'all could put a little towards it that would help us and you guys could be there all weekend. Even if you can't because it's short notice, I still want y'all to come stay on site.


TLDR: Friend offers me a hotel room and asks me if I can help pay for it. I feel weird about being asked to help pay for it, and would rather save the money by staying with friends nearby the wedding. 


WIBTA for saying I can't pay?


Thanks ahead of time for your insight. <3


UPDATE: I decided to put it on the credit card and meet him halfway by paying $180. Thanks everyone! I think this was the best outcome. Conversation was as follows:

Me: Yeah man I think I can meet you halfway. Can I give y'all $180 for a night? I wish I could do more rn but it'll be on the credit card.

Groom: Bud that's more than enough. Like I said I care more about y'all being there than the money. Bride will text you some details tomorrow. I'm excited

1958,No A-holes here,"I (28M) confronted my girlfriend (25F) of about 18 months regarding her instagram posts yesterday and it has caused a massive issue between us. I will try describe this in the best an most unbiased way I can as I am truly unsure if I have taken the wrong approach to this.      
         
My gf is pretty popular on Instagram (EDIT: somewhat popular, under 10k followers), she used to use it a lot more before we were dating for her cosplay but also posted a lot of selfies with the occasional photo in her underwear which was all generally tasteful enough, I never had an issue with it. Recently she has started using Instagram a bit more as she didn't post much for a while and has been uploading more sexually suggestive posts such as 'Ahegoa' poses with hashtags to go with it, therefore increasing the reach of her photos. There have been a lot of comments coming in that from other males that make me a bit uncomfortable to read. I normally just shrug it off because at the end of the day she's my girlfriend and we love each other so I try not to let these comments affect me.           
             
My issue is she seems to love the attention and makes posts aimed at getting this sort of exposure. I find it unnecessary and I'm not really sure what shes trying to achieve by doing this.          
After the most recent post I got a bit awkward about it because it was basically a photo of her in her bra with her tongue out doing the 'Ahegoa' pose. When I got home from work she asked me why I was acting so cold towards her. I wasn't intending to however I was just overthinking the situation in my head and I guess it was making me act a little odd.          
              
She messaged me even though we were in the same room asking why I was acting the way I was and I told her that I found her instagram posts weird and I didn't know what to think. She got upset and we didnt speak for the rest of the night.           
            
Today I noticed she deleted the photo and I asked why. She said because of me and I was being a dick. I explained how I was confused about why she is posting photos like this and she basically said she thinks it's cute and that I'm opinionated and she got really annoyed that I made a big deal out of it.          
             
She basically cracked it at me now and won't really talk to me, I know I may have approached the situation in the wrong manner but AITA for being upset about her posting photos to garner this sort of attention?

EDIT: In reply to some of the comments: I didn't ask her to remove the post or even stop posting of this nature. I was more concerned about trying to understand her motives.",73,134,0.96

1961,Everyone Sucks,"A friend(ish) of mine runs a restaurant in my city and asked me months and months ago to help him out. We went to school together but beyond Facebook and the occasional meetup, we're not really close. He wanted me to give him some pointers on recipes because he likes my cooking. I've always been averse to the idea because otherwise I'm not involved in his business, I'm just his menu designer basically and he stressed it would be a favor between friends (read: unpaid).

Anyways, three weeks ago I posted a family recipe on Facebook. It's probably my favorite dish of all time, adapted from my mother's adaptation from her mother's recipe. I love my mother's version but I finally figured out what it was missing and wanted to share it with friends and family.

I guess buddy got wind of this and started making it for his restaurant under the name of ""Nonna Carmela's Pasta"". That's my grandmother's name. How he found this out I'm not sure but I guess a mutual friend told him. It's very clearly a reference to my family.

Look, ultimately I don't care if someone makes my recipe at home or even in a restaurant, but this comes after I refused to write his menu for him, plus he used my grandmother's name in the recipe name. He's making allusions to it being his own family recipe but it is verbatim what I posted on Facebook.

I know it's petty of me, but would I be the asshole for writing a Facebook/Google review for his business, basically telling him he stole my family recipe and is profiting off it after I expressly told him I didn't want it to happen? AFAIK a business can't delete their own reviews.

It's a relatively new restaurant and so far the reviews are sitting in the mid-3s anyways after 20 reviews. I'd imagine it would at least partially impact his bottom line if I spilled the beans on the situation.

Would I be the asshole? My wife suggests just letting it be, it can't be helped, and if I did anything, it would not be a net positive for us. I argue it's the principle of it. At the very least I want that name changed.",181,630,0.94
1962,Asshole,"I just finished grad school and am in the process of moving back home, starting a new job, and also moving into my mom's house to help her out financially. We've been talking for a while about adopting a dog when I move in and I've been researching rescues and sending my mom listings for potential dogs. I move in in about a week, but until then I'm on the other side of the country.

On Saturday, I sent my mom a listing for a pretty cute puppy and mentioned it will be at an adoption event that day in case she wanted to do a meet and greet. A few hours later she sent me a text that she has adopted the puppy and is bringing her home.

Now, this wouldn't be a big deal if it was her dog, but we've been very clear that this is MY dog. I'm the primary care taker for it, she expects me to refund her the adoption fees, I'll be the one picking out a vet, taking it to training classes, etc.

I blew up at her for adopting the dog without so much as a phone call to consult and let me make a decision. She says that she considered the dog to be approved by me since I sent her the listing, and that ""what else was I supposed to do?"" at an adoption event. She hasn't done any vetting of the dog since ""all shelter dogs are the same"" and didn't bother checking if the dog is suitable for our family in terms of health needs or personality or energy levels or anything (shes only had purebred dogs before). She also asked, ""Do you want me to take the dog back?"" But then got upset when I said yes, we'll have to take the dog back if it's a poor fit for us.

I won't meet the dog for another week so it's her problem for now, and of course we'll keep the dog if there's no behavioral issues that emerge. AITA for being so harsh on my mom?",110,64,0.9

1964,Not the A-hole,"A couple months ago I got a very comfortable IKEA chair for my dorm room.

&#x200B;

I have a random roommate whom I do not like (he is very annoying, I could make a whole post detailing the shit he does but i digress.) When I first set up the chair in our room I told him that it was totally fine for him to sit in the chair and game but my only rule was don't sleep in the chair (I said this because he has a habit of falling asleep in his uncomfy spinny plastic university given chair.)

&#x200B;

He obliged my request for the first few weeks, eventually though he started to fall asleep in the chair; to which I responded by waking him up and reminding him that I do not want him sleeping in my chair, after which he would make no actions and fall asleep just for me to wake him up again.

&#x200B;

This went on for months, him falling asleep, me waking him up, him falling asleep 5 mins later, me waking him up again cont. until a few weeks ago I finally snapped and told him how infuriating it is to set clear boundaries only for them to not only be repeatedly crossed but straight up ignored when I reminded him.

&#x200B;

This helped until today when I found him sleeping in my chair YET AGAIN. So I let the door slam behind me to wake him up (its on a loose hinge) said hello, and told him that I really do not want to have to talk to him again about sleeping in my chair.

1969,Not the A-hole,"A while ago, I went out with one friend and two acquaintances of ours. It was a spur of the moment thing, and we ended up in a small Italian place. I tend to be fairly frugal when it comes to restaurants (and thankfully, I don't drink alcohol, so that helps) and am used to paying for what I've eaten (unless our meals evened out pretty much, then we'd share equally. AKA, if all of us get a starter, main and dessert, then we split it equally - if that makes sense). Anyway, I'll give a brief overview of what we each ordered:  


Me: a personal pizza and a coke.  
Friend: a starter, two cokes, a beer and a main.  
Acquaintances: two starters, two mains, two desserts, two glasses of wine each and two shot of limencello.  


After eating I popped to the bathroom and when I returned to the table, I was informed that the bill was being split equally between us all, and two of the others had already paid. The amount I paid was triple the amount I ate. I didn't say anything at the time but I was pretty peeved. Later on, I asked my friend to pay individually if there's been a clear unequal distribution of food or if a lot of alcohol is consumed (as that hikes up the price). I didn't say it in an accusatory way but he got really passive-aggressive and asked if I was blaming him. I told him I wasn't and that I didn't want any repayment or anything (which he had suggested) but just in the future, would it be okay to be more mindful. Anyway, I dropped it as he seemed very angry about the whole thing and now, when we go out, he keeps trying to pay my tab to ""pay me back"" which just makes me feel uncomfortable.

1972,Everyone Sucks,"My husband and I have been married 8 years. We’ve always had a “work hard play hard” attitude towards money so while we have aggressive fiscal goals, we still treat ourselves, go out to eat, vacation, etc. I recently started making 105k and a year ago husband got a big promotion from making 95k to 147k before bonuses. Great, right? We started splurging more and booked a vacation to celebrate his raise and it’s been smooth sailing since.  


Well three weeks ago I find out he was passed for the promotion but thought he had it in the bag so told me the “good news” prematurely and didn’t know how to take it back. **So he lied and pretended to have a promotion and be in a new role for a year** What’s more, is that since that time, he’s racked up $58,000 in high interest credit card debt as well as $25,000 in personal loans to consolidate more CC debt. 8k was for the celebratory promotion vacation and 4K was for a celebratory boys trip I wasn’t on. The rest was just spent on dumb new gadgets, toys, experiences, dining, an expensive bracelet for me, a watch for him etc. I knew of all the items he was buying but didn’t realize how much he was spending on events, trips, food, alcohol, etc. Previously, we were debt free. **He was spending money to keep up appearances about this new raise that he told everyone about**


Since finding out, we have buckled down immensely and lead very frugal lives to much surprise to our friends and family. No more happy hours, events, trips etc until this debt is wiped. Of course, they’re all asking if we’re okay, and I’ve been honest about the situation and say my husband racked up a ton of debt and we have to get it under control ASAP. Now my husband is telling me by doing that I’m embarrassing  him in front of our peers and I shouldn’t be airing our dirty laundry. I don’t consider this to be dirty laundry- we aren’t talking about our fights. I didn’t even talk about his fake promotion lie. I simply say he racked up X amount of debt without my knowledge and now we’re digging ourselves out of the hole. He’s been annoyed about it for weeks but the straw on the camels back according to him was at a birthday party last week where we were invited to rent a beach house with another couple for Memorial Day. Before my husband even said anything I interjected and said “we’d love to but we’re focusing on paying down some debts now”. The woman of the other couple goes “oh right, I completely forgot, how’s that going?”. And we have quick small talk. 

Later at home, my husband tells me I need to stop sharing this info and making him look stupid and he’s been sleeping in the guest room ever since. I told him I didn’t mean to make him look stupid but I’m certainly not apologizing. He fucked up and it led to major lifestyle shifts and I don’t see why friends and family shouldn’t be made aware.

So, AITA?

**Edit: the debt wasn’t incurred waiting for news on the promotion. It was incurred over a year where he lied about getting his promotion and new income and pretended to be in the new role. He was trying to keep appearances to me and our friends and family who all thought he received it** I also don’t share this info with strangers, just family and close friends that we’ve known since college. Not just anyone. But I do understand all the YTA answers and I’m reflecting and understanding that perspective.",654,1515,0.95
1973,Not the A-hole,"Today my gf was supposed to be busy at lunch but ended up free to see me on mine as we do a few times a week (she has strict parents so she's not really allowed out, this is pretty much the only time I get to see her in person), I picked her up and we went to my place, as soon as she came in she grabs my tablet and lay on the couch, I was in the kitchen making my coffee and hear her moaning a bit so I peaked out and saw she had started masturbating to gay porn, I have no problem with her porn preference, or that she was watching it, what upset me was what happened next. 

So obvious I got turned on so I try to initiate sex, but she rejects me and keeps masturbating even telling me to go away and blocking me from view with my tablet. So I got fed up and just went to my room for a bit, and a bit before we would usually leave I came out and said it was time to go. She said she wasn't done, I said you shouldn't have come if all you wanted to do was masturbate to porn, she said it was a joke, she was just messing around and that it was ok, to which I said it was not OK, I told her that it hurts that she was masturbating to porn when I was right there. She stopped talking to me, and left ahead of me, when I asked her to slow down she said fuck you, and for the entire 15 min drive she probably said (mumbled) 2 words. 

Since then I finished and got off work without hearing from her at all and snapped her letting her know I was home if she wanted to talk, she opened the message and didn't respond for a while, which is when I noticed she had ghosted me on snapmap (she didn't show up on the map as if she had blocked me from seeing it) she responded about 10 min later saying ""I’m gonna be spending some time to myself today""

I was very upset with her and told her again that I'm allergic to eggs and that she could have killed me (maybe a bit of hyperbole). She responded that it was my responsibility to check the contents of the foods I'm eating because of my allergy.

1980,Asshole,"My cousin Stephanie and I are really more friends than relatives. An important note is that she's not really online much, so can be out of the loop on certain memes and jokes in internet culture, and tbh, doesn't really understand the concept of viral internet references or how they work.

Stephanie is pregnant and just found out it's going to be a girl. About a week ago, she told a gathering of her best girlfriends that she's going to name her daughter Karen. The room instantly went cold, but after an awkward silence, everyone else politely said it was lovely. I couldn't bring myself to respond at all. Later in the evening, when Stephanie was out of the room, everyone was immediately like, ""OMG, that poor kid,"" and ""why would she pick Karen of all names?!"" I was uncomfortable with this conversation, given that everyone had been so positive about the name to her face.

I thought more about it over the next couple of days, and just felt really weird about the whole thing. The name is really loaded, to the point it could be detrimental to the baby, and Stephanie had no idea of the connotations to make an informed decision.

So a couple of days later, I tentatively brought it up. I told her I was so excited for the baby, and just wanted her to have all available information when picking a name. I then started to explain that Karen has some negative connotations and has become sort of an internet joke to describe a specific kind of entitled middle aged woman. Stephanie instantly was furious and started talking over me, saying, ""why are you saying this?! This is so mean!!"" I was really surprised by her reaction (it felt very, very out of character), so I immediately stopped and said, ""I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. I just wanted to tell you something I thought you might not know.""

She replied, ""That's the name I picked for my daughter. And you think I picked it as some kind of joke?! I don't understand why you'd say something so hurtful."" When she said that, I felt like it signaled that she didn't really understand what I was trying to tell her, so after agonizing for a second about whether to press the issue even though she was so angry, I felt like in for a penny, in for a pound, and since she was already mad, I wanted her to at least understand what I was trying to explain to her. I googled ""Karen know your meme"" on my phone and tried to show her the screen of results while saying, ""look, I'm just saying that there's more meaning to the name than you may realize.""

She stood up, pushed my phone away, and shouted, ""Wow!!"" She then stormed out of my home and drove away. My aunt and mom have been berating me all week, because Stephanie told them that I made fun of her baby name. Stephanie has not spoken to me or responded to my texts since.

I can take a hint, and I'm not going to broach a topic again that caused so much distress, but I keep going back and forth on whether I was TA here by bringing it up in the first place.

Edit: Thanks, everyone! I have been properly schooled, and I accept my judgement that I was TA here. Stephanie and I have a history of being extremely open and honest with each other (I was the maid of honor in her wedding, which we planned on being the case from a young age, and we always joked as teenagers that part of my duties would include talking her out of the marriage if the groom she picked sucked), and so maybe I was too flippant with approaching this topic due to our history, and was unempathetic in underestimating how much she was already invested in the name she chose for her future daughter. I admit I'm a bit frustrated that Stephanie *still* doesn't understand what I was trying to tell her (she still thinks I was making some kind of weird, cruel joke accusing *her* of picking the name as a joke), but I have messaged her a sincere apology that she accepted, and I will never speak of this again, to Stephanie or Baby Karen. I'll also stand up for Stephanie if her other friends shit talk the name around me again. If they're not willing to voice their thoughts to Stephanie directly, they need to not say the kinds of things they were saying behind her back.

Edit 2: One more thing: I definitely was not trying to tell Stephanie to *not* name her daughter Karen. I just wanted her to make the decision either way knowing the connotations, since I'd want someone to do the same for me if I picked a baby name with cultural baggage I wasn't aware of. I realize now I handled it poorly and was hurtful to Stephanie in the process, but I just wanted to be clear that I wasn't actively trying to talk her out of the name. I just didn't want her to be blindsided if it came up later.",375,1010,0.93

1982,Not the A-hole,"So the other day my friend and I decided to go out to a nice restaurant. We treated ourselves to wine and steaks. The bill came out to be 120 dollars. Service was sub-par at best it took the waitress a long time to refill drinks and the place was not very busy. The waitress delivered to the bill to my friend while I was using the bathroom and he filled out the bill for my signature. We wanted to give her a generous tip and wrote out $24 dollars as I always tip 20%. I realize as I am signing the bill that my card is nowhere in sight. So I politely walk up to the waitress and ask where my card is. She blurts out I'm busy and have orders to take give me a few minutes. At this point I became a bit annoyed because I have a lot of money on my card and it could be anywhere at this point possibly stolen. So after 5 minutes she starts looking for the card. She is looking under tables and asking other patrons where the card is. About 10 minutes goes by and still no card. She goes in the back and ""finds it in the cash register"". ""Why would it be inside of the cash register in the first place?"" I ask and she said ""someone found it"". I believe this was very negligent on her part and now anyone could possibly have my card number. So I scribbled out the tip I originally wrote and put $5 instead (honestly I do not think I should have even put anything). My friend and I storm out and I was pretty upset at this point and even forgot my leftovers. She runs out and asks what the deal is and why I tipped so low. I said "" I have been coming to this establishment for 10 years and losing my card is unacceptable and will not be coming back because of your negligence"" then walked away.

1985,Everyone Sucks,"Background: My parents decided to take my sister and me on vacation for the long weekend. We settled into a smallish hotel and the morning after, we decided to go on a hike. My father told us to wear our hiking boots and I complied while my sister threw a tantrum, begrudgingly wearing them after ten or so minutes. By this time, both my parents were somewhat frustrated so we set off.

About a quarter of a mile in, I asked if I could play music through my earbuds while walking the remaining two miles and this was met with, in my opinion, an overly forceful NO even though none of us were talking to one another. A few minutes later, I asked again, explaining that it wouldn't hurt them and I would enjoy the walk a lot more, and this time my mother begins to scream about how my phone is ""destroying the family."" She keeps shouting (*incredibly* loudly) and I see a lot of people (maybe 3 or 4 passing families, almost 20 people) stop and turn their heads in our direction.

By now I didn't know what to do and I felt super embarrassed and humiliated in front of these people. In frustration, I walk back to the parking lot. After my parents return, my phone connection is immediately terminated (I'm posting on computer) and my mother goes on a solid 2-hour rant about how my actions were completely unjustified, how she was fully in the right, and ordered us to get into the car so we could drive back home. I think it was a lot of pent-up anger about my sister being defiant earlier, desire for what she sees as family time (despite hardly talking during the hike), and towards my use of the phone recently to listen to music, text my friends, and play games maybe eight hours a week total.

My action of storming back was also caused my some previously stored resentment, where my mother had made some recent and extremely disparaging comparisons to my friends' academic grades and mocked my ""lack of a social life.""

So Reddit, AITA? I *never* consciously knew nor wanted our three-day vacation to be cut short like this but my parents still insist that I'm responsible for it.

&#x200B;

Edit: for the Redditors saying INFO: The only other time I had used my phone during the vacation was also to listen to music for part of the drive there. In general, my mother dislikes it when I'm on the phone but in this case I genuinely thought it was a harmless question.

Edit 2: for those saying that I could have started the conversation, my mother had no intention of talking. She wanted me to ""hear the sounds of nature"" which I find ridiculous and in fact told me to be quiet two or three times when I said anything.",36,42,0.86

1988,Asshole,"Throwaway just in case.

All this started as a small discussion with my wife and it has morphed into an actual argument.  

About 4 years ago and only a few months into dating my now-wife Diana, I was diagnosed with a pretty advanced cancer. It came as a huge shock to everyone, but Diana never left my side since. She went to all my doctor's appointments, sat with me through 3 months of chemo and took care of me after my 2 major surgeries.

So the day I was diagnosed, I was also admitted to the hospital and then rushed into surgery the next morning. It all happened so quickly. When I had a second, I sent out a text to my closest friends telling them I was in the hospital, the doctors confirmed it was cancer, but that everything was going to be OK. I said I had just had surgery, so I couldn't leave the room to call them, but they could call Diana if they wanted to check in or else text me. Plus I didn't wanna disturb the other guy sharing my room.

One of my best buddies I will call Chris never responded to my text. He actually hasn’t spoken to me or texted me since - completely ghosted me. I tried a few times to call/text, but he never responded. It was very out of the blue for me since Chris and I had been part of the same group of friends for nearly 15 years. At least we knew he was OK though because a mutual friend would occasionally see him.

So fast forward 4 years and I heard from the mutual friend that Chris wants to hang out with the group again but he’s worried it will be awkward since so much time has passed. I assured the mutual friend that it would be great to see Chris and catch up and I want him to meet my wife.

Well Diana says she won’t go and she doesn’t want to meet “the asshole who abandoned his friend when he needed him the most”. I tried to explain to her that Chris was going through a tough time when I got sick and it was not personal. And full disclosure… during a particularly rough week of chemo I had a breakdown and I shared with Diana that I was very hurt by the way Chris stopped talking to me. So now 4 years later, Diana says I can see him all I want, but she refuses to meet him because Chris ghosted me a few years ago and has never said he was sorry or tried to reach out himself. Doesn't help that Chris was the only person to react that way. 

Except none of that bothers me anymore and I am cool to just pretend nothing ever happened and move on. I don’t want to push Diana, but I think she is being childish about it. Am I the asshole for wanting her to get over this? She has never actually met the guy. We fight about it every time I bring it up. I say life is too short to hold grudges and she says life is too short to waste your time with people who have proven themselves to be bad friends.",52,71,0.88
1989,Not the A-hole,"The mother was living with another guy (room mate), just out of a long term relationship. I knew her for all of 2-3 weeks and knew it wasn’t going to work so ended it. She was supposedly on the pill. Got a call, she’s pregnant, and she says it’s mine. I let her know I want a paternity test. Job opportunity is coming up which I take - as I am coordinating to sort this out while away I get an email that says baby momma is scared I’m going to come back home with my good job and take baby. As I’m trying to work through this while away - baby momma ends up closing up shop, moving, changing numbers, off the grid. She didn’t have an email that had her name even, before Facebook and kind of around MySpace. 

Years later (appx 10) get an email that’s “because money” (I never changed my email or phone numbers). As I try to sort this out baby momma is finally good with a paternity test. 100% mine - amazing!! Got a kid I can get to know...no way. Baby momma refutes me putting her on amazing benefits, wants me to pony up cash only. I tell her the judge isn’t going to like that, that i want to get to know the child. Lawyers suck - baby momma doesn’t look great due to “because money - and no contact”.

I try to organize therapy, sessions with child psychiatrist to assist easing me into her life. Baby momma says no. Baby momma wants an ATM machine - and no therapists or professionals to help.

Child now thinks that I didn’t want him/her which isn’t the case at all. The hard part is that the mother did a fantastic job raising the child. The child is athletic, smart, kind, caring, artistic, good values, does well in school. The story needs to be told, I want the child to be a bigger part of our family. I don’t want the child to hate the mother - we all make crappy decisions throughout our lives. 

I was denied the ability to raise the child. I currently look like the uncaring. WIBTA if I gave the child all of the correspondence over the last 16 years with baby momma and let the chips fall where they may? Why should I have to hold on to this for the sake of a mother who denied her child it’s father? Baby momma constantly says she’s open with the child about everything - they talk about adult stuff easy enough-

Edit: baby momma although legally required is not collecting child support from an Ex-husband. In her court paperwork when I asked why she wasn’t she  put in her affidavit that “he didn’t act like a father to (my child)” for the 2-3 years they were married. One of the reasons why I question her motives in what’s best for the child versus what’s convenient for her - if I give the kid all of this paperwork and correspondence he/she might see another side of baby momma.....",54,122,0.94

1991,Not the A-hole,"This literally just happened at a cook out. My friend Lori is a young window. She lost her husband in a freak accident and has 2 young kids. It was devastating. Next week will be 2 years since he passed. Lori is here at the BBQ and one of her husband's former co-workers kindly asked her how she was doing and told her that he misses her husband. As soon as they started talking this fringe friend, Kate, swooped into the conversation. I had the impression that Kate actually wanted the attention of the co-worker guy. She kept trying to tell Lori how ""she knew exactly what she was going through because she got divorced this year"". (Side note, Kate's husband left because she's was caught cheating). Any comment that Lori said, Kate seemed to have to one-up it. For instance- Lori cut all of her hair off after the accident and uses her hair growth as a physical reminder that time and life are moving on. The co-worker guy complimented that Lori ""looks like she's doing well"". And that she ""looked like a real badass when she shaved her head."" Kate chimed in ""after my divorce, the grief was just too much, I had to go blonde. I just needed the change."" I finally said ""Kate, divorce really isn't the same as death. I don't doubt that you've been through tough times. But it's not the same."" She gave me the most affronted look, and then looked at the co-worker guy and rolled her eyes about my comment. Then she immediately walked over the host of the bbq. The host came to me a few minutes later and said that I shouldn't have brought up her divorce because it's ""sensitive information"" and I was extremely rude for attacking Kate like that. I explained the sequence of events, just like I did here, but she says that Kate is really upset.

1992,Not the A-hole,"We both are in our mid-20s and after our 4 years of relationship I decided that I might open up to her and tell her about my fantasies about her sleeping with an another man. So I actually did it. Her reaction was really promising and getting me excited about trying it out. But I clearly discussed with her about our rules like using a condom and not doing it with friends that we both know and also before hooking up with someone to ask me if I would be fine with it. Because I really want to be ready for it when it actually happens. The thing is... that the first experience went fine, I'm not going into detail but it was just as expected and it really did improve our ""sex"" that day. That was also with the second time, it was an emotional rollercoaster but I got through with it and had also my fun with her.

&#x200B;

The problem is the unwanted third time from my side. She was going out in a bar with friends like usual and actually texted me that someone started to flirt with her and was on her way with his car to him. It didn't took long for me to respond with a ""Not this time dear, I'm not really feeling well"". My heart started racing in hope to get a respond from her, but a respond never came within a hour. So I knew that she didn't actually care looking for my respond and just went through it. After hours of waiting that night she messaged me with ""Aww, I forgot to look at the phone because I was really excited. I'm coming home to make you feel better ;)"". This really got me mad and so I called her and told her to come home and pack her stuff and go to an another place. Because I needed to cool of my head and rethink about everything. She just couldn't understand what she did wrong because she already did it two times and thought I would be cool with the third time. I told her that we already had discussed about the rules that were firm including that ""telling me before doing it"" one.

AITA for kicking her out of my apartment for a few days and giving our relationship a break unti I could figure out what to do now ?

&#x200B;

TLDR: My gf and I set a firm rule that she has to tell me before hooking up with a guy and waiting for my ""okay"" before doing it so.

1993,Not the A-hole,"So, in a few months, my husband and I will be giving birth to our first child. I’m super excited and my husband is straight up amazing. I plan on my MiL,  FiL and my own parents and siblings to come visit the newborn in the hospital but I really don’t want my BiL there. 

I feel like such a piece of shit for even thinking this way but we have a little bit of of a past that makes me uncomfortable. He is 35 years old and has been diagnosed with Autism. He is pretty low functioning, he can cook for himself and take care of his basic needs but everything else is provided for him by his parents. When my husband and I first got married a couple of years ago, we had stayed with my in laws for a bit. While I was there, my BiL started writing notes to me telling me he wanted to have sex with me and for me to not tell my husband about it. My husband wasn’t happy but I decided to talk to his parents for my best move forward because I have never really been in this situation before. I really wanted to try to understand where he was coming from. 
My MiL told him to stop and that it wasn’t okay but also told me to just not worry abut it because he’s harmless, wouldn’t hurt me and he doesn’t know the difference between right and wrong. I decided to just let it go because the in laws seemed to know what was best for the situation and I didn’t want to be close minded. 
It didn’t stop there. He started waiting for my husband to walk out of the room, even for five minutes and would come inside into my room while I was alone and sleeping. I would wake up to him staring at me and felt freaked out immediately. My husband and I started taking to him about how it’s def not okay to do these things. Around the fifth time of this happening, my husband got so angry. He started to yell at his brother and it really hurt his feelings. He started to cry and walk out of the house. His mother found him a few miles away and got upset with my husband and I about being angry about the situation. She once again stated that he doesn’t know any better and he doesn’t realize what he was doing was not okay and that he sometimes forgets that we have boundaries too. 

We then moved into our own place. Now that we aren’t that far away from me giving birth, I want to ask if it would be okay to not bring my BiL to the hospital even after the baby is born. I don’t plan on keeping him away forever, I just want those first few days to be as stress free as possible as I will be going through a lot physically and emotionally. Also, my breasts will be out quite often to feed the little one. 
I told my parents who don’t think I’m being fair since it will be his nephew and that I shouldn’t ask him to not come. I also know that my in laws won’t be happy about this either, I’m afraid to even bring it up around my husband because I do feel like I am being a huge asshole.

1994,Not the A-hole,"My girlfriend and I (both college-age) have been together for two years. During that time, she’s been addicted on and off to prescription (but not her own Rx) adderall. For a long time I didn’t know about it, but after about a year of dating she started trying to pressure me to use it.  

About 9 months ago, we had a long talk where she broke down crying and said that she knows she has a problem and needs help. I told her I would be there to support her through this and I thought that was the end of it. 

3 weeks ago, I found out that not only had she been using it all along, she also bought $200 worth (about one entire bottle full) the day prior. I offered to help her through it one last time and so she gave me the bottle to ration it out to her since she’s a pre-PA student and was studying for the GRE (pre-PA school exam) so I figured that at this point it wasn’t a good time to battle the addiction since the adderall helps her study and she has a life-changing exam to prepare for. I reluctantly agreed and began to ration it to her in small doses (10-20mg per day).

2 weeks ago, we went on a small vacation and I found her rummaging through my bag looking for the bottle. She had the bottle in her hand and claimed to be “counting” to make sure none had gone missing. I took the bottle, which at this point was about half full, and ignored the incident. I later found out that she had stolen several of the pills at that time. 

Then, one week ago, she convinced me to give her the rest of the bottle, which I foolishly agreed to because she is an adult and can make her own choices. 

Yesterday, she told me that she had taken the entire bottle (several weeks’ worth) in the span of 2-3 days and even stolen some of my own supply that I am prescribed. This led to her apologizing profusely and swearing to stop taking them altogether starting immediately. 

Today, she has been begging me to “allow” her to buy more.  I told her that it has been less than 24 hours since she adamantly swore it off for the third time and if she buys more, it will be the last straw and I do not want to see her anymore. She has a track record of proving that she cannot be trusted to her word (more than just the drugs) and will sneak around behind my back, only feeling remorse when I catch her. 

Important: she spends 30%-40% of her income on this, has terrible side effects at all times, and misuses it 90% of the time. She will take 60-70mg a day to sit around and not study at all for her test. 

I feel bad for using an ultimatum, but I feel it has gone too far and this is my last option.

1995,Not the A-hole,"To make a long story short, my mother (and sister to be honest) have always told me that if I chose to marry someone who wasn't from the same religion as us, they wouldn't attend. This came from multiple times of me dating girls outside our religion since I'm not religious/observant at all. 

I always felt quite betrayed and hurt by that. To think my own mother would put her religion before me, while always harping on about how important family is quite shocked me, and I was quite hurt by it.

Fast forward to today, and my girlfriend happens to be from the same religious background as me. So theoretically, my mother would be delighted if we got married. If we do get married, I don't plan on inviting my mother. The way I see it, she promised to turn her back on me if I didn't do what she wanted, so I have no room for someone like that at my wedding. 

I can see how some would all it a petty and a bit of a dick thing to do, but it was an incredibly hurtful thing for her to say for me. I had discussions over the years with her about it and she remained adamant about it even knowing how upset I was.",33,136,0.92
1996,Not the A-hole,"I get my apartment cleaned about once a month by a cleaning company. It’s always a different housekeeper, though they normally do a consistent job. When booking them, they have two hour time slots for the cleaning with a one hour window for arrival. This time around I booked my appointment for 3PM. I work from home so I’m always around when they show up and while the clean. 

I jumped in the shower around 1PM and about five minutes later I heard the doorbell. Assuming it was just a delivery I didn’t think much of it. I hear it again about a minute later and finished up my shower to see what was going on. By the time I got dressed, whoever was at the door was ringing it incessantly. Barely dressed I opened the door to find the housekeeper. I told her that I thought she was scheduled for 3PM to which she said her 1PM appointment had just cancelled so she came here.

So here’s the thing. I don’t like to leave my apartment alone with anyone I don’t know in it, I had been planning on using this time as a lunch break (I hadn’t eaten anything up until that point). I’m also not going to cook in the kitchen while someone is there trying to clean it either. So I told her that because our appointment was for 3PM to come back then. She told me that she was already here so I should just let her clean now, to which I asked her “what would you have done if I hadn’t been home to answer the door?” to which she didn’t really have a response. She told me that this was going to mess with her schedule for the rest of the day, to which I said the same. At this point I realized I could just let her clean and go get lunch afterwards, but I was upset about the principle of the matter and apparently this is the hill I was willing to die on. I told her I was going to lunch and that she could come back when the appointment was scheduled for. She again reiterated that I should just let her in and I could go get lunch while she cleaned and I told her that I’m not comfortable having someone I don’t know in my home while I’m not present, and again started that this wasn’t our scheduled time. She was visibly pissed. 

When I returned from lunch, I saw her sitting in her car, which she did until right after 3 when she came inside to clean. I tried to apologize, but if i’m being honest it wasn’t really an apology. I still stood by the fact that we made an appointment and the company should respect that. She didn’t say much, but did give me some angry looks. She ended up doing a very subpar job, which may or may not have had anything to do with our argument.

I work in a small office. I have several coworkers but only one I have a problem with. Let’s call her Karen. 

Now due to the way our job is, there is only ever one of us in the office at any given time. Our shifts are broken down into segments. We take calls and dispatch employees to handle incidents on our clients properties. We also write emails and logs to keep track of everything happening.

Day (easiest)
Swing (difficult)
Grave (difficult)

I work the grave shift and Karen works the day shift.

Now because she’s been at the company longer,  she has been given an honorary title / rank that makes her believe that she is a superior to anyone with a lower “rank.” She believes that her work is as difficult as mine and that she is better at it than I. Okay that might be fair under normal conditions, seeing as she’s been there longer than me. 

But she’s borderline illiterate... if not for Microsoft Word spellchecking her, her sentences would be toddler level.
She cannot spell or form sentences, but can speak on the phone just fine. But these broken sentences and terrible grammar get sent out to our clients if she sends it out during her shift. 

Truthfully I could let it all go, but she constantly tries to correct me on my work. So in the back of my head I’m obviously like This mf can’t even spell and she’s trying to be a “supervisor to me” when her honorary title is completely superficial, and means nothing in terms of pay. I work a harder shift than her, output much more work, and actually try to present our company in coherent light to clients.

I’ve already spoken to a supervisor about this and he said that several employees have complained but that it’s a toxic mindset and that we’re shaming her education level..

I was very wrong. Instead of keeping the pageant name “Mr.(school name)” they renamed it to “Next Top Wolf” (our mascot) in order to be more gender inclusive. This already pissed people off.

Only 30 people showed up to the event, that’s extremely low considering we are a 4A high school with 2400 kids. During the formal wear portion, nobody clapped for me. I got a few boos.
