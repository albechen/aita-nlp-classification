1,Not the A-hole,"Sorry for mistakes, I’m on mobile. Feel free to correct any. 

Ok so in short, I was on a 10 hour flight from Tokyo to Vancouver in economy class, I’m a average sized 5’9” 14 year old  so I generally don’t take up a lot of space but it was a 10 hour flight and I just wanted to get some sleep.

As soon as the flight took off and the seat belt sign was switched off I reclined my seat back as everyone else was doing but as soon as I do, the guy behind kicked he seat! I immediately thought this guy tall ass man and needed some leg room so I recline forward. As dinner came, I reclined forward so I can enjoy my lasagna but when I’m done I recline back and he kicks again!

As the flight continues there is the occasional thump which was annoying and woke me up several times but I’m extremely shy and introverted so I let it go. 

Whenever I get up to use the restroom this dude gave me the filthiest looks, almost as if I’m causing him extreme pain but then I notice, he doesn’t have his seat reclined at all and has his legs are together and pushed up against the seat he so he was almost giving himself no legroom! He could have just spread his les wider so they wouldn’t be touching the seat! 

One time when I went to the bathroom, he somehow managed to get my seat back to its original position and for about 2 hours his legs were crossed so I couldn’t recline it even a centimetre. I eventually got it back when he left. 

When the flight landed I realized I was almost the same height as this guy so I guess he didn’t need that legroom after all. 

Any Reddit, AITA?

Just a note: I was not being obnoxious and had my seat back all the way, probably 30% of the way. 


Edit: the default position on these seats was almost a 90 degree angle. It is unrealistic to expect I would sit through a 10 hour flight like that. ",91,50,0.79
2,Not the A-hole,"No, I am not an anti vaxxer. I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.

I discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his ""anti vaxxer sister"" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. 

I asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?",828,8579,0.95
3,Asshole,"One of my best friends from child hood, we'll call hime Jake, is having a baby with his fiance.  My friend is biracial (half black half white) but he was entirely raised by his white mom and white step dad. His girlfriend is black, but again she's not Nigerian or from Africa. I am white.  I mean no offence to my friend but he grew up around mostly white people and it was only in college when he went through this phase where he started to really try and be more ""black"" and hang around black people more and behave more about what people ""perceive"" black people should act like and I kinda think some part of it was an act but whatever. Another note is that his fiance isn't really a huge fan of me and apparently when she first met me she got the impression I was racist. I don't really know why but that kinda soured our relationship but we're friendly and cordial to each other.

&#x200B;

So when I was hanging out with Jake few days ago, he was trying to order monogrammed pillows or something cheesy like that and then revealed that they were naming their daughter Morayo which is a Nigerian name apparently. He kept gushing over the name and I personally just thought it was weird to name your kid a name from a country you know literally nothing about. So I asked ""are you sure you want to give your kid a Nigerian name. I mean you guys aren't Nigerian."" He seemed offended and said. ""Yeah but we're black and we have roots from Nigeria anyway.""

So I probably should have let it go but then I said in a mostly joking manner. ""So if I took a DNA test and found out I'm like 1% African should I give my kid a Nigerian name?""

Jake got mad and cursed at me a few times and said that tons of ""black"" names are african or arabic  and that I should ""mind my own white business"" and I had no idea what I was talking about.

He did change the subject after that but I can tell it bothered him. Shortly after his fiance publicly revealed the name on social media and people started gushing about it and his girlfriend made a comment on Facebook about how she was glad they liked it and ""some of Jake's friends thought it was too African lol"" She knows I follow her and obviously posted that for me to see it.

AITA here? I'm conflicted. Like I didn't think it was a big enough deal for Jake to go rat on me to his GF (who he KNOWS doesn't really like me). But maybe I was out of line to criticize the name choice.

4,Not the A-hole,"I have a co-worker at my workplace who I would consider to be friends with, we sometimes hang out after work or do stuff on the weekends. Usually when I try to make plans with him I always get the typical ""sure, I don't have any plans yet but I can't if I am spontaneously going out"" which in 80% of all cases means that he won't have time since he would rather hang out with other people (notifiying me half an hour before we were planned to meet), making me sort of feel like the second choice he has to do something with when all his other plans get cancelled.

I don't know how many times I was stood up waiting for him just to get a text half an hour before telling me that he won't come.

Today, he asked me if I wanted to go out to eat something, but I was already invited by my family for dinner. So I told him I can't come.
As a result to this, he got a bit mad and said that I should cancel since I can have dinner with my family any other day as well.
I refused, saying that they invited me weeks ago unlike him (2 hours before he wanted to go out) and if he wanted to reschedule.

It never got to the reschedule part since he was so mad at me for being so unspontaneous, that I did not get another answer.

I feel like it's just fair that I refuse to cancel my plans with my family, simply because his plans were cancelled and was spontaneously looking for something else to do.
Especially since he refuses to make set plans with me any time I ask.

So, AITA for refusing to cancel my plans to meet his schedule?",29,37,0.92
5,Asshole,"  

My family are Brahmins. We believe that violence towards animals is wrong. My children and I live in a Western country for three years, my husband for longer. The children attend public school.

Friday, I receive a letter from my daughter’s kindergarten teacher about my daughter’s behavior at canteen.

&#x200B;

According to teacher, my child tells on what her batchmates eat for lunch. She tells them that meat is flesh and it is unkind to hurt animals. Some of the children are quite affected and refuses to eat their lunches. 

&#x200B;

The parents are unhappy. The teacher asks us to silence our daughter from making these beliefs to children.

The teacher is too good and not a bad person. However the issue is eating my brain.

6,Not the A-hole,"My husband goes out for happy hour with his coworkers every Wednesday. He usually gets a little buzzed and usually I don't mind. However, I am now nearing my due date and have asked that he come straight home after work for the next 3 weeks just in case the baby comes early. Its also getting harder and harder for me to get things done on my own, so having him home in the evening when the older kids are also home would be really helpful to me.

My husband insists that since our first 2 came right on time, it's not a big deal for him to go out to happy hour to unwind. He wants to compromise by not drinking the week of my due date, but I know if the baby comes early and he's not 100% sober I will be so stressed going into labor. On top of that, I'm not asking him to never go again, just that he spend the next 3 weeks available and sober in case something happens. AITA for this?",40,156,0.95
7,Asshole,"I’m a server in a sports bar/restaurant. Now when I come up to a table of mine that recently closed out, if I noticed they left something behind on the table like their sunglasses or their wallet, I always check the tip first before deciding what to do.

9,Not the A-hole,"Obvious throwaway because I have friends who know my personal account.

&#x200B;

So I've known my wife for 9 years, we dated for 5, and we've been married for just under 6 months.  She comes from an insanely toxic family, she was emancipated at 16 and to this day refuses to speak to any of her family. They are all addicted to meth and her sister to meth + anything she can get her hands on. Her sister has 3 kids, ages 9 months (F), 6 years (M), and 13 years (F). My wife began taking care of these children when the first was born when she was only 7 years old because no one else would. For whatever reason CPS never took the kids away despite near constant monitoring and the last my wife knew of these kids was 3 years ago when she permanently cut her family off. 

&#x200B;

Her parents always assumed she would adopt any children her sister produced (this actually was the beginning of the rift that led to her cutting her parents off) and were never shy about it. When we started dating (She was 15, I was 17) I told her that if she adopted those kids then the relationship wouldn't work out because if I am having kids they are going to need to be my own **(EDIT: My mind was going at a million miles per hour when I typed this. This is not an all-encompassing statement. When I typed it I was focused on my current situation. I would not be opposed to marrying someone with kids already, I just expected to never raise these children and I do not want to.)** . She agreed and said she had no desire to ever adopt those kids. 

  
I just deleted like 5 paragraphs worth of useless details because I'm just ranting. I will just get to the point, so out of the blue last week she tells me that she feels guilty about leaving the children behind and she is planning on reaching out to her sister to formally adopt them.  I told her hell no, I made it clear very early on that I do not want to raise those kids. She told me that she assumed I would ""grow out of it"" and accept them. We argued and have been arguing over and over for days now about her decision. She has since reached out to her sister and has started the process of adopting the children. The oldest girl is pregnant, the middle child is a decent kid, and the youngest one only got out of prenatal ICU 5 months ago due to the mother's incessant abuse of drugs during pregnancy.   I am 22, she is 20. I think even if I wanted to adopt these kids I would still want to say no due to our age and financial situation (She works at a make up store, I work at a grocery store for fucks sake)

&#x200B;

I haven't straight up told her that I am planning on leaving yet but I've already told my parents that if she doesn't stop then that is my plan.  Am I the asshole here?

10,Not the A-hole,"It’s important to note that I already have 2 cats and live in a small one bedroom apartment.

So my girlfriend found a cat in the dumpster at her work a couple days ago. She always has cat food in her car ever since she saw a homeless cat in her neighborhood while driving. So, she leads the cat in her car with the food, gets it to her house and sets it up with food and water.

She starts sending me picture after picture, this cat, she thinks is a boy, is actually really nice, rubbing up to her, butting his head against her, and is really calm. They go to the vet and the little guy isn’t microchipped. I say they can go to a local animal shelter, which we both can vouch for (it’s a no-kill, very good turn around kind of place, it’s actually really really cool of a place), but she’s worried about who might adopt him. 

Now a day ago she texts me and says her mom has a proposition for me. They will pay for everything (equipment, vet visits, food, etc.) if I keep the cat. My girlfriend (who lives with her parents) says she’ll stay over to help introduce to my own cats, and other stuff. Her mom thinks they were meant to find this cat and they really love the cat but can’t keep it because they have dogs and also a cat, and apparently it would make her dad go ballistic. 

Now I don’t want another cat. The second one I got reluctantly, which of course turned out good in the end, but this time I did not want another one. She might be here for a week or two to help, but after that it’s on me (she otherwise only visits after work for a couple of hours or sleeps over on the weekends on occasion).

So I text her.

Me: So listen, I really don’t want to hurt you or your mom’s feelings but I really don’t think 🤔 want another cat right now

Her: Okay.

Me: I’m sorry

Her: I posted about him. (She posted a nice Facebook post about the cat and asking anyone if they wanted him because they had no other options (even though there’s still that shelter).)

Me: Yep, I see it. Looks good 👍

Her: Okay.

It’s been awhile and she hasn’t texted me back, even when I asked if they considered that shelter, so I assume she’s mad at me for not taking the cat.

It just seems to me like she’s acting a little childish that she couldn’t keep the pet she found. I know it’s sad, but it happens all the time and there is worse places for the cat to go, again, this shelter is amazing and I have no doubt he’d be adopted in a week with his personality. But I digress. Reddit, AITA?

Edit: Girlfriend said that they are taking him to the shelter I wrote about. Still seems peeved about it. ",35,85,0.89

15,Not the A-hole,"Early in our relationship she made comments like “wow, he’s good looking/attractive” when she saw a random guy she found attractive on the street in front of me. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to find other people attractive, but if I’m honest, it feels disrespectful to say it to me/in front of me? I find other women attractive, but I don’t advertise it to her. What good does that do? I told her I didn’t like that she would just blurt that out in front of me and she agreed not to do it again, but we agreed it’s normal to think others are attractive. Fast forward about 2 months and she continues making similar comments while we were having dinner at a restaurant. I got annoyed with her and didn’t say much after because I don’t feel like saying anything when I get upset. She asked me what the problem was and I told her it annoys me when she does this. She got defensive and said she was joking, and when I asked her if she forgot that she agreed not to do that or if she just didn’t care about it she said I was overreacting and that she was making a joke. I really don’t understand how that’s a joke though? I have trouble trusting her because of this to be honest.

I get that I’m being insecure, I accept that, and I should work on that. But was I an asshole here? Have you had a similar situation in your relationship? What do you think? Should partners just tell each other they are attracted to random strangers on the street? Am I being unreasonable for thinking she might cheat on me because of this? (I didn’t say that to her btw)

She really doesn't like me gaming or having a lan party, but I guess that is because she doesn't like gaming overall. So everything was fine and all that, the lan party was fun as always, but today when I came back home to my gf, she was upset because she had  been alone the whole day (I came home at 5pm), and she was going to leave to visit her parents.

19,Asshole,"Throwaway because I don't want this connected with my main account.

So, a few days ago me and girlfriend got into an argument because I told her she had a s\*\*\*\*y attitude.  I know this sounds bad, here's what happened.

My girlfriend is an avid gamer, but not very tech savvy.  One of her games had an update and restarted all her settings, and she couldn't figure out how to set them back to how she likes.  Here is how the conversation went (that I can remember)

Me:  Do you want me to help?

Her: No, I want to figure it out so if it happens again I know how to fix it, I'll ask if I can't figure it out though.

Me: Ok.  

I knew eventually she was going to ask, because, again, she is not tech savvy, at all.  So, I googled the problem, and it turned out to be a super easy fix.  I watched her try to fix this, getting more and more frustrated, and after about 20 minutes I asked her again if she needed help.  She just kind of huffed and shook her head and said she wanted to figure it out.  This went on for another hour and a half.  Eventually, she does ask me for help (""\*sigh\* Hey, I can't figure this out, can you help?""), and I JOKINGLY tell her ""you don't need to have such a s\*\*\*\*y attitude about it"".  She went from 0-100 instantly and said ""What the f\*\*\*?  You know what, I don't want your help, I will figure it out.

Firstly, she doesn’t really make an effort with her sons birthdays any other time apart from getting the family round for a meal, so it strikes me as the only reason she is wanting this fuss is because she knows there is essentially a free party for him which happens to be our wedding!

However I do see her reasoning in that our wedding happened to be on his birthday (we completely forgot this when booking the wedding) and it does need to be recognised one way or another

  I have two kids of my own and I love them to death, but I’ve never been a “kid person.” My kids are not the perfect package either, but he accepted them and treated them as if they were his own. He was amazing with them.

I would have left him immediately if he said he didn’t like my kids, because I would want what’s best for my own kids and not just stick it out for selfish reasons. I have no idea how he justified staying with me after the multiple conversations.

27,Not the A-hole,"Hi guys!

To give some backstory, I’ve been best friends with the same person since we were children. We always supported each other through our own hardships and emotional struggles throughout school, but after some serious outbursts she moved away for a few months. After returning (the month after we graduated high school) she was a totally different person. She was very self-centered and narcissistic. I maintained the friendship hoping that she would become her old self with age.

A side story, I was abused by my high school boyfriend. It took me over a year to come to terms with and begin talking about. My “best friend” was the first person I told. She acted sympathetic and helped me through it a lot. I felt like my old friend was back and began hanging out with her more frequently. Then I found out she was in a relationship with my abuser. This relationship began after I told her about the abuse. I was devastated but couldn’t let go of my childhood friend for whatever reason. I distanced myself from her because I was afraid he was using her to get information about me, and he would frequently drive by my house when I wasn’t home.

They broke up, and she met her current fiancé. She has barely spoken to me other than to ask me for favors (food and driving her places) and just recently asked me to be her maid of honor. I don’t know why, but I just broke down. I cried for hours, and my other friends encouraged me to remove her from my life. I listened to their advice and declined her offer and blocked her on all social platforms.

I’m now starting to question my decision. It has been over a year since she broke up with my ex boyfriend/abuser, and I feel like my random block was unwarranted now. AITA???",16,86,0.93

Work all day with her and then be home all night with her.  It seems like a recipe for disaster.  She hasn’t had much luck in her job search so far though.  ,23,25,0.95

31,Not the A-hole,"A couple that live on my street have a dog that is an escape artist. A female staffy cross something that has severe anxiety issues. Friday morning their dog escaped again and ended up getting into my house while I was at work and my wife was at home. She calls the neighbours who ask if she can keep the dog in our house while they're at work and she agrees, fair enough this has happened before. 

My wife goes to work and I get home Friday night ready to go out only to find this annoying, anxious dog in my home. I'm waiting for them to pick up their dog and I expected them to come by before dinner. We have a huge thunderstorm and the dog goes berserk. They no show to pick up their own dog so I call my wife and she calls the neighbours.turns out its their wedding on Saturday (today) and they're so busy that they can't get around to picking up their dog, but they will on Saturday morning. Friday night ruined.

Fast forward until Saturday night and the dog is still here. They are too busy to pick up their dog due to their wedding. I'm pissed off, this dog is literally the worst dog in the world and I've lost my weekend as I can't leave it inside alone (it scratches the doors and walls trying to get out if left alone) and it will just crawl under my fence if we leave it outside. 

AITA for not wanting to look after this dog for these guys (I don't even know their names), or are we being used?",25,36,0.89
32,Asshole,"The title pretty much says it all. I've started going to the gym semi- regularly and doing some fitness classes, like spinning and full body workout things. During a spinning class, the instructor came up to me and, without asking me, put his hand on my back to correct my posture. I immediately shook his hand off and told him ""Please, no touching. Thanks."" He looked irritated but left me alone. He never came to my bike again during the session. In a different class, a female instructor pushed my legs up during crunches, when I physically couldn't pull them up further. I simply let my legs fall and waved a hand to signal ""leave me alone."" Every time I do this, the trainers look so defeated and almost sad. I get that their job is to make sure everybody gets the most out of the training, but I really dislike being touched by strangers, and even more so when I am sweaty and feel somewhat vulnerable.

Still I can't help feeling that I'm being childish, since nobody else seems to mind the trainers correcting them. So AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT: So, I've read through all the comments. Although there seem to be some people who think I'm an asshole for not wanting to be touched, I gathered that most people think I should communicate better and that the way I handled the situation is what makes me the asshole. So thanks everyone, I will let the trainers know beforehand to only correct me verbally. Also, to the people who said I should just not go to these classes and that I ""have to get over myself"", I strongly disagree. I think if I pay for the gym and for these classes, then I have just as much right to be there, even if I have this one issue. ",99,210,0.93

35,Not the A-hole,"I live pretty far from the rest of my family.  For the last three years I save up and take my sisters on a vacation.  My youngest sis and I are very close.  My middle sister not so much.  The relationship between the two of them is sometimes outright hostile.  

I’ve included her the last three times more out of obligation than anything else.  The reason I want to leave her out of this one is because she outright ruined the last.  She insisted on bringing her young daughter.  If me and my other sister did anything that a young child couldn’t be included in she would throw a hissy fit.  She kept starting fights with my other sister.  One of the nights she was letting her daughter be so freaking loud that the people next to us complained and hotel staff came to our room and asked us to quiet down.  Then she loudly said, “jokes on them, he didn’t even care”.  I’m pretty sure he wouldn’t have come to our room if he didn’t care.     Whenever her and my other sister would fight she kept threatening to leave early.  I just kept my mouth shut internally hoping she really would.  

These vacations aren’t cheap.  This is the one big fun thing I get to do all year.  There’s just always some drama or hassle with her.  I know it would probably hurt her feeling or piss her off or both, but I want to be able to actually enjoy the vacation this year.  ",40,270,0.96
36,Not the A-hole,"Let's start this off with a bit of backstory. I don't want mom or my brother to find this.

&#x200B;

My girlfriend and I( both 19) have known eachother for 9 years and been together romantically for 5 of them, we love each other. We fight and make fun of each other but we're in love. My mother however, dislikes my girlfriend and has made no attempt since we were ten and first met to try and make a relationship. She wanted me to have nothing to do with her and saw her as a rowdy delinquent and not a good influence on me. My girlfriend will tell you herself that she was terrible person as a kid but she's grown up a lot since then, we both have.

We mutually decided that we would wait until after university for marriage and kids and used condoms plus pulling out. But like everyone says it only takes one time and my girlfriend is pregnant after one night without a condom. My mom found out from my brother after he let accidentally let it slip. We were gonna tell her after we returned home from a summer long visit to my grandparents on my late father's side in California (found out in August 2018)  but I told my brother beforehand for advice on what to tell her and he somehow let it slip to her. So we returned early from the trip and well mom flipped her shit and yelled at us for being reckless (we expected as much) when we got in the car then asked us what were our plans. We told her we were gonna keep it and she told us we need to to think about it more before deciding what to do it. My girlfriend told her we had spent two weeks thinking about since we found out and decided to keep the baby. Mom told us we were making a mistake and we'd regret it and the rest of the ride was tense and silence after that. Me and my girlfriend moved into our own place (with help from our grandparents) and my mom and I didn't talk the whole pregnancy.

Last week, we welcomed our son into the world and a made a post on Facebook about it only to get a call from my mother consisting mostly of her tearing me a new one for not 'making her get an abortion' (exact words)  and trying to convince me to 'run while he can't remember me'. I told her to fuck off and hung up in her face. Yesterday she called and and apologized and asked when she could see her grandson. I asked if my brother also had a son I didn't know about and told her that as far as I was concerned, she gave up the right to be in his life when she told me to run and that she would NEVER see him until I say so. She started to cry and hung up.

My brother messaged me and told me I was 'too harsh' and 'she was just trying to look out for me' and that I should apologize and let her see him now that she's changed her tune. My mother's parents are also pissed at me for this but my girlfriend is on my side. I'm starting to wonder if we were too harsh on her and was she really trying to look after me?

Edit: To address some things that came up regarding Grandparents' rights, this is my state's law regarding it:
You have a very strong relationship with your grandchild and you see him or her routinely - a few times a year is probably not enough;

You have not been seeing your grandchild but you have tried very hard to see him or her; or,

At least one of the child’s parents has died.

Edit 2: While I didn't respond to every judgement,  I made a point read them all (Well most of them). Thank you guys for all the advice. We'll spend the next few weeks with our son and decide whether or not my mother should be in his life and what would be best. We'll be meeting with her without our son after we've thought about and explain our decision. Also, to those who suggested birth control, my girlfriend said she'd look into it more and avoid her cousin's medical advice.

37,Not the A-hole,"My SO went out last night and specifically told me she wasn't going to drink. She came home way later than she ballparked before leaving, I'm understanding of that.  Turns out she got hammered and now is having a very rough morning and wants me to leave work to come home. A little back story is she lost her job recently because she took klonopin and whiskey before work and couldn't finish her shift so never went back. This causes me to have to work every weekend until she finds something else. I haven't had a day off in 3 months. When she asked me to come home I told her I couldn't leave right now. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for not being willing to help her since my view is this is her problem not mine. She knows I don't like when she drinks especially since she willingly stopped taking her bipolar medicine and got mad when I was "" in her business"" about her medication. 


Thank you for everyone's advice and views so I could see the whole picture. I was convinced by some in the thread to get home from work and give her emotional support. I did use the time to address my concerns that apparently I should have spoken up about earlier (which made me TA for just letting her be) she did not like what I had to say about how her actions effected me. She does agree she needs help and is suicidal and been using booze to medicate herself. Marriage is tricky but I hope this is the path to straight and narrow. So I guess to sum it up I was TA for constantly letting this slide and then getting upset about it. I appreciate all the recommendations for bipolar groups. ",131,1142,0.94

39,Not the A-hole,"I dated my ex for 3 years and ended up finding out she was cheating for about half of that time. I broke up with her about 4 months ago and she moved out of my house. I ended up hearing from friends that she was painting me as the bad guy who drove her into the beds of all those guys she cheated with. No one believed her and she ended up isolating herself from the friend group because people really didn’t like the way she handled things as far as cheating and with the break up.

Her parents recently were killed in a bad car accident. It’s a shame, they were very good people. I enjoyed the time I spent around them and they treated me well. They died about 5 days ago. 

My friends have been telling me over the past few days that she was asking about me and saying she wishes she could be with me and talk to me about the loss and apologize. 

I don’t buy the bullshit. This isn’t about her being sincerely remorseful about anything. This is her wanting to manipulate me into emotionally supporting her through this. Her parents dying sucks and I’m sure that’s awful to deal with, but it is firmly her problem, not mine. 

I told my friends this and they said they’d soften it but make sure she knows I’m not the one she should be calling or coming to.

She came over to my house early this morning a mess and crying and apologizing and begging at my doorstep. I thought about what I’d say but everything was going to be needlessly cruel so I just shut the door and she screamed so loud and for so long my neighbors called the police.

I didn’t get in trouble or anything but it was embarrassing and I had to deal with explaining things to them(it sure was fun explaining the context of her saying her parents were dead and crying on my doorstep). 

My standing on this is pretty much that it sucks for her and more for her parents. But this isn’t my job anymore—to deal with supporting her through anything.",1312,9834,0.95

  I'm gay and have known my husband for 4 years, been married for 8 months. I'm also a nurse. On my way home I was feeling adventurous so I decided to pop in at my in-laws' to say hello. My sister-in-law and her husband was also there. They invited me in, we were talking and somehow avoided any conflict (they loathe me and think I turned their son gay, but I tolerated it because I don't have any family of my own).


  The topic of mass shootings and the Orlando shooting came up and I said it's a pity I couldn't donate blood considering I was in the area and have blood type O-, meaning anyone can receive blood from me. I don't know what went through her head but my SIL said it's for the best and that you never know what's in my blood. I informed her I've been tested multiple times and STDs don't appear out of thin air to which she replied ""You probably have AIDS but you don't know it"". 


  When she said that I completely let go and laid into her about everything including how she's in denial about her brother's sexuality, how she sleeps around more than I ever did, and how if she wasn't a high school dropout maybe she'd know then how STDs spread. This led to a HUGE fight between her and her husband and I while her parents just sat there watching. I got up to leave and said I want nothing to do with them and that I was surprised my husband even talks to them at all. 


 And worst part is after I told my husband about this he still chose to defend them. I'm beyond mad at this point, I told him they literally don't acknowledge he's married and yet he still wants to have a relationship with them.

My wife and I have been married for 10 years, dated for 6 before that, have 2 kids together. No marital issues (the occasional fight, but nothing drastic). I had a vasectomy 5 years ago and have had no complications.

&#x200B;

Here's the rub: she has been getting UTIs (Urine Tract Infections) for the past 3 years, and it only happens after we have sex. We do the deed, and for the next 2\~3 days she's in pain, hobbling around the house like a 100-year-old woman and running to the bathroom every 30 minutes. We seen doctors, specialists, she's taken antibiotics, probiotics, supplements, we've both changed our diet completely to account for mineral and other factors, but it keeps happening. If we don't have sex, she's as healthy as a horse. One night of love-making and she's making zombie sounds.

&#x200B;

And I feel like crap. I'm totally fine, health wise, but I have to see the woman I love on the verge of tears for half a week after sex. So I began to withdraw. I told her exactly what I was feeling and why, and she says ""don't worry, it's my problem, I'll deal with it."" But I can't ignore it. For the past year and a bit I've been making excuses as to why I can't have sex anymore (too tired, early start at work tomorrow, etc).

&#x200B;

It's getting to the point where she almost drags me to bed in lingerie, and when I refuse, we argue for an hour why I'm denying her sex. My point has never changed: As much as I would love to, I don't want to do something to her that will result in her being in pain. She says not to worry about it, but it's damn hard to ignore when she's groaning in pain next to me for a few nights, and I know for a fact that i'm at fault (biologically at least).

&#x200B;

My wife says I'm selfish and cold-hearted for doing what I'm doing, but from where I sit, it's either hurt her feelings or feel guilty myself knowing I'm (in some way) the cause of her pain.

42,Asshole,"\-- TL/DR below; apologies for any spelling / grammatical errors --

This happened a couple of weeks ago. It was a Monday and there was going to be a family birthday party on Friday. My aunt (lets call her Carol) asked me if my sister and I were going to drive to said party separated from our parents, we sometimes do that in order to be able to leave earlier. Carol and her 2 kids would then come along because she lives close to our place.

Anyway, I told her I'd ask my sister and come back to her. Later that day I asked and my sister said she would.

Well, I forgot to tell Carol. I then had a very stressful week, I had a lot of stuff in my head to think about that this just got lost. Skip ahead to Friday my family and I decide to get going. Sister is still planning to drive separately which I try to talk her out of to save money but she is insisted so I decide to drive with my parents for the sake of my mood and the relationship to my sister.

When we arrive everyone but my sister was already there. I get to Carol and go in for a hug. While hugging she asks me where my sister is, I tell her she drove separately and then it hit me. I apologize for forgetting about it and she's pretty cool about it. She (kind of jokingly) says that I can drive her and her kids home so that she can get a drink. I didn't say anything to that but it wouldn't be a problem for me, wasn't going to get drunk that night anyway. Later on Carol comes over and asks again. I say yes.

The whole party then was pretty boring for me and I was kind of jealous of my sister but I accepted my fate.

When we got going Carols kids were exhausted so I was eager to get home quickly. I was going over the speed limit where there was one on the Autobahn but never more than 20 km/h (12.4 mph) faster because thats kind of the limit where you get away with a fine and no bigger consequences. The fact that I never got a speeding ticket before and the lack of speed traps on this route gave me a false sense of security and then it happened. I saw a bright red flash and we all knew what was coming. My mood? Ruined. My aunt didn't say anything.

3 days ago the ticket arrived. It's a fine of 40€ ($45). My aunt came over and told me and then asked how I wanted to pay her. I asked her to split it since it was kind of a favor that I drove her and her kids home so that she wouldn't have to. Additionally my job doesn't pay too well and I'm always kind of short on money. I offered her 20€ on the spot but she told me that I should pay all of it since I was driving. I don't agree with that. She and her husband both work full time and earn enough money, she should pay part of the ticket. Asshole thinking?

TL/DR: My aunt gets a speeding ticket because of me taking her and her kids home in her car and asks me to pay the whole amount. I disagree and ask her to split it half and half. AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: Alright guys, thanks for making me realize my mistake. I drove to my aunts place today and gave her the money. We talked a little and there are no hard feelings which I'm thankful for. I learned my lesson :)",38,34,0.87

45,Not the A-hole,"My friends enjoy home hangouts. Every other weekend we would pick a location, typically my apartment or Liz’s (my close friend) apartment, and we'd all bring stuff for group entertainment. Being good friends, everyone brings food or drinks to share. Sometimes I would bring some nice alcohol or a meal, sometimes only chips and juice if that was what I could afford. Similar situation for other friends: sometimes they bring pizza, sometimes only a board game. No one was ever be called out for not bringing something. We're all college students so we totally understand that money can be tight. No big deal.

Anyway, this night, Liz was hosting. I texted her asking if there was anything in particular I should bring. She replies saying that a friend I did not know would be bringing food for us. Cool. I opted to bring drinks and some video games. Note: This friend had been to previous group gatherings, I just didn’t attend those.

When I arrive, the new friend is not there yet. There are only desserts available. The friend, Mary, showed up about 15 mins later with those super long Port of Subs sandwiches cut into about a dozen pieces. Mary places it on the table and most of the group goes to get piece. I don't because I was in conversation with Liz at the time. Our conversation ends and Liz reminds me to go get some of the sandwich because we'll be playing games soon. I notice the sandwich has some stuff I don't eat but this free food at a group gathering, so obviously I'm not about to complain. Also, I'm pretty hungry at this point. I picked off what I didn’t like and ate the rest.  

As the night winds down and people are talking about going home soon, Mary announces that anyone who ate a piece of the sandwich needs to venmo her $4.23. She says she did the calculations, that's the cost, and that she's sorry but she's on a college budget. I'm super annoyed because she waited until AFTER we all ate to put a price tag on it and like I mentioned, the sandwich isn't really something I would choose to eat but I did because it was the only non-dessert option. Liz told me she had no idea Mary would want to be paid back, especially considering that Liz's boyfriend had to give Mary a ride from her dorm to the sub shop, then to the apartment, then back to the dorm again when the night was over, all free of charge. Half of our friend group did know Mary before I did, so I have no idea if this was normal behavior for her but they didn't seem particularly surprised or annoyed. I think most of the people that ate a sandwich did venmo her. I personally decided not to pay her because I felt it was unfair for her to spring the cost on us after we ate. Had I known I would be charged, I wouldn't have eaten it. I do feel a bit bad because maybe she did really need the money but we're all on a college budget so it's not like that's a unique situation either.

I wasn’t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  

I’ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it’s my choice and I don’t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.

I didn’t tell him first because due to our age and length of the relationship I honestly thought he’d want me to terminate the pregnancy and I wanted few day to wrap my head around the situation before taking that on.  Turns out that wasn’t the case though.

My girlfriend and I finally get home, only to find my cousin and my niece still at home, with no one else to be found. Confused, I ask where my mother is. My cousin tells me that she left.

She got really upset with me and said she was looking forward to something nice like an upgraded diamond wedding band of SIMILAR VALUE range. WTF. She argued that because we make more money we should treat each other proportionally so I was being CHEAP and not showing her how much I care.

Anyways, my daughter asks me if I will skate with her and then also grabs her moms hand. She then starts smiling and saying “we’re a family again” I then pull away and tell my daughter to go ahead and skate with mommy for a while and we can switch off. I was not comfortable with this. 
My ex brought this up today and was saying I don’t know how to coparent and I should have no problem skating together with our daughter.

My Husband and I are in our hometown visiting family and one of our favorite ways to see everyone is by going out to eat. Its just so much easier for everyone involved. We have plans to meet my Husbands side of the family tomorrow for lunch.

My SIL and her Husband have chosen not to partake in any alcohol. Part of this is in solidarity with her FIL who is a recovering alcoholic (15-20 years sober).

Today while my husband was asking where they would like to go for lunch my SIL asked us not to drink anything alcoholic in front of her children (3+4). The big kicker here is that she requested that we go to a local brewery for lunch!! I just cannot get over the irony in her texts today. 

My knee jerk reaction was anger initially. Who the hell do they think they are? I simply told my Husband that I am an adult and will be ordering whatever I feel like during lunch. We are all in our late 20s/early 30s, and plenty old enough to decide what we would like to drink. Husband said the choice is mine, but that he wont drink out of respect for his sister.

TL;DR: SIL and family chooses not to drink alcohol, but wants to do family lunch at a brewery. Asked us not to drink alcohol in front of her kids. 

WIBTA if I ordered a flight of beers to sample while at the same table as my non alcoholic in laws? 

Edited for infor: No one at the lunch will be a recovering alcoholic. In no way would I drink in front of someone who has a problem with alcohol.

They just went to dinner at another brewery 3 days ago where my FIL had a beer with dinner. 

Flights of beer here are little 4oz cups with maybe 3 full swallows of beer in it. Not planning on ordering a fishbowl or giant margarita.

Edit 2:
Lunch went well today. I chose to go early and ask the server to bring my drinks in a water glass. Worked so well my husband didnt even notice! ",115,171,0.94
56,Not the A-hole,"I am pregnant and would like to announce it on April 1st, making the post look like my younger sister is playing a joke on me until the afternoon when I clear it up and say that I'm really pregnant  (and the April fool is tricking people into believing she 'hacked me). My younger sister loves this idea, thinks it's hilarious and helped with the wording to make it look as unlike me as possible (like, it will have hashtags which I never use, and I'll joke about naming the kid April). I like a good joke, and how often does big, good news come up so close to April?

My family all already know my situation so I won't be breaking any news to them, this will be a surprise for my friends. I was talking to my elder sister about the April fool plan. She didn't like the idea and was concerned I'd offend or upset other people who had difficulty conceiving or miscarriages. I had a knejerk reaction of, ""someone else's misfortune isn't my burden to bear and it's not like I'm pretending to be pregnant "" and she reluctantly agreed, but now I'm having second thoughts. Is it an arsehole move to announce a pregnancy when people might think I'm joking?

57,Not the A-hole,"I went into a 7/11 and got a bunch of treats for my best friend’s birthday. We never do presents but I figured I’d grab some stuff that we always used to eat when we’d hangout in HS. I got a bunch of candy, snacks, drinks, etc. As I was checking out I decided that I would also grab some scratch off tickets, as we used to spend hours buying, scratching, cashing them in, repeat. 

I check out, pay with my card, and go to leave. At this point the woman cashing me out says “You can’t leave, you have to pay”. I got confused and replied, “didn’t I just slide my card?”. She told me they just instituted a new store policy, one that requires *cash* to be used for scratch offs. I did not have any cash on me, so I told her to forget it and grabbed my other items. 

This is where it goes off the rails. She insists she cannot remove them from her cash register unless I pay her, freezing it up, and that it’s my fault so I cannot leave until I pay. I told her that if we wanted to get picky, she did not warn me about the policy before I slid my card- an obvious indication I likely didn’t have cash- so it wasn’t really my fault. This really made her mad, as she said she had no clue I didn’t have cash, and that I should’ve known about the new policy. 

There’s quite the line forming behind me, with everyone pretending they can’t hear this fight happening. She keeps insisting I cannot leave without paying, and I keep insisting I can’t pay because I *have no cash*.

I finally got sick of it and walked out, with her screaming at me the whole way.

64,Everyone Sucks,"Sorry for any formatting issues, I’m on mobile. 


So, long story short, we haven’t been doing all that well recently because I genuinely HAVE been an asshole for a good chunk of the year. Anger issues, it’s not fun. I’m working on trying to see a therapist as it currently stands but setting up a new doctors appointment and running through insurance isn’t fun. 


Well, we live together. And we’ve been dating off an on for a while, decided to make it official this year by moving in together and blah blah. I just recently learned my anger has become an issue, and a lot of it for the past month has been randomly directed at her. She’s an angel, did nothing wrong, and took it all without a word. A couple of weeks ago she finally said to me “I’m not sure I can do this anymore” which was a massive eye opener for me, and I began to work on trying meditation and other forms of anger control until I could get on some anti depressant medication. 


But back to the story. The other day I noticed she was on her phone, like a lot, and at one point I had glanced over and she was sending pictures, not nudes just general selfies etc, to some guy with a nickname on her phone. And his response included the word “princess” so I asked her about it. She immediately got self defensive and began to raise her voice, to which I did as well and things got a little heated and I said “hey look, can we talk about this like adults instead of screaming at each other?” So we did. Her response to the so called “flirting” was that it was “Helping my self confidence issues, and it’s not like I’m seeing him in person. He’s just a customer from work who gave me his number and I decided to text him because why not” 


I take issue to this, and I said so, to which she HAD called me an asshole, and has now taken off from the apartment for the night. Not sure where she’s going, she blocked me and she’s been gone for about an hour now. I don’t think she’s coming back home tonight because she took her laptop and everything with her. 


Which begs the question, AM I the asshole? Because I honestly don’t know. My anger IS an issue but part of me says she shouldn’t be doing that, regardless of whether or not she’s “not meeting him in person”. But I could also be overreacting, and I’d rather not talk to my friends about it because I don’t like to bother them with personal details. ",23,27,0.93

Not normal screaming, like holy shit this person is going to blow out their voice type of screaming. It really freaked me out. I heard all kinds of banging. I honestly didn't know who it was and I was scared. I really thought an insane person broke into our house and obviously I wasn't going to go down stairs to check it I didn't want to get murdered, so I hid under my bed and called 911. I stayed on the phone with the lady until the cops came. It didn't take them long to get there. I guess because I told them it was an intruder a bunch of cops pulled up guns drawn ready to go. They talked to my mom and me separately for like 30 minutes then they left. My mom was pissed at me and said she can scream and slam doors because it's her g&ddamn house this that and the third.

Anyways, as the title says, my ex decided to ""come out"" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.

I confronted her via text and all she said was ""Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.""

Now I usually come up with an excuse to get out of eating, but I will bring in cookies or drinks to ""contribute"", and it had worked up until today. My co-workers basically confronted me about how I never eat because I'm ""too good for their food"" and other ridiculous peer pressure tactics and wouldn't leave it alone. So I straight up told them something like, ""I don't know how you live, you could have roaches. You could have pets that you pet then go back to cooking, and I've personally seen a few of you leave the bathroom without washing your hands. It's not just your food I don't eat anyone's food unless I know their sanitary standards."" Then I proceeded to read the TSB on my laptop.

He and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he’s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It’s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. 

He said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I’m not sure if there’s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.

His sister is 17, I am 24 and BF is 27. 

His sister came to me recently asking for advice when losing virginity and a couple other things, and she made it really clear she was planning on losing it with her current bf. I gave her all the best advice I could and told her to make sure to be safe, etc. I went with her to the doctor to get her on birth control but also made sure to tell her to use a condom for the first few times just in case - don’t want any extra worries on her mind!

A couple days later, she sends me a text saying it went really well but was very vague about it all - which I’m glad about, it’s her personal life at the end of the day. I told her I was happy for her and that’s it. The messages were very vague in terms of the actual experience, but you can definitely tell what she was talking about as she said she used a condom plus a whole lot of lube. 

BF found the messages on my phone and is LIVID. He’s been so angry at me, saying his sister’s life is not my concern and I should have put a stop to it and not encouraged it. He’s not overly protective of his sister, but I can understand the worries as the eldest brother. I tried to calm him but he is very upset with me, saying I allowed his young sister to have sex when I shouldn’t have. He went on a tangent about her being way too young (in my opinion, she isn’t. I also can’t dictate what she does and doesn’t do but he won’t listen to me), and talking about how I am such a bad influence for helping her.

73,No A-holes here,"The day my niece was born, I was obviously excited. But that was it, just excitement and curiosity. I didn't really feel love. I hadn't addressed the thought until I heard my other sister (not mother of niece) talk about how everytime she sees her, she's filled with a sense of love.

Now, she's about a year old, and everyone in my family talks about her so endearingly. I wanna clarify that I don't feel jealous of the attention or anything like that, I just genuinely can't relate to what they say about her. I don't feel any connection to her past the obvious ""Aw cute baby"" feeling. And I can never grasp conversations about her either. Like, I don't understand how they can all talk about her so long because I just get bored immediately. Our family group chat is just full of pictures of her and then people proceeding to send many, _many_ heart emojis, call her cute, etc. It also isn't that I'm trying to act all cOoL and eDgY by not liking a baby, I just sincerely can't relate to how everyone else feels. And I feel really bad about it. I always try to interact with her, but it comes off as awkward and forced, which makes it obvious that I don't really want to be doing it. That, of course, makes my parents quite frustrated, especially when the baby's calling out for specifically me.

I really wish I could relate to how my family sees my neice because, well, it feels like when people are referencing a movie you've never watched, and you try to keep being in the conversation with no knowledge of what they're talking about. It also seems as if this feeling is going to keep being there as I become older and reach the age of having children.

74,No A-holes here,"My in-laws have large family holidays (40+ people). The first time I met his family, I noticed there were no women! At mealtime, the women suddenly appeared. After dinner, the guys migrated to watch the football game, and the women disappeared again. I thought they just didn't like football. It turns out that the women spend 2 hours before the meal cooking, folding napkins, setting tables, etc. Then after the meal, the women spend another hour or two doing dishes and cleaning. By the time they were done cleaning, everyone was preparing to leave.

The next holiday, aunt-in-law mentioned that the women would like to meet me, since we barely interacted. They'd love if I could come an hour early and help set up. I shook off the vague Stepford Wives vibes and I figured, when in Rome, do as the Romans do.

So my then-boyfriend and I showed up early. The women looked at me like I had grown a third eye. Aunt declared ""No men in the kitchen!"", he was banished to the TV room, and suddenly I was stranded with 20 people I didn't know. Most of these women are housewives, and it is a matter of pride that they do 100% of the housework and cooking. It quickly became clear that I am inept at floral arrangement and my knife work is not up to par (I know how to cook, but I really don't care if the carrots slices are uneven). One of the women told me not to worry because they will teach me to be ""bride ready"" so I can make my husband proud. Awkward.

After the meal, the women started collecting dishes, and I mentioned to my then-boyfriend that we should both help out. But, he was again banished. So I retreated with him to the TV room and hung out with the guys. We played a board game while the women cleaned.

That was a few years ago, and since then, I stay with the guys during family holidays. I'm the only woman who does. Occasionally one of the women will hand me a stack of dirty plates, or ask for help with prep. I'll help out, but I usually pull my husband in to help, too. When he gets banished, I'll go too.

We go to family gatherings 3-4 times a year. 10 hours/year of housework will not kill me. Still, it feels really weird and archaic that the men lounge around while the women work. Also, the women kind of freak me out. They are 100% perfect housewives and can be pretty intense. Never a hair out of place. I'm a nerdy tomboy, and I'm way more comfortable with the guys.

My mom says I'm being rude. If I don't want to participate with the way they run their family functions, I should not attend. By hanging out with the guys, I'm basically rejecting all of the women and their way of life.

76,Not the A-hole,"I've had this dog since I was a kid and he's getting on in years now, but he's still pretty spritely for his age. I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.

I have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, ""Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog."" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.

Nope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also ""borrow"" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.

I've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.

Two -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, ""Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch."" 

I complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.",960,10752,0.95
77,Asshole,"My little sister and I have been close for our entire lives, and I have tried to give her guidance and advice where I can. In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.

However, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right.

My sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby.

His relationship with his sister has degraded severely over the last couple of years to the point to where they're not talking any more. I find this to be a pity, but up until now they've both been in very good health, so I thought they'd eventually reconcile after some time apart. My aunt takes slights very seriously and when she decides to be furious with someone it's almost like they're dead to her. My aunt is extremely generous and kind as long as the people in her life actively appreciate the impact that she's made in theirs.

Yesterday I received a message from my mom (divorced from my dad) that my aunt has meningitis and is in the hospital. Also, my cousin has had to drop everything and flew a couple of states over to stay with her in the hospital. I was told explicitly not to tell my father, in all caps. I called my cousin this morning and talked to her about the severity of the situation, my aunt is falling in and out of consciousness and can't deal with a lot of stimulation at the moment, so no one can talk with her except my cousin and my Aunt's BF. When going through everything my aunt said things like, ""don't tell ""my dad"", don't even tell him if I'm dead"". My cousin tried to talk her down from that, but she was having none of that. She's basically staking this out as a final wish kind of demand and the family is taking the request with the utmost seriousness.

I told my cousin that it would be extraordinarily sad if my dad was never given the option to reconcile with his little sister while she was dying. She cried, I cried, and then I told her I wouldn't tell him out of respect for my aunt.

So I spent the day struggling deeply with this knowledge. Eventually, after thinking through what kind of incredible betrayal of my father it would be for everyone else in the family to know about this except for him, and what kind of weight it would be for him to bare if she was to pass away without him even trying to reconnect, I called him. I asked him if there was anything big or new with him, and he replied like everything was great. Then told him that there may be something really big going on, I told him I couldn't give him specifics as to the who or what, but he's smart so he got enough information from me to follow a bread crumb trail that I know exists. I've already had confirmation that he's digging into it.

Even if she won't take his call or my cousin won't let any notification get through to her, my dad at least deserves the opportunity to make up for past mistakes, and at the very least know in his heart his last action towards her wasn't tinted with acrimony. I believe my aunt deserves the same.

I made up storys about how my aunt used to do stuff like that and now shes rich, I said a bunch of stuff about investments to make it sound like a good idea, basically I did the MLM recruiters job for them. What it all boiled down to was her getting overly mad about the other cashier, she said a bunch of stufd about how ""she doesnt need this money anymore"" and ""how much better she is since she has been selected"", and she sent them the money on her break.

80,Not the A-hole,"A bit of context: I have been with my SO for 5 years. I am now 22 and he’s 25. 

We got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can’t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I’m going to be there for him no matter what and I’m not going anywhere

Things are changing now. I don’t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I’m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it’s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this

82,Asshole,"My wife (married 6 years, together 10 years) is a stay-at-home parent for our two children (4, 1.5). 
I work pretty long hours and sometimes travel for work, leaving her to do most the parenting and housework. On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. 

This weekend I’ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. 
It’s been hard on my wife, she’s exhausted from the week and then she’s not getting a break over the weekend as I’ve gone away. 

I feel bad for leaving her and it’s tough on her, but it’s one weekend away in the year. 

She’s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I’ve made the wrong decision. 

So what do you think Reddit - AITA?

EDIT: we had planned this for some months and she only made it clear it was too much for her after I had left. My parents have been helping out a little and she has some friends come round to keep her company.  

EDIT2: Update: some useful opinions and suggestions in the comments. I cut the trip short and came home, bunch of flowers in hand. After i made dinner and put the kids to bed we had a good talk. She said that although she had agreed to the trip, she had not foreseen that she’d find it so hard, particularly with the the misunderstanding about the length of the trip. I apologised and she already has a date in the diary for her own vacation. ",251,230,0.89
83,Not the A-hole,"So, a bit of background, I guess:

I'm on the autistic spectrum. I've faced years of bullying at school because I was being myself, and I had a very confusing and anger-filled time growing up. It really wasn't easy. I'm now a depressed, anxious, insecure adult because of it. A lot of the stuff I faced was due to being autistic, and how I was treated by others.

I get annoyed every time I see those videos on social media where a kid with some kind of disability gets asked to prom, and then a post is shared around about it, and people see the non-disabled person as 'an inspiration'. In the UK, there's a show named The Undateables, and it's based around people with various disabilities finding love. That's fine, right up until they named it that. We're disabled, and we're seen as 'undateable' by the general public, and when we do get into relationships (Which is a normal thing), it's suddenly 'aww how sweet'. It's not seen the same.

&#x200B;

My point is that I feel these acts are based totally around pity and condescension. The girl in a wheelchair with cerebral palsy, or the guy with down syndrome, or the autistic classmate, they're lied to and used by the other kids for 'kind points' on social media. I've spoke up about this a few times in the past, and I've been called heartless, hateful, and cynical because I disagreed. Damn it, they deserve to be invited to all the things, just like everybody else. It didn't NEED a media circus!  


Another example is when someone films them self giving food or money to homeless people. I find it incredibly telling how there's a camera rolling right before the act. They frankly don't give a shit about the homeless guy, they're just trying to portray themselves as kind and benevolent, when they're clearly just trying to get likes.  

I'm really sad and angry that this is happening.

AITA?

Now, I don't like soup. To me it kind of looks like barf. And this soup was very pungent. It smelled like fish chowder but was also very tomatoey. She also started slurping her drink very loudly and started eating her croutons very loudly. At one point she started dumping them in her mouth from the bag.  


I tried to ignore her but then she started leaning closer to me and was looking at what I was doing on my laptop. I should mention that I have sensory issues and was already getting overwhelmed by the smell of the soup. Her chewing in my ear just tipped me over the edge.  


I turned to her and asked, in an admittedly more aggressive tone than I meant to ""can you please stop doing that? It's really distracting.""

86,Not the A-hole,"This is a little more complicated than just selling my home. For starters, my in-law's donated my wife and I some property. We didn't pay anything for it, it's legally ours(went through an attorney). We bought a double wide mobile home for $38,000. We used $12,000 of our money to move the home, set up, electrical, permits, etc. So, the only thing we got a loan for was $38,000.

We have lived there for about six years now and it was a starter home for us and we're ready to move. I got the home/land appraised for $140,000. My wife and I were planning on selling the home for $125,000, give my in-laws $30,000 for the land, pay off our existing loan and wife's car note so we would be debt free, and put the rest down on another home. I did some research on the land value and it was around $17,000.

Now, my father in-law said he would like to buy the home, but for the price we paid for it, which again is $38,000. My mother in-law said she would do $50,000 to include the money we spent to get the house moved, etc, but my father in-law is against that. He wants to buy it to use as a rental investment.

88,Not the A-hole,"In 2016, I moved with my family to England from America, not only because my Dad got a job there but so I can possibly get free college since my Dad is actually a UK citizen and I can get citizenship really easy; except for one small detail. My Dad forgot to bring my birth certificate which is required for me to go through the citizenship process. My Dad tells me not to worry about it and he will take care of everything so I can go to school. So I trust him.  


Fast forward to 2019 January. I want to visit my first ever girlfriend of 3 months who lives in Belgium, who has already visited me in England twice already. I talk this over with my parents first and they are worried about my safety saying that I shouldn't go and tell me that I might have trouble getting back. I don't worry about their first concern, but I question the second one asking why I might have trouble getting back. They said they don't know and I should listen to them.  


Knowing my parents I assumed it's just an attempt to stop me from going, so I do my own research to see if there really might be any problems with my travelling. I didn't find out anything wrong. After ordering the tickets they get even friskier and they once again said that I might have trouble getting back and I asked why again; they said they didn't know and said I should just ""listen & respect your parents"". After that, they just said ""Well he's an adult now, let him learn"".  


Then I had a great week in Belgium and experienced everything I wanted, couldn't possibly have any regrets until I met with border patrol when I was going back home and told me I was not allowed back into the country.

I was thinking ""Umm...what? Let me call my Dad...""

My Dad told me not to worry and just ask for a tourist visa. Surprise surprise, I was not allowed to.

""Oh shit, am I homeless? What am I going to do??""  


I call my Dad again tell him my situation and both my parents are super angry with me and tell me it's all my fault and I should I have listened to them. If I knew about my 6 month visa and how not having my birth certificate is why my Dad hasn't taken care of my citizenship yet, then I totally would have flown back to America a long time ago to get it and do things properly; I had the money for it from my freelancing work. However, once I tell them all this, they get even angrier with me yelling louder and how they always have to fix my mess. I really need them in this situation and didn't want to fight, so I just apologize and accept everything they say.  


I'm currently in a situation where I have flown back to America to get my birth certificate and going through my citizenship process with my parent's financial support (which there really isn't much of and I'm crashing from house to house trying to make everything last).

(I’m in mobile so excuse me for the poor formatting)

A few months ago my friends cat  passed away. She loved this cat, it was her best friend of the whole world. She’s had this thing for about 10-12 years, it went with her when she moved out from her parents place and everything. 

The cat was kinda cute, small fluffy orange thing. I don’t like cats, hate them. They’re nowhere near as loyal as a dog, they claw everything and everyone, littler box in your house?! No thanks. I much prefer dogs but oh well.


Anyway, when the cat died three months ago my friend was devastated, she cried and cried and cried. A week after the cats passing I asked her if she wanted to hang out but she declined saying she didn’t want to go out.  I then asked her the following week but got the same response. A few days go by and I stop by her place, she lets me in and seems fine.

When I walked in I saw a jar on her shelf in her living room next to the tv, taking a closer look it was the cats ashes with its name, age and some weird message on it next to a photo of her and the cat. I was immediately weirded out by that, why would you want a dead animals ashes in your home?

She did get better eventually but it was clear as day that she missed the thing. Well, last month was her 19th birthday and I thought... why not get her a cat? I’m a good friend and it’ll make her happy so she won’t be as mopey. I stoped by the shelter a week before her birth and got a cat that looked something similar to her old one. By the time of her birthday I stopped by her house and her boyfriend was there.  I put it in a box (with holes) and have her the gift. When she opened the box she starts crying. I thought I did something good. Clearly not. She gave the box to her BF and went into her room. It being awkward I left.

Fast forward a few days later I get a message from the BF saying how that wasn’t cool that I got a cat for her. He said something on the lines that she didn’t want a cat at the moment. 

??! What? 

I told him that it’s not like a person died. He didn’t seem to like that answer and told me not to come over for a while. I said I wanted the cat back but he said no, he’s looking after the cat. I paid for the cat, is she doesn’t want it then put it back at the shelter for someone who does want it. He proceeded to call me an asshole and a bitch.

So, I am pretty certain I'm not but am feeling guilt  from my SO is complaining that I am being mean and selfish. This summer SO wants us to go for  a family vacation with the in-laws, this would be the second time we do so. The trip would include her siblings, her parents and all the kids so it's a big deal as we don't do that often. Problem is, her father violated her when she was a teenager and I cannot stand the man, nor my SO's mother as she blamed her child for what happened. He is a terrible person, has done a terrible  thing and I cannot stomach his presence or the asshat he calls his wife.

Me and the SO have had our troubles the last two years because I stupidly  agreed to move to an area where her parents live. We used to fight daily  about family breakfasts that I didn't want to go to, easter breaks or trips to Macey's with them that I just thought was wrong, totally out of order etc but acquiesced because she insisted and fought to make it happen. SO has been to a psychologist for her issues stemming from the incident with her father, later a psychiatrist to work through  her things - this is an ongoing process and a lot of her trauma has resulted in some difficult relationship dynamics at times. Her mother is the evil queen in my life, who blamed her daughter for the incident, accusing her of trying to  take her man, checking if she was pregnant all the time, physically punishing her for the incident without talking about it in any sensible way - the whole nasty schpiel - you can imagine the fallout for my wife when she was a teenager (the shame, the stress, the silence).

My  SO wants to be close to her family despite said issues, this makes me sad but I cannot force her away from her family - that is her choice. But my child and just as importantly myself should be kept out of that sick constellation of fear, shame, pretense and anger that I feel can erupt at any moment. She is arguing that she also wants to give our boy a nice family vacation with her family because ""everybody else is going and he would love to be with his cousins"" and she wants to go with her siblings. I agree that a vacation with her siblings would be nice, but on  principle I can no longer condone doing activities like this with her fathar and mother present despite her wishes to do so.

AITA  for not wanting to travel with this her family and effectively blocking our participation the big family vacation because of my principles, even if there is no risk the father posing any danger of repeat incidents?",54,334,0.94

95,Everyone Sucks,"All right, hear me out. Obligatory on mobile/throw away disclaimer. 

My partner (31m)  and I (29f) knew we wanted to marry each other pretty early on, so we had had numerous conversations about what kind of ring I wanted. Not a diamond. Not a diamond. Not a diamond. That's all I asked. While he was designing the ring, he was making jokes about how I didn't want a diamond. I actively didn't want something traditional. Fast forward to him proposing to me, it's a diamond.

Fast forward a couple weeks later we were talking about the ring because it was a little too small to begin with, and I was asking him why he chose to get me a diamond instead of anything else. He said he didn't want to have to explain to people why he didn't get a diamond, that the purchase really represents him and how he values the relationship. He had the ring custom built. He chose everything about the design and stones. I mentioned that the ring is really for the recipient and not for the audience and I think this was discouraging to him because he said he thought I could change my mind about diamonds and we can just get everything changed.

I don't want that, this is the ring he gave me, this is the ring he wanted to give me. It's an immensely beautiful and expensive gesture and I would never want something that he didn't want to give me. But aside from the size being too small, I genuinely do not like the design of the ring and I hate diamonds. I am blown away that he would go above and beyond to make getting me an engagement ring a massive, personal project. That's why I don't want another ring, the sentiment alone does it for me. We basically settled on he should have included me in the process.  He just wanted to make me happy, and he spent a lot of money to do it. (Which is another reason why I didn't want a diamond in the first place.)

Now, I'm picking out wedding bands, the design I want does not match the engagement ring, I do not want to wear them together. 

I don't want to wear my engagement ring at our wedding. It's too small to fit comfortably with another ring on the same finger. I don't want to wear it on my right hand. Point blank, I dont want to.

So, WIBTA if I was honest to those who ask where my ring is? If I said it's not really my style? Any other excuse would contradict the fact that Im probably not going to wear my engagement ring much after this. It irks me that so much about weddings is showboating and I don't want to pretend. I got something I didn't want half because my partner was worried about what other people would think, and now do I have to continue that facade? Both of our mothers know how I feel about the ring. And my partner knows I probably won't wear the ring much after we get married. If that matters at all. ",38,42,0.87

98,Not the A-hole,"I'm posting this to get an outside opinion and see if I'm overreacting. 

tl;dr - I feel as though once I do something nice, it is expected that I do that task in the future.

Girlfriend[26f] and I[26m] have lived together for about 2 years and have been together for a total of 4 and a half. I feel like my GF is self centered in a lot of ways and takes advantage of my kindness and somewhat uses me. 

A few examples of what I mean

- Last night she was watching Netflix on our Smart TV and her legs were hurting so she wanted to do some stretching. She handed me the remote and asked me to find her yoga. Not a big deal there, I happened to hear a yoga program a few days ago that is one of those like 8 week mapped out programs with videos included. After the video she says I'm going to try to do this every day, cool, works for me. I told her I'll find the programming guide for her so she can see what videos she should watch every day. She tells me ""no you can just put the video on and tell me okay this is what you're doing.""

- She absolutely refuses to take partial responsibility to try and remember to take her birth control. I have to get it for her every night or else she doesn't/forgets to take it. Sometimes, even if I verbally remind her to go take it, she has me get it for her. I ask her why doesn't she make an effort to remember to take it herself and why is it always on me, she responds with ""it isn't always on you, you give it to me and I take it""

- When she goes to bed she will always ask me to set her alarm for work on her phone and plug it in. This especially annoys me when she literally hands me her phone when shes done browsing Facebook or whatever and then asks me to do this. I understand it if her phone is on the dresser or something and I'm walking by and shes already in bed, but that to me is ridiculous. 

- We don't often go to bed at exactly the same time (I'm full time getting my masters in CS, she works full time, I usually go to bed about an hour later or so) but sometimes when we do and I'm already in bed messing around on my phone or whatever and she is getting out of the shower she will get in bed without turning the light off and ask me to turn it off and turn on the fan. I usually make a big deal about this whenever it happens and ask her if shes serious...

I don't want it to come off as she treats me as her slave and just bosses me around all the time, I just feel that I get punished for my kindness, because all of these things (and others like it) I have done at some point not because I was asked, but just to be nice and it seems once I do something to be nice a couple of times it seems like its just expected that ""oh okay this is your job now"" and it just kind of frustrates me.

She has one child already and is really struggling financially. I have bought her groceries on multiple occasions and pay for her to eat every time we go out.  
She took the tests because she believed her abusive boyfriend and his buddy tampered with her birth control. I believe this to be true. She was very upset when she found out, but as soon as she told the boyfriend, she became excited. She did not want another child yet until she found out she was going to have one and he brainwashed her into thinking this was what she wants. She refuses to terminate or give the baby up even though she can barely afford to care for the child she has. She wants to give her boyfriend another child like he wants. 

I have mixed emotions about all of this, but I ultimately am disappointed in her and I'm annoyed that she is not living her life for herself. Nothing she does is for her own happiness, it's all for her boyfriend. She could have a great job with her degree, but because her boyfriend wants her to work at \[insert big department store here\] with him, she won't look for another job. He wants her there so she doesn't make much money and so that they are eligible for government assistance. He will not get a better job to support her either.

104,Asshole,"My (lesbian) younger sister is getting married to a girl who is generally very sweet and family oriented, but can be at any given moment alarmingly obstinate. Where the wedding is concerned, my sister doesn't really care about the fine details, she just wants people to have a fun time and of course for her fiancee to be happy. Her fiancee, however, wants everything to be perfect, exactly the way she wants it. 

I am in the bridal party, however, I was living abroad when the bridesmaid's dresses (all long and black) were ordered. I picked one and sent my mom my measurements so she could order for me. When she called the shop, they insisted she needed to order several sizes up as the dresses ""run VERY small"". I'm normally a size 4 but the shop convinced my mother to order a 12.

Now I'm back in the country and the wedding is nearly upon us. The 12 was, as expected, WAY too big. I've had it altered several times but it still looks like a sack of potatoes on me. I've now spent over $300 on this thing. 

Trying to salvage the situation, I went through my mother and sister's closets and actually found a really classy long black gown my sister wore to her prom - it's a size 2 but it fits me like a glove. My mother sends my sister some pics asking if it would be ok for me to wear this instead of the bride-sanctioned tarp I am currently stuck with. As I said, my sister couldn't care less but she got a very firm ""NO"" from her fiancee; the dress was too different, it wouldn't look right in pictures, etc. Granted, it is a bit different from the official bridesmaid's dresses as the material on this dress is nicer and it's a deeper color black but nothing extreme. I figured being a bit different wouldn't be a huge deal as I am the maid of honor, and it'd certainly be better and far less noticeable than wearing the comically ill-fitting dress.

So, I've been told no, and my sister, not wanting to cause further drama will not put her foot down on this. The bridal shop will not refund or exchange the dress (apparently everyone signed an ""all sales are final"" form), which means I have to pay full price for a new one as well as expedited shipping to make sure it gets here on time for the wedding, AND I'll have to pay for any quick alterations it most likely needs. My new job doesn't start until just before the wedding, I've just spent thousands of dollars on my overseas move, it won't bankrupt me but this is not the sort of thing I want to be wasting money on especially because I will never wear any of these dresses again.

My mother did offer to pay for the second dress, but she has already spent far more on this wedding than was initially agreed so I really don't want to be adding to her own financial burden. 

WIBTA if just wear the slightly different gown that actually fits me instead of buying yet another dress?

105,Not the A-hole,"So we have a pretty popular restaurant that lots of people order take out from. Actually about 15 years ago when they first opened they had no seating, so it was all take out. Anyways as they became more popular and more people were coming it started getting really busy and crowded at times, they started letting people call in their order by phone so that a person could just show up and their order was ready. Now when they were very busy if you already called in your order, you wouldn't wait in a line with everyone else that hadn't ordered yet, if a person was ordering or at the register paying you let that finish then let them know you were there for your phone order. Once in a while the occasional new person would be all offended and give you the ""hey there's a line here"" nonsense because they were on their first trip to the restaurant, but for the most part every one knows how it goes there. 

So, the other day I call in my order for my fam, it's like a $45 total because there's 4 of us. I get to the restaurant about 25 minutes later which is normally plenty of time, even when they are slammed the orders still come out in a quick time. So I go inside and head for the register like I have done hundreds of times. a bunch of people were in a line, I figured that was the line of people waiting to order. Right away 2 door dash dorks start in with the 'there's a line here"" crap. ""I called in my order"" i respond. They get all huffy about it but in my head I'm like this ain't my 1st rodeo so I pretty much pay them no mind & proceed to the register. The girl behind the counter looks at me, I tell her my name & she looks thru the orders waiting to be picked up and says mine isnt there. Then she asks me ""did you wait in line?"" I'm like no I called it in. Then she tells me i have to wait in line. I go there often enough that I know she is a new employee, and for the past 15+ years that's not the normal procedure. I was pretty irritated by the whole situation so i just walked out. Then I was thinking about it and I wonder if it was just because she was new, or were the 2 door dash guys making her feel pressured to make me wait in line, or am I just an asshole for leaving and not waiting or paying for the order. Just to clarify I have been back to the restaurant today, I called my order in, showed up, skipped the line with no objections from anyone and got my order and left.

106,Asshole,"So my girlfriend's mom is one of those neurotic, paranoid panicky kind of people. Anytime there's something that she doesn't know or doesn't go exactly to plan it's because the worst possible thing happened to cause it. This includes if a door to outside is left even slightly ajar and she doesn't see her dog sitting at the doorway watching whoever is outside. Immediately a ""OMG WHERE IS <dog>?! When's the last time anyone has seen her?!"" echoes throughout the house and massive passive aggressive mode if we don't drop what we're doing to look and call for the dog. 9/10 she's sitting by the door to the backyard looking out through the screen door in the sun or sleeping under gf's mom's bed.   


Anyway, I was mowing the lawn, watering the flowers, sweeping the driveway as per her request (I have no problem doing this,it takes about 45 minutes if I stretch it out) and left the gate from the backyard to the front open as I brought the lawn mower, weed whacker, and the gas out. Unbeknownst to me her mom left her door to the backyard open for some reason, and when I'm bringing the gas back to the shed in the backyard she noticed that I didn't have to open the gate and immediately went into panic mode about the dog's whereabouts. But this time she also gave me an earful about being responsible/not being lazy, *this was all before she went inside to verify the dog was in fact missing*. But lo and behold we go inside and no sign of the pooch, so I actually start to get worried and feel kinda bad even though I don't know how I was supposed to know it would be outside. With a parting shot about maybe *someone paying attention* saw the dog walking down the street she leaves to go knock on the neighbors doors.

It's hot, I feel bad and pretty irritated so I go in the bathroom to splash some water on my face and think how long the gate was left unattended. While I wipe my face off I hear some scratches on what sounds like porcelain or ceramic and who's in the bathtub stretching like she maybe just woke up but the dog, who probably laid down to fall asleep cause the bathtub is cool. When I ask my gf if she used the bathroom last she told me that her mom had just put new towels in there maybe 10 minutes before she went outside to see the gate open. 

When her mom came back I offered to help look for another 15 minutes or so before I heroically found the dog safe and sound while making sure to ask while laughing, ""Haha who was the last person in the bathroom?"" My gf shot me a look and asked me afterwards if I put the dog in there, and confirmed no I didn't I found her but being blamed for losing the dog made me have no qualms about letting her mom stress out a bit more. She thought it was kinda funny getting tired of her moms nonsense but called me an asshole.

107,Asshole,"A couple months ago I decided to become vegetarian, but my wife still eats meat and thats fine to me. I do most of the cooking and so I always cook vegetarian meals.

For example when I cook meat free sausages she wants me to cook normal sausages for her aswell. This would be fine but I already don't like cooking and this just makes it more complicated and time consuming. Also if she wants meat she could just eat it when I'm not cooking or do more cooking herself.

109,Not the A-hole,"I was dining at an upscale restaurant and the bill came out to $49.82. I pulled out a $50 to pay, and told the waitress I didn't need change. Goes without saying, but I was planning on leaving the rest of her tip on the table. I used to work as a server. I always tip generously. 

The waitress misunderstood my intentions and said ""Really?"" loud enough for all the other diners to hear. Before I could say anything, she said something like ""Woooow- thanks for the generous tip"", snatched the payment from the table, and walked away in a huff. All the diners around me were staring daggers at me. It was humiliating. 

I flagged down the manager and let him know what happened. He knows me and knows I'd never stiff servers. 

He offered to comp the meal, but I said it wasn't necessary. I just wanted to let him know what happened and would be on my way. The manager insisted that I was owed an apology. Made sense to me at the time. She apologizes, gets her tip, I leave, everyone is happy. 

When the manager called the waitress over, both of us saw her roll her eyes as she was walking here. As soon as the manager saw this, he put on his ""you're about to get fired"" face. All the tears and pleading made no difference. It was ugly. People were filming with their cell phones. 

As she was being escorted to the back by some kitchen workers (who probably think I'm the second coming of Satan). The manager insisted on comping our meal and we went on our way. 

When we got home, the wife claimed I was an asshole for making a huge scene out of nothing, and getting that poor girl fired over a simple misunderstanding.

111,No A-holes here,"I'm 20M, in college. My fuckbuddy, let's call her Grace, is 23F and a grad student at my university. So, we agreed to just be fuckbuddies, and I fully intend to stick to that: just sex, no hanging out outside that, no feelings, whatsoever. Recently, Grace has been trying to violate this time and time again. Clearly, she caught feelings for me. H
She wants to hang out after sex, watch Netflix together, wants to go on dates, introduce me to her friends. And no, I don't want any of that. Right now, I just don't have the time or frame of mind to be in a relationship. I just want sex to blow off steam. 

So clearly, we're incompatible here, because Grace is now suddenly wanting to go on dates and cuddle and all that. So yesterday I told her straight up: 'You obviously have feelings for me, but I don't have any for you. This makes us incompatible. If you're willing to set aside your feelings and just have sex, we can continue. If you aren't willing to just be fuckbuddies, I'm sorry, but I think it would be better for both of us if we broke up'.

112,Not the A-hole,"I like to think I'm right on this one, but posting to make sure I'm not missing anything. My son is 13, and his middle school is currently in off-season after their first year of football. He doesn't plan to join the team next year, because he's not as good as others, but he still loves to play along with other sports with friends. For the longest time, the wife and I didn't really give it much attention. Growing up, I played the same way, and the worst I came out with were a couple of fingers dislocating and a sprained knee. Some friends had it worse, but I guess I never considered my son's health until recently.

&#x200B;

The problem is that he and his friends play tackle football without any pads or proper equipment every weekend. I got a call this past weekend from my son asking about an emergency. Some of them wear cleats (spiked shoes for better traction), and somehow, one of his friends got stepped on face first by the cleats and was bleeding like no other. He ended up going to the ER and getting stitches, but it certainly made me realize that playing tackle football without any protection can lead to far worse things. I know there's been a lot of discussion about concussions and I feel like that is only more expected if you're not wearing helmets.

&#x200B;

So yeah, I told my son he can't play tackle football anymore. I'm fine if he and his friends want to play flag football, but my son started giving a huge fit. Got into an argument, told me he hates me, says how its unfair because I used to play without pads back in the day, how his friends are still planning to play next week,  and any other reason or insult he could think of. My son has been radio silent with me since, and only talking with my wife. My wife is on my side, but she's playing the good cop in this situation so that he is communicating with one of us.

I know he loves football. From fantasy football, to loving his favorite team, playing it, and everything else. I feel like I offered a good alternative to play flag football. It's actually something I still play with some co-workers and it's great. But I just want to know if I made a mistake?

113,Not the A-hole,"Buckle up. Long Story Time!   


I (22 Year old Female) used to work at a bank as an Audio Visual technician, and our Team Lead left, leaving a spot to fill. Instead of hiring a new Lead, they promoted me, and found a new technician (36 Year old Male, Married, 2 Year old Daughter) to fill my job role. 

As the new lead, I was in charge of training this new tech, who had no prior experience in AV, so I went back to basics, and essentially went real slow with the training and explaining everything fully. I thought I was being careful and considerate by really being thorough, BOY I was wrong. 

We'd gone into the storage room to sort through some old kit that needed to be thrown away. He picked up a bunch of cables, and just threw them straight into the recycle box. I politely asked him why he did that, and he just said they need to be thrown. He hadn't even looked at what cables they were. I've literally turned round and said ""Don't be so ignorant, separate the cables out and test them before you just thrown them away. They could still be useful"". No word of lie, hes gone fucking bonkers at me.. ""Stop talking to me as if I am stupid. I am a 36 Year Old Man, with a respectable job, a loving wife and a 2 Year old daughter. I do NOT need to take orders from a self-involved 22 year old woman who thinks she can boss me round"". Oh boy. I lost the plot. I've only gone and literally shouted at the top of my lungs ""Don't talk to me as if I am a fucking baby"". Safe to say, everyone and their mum heard in the office. 

I took a step back from training him from this point. I couldn't be asked to deal with someone so highly strung that they thought the world evolved round him, so I assigned one of the other AV techs (a man) the task of training him. A couple days later I was approached by this tech and he asked if we could speak privately. He explained to me that this nut job had spent the last few days bitching the hell about me.. ""She's a woman, I don't need to take orders from her. She's young enough to be my daughter. She's stupid. She's blonde. Who the fuck put her in charge"" You name the insult, he said it about me.   


I spoke to my Account Manager and he was moved to Hardware, and a week later, he was removed from site entirely.   


No one ever really confirmed to me whether I was the reason he was removed from site, but a week after he was removed from site I heard that he was raising a complaint about me in the workplace. ""Unfair dismissal"" he said.

114,Not the A-hole,"I’ve moved into a home for the first time that is truly nice, after getting married. It has been my dream to entertain at home for a long time, we take it seriously and it is a real joy to share what we have and have a nice time with people we love.

One of my closest friends and his wife (I’ve been close with them both for over a decade, him for much longer) came to visit. They also love to entertain. They’ve had us over for dinner and to stay in their home countless times. They know what it means to host. Actually, I learned a lot of what I know about hosting from them.

When I said “let us cook you dinner” on the phone while setting it up earlier that day, my friend said “no, let us just bring Thai.” My wife has a sensitive stomach and eating prepared food doesn’t always agree with her, so cooking at home is always the preference. I replied that we have a lot of food that fits their dietary restrictions, it would be our pleasure to make them a meal and have a nice night in our home. He said his wife would not eat anything  we prepared, that it’s a weird thing with her, we just need to order Thai.

A good host respects their guests’ needs. So at first I agreed. I didn’t know this quirk, but ok. Thai, then.

But then I started thinking about all the dinner parties in houses these people have told me about. They eat at other people’s houses almost weekly. 

They arrived, we provided appetizers with drinks, she ate them. We ordered Thai. Waited an hour and were starving. There was a mistake with Grubhub, and we would not be delivered the food. My wife threw together a quick and simple meal, which my friend ate and loved. His wife, literally stumbling drunk at this point from drinking cocktails with no food since lunch (which she ate out—she does restaurants, and other peoples’ houses), refused to eat, and became hangry and snappy at her husband, who was hurt and embarrassed. They left.

And I’m left feeling really offended. We’re clean people. We have food for every diet. We wanted to share our one of our simplest pleasures with people who know exactly how nice it is to host your friends. What am I missing here? Am I the asshole for feeling like maybe these people aren’t really friends at all, or at least not the kind of friends you invite to your home? Help me let go of this grudge, or of them.",57,115,0.94

118,No A-holes here,"A little while after we got married, my wife wanted to know when we should start having children.  I told her I am ready for kids even now, but I am obviously willing to wait for her to be ready.  I asked her, however, to keep it a secret from me when she's ready for kids, as I like the idea of being surprised with the news.  At the time, she loved this idea and got very excited, and found it analogous to how I kept the idea of proposing very secret from her until I actually asked her to marry me.  She's always wanted children, but we knew that we wanted a few years to ourselves first.

Fast forward a few years, and several of our close friends and family members have started having children.  I've also noticed advertisements showing up on amazon and pinterest regarding baby announcements and nursery remodels.  Additionally, although my wife is on the pill, I haven't noticed her taking any of her pill medication in almost 6 months.  We always go grocery shopping together, and picking up her prescriptions is just one task that she always assigns to me at the pharmacy while she browses the rest of the grocery store.  Lastly, the amount of sex that we've been having has skyrocketed.  There have been weeks when we would have sex almost every day, and many days it would be about twice a day.

However, she's not pregnant.  I know because she still goes through her periods, and usually right after she has started her period she's usually okay with going out for drinks with friends, while she normally avoids it during the rest of the month.

I have this feeling that there is a possibility that she is trying to get pregnant, but is unsuccessful.  Because I asked her to surprise me, she doesn't have anyone to talk to about this.  I don't want to take away the potential for her to finally surprise me with something she's very excited to tell me, but I also want to be there for her in case she wants to talk about potential infertility issues.  I have no idea if it normally takes this long to get pregnant when she's actively trying.  My brother and his wife got pregnant literally two months after their wedding, and I often wonder if this weighs on her.

Am I the asshole for letting her go through this on her own in her attempt to surprise me?  As a man, what can I do to help?  Should I take any types of pills or supplements to increase the chances from my end that she won't tell me about?

**Edit**:  Sorry that I'm not clear on this.  I'm OKAY with her not surprising me and us working on it together.  I just have a reputation of finding out about surprises she has long before she's ready to tell me.  I knew she was planning a birthday party for me when she accidentally included my number in a reservation for 12 at one of my favorite places.  So when I told her she can try to surprise me with a baby, her eyes lit up because she thought that would be something I could never figure out.  I wanted to let her have this, since I know that's what she wanted, but not at the cost of letting her go through the difficulty of trying to get pregnant all alone.",35,48,0.89

So for background, I work for a company as a junior IT person with 4 people IT people (one being my manager), all of which are more experienced than me by at least 3 years. They are all pals and are very much ""lads lads"" in that there is a lot of slagging eachother and ""banter"". I don't necessarily fit that crieteria since I'm kind of a girly girl.

I mostly get on well with them, but they can get personal very quick and it sometimes gets to me. They will ""joke"" that I'm bad at my job, I lack social skills, act condescendingly towards me and all of this, Infront of other colleagues who are not in their group which to me, makes it worse

At first I would take it pretty personally as I try my best at work, get a lot of praise from others about my work, ect. I learned to take it, laugh along and maybe sometimes fire back but never that much. 

Fastforward to today, a girl who I'm friends with came into the office asking for help with her phone, that she needs to download a document from her phone, but she has no data. I offered her my hotspot, because I have unlimited data and it's no big deal. 

The guys start making fun of me, saying I'm going to far out of my way to accommodate this request and I reply saying ""it's no big deal, if I can help I will"". They ""joke"" that I help people when I shouldn't (my manager included), bringing back an old case where the cleaner brought in a personal laptop, asking if I could get personal files off her broken machine, which I did because it took all of 5 minutes and she cried when I have her the usb with the photos on it. 

In response, I said jokingly but kinda seriously (to my manager) ""well I remember a time when you asked me to set up a work laptop for your wife to use, but it wasn't a problem then was it?""

Everyone mentioned the tension and acted awkward, while my boss laughed and joked I had crossed a line and some things stay within the IT dept.

125,META,"There are so many posts here where people ask a question only for it to be *completely* ignored or improperly judged, simply because people read details in their post that trigger them and react only to that. **This subreddit is not a place to make judgments based on whether or not your values/beliefs agree with OPs' or how you feel about certain contextual details they may include.** We need to aim to give people fair answers to their specific questions based on the relevant information.

For example, let's say OP says they have a non-binary gendered coworker and they're being asked to use pronouns that they aren't used to and they keep accidentally making mistakes, which is upsetting their coworker (adapted from a recent post). Just because you support the LGBTQAI community doesn't mean that OP is the asshole for making the honest mistake of mixing up someone's pronouns. Just because you aren't supportive, it doesn't mean the coworker is the asshole for asking for their preferred pronouns to be used or for being upset at someone's mistakes. The whole gender situation is often a trigger to many Redditors and the focus of their judgment, but it's actually not the focus of the question. The important thing is how these people are acting - whether OP is making the effort to treat someone else with respect and whether that person is making the effort to treat them with respect back.

Just because you hate how OP presents themselves or others in a story or a detail of their story does NOT mean that therefore no matter what else is in the story, OP is/is not the asshole (exceptions exist, such as in one-sided abuse obviously abuser is always the asshole).

Another example - there are a lot of abortion-related posts lately that address whether OP should tell their partner or give them a say. Many people comment about whether abortion is okay or not, and this is NOT helpful to these posters. It doesn't answer OPs' questions. Whether or not they should get an abortion is none of your business and while it may or may not make them *an* asshole, it's not relevant. Instead judge based on details like *why* they are questioning this, whether or not they have a good reason to share or not share information/decisions with someone based on their relationship with that person, both people's behaviors, etc. 

We are all fallible humans wandering around on Spaceship Earth bumping into each other and struggling to do what we think is right and what makes sense to us. A lot of us don't agree on a lot of things. However, we all deserve for the specific judgments we ask about to be answered and to be done so fairly based only on the information *relevant* to our questions (and we can all be guilty of failing to provide this). If you can't control yourself then move on to the next post and comment there instead. Too many people are getting responses that aren't very constructive or focus on the wrong parts of the story and this defeats the purpose of AITA.

Edit - I am NOT saying ignore all details. There seems to be a lot of confusion about that. I was limited in my character count by what I could say. Example - If there is a post where OP talks about getting in a fight over who need to take out the trash with their SO who happens to be a cheater then the SO is *an* asshole for cheating but your judgment should be about the details of the argument and not just label SO as TA because of the irrelevant detail of their infidelity and you hate cheaters.

Edit 2 - I'm sorry if anyone finds my use of the word trigger as offense. I recognize it means different things to different people and if this use has hurt you, my apologies. I myself have ptsd from past traumas and I recognize its meaning can be very different from how some people use it.",140,1384,0.88
126,Not the A-hole,"For a bit of backstory, I live in a condo and underneath me is a mom living with her grown son. These two have caused me problems for years. I work full time and sleep early so I’m never really home and I NEVER throw parties or act loud in absolutely any way other maybe dropping something here or there which is to be expected when living in an apartment. These two clearly live of welfare as they are home 24/7 and seem to take up entertaining themselves by calling the police on me every week and complaining about how extremely loud I am and I won’t let them sleep. They bang on on the ceiling and scream at me at 3 am while I’m sleeping (and have to wake up at 6 am) and claim that I’m being extremely loud and bothersome. One time they call the police on me for being loud while I was OUT on vacation. The condo manager entered my apartment only to find an empty place. Lately these two have been keeping me up because the son will be screaming at the mother for hours, sometimes it sounds like furniture is being thrown around. These don’t sound like little disagreements, but full on screaming fit to the point where he’s losing his voice. I decided that I had enough and took it upon myself to report the son for what seems to be elder abuse and asked if the police can “check up” on them. In my mind I feel like it’s fair as it does sound pretty bad down there and I’m hoping these police visits every now and then will show them that I’m sick of being harassed by them.  Also want to add that I have tried approaching them when i ran into them at the parking lot, but they felt threatened and called a private investigator on me who told me that’s i am never allowed to approach them or I will be “arrested”",40,206,0.95

128,Asshole,"So I (30M) got married 2 years ago to (28F). Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.

Now I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. 

Anyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. 

She seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. 

So when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. 

It's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (30F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?

129,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR at the bottom.

We (90 kids) are on our way back from a geography excursion, and we are catching public transport (bus) back to school. Half of us got on the first bus and even with our group being split up, surprise, seating was a bit of an issue. Luckily it was the middle of the day and the bus was nearly empty. 

My mates and I run up the back being and get seats first. Everyone else gets on and all the seats are now full, obviously a few people are standing up. I see a friend of mine (C) go up to a girl (F) and ask if he can sit next to her (she has her bag on the chair taking up a space). She says no and my friend just continues up to the back and stands. I ask C what happened and he tells me F was saving it for a friend. I give C my seat and stand and don't think much about it.

Halfway back to school I notice F still has her bag on her chair, it didn't look like the friend she was saving the seat for planned on showing up. Bit of background info, F is bisexual and very out going. She has been bullied (the teachers know about it I think it's mostly stopped) in the past about it by people I am in no way involved in. C is also quite shy but otherwise a very nice person, also not involved in the bullying. I go up to her, and knowing her personality (she is very emotional), I do my best to be as non threatening and as easy going as possible. I ask her if either myself or C can sit there, as I've noticed that the seat is empty except for her bag. F then groans and goes ""omg can't you just leave me alone!"". She seemed pissed off. I'm confused so I ask why can't I sit there. At this point a few of the girls behind her are telling me to piss off etc. One of them is my mates gf and I don't want to get into the shits with her so I leave it at that and go back to my mates.

From the way people responded it seems like I was being a dick, which is why I brought this here. If I am the asshole an explanation as to why would be great.

TL;DR: Ask a girl to move her bag because the bus is packed and there are no seats. She responds as if I've slapped her. AITA.

130,Asshole,"My girlfriend has been an off and on again smoker for years. I absolutely cannot stand it, the smell, or any of it. We’re only in our mid twenties and I’ve been trying to get her to quit now before it kills her in 20 years. 

The other night she came home absolutely reeling of smoke and I asked her straight up if she had started again. She said no but I didn’t believe her. So I waited until she went to bed that night and I looked through her purse and found a pack of smokes hidden underneath a bunch of crap. I threw them out in the dumpster outside our apartment building. 

When she woke up she started rummaging through her purse and I asked her if she was looking for her smokes because if she is I threw them out last night. She started raising her voice at me that I had no right to do that and I shot back at her that she shouldn’t have lied to me about starting again. 

She stormed off to work and we’ve barely spoken to each other in a few days now. We’ve been together almost three years and this is our first significant argument up until now. 

When we have talked, it starts out as a normal conversation but it quickly devolves into her accusing me of being a controlling asshole and me calling her a liar. 

So, AITA for throwing out her cigarettes?

The other day a woman who must have been in her mid-late 70s got on the bus and stood near me. There were no free seats and I wasn't sat in an area specifically for elderly people or anything like that. She kept giving me hacky side glances and tutting the entire journey.

134,Not the A-hole,"hey, first of all, thx for the judgement on my last post.

yesterday evening, my girlfriend (27) of a year and me (m27) wanted to watch a movie, i had already opened the shining on netflix and went to the toilet real quick. when i came back, lina looked at me kind of shocked and said that she wanted to brows netflix and accidently hovered over one of my bookmarks, where she found porn sites. They are pretty old bookmarks from like 4 years ago (I know, stupid on me to leave them) and I told her exactly that. She then asked whether i watch porn, and I said that while I haven't watched it in a while 'cause I'm super happy with our sexlife, I have watched it while we're in a relationship.

That's where her whole world fell apart, she started crying, said she is disgusted.. I said it doesn't mean anything at all, that she is my center of attention and the one who i desire over everything and that our sexlife is awesome, and that i did it because we're in a long distance relationship and it can get my imagination going etc. She said that makes it worse. She is disgusted and humiliated that i would masturbate to other women's bodies, and to see them cum, and that i lied when i told her a couple of days ago that she is the only one i want, she says that i don't suffice her. she says apparently the nudes she sends me aren't enough, and i said that i love them over everything and masturbate to them all the fucking time. i tried to explain and explain, that for me it isn't attached to feelings, just visual, but she didn't want to hear it, said to go fuck myself etc.. but to be honest i can also understand her, and told her that i would never watch porn again, and that it's reasonable to demand that, but she doesn't want that either.

i'm in her country (europe) for the whole month, and to be honest, the last weeks weren't really easy either, she is quite insecure because of the distance and pretty emotional also.. i tried to console her the rest of the evening but it didn't work at all, she only said that she thought i wasn't like that, that something's broken.. she was inconsolable, and when it was kind of time to sleep, i asked her several times what position would help her the most so that i can cuddle her, and she said several times just sleep in your sleep position. i did that and then she said how i could really leave her to sleep like that.. i tried to console again and tbh became frustrated, and said i'm really trying to do everything to help you her and it's still not enough maybe that's where i am the asshole? i didn't really want to excuse either, and said that i didn't really do anything wrong, maybe also asshole? sorry for this blur, i'm emotional and clueless to and promised not to speak to friends about it..

I don't know what to do, i feel on a communicative level we're not really compatible.. she cried so much and is so sad and broken on the inside, WIBTA for ending it when she comes back from work tonight?

136,Not the A-hole,"Start things off with first post, sorry if I’m doing anything wrong and I’m writing this on my phone.

My (id like to say ex) best friend’s 18th birthday was last year. I got her tickets to Twenty One Pilots. Not gonna lie, tickets weren’t cheap. $132 AUD each

I thought it would be fun, we could camp out together, get ready and have fun together, ya know what best friends do with each other. Fast forward to her actual birthday when I told her I got her tickets. She was very excited obviously because she loves this band but after that date she talked to me less and less. I just blew it off as school because year 12 was stressful

Fast forward again to the concert night. She got there a bit before me because I had exams, work and what not. I thought okay cool I’ll go get my number to wait in line thinking she’d save me a number because I got our tickets, we were gonna go together. Nope. I got there, got a quick hello from my supposed good friend and then she ran off for the rest of the wait (around 18 hours). Not only that but her girlfriend was yelling at me for some stupid not relevant reason so I just left. 

My friend then told me to leave the day of the concert and not be with her because she was with other people and ignored me whenever I tried to talk to her. Ngl not a fun time

Fast forward again to my birthday. I have major social issues and I HATE opening presents in front of people and she knows that so I said thanks and put the present next to me. She got REAL upset about that and forced me onto the couch to open it. 2 candles, a fridge magnet and a kangaroo keychain. She got upset when she didn’t see absolute enthusiasm and for the rest of the night her girlfriend was kinda dirty looking me

My dilemma is that I’ve grown up my entire being thankful for anything I receive. it’s a privilege not an expectation to get a birthday present. And people have told me I’m a stuck up ass for not being thrilled with candles and Australian themed souvenirs(we’re both Australians so really it’s nothing special) it’s eating me up inside not being grateful

Edit: for those wondering, I used to be best friends with her and her girlfriend, they started dating (they met through me) and like any relationship that starts like this i got pushed out of the picture. I have no idea why the girlfriend hates me though (she’s made it very clear)",106,544,0.96
137,Not the A-hole,"I recently won a ‘fuck you’ amount of money. I won’t say exactly how much but it’s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It’s enough to change the life of myself and my family. 

My ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. 

She was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She’s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I’m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven’t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. 

Long story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I’m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I’m not *in* love with her. We’ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I’m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don’t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?

138,Not the A-hole,"I (M) am the 7th of 7, 5F 2M Sister I'm refering to is 2 years older and #6.

3 years ago my sister got married and chose her wedding date for a time when my parents were going on a cruise with my Grandfather and aunt etc. She wanted them to cancel to go and they straight up said no if you want us to be there then change the date (they had already paid and planned for about a year.) so she changed it to my birthday, whatever no big deal.

I suffer from clinical depression and at that time was going through the task of getting on a medication that worked for me and I was very unstable. (been depressed since 4th or 5th grade maybe earlier) I was 21 at this time living with my parents and working a part time job (~30hrs a week) and I did a lot on my parents farm. She was also living with my parents and would constantly harass me at least 3 times a week telling me I was a PoS and would never be better than her soon to be husband and I should just KMS.

Over the next few months I was constantly verbally assaulted with that fact I was a PoS and should KMS at least 2-3 times a week. I was also informed by my favorite sister #5 that she said no one could mention it was my birthday after 11 am that day. I had already made plans to go visit a friend for that weekend for my birthday (about 2 hours away) which I was told to cancel because it was her wedding (I had planned it before she got engaged.) I really didn't want to go (I hate large social gatherings) and she was being her narcissistic self.

I ending up going only because I wanted to hang out with my grandfather (then 89), who lives 1/2 way across the country and I don't get to see very often. I basically just kept him company the entire time and enjoyed listening to his WW2 stories. The wedding was okay (honestly pretty shitty now that I attended one of my friend's wedding) and I left as soon as I had eaten with my grandfather. I said goodbye to my eldest sister and her family (they live near my grandfather and were leaving for home right after) and went home.

Once she moved I avoided her as much as possible and refused to go to family reunions etc if she was there. I told my parent's that I wanted nothing to do with her and I wouldn't be in any family photos with her there. If I attended any family gathering with her there (without my knowledge) I avoided her and left as early as I could.

My parent's think I'm an ass for not being around her and ""forgiving her"" for the way she treated me.

It's been 3.5 years and I'm finishing up my schooling and planning to move (my sister moved back in the same small town where my family lives) and I would have no plans to visit afterwards.

Parents think ITA for avoiding her and not forgiving her for being abusive for years and that I won't visit them when I finish my schooling if she's there or be in any family photos including her.

My family knows she told me to KMS often and honestly only #1 and #5 defend me.",38,81,0.95

140,Not the A-hole,"Ok so kinda a boring post but this interaction really bothered me. Around 4am, I couldn’t sleep so I decided to get a coffee from Tim Hortons (Canadians amirite??) I’m a little out of it due to the little to no sleep I got in the past 2 days (a lot on my mind) and when I got out of the elevator I saw a guy just standing outside the lobby entrance (phone directory or fob to get into the building) and I kept walking because I didn’t feel comfortable opening the building entrance for what could be a dangerous person- also being a 21F I felt concerned for my own safety. As I walk away to the side exit he pounds at the door and I turn back and realize it’s someone who lives in this building (I’ve lived in this building for majority of my life so Im familiar with most of the residents) when I let him in he snapped at me and said “it’s common sense to open the door because I live here and why else would I be standing there. I said “No, it’s common sense not to open the door for the safety of the residents especially at this hour”. 

So my question is AITA for not letting him in when I first saw him at the door? 

I felt kinda bad after the interaction because there’s been times where my brother has forgotten his fob and was stuck in the lobby for ages. 

Edit 1: for the peeps that said I should’ve been more calm with my response to him; I see why you would say that, however, he snapped in a loud tone and I was taken back and I responded in a sassy way, but not in a way that escalated the situation- I used my indoor voice lmao",67,195,0.89

143,Not the A-hole,"A little backstory- I was born in Canada and raised there until I was about 3. I was then put up for adoption because my parents couldn’t afford me and my brother, so when they moved to the US for work they put me up. I got adopted when I was 4 by a low middle class family. 



So now I’m 25 and have been married happily to my wife for 4 and a half years now. Life has been great up until the beginning of last year. My foster parents have been badgering me and my wife to have a kid, they even told my wife (after my wife told them that she couldn’t with her working situation) that she should just quit her job and that we can live off of one income. My income is only able to support a 2 person family at best so trying to support a baby will result in the same thing my parent did with me(I forgot to mention that I still talk with my biological parents very often). So after dealing with them constantly calling us and asking us every time we visit if “we’ve woken up and realized we needed a kid”( their exact words). Me and my wife have decided to delete their numbers off our phone block them on all social media and completely get them out of our life. Now were thinking it might be an overreaction, any opinions?


EDIT: Important info left out- we have told them our opinion on the situation and every time we do it ends in an argument about how they deserve a grandchild and how were being selfish. Also when they talk to us about this they use a condescending voice and it makes us just feel like complete idiots.

145,Not the A-hole,"So this girl and I have been friends since high school, we bonded over 1D and Little Mix, and we lost touch for a little while after she graduated. When we started talking again she had a toddler and now she got lucky with twins. She's in a stable relationship that has a stable income and she always wanted kids, so I'm super happy for her! The problem is that she won't stop talking about her children. Yes, I get it, they're your kids and you love them, but stfu about them for half a second. I'll be telling her that I'm not feeling good and I don't want to talk right now and she'll tell me to go babysit her kids (for free!) cause that'll make me feel better. I know it's a joke, but she knows I don't like kids most of the time, and as I don't know hers and I don't agree with the way her and her SO are raising them, there's no way in hell that would ever be funny. And she knows that. 

Last week I kind of snapped. It was a build up of her ignoring my requests to stop talking about her kids when I'm in a bad mood (whether that means mad or sad or anything that means I can't just send her supporting messages while she discusses how tired she is). I was in a certain amount of pain and she kept repeating ""oh I get it, with the 3 demons around I'm constantly aching"" or versions of that and I just snapped. Idk what happened, but I told her something along the lines of ""You know we used to be friends because we had things in common, now we're friends because you have no other old friend left because you keep talking about your kids all the time. Having kids doesn't make you special and it definitely does not allow you to compare your pain - which is caused by your choices - and mine - which is due to a chronic pain disorder that has been ruining/controlling my life for the better part of 3 years."" She told me that was harsh and unfair but I just told her that I had repeatedly told her to stop with her kids and her comparing her kid-related problems to my health problems. She told me I had been rude about her kids for a while now and that I should just tell her if I didn't love them. So I told her that I had never met them and that I don't like kids, ""do the math.""

147,Not the A-hole,"So I agreed to go to an out of town wedding with my boyfriend, and a few weeks in advance I asked what I should wear. I didn't own a suit, and wanted to know if slacks and a button down would be too casual. I had plenty of money to be able to afford a suit, and as an adult man it would be reasonable for me to have one anyway.  He told me that it would be totally fine, I didn't need a suit. 

Flash forward to the night before we leave for the wedding, we're packing and I notice he's packing a suit.  I said I thought we didn't need suits and he said I'd still be fine without one, but he was going to wear one.  This got me concerned that I'd be really underdressed.  I asked him if he could please not wear a suit, since I still didn't have one and had no way to get one in time.  I assumed this would be fine, since he told me it'd be okay not to wear one in the first place.  He probably just didn't realize that I'd feel a lot more comfortable: I knew that if we were dressed to the same level, I'd feel less out of place (you know, solidarity and all that). I didn't know anyone at the wedding and am just self conscious about being over/under dressed to things generally.  To my surprise, he outright refused.  He said HE'D feel underdressed and out of place at a wedding without a suit. We argued about it for awhile, and at the end of the day he still refused to dress down at all.

This hurt my feelings quite a bit because it felt like he was choosing appearances over my feelings.  Essentially he'd rather me feel underdressed than him, even when he told it'd be fine in the first place.  If he wouldn't feel comfortable without a suit, why would he tell me I'd be okay without one? I couldn't (and still don't) understand--if the roles were reversed, I'd dress down in a heartbeat.

I recognize that this is a small deal, it sounds silly even writing it, but to me that almost makes it worse--I was having a ton of anxiety about it, and it seems like such a small thing for him to just dress down to the level he told me was reasonable.  On the other hand, I wonder if I'm the asshole for being hurt and making such a big deal out of this, because it's his decision to wear what he wants to wear and I shouldn't be trying to control that even if it WOULD make me feel a lot more comfortable?

150,Not the A-hole,"This is my first post and it’s on mobile so sorry for length and/or format. 

So here’s some background. My best friend has been dating a boy for a few years and she’s always telling me how she’s jealous of me and my girlfriend (I proposed on New Years to her) and how she can’t wait for her boyfriend to propose. We often call each other as we live in separate states. She works the night shift though so I have to stay up in order for this to happen. 
Usually 2-4 am

So she called me a few nights ago and we started talking about anime and games. She often asks me to recommend anime to her as I know what she likes. We start talking about one with a couple as the main characters which leads to us talking about marriage. She tells me her boyfriend is gonna propose to her. 

I tell her I’m happy for her and ask if I’ll be invited to the wedding to which she says of course. She then tells me how she told her boyfriend which rings she would like. I say that’s cool I see couples do that fairly often. Then she tells me several other details she told him she wanted for his proposal to which I’m a little put off as it robs him of his opportunity for creativity. 

I tell her that I think that’s a little restrictive and the setting shouldn’t matter. I go on a little rant about how nothing outside of the two of you should matter except the moment. I can tell I upset her as she’s pretty quiet for the rest of the phone call and I feel bad. I tell her I’m sorry for upsetting her and wish her a good night.

I text her a good morning but leave her alone to let her calm down the next day. She tells me a few hours later that she told her boyfriend not to propose. I am shocked and I immediately feel bad and ask her if it was because of what I said. She says it doesn’t matter anymore. I feel terrible but I feel it’s not all my fault. Yes I did say I disagreed with the way she was doing things but ultimately she made the decision based off what I said. Wouldn’t that mean she agreed with me? Or did I pressure her? Normally she listens to what I say and just hears me out. This was one of the few times she acted on MY opinion. She’s mad at me and I feel terrible.",27,28,0.88

* Partner and I together for 11+ years
* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  
* ~~2~~ 3 dogs die over the years. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward

---

**~5 years ago**

Partner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.

* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need
* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. 
* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.

My partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?

---

**ONE week goes by:**

* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone
* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. 

---

**Today:**

* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. 
* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner ""wins"" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.
* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.
* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.

---

**I should note:**

* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit 
* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.
* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.

153,Asshole,"So I’m a student at a pretty big university. I have a couple of hours in between my first two classes of the day, so I usually try and snag this small sound proof study room to get some work done in between classes. So this particular day its empty, so I rush in and shut the door and unpack my stuff. This study room is big enough for maybe 5 people. It’s a circle and it’s around 10 x 10 ft, maybe smaller. I start doing some work for class (this particular assignment I was drawing sketches) when another student that I didn’t know opened the door and sat down and said “you don’t mind, do you?” I was so shocked that someone would come in to such a small space with someone they don’t know that I just looked at them and didn’t say anything. She pulls out some fast food from her bag and starts eating loudly, to where I can hear her spit sloshing around. That sound grosses me out so I’m getting pretty angry when her phone starts vibrating, and to my surprise she actually picks up  and answers the phone call. She talks to the person on the phone for about 30 seconds and then hangs up. Then, she starts playing music through her headphones and typing away on her laptop. This whole time I’m just trying to do my sketches, but I’m getting more and more fed up with her behavior. I can hear her music despite the fact that she is wearing headphones, and her typing on her keyboard is echoing throughout the study room. I decided Ive had enough but I couldn’t ask her to leave because I technically hadn’t said no when she walked in, so I opened my laptop and started playing a random YouTube video pretty loud and pretended like I was playing attention to it. I felt her immediately look up at me but I pretended I didn’t notice until about 20 seconds pass and she says “do you have headphones or anything that you can put in?” I said no (i actually did) to which she replied “well can you turn it down a bit?

155,Everyone Sucks,"Asking about/for a friend.

My friend's been in a relatively loveless marriage with her husband, let's call him B, for several years, & they have 2 young children together.

I met them both a few years ago, early into the marriage, & have always been cordial with B. They've always seemed like a bad fit for one another. Conflicting personality types, different hobbies, even different tastes in food. But they're married, I always figured they had some deeper connection. Also, I didn't feel I knew her well enough to say anything.

Over the years though, the conflicts between them have escalated, and a few months ago I felt so uncomfortable by a fight they had in front of me that I had to say something to her. I told her it often seemed like they were a bad match for each other, because of their many differences. I also felt he was being mean & dismissive to her.

At that point, she told me a lot that I didn't know. For one thing, the meanness--which she describes as ""contempt""--is apparently a personality trait that she's been trying to parse for years. He seems to genuinely want to understand why she is upset in a given situation, but despite his sincerest efforts, he can't seem to put himself in her position mentally. ""He lacks empathy,"" is what she told me. ""He doesn't mean to, and he doesn't think he does, but he can't understand other ppl's feelings."" And then, she says, he gets mad.

TBH I was a little dismissive of this cuz I thought that was kind of a cop-out way to avoid the real issue of being poorly matched for one another. I asked if she'd ever brought it up to him, she said yes, but he got so offended & angry that she never wanted to bring it up again.

So fast forward to yesterday. My friend told me that they'd been going to see a marriage counselor for a few months. She specifically found a marriage counselor who specializes in spectrum disorders, but not in a conspicuous way, so as to keep the information from B. After several long meetings, the counselor agreed with my friend that yes, B \[might be\] on the spectrum, and yes, he appears to be unable to empathize w/ other ppl. This helped to explain a lot of confusing behavior for my friend, because she did not want to believe that he actually \*was\* as unkind as he had been behaving towards her. The counselor's agreement was comforting to her because it gave her a framework through which to understand his behavior.

My friend feels relieved to have some answers, though of course the challenge now is B doesn't have a clue. It sucks that she did it so secretively, I'm sure he'll think she's an asshole, but I feel like, maybe that's to be expected, given the circumstances?

So... I guess what I'm asking, IS my friend TA for having him evaluated behind his back?

*edit: I did not mean to imply that all people with ASD cannot feel empathy, learn how to act on empathy even if it's not first nature to them, or understand feelings. I do not believe that, & I apologize if it reads that way. The 3000 character limit forced me to delete a lot of context about my two friends, and I did not mean to be reductive or ableist in my depiction. I added a bit more to clarify.*",46,35,0.92

Around 9pm, after three and a half hours of no contact and ignored texts and calls I decided I would call the clinic she had her placement at to make sure she had arrived safely. So I called, they said she was there, and that was that. Moments later I start receiving texts from her saying how the secretary at the clinic thought I was controlling and how embarrassed she was.

Now, what i feared at the start happened. My spouse met someone online and it only started as a friendship but there was frequent communication between them behind my back for months. the contact is now permanent (every day several times) and the nature of the relationship is different and there are feelings involved.

I was asked for the divorce and even tho i wanted to try to fix the marriage i agreed to not contest it just to make things easier and cheaper avoiding courts. But when we were deciding how to split assets (my spouse does not think i deserve anything because earn almost a third of their wage and i did not contribute the same economically) I was lied to and i knew it.

I invaded their privacy (i know is bad but consider the magnitude of a divorce) to find the truth and that is when i discovered the affair and that there is money that my spouse tried to hide from me. I collected evidence of both things in case we end up in court.

164,Asshole,"Sigh. I think I messed up.

My parents do not live in a very populated US city, they're around 60yo, and my dad's been laid off from his old job about half a year ago. He's been applying for jobs and finally got a written offer.

The offer is for the same amount that he's been getting for years: it's a decent amount but by no means very high.

I don't live with my parents and I work in a different industry, but having gone through several job offers and successful negotiations, I suggested that my dad asks for a +$5k raise. The reply email was crafted very carefully, stating that 1) he appreciates the offer and the initial meeting 2) he's wondering if there's any flexibility in the offer because he believes he can bring a lot to the team and the company and 3) finally asking if they're willing to go for +$5k.

Initially my dad hesitated (I think because he's been tired of searching for a job for so long), but eventually he agreed to try it. My thought process was:

1. He deserves more -- he really is amazing in his industry
2. It's an initial negotiation and he's not asking for an outrageous amount on top of the initial offer
3. He's never agreed to any previous offer from them (or discussed any potential salary), so there's no reason why he can't try to ask for a bit more
4. The email was extremely professional and polite, structured so they could easily have replied back with ""no, that's our best and final offer""

To my shock, the employer's contact called back (not emailed back) 3 days later saying they're rescinding the offer...(!)

Wat. The only reason I can think of is that they were so unsure of whether to hire him or not initially, that they either 1) decided not to bother or 2) found someone else.

Of course my dad feels horrible now, and so do I. And if it wasn't for my convincing, he would probably have that job by now.

Am I the asshole for getting involved and should we not have negotiated?

165,Not the A-hole,"I(18F) come from a traditional family. My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it’s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.

My bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don’t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn’t get it.

He also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don’t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it’s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.

Last weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn’t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn’t date a girl with a higher salary.

I called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I’m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. 

So, AITA for getting “triggered” and thinking he’s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?

EDIT: throwaway because I don’t want bf to see this

EDIT: WOW I did not expect this to get so many responses. Thank you all for your advice! I haven’t had time to respond to any but I appreciate it. 

I have decided just to break it off with him tonight. I’m going to be honest with him and tell him this is why. Even though his behavior is annoying we have still had some fun times and I have known him for a long time so it’s hard, but I’m telling myself this is for the best since I am going to college and he is going to work for his uncle’s business next year, and the long distance thing would have just added another challenge.

One thing I would like to add is that my boyfriend is still a kid and this is the way he was raised so I don’t think he deserves all the hate on here. He is half black/half Mexican and the Mexican side of the family is veryyy traditional and strictly enforce those gender rules and it seems like it’s a really big deal in their culture (at least to his elders).  He is under pressure to act this way. So yeah there is that cultural divide that I probably should have mentioned but didn’t think to in my OP. ",774,4337,0.93

169,Not the A-hole,"So last August some friends of a friend needed a place for their dog since they moved into an apartment. The dog was already at their parents, but they were moving houses so they need somewhere for 2 months. They offered about 40 bucks a month for food for him (just barely enough for him).  

After they eventually dropped him off he settled in nicely. The dog is a very active breed and we have a decent sized yard, and a dog park nearby which he loves. 

He was meant to be gone by December so my mum and I tried to not get attached. December comes around and the owners visited because I found a tick and had already taken it out at the vet. So they also came to drop if some tick protect since they pretty much get it for free. They only visited the dog once before a couple of weeks after we got him. 

At that time they were saying it would be be best he just stays at ours, and essentially saying they had no where for him to go for the foreseeable future. I was happy because I had already grown attached, but my mum had been wary till then. So they stopped paying every month, since we thought he was ours.

Fast forward to yesterday when we got a text from the owner saying they want to move him to live in an apartment with their friend in the city. We were furious and saddened. We were mad that they wanted to keep him in an apartment with no grass (active, medium breed) and sad that they wanted to take him.

The owner says she misses him but has only visited them twice in 8 months, to which they in the area every weekend. We've put so much love into caring for him and have even taught him new tricks. The poor dog has been uprooted so many time already and is still very young.

Am I the asshole for wanting to keep him?

172,No A-holes here,"Hi guys! My partner (not married) and I have been together since college- 18 years. When we graduated we had nothing (including thankfully student loan debt). We both got jobs and worked for 6 or 7 years. At that point we decided to open our own business with the intent i would work there and She would quit and join me when the business could afford to support both of us. The business made a job for me but never earned as much as we hoped so she never quit her day job. At the same time her career skyrocketed as she kept quickly moving up the ladder. She currently has a high power high stress job and is a 6 figure earner. We share all assets (business, House, cars, etc) but our retirement accounts which are only in our own name. 

In the course of the last decade she has amassed a tremendous retirement account while I literally have about 20k as many years I would forgo investing to save cash for business or home projects. So when the discussion of of splitting our assets she said she would keep all her retirement because she has had a challenging and stressful career that has required years of long hours. At the same time she says I have had it relatively easy being able to set my own schedule and take vacations whenever I want. While this is pretty much true (although there have been stressful stretches for me) the way I see it is we started together with nothing and built everything we have together. We made the decision together to start the business and I quit my day job (with benefits like retirement) to run it. 

I have no reason to believe we will ever break up but I find this difference in philosophy angers me. If feel like we’re either in together all the way or why bother at all and just keep all assets separate? To be fair, I am in line for a decent inheritance (she will be getting nine from her family) and she claims she shouldn’t get that if we break up but I don’t know if she’s just saying that at the moment to make a point.

Am I the asshole for expecting half of my partners retirement?






**EDIT:** Hi everyone! I really appreciate all the feedback. It's good to hear other folk's perspective on this. Just like my partner and I it looks like opinions are split roughly down the middle with the top comment being NAH. There's been some requests for INFO so I'll add and emphasis a bit here and then I'm going to quote a couple of comments that play in to my perspective. As a reminder, we both had nothing the day we graduated college.

INFO: We don't judge others for getting married but neither of us believe in it for several reasons. It only matters to this discussion because it legally protects spouses and we won't be getting the legal protection because we never tied the knot. Someone posted the list of states with common law (a law specifically designed to protect people in my situation) marriages. We don't live in one. In this case us not getting married may have screwed me if we ever break up.

About the business; I mentioned that we planned on both working there eventually. We both cashed out our retirements to open this business. It was about a 50/50 input. In part because it never became as lucrative as we hoped (we were a bit naive going in it turns out) and also due to my partner's success in her career she has never joined me running the business. During her darkest hours of her job a few years ago I begged (many times over the course of a couple years) her to quit and to help run it. It makes enough that we can do this. But it would mean a big decline in income and we would have to change our lifestyle. That wasn't worth it to my partner. Her awful chauvinist boss finally got fired and her work life is a million times better now. Something I may not have emphasized enough in the OP, opening the business was a group decision. I gave up my career path and all the benefits that came with it because we decided together that I had a better skill set than she did to get it off the ground. It was my choice for sure, but it was also our choice and in fact the business was her idea and concept.

In the last 10+ her employer contributes and she also contributes the max to her retirement 401k. The part she contributes is cash we would otherwise have as a couple. While she was doing that all the cash I was getting from our business went directly to our next investments and projects. We now jointly own a couple rentals because instead of contributing to my retirement we saved for down payments.Yes, this was my choice but it was also our choice.

Here's a couple of quotes that resonate with me:

From u/centurion44

> it's wrong to spend a liftetime with a partner and leave them high and dry because ""they didn't earn this"". It's an inherent failure to understand what the word partner means.

From u/ehemthrowsaway

>  in mutually deciding to start a business, she helped convince him to forsake his financial security because she had hers, she's obligated to fulfill her promise, even if it wasn't explicit or legal.

From u/curiousdragon (this riled up some folks but I agree in this case as I see the business as 'our baby')

>no different then a SAHM deserving funds in a divorce.

There's many comments about marriage. To me if you need marriage to save yourself from your partner why are you with your partner in the first place?

Here's my lesson: I went into all of this assuming we were a team 100%. In every single way (every asset is shared) except our retirements we are 100% partners. I would have never agreed to taking on the business if I would have known it may cost me hundreds of thousands down the road. I guess I'm an idiot for not having this conversation. I never thought I would have to because my partner is so woke about equality. It turns out we're all woke when it suits us.

In summary I traded my retirement potential for joint assets. It was my (our) choice. My partner did not make this choice. I never in a million years thought investing in joint assets could be bad for me because I assumed we are a team. I now know we are not a team like I thought. I got another piece of advice from a comment:

From u/Ms1776

>Why don't you just stick your inheritance in your retirement fund?

This is what I will do. I always figured my inheritance would be a boon for both of us as a team. I was wrong. Instead it will be used to protect myself from poor decisions I made with my partner. The worst part of all of this is the dissapointment and heartbreak I feel. Losing the sense of us. Nothing has changed on the ground. We're fine. But I need to process this shift. I need time to realize that we aren't what I thought we were. I'll leave you with this quote that struck me when I first read it 25 years ago:

> In “Mother Night,” Kurt and Jane were a nation of two. “The world is divided into two groups: us, and the other people,” he told her. “We’ll win against any combination of powers.”

174,No A-holes here,"This sounds bad, but I'll elaborate. I don't often tell people I am in a relationship **unless the conversation warrants it** (i.e. the discussion shifts to talking about our partners, etc.) 

In my perspective, this isn't necessarily ""lying"" per se, as much as it is the omission of irrelevant details. 

My primary reason for this is that I have been criticized before (particularly by men) claiming that I'm entitled for thinking they ""want me"" because I told them I was in a relationship straight-up. 

This has been an area of contention for me because, on one hand, it does seem a bit odd to disclaim that outright, but on the other hand, I have gotten shit for ""leading people on,"" if I don't reveal my relationship status early on in a conversation.

My boyfriend is uncomfortable by my decision to keep our relationship relatively private unless I am asked/the context permits it, but he also has a better sense of intuition than I do. 

My environment makes it so I constantly interact with individuals my age that I'm obligated to be nice/courteous to, and I am a petite and relatively conventionally attractive woman. This makes my boyfriend worry because I have been confronted both publicly and privately by people after ""leading them on,"" which compromises my safety.

My partner isn't insecure and our relationship isn't unhealthy, but AITA if I decide to continue only discussing my relationship status when asked or when the social context permits it?

EDIT: I forgot to add, I have a fairly ""friendly"" face, I'm naive, and I believe in looking for the good in people. This has led to a lot of sticky situations for myself with people perceiving my niceness as flirtation or something they can take advantage of. I try to invest myself emotionally in my friends and even acquaintances as much as I can, which again, is sometimes perceived as flirtation. ",75,72,0.9

176,Everyone Sucks,"The son of one of my husband's family friends showed up to my wedding in his marines formal wear, complete with all his medals. Now, I have nothing against anyone in the military but this was a black tie optional wedding and frankly it felt very out of place and it seemed like he was just trying to show off. My wedding had over 300 guests and nobody else felt the need to wear something to make them stand out.

Up until the point that I asked him to leave, he of course was acting very well mannered and like a complete gentleman, as one might expect from a member of the armed forces, and there were even a few excited teenage girls at my wedding who wanted to take a picture with him, to which he graciously agreed. Many people were thanking him for his service, and frankly it just felt like the only reason he wore that was to be in the spotlight and make it about him, which I don't think you are supposed to do at someone else's wedding. If he wants to wear that to his own wedding then fine, but the whole point of having a dress code at a wedding is so that no one guest will stand out too much.  I felt that he should have known this, since the whole point of uniforms in the military is so that you don't stand out from everyone else!

I felt kind of bad about asking him to leave, but it just didn't feel right for him to be there like that.

One of my employees was getting married and she sent me an invitation.   I had only been managing this particular location for a month, and I did not know her prior to transferring to the location.  Instead of attending a strangers wedding, I sent her a card with a short hand written note congratulating the bride and groom.  

A few days after the wedding, the employye sent me an email asking if I was aware that the card did not have any money in it.   I thought this was extremely tacky and asked if a gift was the only reason I was invited.  

Am I required to buy a gift if I dont attend?  Should I have not sent a card congratulating the couple?

178,Asshole,"So the title maybe doesn't put me in the best light, but hear me out. I had a crush on this girl, we flirted, she apparently told her friends about me, she told one of my friends she liked me, and then she basically got a bf, out of nowhere, after months of (apparent) relationship building, where she was very touchy and flirty. I took it in stride and basically abandoned her, I stopped speaking to her for months, I ignored her messages and pretended she had never existed or mattered to me when my friends brought her up.

Anyway, a few months back we kind of reconciled I guess, and she's been more open with me. She's stayed at my place a few times, though I wasn't interested in touching her. She said I love you to me and I said it back. A few days after that I told her about a girl I've been crushing on, and a while later I told her the other girl sent me underwear pics. She seemed off, but I kept flirting with her, and spending time with her.

But, I've been getting incredibly bored of her, and I've frankly never trusted her or enjoyed her company that much ever since the initial rejection over a year ago. I started by ignoring her in public, in front of her friends, when she saw me at coffee shops and so on. I also posted a snap story, a private one with only me, her and a few others able to view, about this amazing girl I've met, and who I'm falling for (not true, no such girl exists), and she basically stopped speaking to me.

I know this probably makes me look bad, but can people understand where I'm coming from. Or am i an asshole, who wasted her time and hurt her out of spite? A friend told me something of that nature yesterday.

185,Asshole,"When I was 20 years old and a student, I met a girl online who was 26 and worked as a nurse. She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated ""naturally"" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.

My wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fiancée, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.

I've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about ""what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...

The whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.

My GF's best friend and her husband invited my GF, our two small children and I to a trip over memorial day weekend. The husband is a big drinker but I figured if it was just us and them it wouldn't be too big of a deal. They just had a baby. I did expect them to drink but I didn't think it would be everyone getting sloppy. Well my GF told me after we accepted the invite that two of the husbands friends and his parents are going. They are all big drinkers. I've heard stories about their family get togethers and they sound a lot like when I would drink, everyone gets sloppy and behaves obnoxiously. Had I known they were going initially I would have declined. For a few days I was trying to find a way to tell my gf I didn't want to go but couldn't. I am a bit ashamed honestly.

189,No A-holes here,"For reasons unbeknownst to either of us, my girlfriend's dog is absolutely terrified of me.  This is the usual routine when we enter her apartment together:

- The dog hears the door open and excitedly runs around the corner to see my girlfriend.  As soon as it lays eyes on me, it turns around as fast as possible (you can hear its nails scratching the carpet) and sprints into the furthest away room to hide in the corner.

- As it runs away, it pisses and shits all over the floor in terror.

- At this point my girlfriend is embarrassed and asks me to stay near the door while she cleans up the piss and shit.

- The dog then stays in the corner of that one room and will not move under any circumstances (unless I come near it, in which case it sprints away as fast as it possibly can).  Despite having dated this girl since last summer, I have never once seen her dog voluntarily come out of that corner, including instances when I stayed over for three or four days at a time.  I'm not exaggerating.  It will stay in that corner, motionless, for days on end.  If she picks it up and walks over to me, then it starts violently thrashing like a fish out of water until she puts it down so it can run away.  If I stand right outside the room it hides in, then it just stares at me and visibly trembles in fear.  My girlfriend has to put the food bowl right in front of it so it can eat without leaving the corner because otherwise it just won't eat, sometimes for days.  And even when the food bowl is right in front of it, my girlfriend says it doesn't eat as much when I'm around as it usually does.

- Whenever I leave, my girlfriend says it's playful, affectionate, and ""a totally different dog.""  I've never witnessed this behavior.

I should also note that there was an incident in December when I pet it and it aggressively bit me multiple times, so bad that people were asking me what happened to my hands.  I now have scars on both of my hands and haven't tried to interact with it since then.

My girlfriend has dropped some hints that she'd like to move in together, but frankly I don't want to live with that dog.  And I don't think I'm being unreasonable.  Why would I want an animal around when it: A) pisses and shits all over the place whenever I come over, B) refuses to interact with me in any capacity whatsoever, and C) has a history of attacking me.  And frankly, if the dog is this deathly afraid of me, then us living together honestly wouldn't be good for it either.

She has in her instagram bio something about “just a couple New Yorkers trying to make it in suburbia” or something like that. She often posts on social media about missing home with a pic of NYC. She even picked up a slight accent. We recently went to our cousins wedding in NYC, she posted a selfie on instagram with me and the bride and was like “you know you’re from new york when you’re the only white girl at a dominican wedding” (my family is dominican, she is white but there were a lot of other white people there so idk what that was about...plus she’s not from NYC anyways).

She said something and her “accent” got really thick for a second so I responded in the worst, over exaggerated NY accent that I could and then laughed about it. She got mad at me and stormed out of my moms house last night. My brother told me to stop and that I needed to apologize. I told him I would stop now that I know that it bothers her that much, but I’m not going to apologize. I told my brother, first of all she’s asking for it. Second of all if she wasn’t my his wife my brother would be making fun of her just as hard.

When I entered I noticed a guy, white, probably late 20s, scrawny, looked like the kind of person who works in IT and saves his money to fly to Thailand twice a year for ""sightseeing"" with a young Asian girl, she looked like 12 to 14 or so to me, slim, small body, looked like my niece who is 12, and a young looking face as well.

Didn't really think too much of it and I sat down a bit away from them, facing the same direction as the girl so I couldn't really see her perfectly. But I did notice that the guy seemed to do her like gently stroking her cheek and even leaning over to give her a kiss (not on the cheek). It made me sick and since I had recently read about underaged sex traffic victims from Asian countries I wondered whether this might be one of those scenarios.

So outside I decided to call the police and told them that I had seen an adult man making out with a young girl here. I waited across the street until they arrived. They got inside and since there were only few people inside they found them quickly. I could see them through the glass window. They talked to them shortly, then the girl talked, then she showed them what I presume was her ID, the policemen seemed somewhat apologetic and left. Afterwards it looked to me like the guy was consoling her.

I concluded that she probably must have been older and I misjudged her age. I debated whether I should go inside to apologize but I didn't really want to face them so I left.

I told her ""Save your money because that's not going to happen"".  She thinks I'm joking at first but when she sees I'm serious she start freaking out.

From her perspective, she has waited 30 years for a grandchild and since my sister can't have kids she fuels all of her excitement into us.  She has a fear of driving so her visits to us will be limited in the first place.  She is taking her excitement over the top. Her friends threw her a grandma shower for fucks sake.

I told her that I will not be driving 5-10 hours per weekend so he can sleep over in a place where there are untrained massive dogs(they are sweeties but i don't want to take the chance with a 250lb st Bernard and a 150lb Newfoundland that like to jump), and an offensive smell that permeates the house.

She responds saying she has thought of all that and will be taking the train, segregating the dogs, and installing a massive air purifier in the room.  I still tell her no with the logic of ""I don't want my child being 2.5 hours away from me, I'm not comfortable with taking a baby on a train, we are trying to avoid formula, and even with the dogs being in another room and an air purifier where he would sleep I am not comfortable with the arrangement.

Apparently, my mother has already gotten the room ready and has been saving up for this huge air purifier/ozone generator thing and talked through it with my sister because she knows I'm a hard-ass.

EDIT:  Clarification... My mother isn't a cold or bad-hearted person.  I guess when I was a baby my mom dumped me at my grandmothers every weekend, so she always thought this was a norm.  I am glad she is excited but I feel things like a grandma shower is a bit narcissistic.  I would never discourage her from spending time with our son.

Twice during the first act and again during the second act a baby started crying during the show. It happened during some of the more serious moments of the show and I was very annoyed. 

I turned to my friends during intermission and after the show and said: who brings a baby to a show? I was really annoyed but my friends (who aren’t usually theatre goers) thought it was no big deal. They said maybe the parents couldn’t get a babysitter or something and I should have empathy for the parents.

Am I the asshole for having no sympathy for the parents? If you can’t make arrangements for your baby, then you can’t go see a play or musical.  Wait until the kid is old enough to control their actions and possibly even enjoy the show. It’s not like you can easily leave the theatre if the baby decides its time to cry. It’s dark and it takes a minute to maneuver to the door. It’s a situation the parents can avoid (unlike babies crying in the supermarket or on a plane).

197,Asshole,"Last night, my fiancee and I went to a semi-fancy restaurant to enjoy a nice quiet dinner together. We don't do this too often, but it feels good to get a little dressed up and have some good Italian food every once in a while. This time, she had a Groupon that was $63 off for four glasses of wine, two apps, and four main courses. We asked the waiter right at the beginning if we could order two of the main courses to go since there were only two of us, and she said no problem (not part of the assholery, I want to be clear that we weren't trying to trick anyone).

So we have a great meal, ordered our two other main courses to go, then asked for the check. This is where the potential assholery begins. Every item was accounted for on the check, and the total came out to $115 before tax. This meant we should have paid about $60 before tip when all was said and done. Not too bad. HOWEVER, we looked down at the total, and it said something like $7.32, which was just the tax. My fiancee figured we were just misunderstanding the check, as a lot of it was written by hand, so we put down the credit card. Then the receipt came back for a $7.32 total. We were surprised, to say the least, but also pretty excited at the prospect of having an extra $50 in our pocket.

Then my fiancee began to wonder if we should tell anyone. Nobody mentioned that our meal would be comped, and she was worried that someone put it in wrong and would get in trouble for it later. I said that it was fine, our waitress probably knew what she was doing, and not to look a gift horse in the mouth. We ended up not telling anybody, and my fiancee even said on the way out that she thought our waitress gave her a knowing nod as we thanked her.

So AITA (AWTA?) for not telling anyone about this potentially accidental comped meal? Also, since I think this is very relevant, we tipped $30, a 25% tip on the full amount of the check.

EDIT: Welp, seems like both misunderstood how Groupons work! Her parents got the Groupon for her/us, and it said $63 on it, but it looks like that's what they paid for it.

198,Everyone Sucks,"I’ve lived with two roommates for 2.5 years. Aside from them not helping with housekeeping, things have been generally fine. Until this morning. The beef is between me and my roommate who I’ll call Ada.  
  
I am a full time law student, and my schedule makes it impossible for me to hold down a part time job. I live on loans, and a monthly gift card to a grocery store from my parents. The cost of living in my city is absurd, so I don’t have much, if any, room in my budget for luxuries like going out for a beer or ordering pizza every so often. Since I really love to bake, and I can get ingredients in bulk for cheap, I started a side hustle selling baked goods. Business isn’t exactly booming, but I get enough cash to let me enjoy my some little things every now and then.  
  
Last night I got an order for a batch of cupcakes. My policy is to take any order I get, as long as I don’t have another one that I’m making, since if I say no I likely lose that customer forever. I can crank out a batch in an hour, but my partner and I had plans last night so I decided that instead of staying up late I’d just get up a little early and take care of it then.  
  
So at 6:30 I got up and started doing prep work. Pulling out bowls, measuring out ingredients, warming butter, etc. Everything I use, except my mixer, is lexan or silicone, so it’s not noisy. At 7:00, I started putting everything together and turned on my mixer, which is kind of annoying but on low speeds it’s pretty quiet. I also cover my mixer with a towel, to keep dry ingredients from splashing out, which helps muffle the noise.  
  
At 7:40, Ada bursts out of her room demanding to know what’s wrong with me, reminds me that I live with other people, and complains that it’s ridiculous that I’m doing this when she already has to suffer through “falling asleep to gunshots” every night. Pretty sure that is referring to me playing xbox in the evening. I generally keep the volume so low that I can barely hear it, I rarely play past 10-11pm and certainly not every night, and she falls asleep watching Law and Order or Game of Thrones, so even if the volume WASN’T whisper quiet I don’t see how she could hear my tv over hers, when I can hear hers over mine. She’s also seen me playing with headphones on before, so it’s not like she couldn’t have asked me to put headphones on at some point over the past two years if it was bothering her.  
  
So, am I the asshole here? Is it really so absurd that I use my kitchen in the morning? I mean, what if I wanted to make a smoothie for myself for breakfast every morning, I’ve lived with people who do that and it never bothered me.  Would I be yelled at for using a blender? I feel like living with other people includes occasional inconvenience. This is the only time I’ve ever started baking this early, and if she’d complained to me about noise from gaming earlier I’d have taken steps to fix it.  
  
EDIT: I do want to thank everyone for their input and feedback so far. It seems like the consensus is that, while Ada may have overreacted slightly, I was being an asshole. I did text her to apologize as soon as I got to my desk and she got back to me a few minutes ago (about an hour after this post went up). Vaguely positive response, she did ask me not to do it again and asked me to make sure I'm wearing headphones if I'm going to be gaming past 10ish. Totally reasonable asks in my mind. I did also ask her to let me know if she had any other concerns or things that were bothering her, since a few people expressed that this seems like something bigger may be stewing.",75,45,0.9

200,Not the A-hole,"I’m 24 and my brother “Sean” is 14. He came out to me around 4 months ago and I’m the only one he has told so far. I’ve always loved him no matter what and I really don’t care that he’s gay. We’ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. 

He came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he’s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn’t be able to marry, it’s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he’s really nervous. 

What Sean doesn’t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn’t understand how bad it actually was. 

I have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don’t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. 

I only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don’t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn’t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he’s not completely in the dark, he doesn’t really understand just how many bridges were burned. 

So now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don’t trust me. 

So I told him that I don’t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. 

He got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn’t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I’m the only one who knows. 

I offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. 

I’ve tried texting him but he won’t respond to anything I say. It’s not that I don’t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. 

So AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out?

202,Not the A-hole,"I am a manager at a small retail establishment and am working on hiring a part time sales associate. The position has been online over a month and we have received 0 qualified candidates. The other day a middle aged woman “Karen” who works across a couple locations came in while I was reviewing resumes. 

I was reading two resumes with another employee and they were just awful. Resume 1 listed their birth date while subsequently leaving off their education. In my country it’s illegal to ask the applicants age, only if they are over 18. They were 22. The resume did not list any skills they had picked up at their previous two part time jobs nor the dates that they worked there. It was half a page in normal size font that they increased to take up a whole page. They did not have a drivers license which is a requirement for the position and did not have any cover letter. 

Resume 2 was 3 pages. They had one part time job, again not listing any acquired skills. They had their education as the last segment on their resume. They filled 2.5 pages with volunteer experience leaving off any dates or skills acquired though these experiences. Most volunteering was 2 hour projects. Their contact information was only located on the second page of their resume and they only had their name on the first page. Their font and size were not consistent across the document. Again, no cover letter. 

Anyway, Karen comes in while I’m lamenting on how bad these resumes are and how I dread we’ll never find someone qualified enough to fill our basic entry level sales associate position. Karen has marital issues that the staff is well aware of because she literally never shuts up about them. I can tell you about her financial troubles, her kids, her husband and her *gag* sex life (which I NEVER asked about. Super funny though because she tells everyone about her husbands ED and how he can’t hold a job because of it??). 

Karen starts tearing me a new one in that mom way for “harassing strong young men for their *likely* (obviously unknown because we can’t ask) mental disability”. I interviewed both of these candidates anyway because were so desperate for a hire. I understand not all mental deficits present but they both seemed normal, just lazy. I explained to Karen that it takes nothing for someone to google “how to write a resume” and even just follow the first google example, but she still says I was being mean and abusing my power. 

Come to find out she has been telling the other locations she works at how I’m a horrible manager and no wonder no one will work for me. She has taken each of my employees to the side and asked them how they feel about me. They told me that Karen made them feel very uncomfortable by doing this and that they have no issues with me. 

TLDR: older female coworker says I’m being unfair by criticizing resumes. I interviewed the candidates and they were not a good fit as their resume suggested. ",37,33,0.84

We live in an area where a lot of people (mostly women) are OBSESSED with horses and riding horses and owning horses just to say they have horses and just.... horses. 

I have never been interested in that kind of thing. I can recognize that horses are a beautiful, elegant creature but I just have never gotten into it. Neither has my fiancé. He has dated girls who had horses and he just couldn’t deal with it.

We have a 13 month old daughter and my MIL is constantly talking about how she is going to get her crazy about horses and riding them and all of that. We don’t want her to. We want our daughter to be involved in more extra curricular activities like karate and baseball and soccer and the like. 

I understand that it’s a hobby. I understand that it’s loved by a lot of people, and that it isn’t hurting anybody. But what this mostly comes down to is that my MIL expects us to pay for it, and I know that is an expensive hobby because she can barely afford for her daughter to do it. I don’t want to pay for something she is insisting our daughter gets into, especially when our daughter isn’t even old enough to tell us what she wants to do. We don’t have a lot of money, just like MIL, so I would rather put this on the back burner and wait until our daughter is way older to even consider her doing it. When I told MIL this, she said we were being unfair and inconsiderate of our daughter.

206,Not the A-hole,"My sister has been dating this guy for less than three months.  My personal feelings are that he’s an idiot.  I mean he’s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it’s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he’s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some “pot” if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He’s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  

Despite that, it’s her choice who she dates so I’ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He’s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom’s and he’s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren’t always specifically referring to actual family, but it’s just what it’s felt like.  

It really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, “You’re not my family.  You’re the guy my sister is dating for now.”   He just said “alright” and I walked away. 

He’s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend’s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven’t heard from her since it happened.

Wasn't entirely his fault, his wife decided after they got married she didn't like sex anymore, in fact she hated it, and he's one of those guys that live for vagina. The friendship ended when I found out he had been trying to sleep with every girlfriend I ever had behind my back. When he was caught, he denied it and suddenly I heard more truth from more exes. I haven't spoken to him since.

A couple of years afterwards, he was divorced from wife #2 and she messaged me saying he was been going through tough times and needs his friend back. I asked her if he told her WHY I no longer spoke to him.

She replied that he told her I was harassing a woman for sex at a club and she came to him for help and that he was the hero for getting in between us. He liked. I then told her about all of his girlfriends while he was married to her.

First off, I’m not religious whatsoever. I went to church when I was younger and I always had a hard time believing in God and religion as a whole. I find it really cool that people can believe in something that it has a powerful impact on their lives, but it’s just never been for me. My son’s dad has never been very religious either. He never goes to church or anything like that, however his parents go to church and all their other grandchildren are baptized. I feel as if he is being pressured by his parents to get it done.

A couple weeks ago he told me he is planning on getting our son baptized. I told him that should be a decision both of us make. He told me that he needs to be baptized and that he knew I’d disagree. I would never not allow my son to be religious if that’s what he would like, and I’d never discourage him from getting involved in church, but I want him to be able to make that decision on his own. I told his dad that if he gets older and he chooses to get baptized then fine, but I disagree with doing it when he’s so young that he doesn’t even understand what it is. 

I’ve asked a couple people what they think and I’ve gotten mixed reactions- some people think it’s reasonable, and others think that I’m being too harsh by not allowing his father to make this decision and that it’s not even that big of a deal to get baptized.

Am I in the wrong here? Should I just let him get baptized and let it go and let him make his own decision to stay in the church when he’s older?

Edit: I wanted to add that I have been doing some thinking and I think the thing that is bothering me is that he is not given a say in this. Even if it doesn’t seem like a big deal because he won’t remember anyway, this decision is being made for him. I’ve always wanted my son to grow up making his own decisions and having his own autonomy, and I feel like if we start here, what other decisions are going to be made FOR him. If that makes sense.

Ever since my grandfather passed away, my grandmother has been very reliant on my mum and me (aunt/mum's sister isn't very nice and lives quite a distance away) which makes sense. Due to bereavement, her memory has gotten a bit worse but she's had medical tests and there's nothing permanent. She needs glasses and a hearing aid (but refuses to wear them).

Now the event that leads me to ask AITA: recently, whenever my mum has given my grandmother a time to arrive, she is always an hour to two hours early. Even if these times are 9:00am, she will arrive at 7:30am. Even if she writes the time down, no matter how many times my mum or myself tell her a time, she is always early.

I put my foot down and said that it's getting too much and is getting in the way of my mums work. Grandmother's response is that we treat her horribly and she wants my mum to quit her job. I tell her ""you need to be on time, check your phone or watch for the time. 15 minutes early is fine but an hour isn't! My mum is working."" She asks ""what do you expect me to do?""

She was forced into an arranged marriage at 14 with a 35 year old man. They’re still together and have been in Australia for 25 years, but her husband doesn’t speak any English and I think is pretty emotionally abusive tbh. 

Anyway, once every 3ish months we all organise to go out on a “staff night out” somewhere fun for everyone. Lawn bowls, or teppanyaki or something. It’s by no means compulsory - one lady only comes at Christmas no worries - but everyone enjoys it and it’s just a fun way to unwind. Usually, people bring their partners, which is great as we’re all very close. 

Zara never brings her partner, and none of us ever ask. No one has met him and everyone knows the history of their relationship. I’ve only become Zara’s supervisor this year and last week she came to me to ask whether I could bar partners from attending our staff night out. I told her I’d think about it, but the next day told her I wouldn’t as it had nothing to do with work. She then said it made her feel bad her husband couldn’t come and the reason her husband and her’s relationship is the way it is, is a religious thing.

Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.

Now this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. 

I think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. 

One one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady. On the other hand I watch way too much forensic files and my spidey sences were tingling.

231,No A-holes here,"Okay so this happened about 7 years back at school and I still kinda feel bad, found this sub and decided to make this post. My friends still talk about it. I made friends with this weird kid at school (didnt know he had aspergers and might have been autistic), and in class one time I thought it would be funny to prank him, as a friend thing, didnt think it would go that far. My thumb is what you would call a hitchhikers thumb (bends back far, nobody knew), so I decided to make some magic trick up that he couldnt push my thumb back with all his strength. He tried and as he pushed it i let it give out bent it as far back as I could, I yelled in agony pretending he broke my finger and I held it up and said you broke my finger arghhhh. 

Next thing he did was burst out crying, and I kinda sat there like what the fuuuuuck. I didnt know what happened, he kept crying and kept saying he broke my thumb and I was like no man I was kidding its not broken look. And he kept going on freaking out and apologizing and crying and the teacher talked to me after class and was really fucking angry at me. I had no idea, we were like 13 and he probably knew he was special, I knew something was up with him but didnt know he was like that.

232,No A-holes here,"My boyfriend and I have been together for about 3.5 years. We did long distance/only seeing each other a couple of weekends a month until a year ago, when we moved in together.

Our relationship is pretty much perfect in every aspect apart from one - our sex life. Before we moved in together our sex drives were about equal, but over the past few months my boyfriend’s drive has dropped completely. He rarely initiates sex any more, and rejects me 9 times out of 10 when I try to initiate, usually saying that he’s too tired.

I’ve brought it up as an issue at least 3 times now cause I was getting worried something was seriously wrong. Every time we talk about it he says all the right things, reassures me that nothing is wrong, and promises to have sex more regularly, but still nothing has significantly changed.

I’m starting to feel unloved and unattractive. Despite the fact that the rest of our relationship is amazing I don’t know if I can stay with him when I’m feeling like this. I don’t want to throw everything away without trying to work on it one more time, so I was thinking of having another serious talk and explaining that if our sex life doesn’t improve, I’m going  to have to consider the future of the relationship as a whole. But I’m worried that that will come across as a threat. I don’t want to seem like I’m manipulating him into sleeping with me, I just want to get across the severity of the situation and how shitty it’s making me feel.

So, would I be the asshole if I told him I was considering breaking up with him if our sex life doesn’t improve?",31,34,0.91

236,Asshole,"EDIT: a note about the assignment in question. I completely just forgot about it, it slipped my mind. It was finals week and I had a ton to do, and this one assignment literally just popped out of my brain until she reminded me about it. I wasn't being lazy or purposely not doing it, just an honest mistake that i came to terms with until she told me I could still turn it in.

I got an email earlier today from an instructor saying that I hadn't turned in an assignment that was due during the final yesterday. I told her I did it and it was in my folder (a lie) but I just forgot to hand it in (another lie, but it's college, whatever). Then, I left for work. When I go on my first break, I notice she emailed me again and said she was deciding to be generous (she doesn't take late work, ever) and I should send her the assignment. I had to write a paragraph of reflection. I call my boyfriend who is home (we live together) and ask him to open my folder and send me a picture of the handout so I could do it on my lunch break. i do the assignment. I know that basically this assignment is the difference between a B and an A, that's how close my points were. I ask him to do the printing at home and snap a picture for me that I can email to my instructor before I go back to work to make it look like I did the assignment on time and genuinely pulled it out of my folder and took a picture.

""Later"", he tells me. It's already 7pm and I don't know when my instructor's generosity is going to run out. I tell him, why can't you just do it right now, it'll take 30 seconds. I tell him again, can you please just do it real quick so I get it out of the way, and he says ""Later"" again. At this point I hang up as I'm walking back into work from my break. I wait... no picture. I wait five minutes over my break for him to send it.

I'm working and we had a call out, so there was no way for me to (1) notice that he finally sent it to me and (2) even if I had noticed, I would not have been able to step aside to email it to my instructor. Finally, I get out of work around 9:50 and I check my phone and see he sent the picture to me around 8:45 (again, an hour after I initially asked him to do it), and then I see an email from my instructor saying grades are finalized. That email was sent at 8:30. I check my points, and I was five points away from an A. The assignment had been five points.

I come home crying bc my grade could've easily been an A and he comes to me asking what's wrong and I just push him away and blow up, saying that he didn't send it to me in time, and how hard was it to print out a paper and take a picture of it. I go to the bathroom so I can clean up and calm down. Basically, I was upset that he took an hour to send me a picture when it took maybe 30 seconds total.

I go into our room where he's just on his computer. I curl in bed and ignore him because I'm still incredibly angry and I can't talk if I'm angry because I'll just start crying, and he says nothing. Eventually, he gets off the computer and goes to the living room, still without saying anything to me. I got home at 10:10 and it's been two hours and I still haven't spoken a word to him, and he hasn't attempted to even apologize or even just talk to me or comfort me since I got home. I feel like he's mad at me. AITA?",107,69,0.9

To give a few example: 

* We had one other black person join our team for short time and they used to refer his as my cousin even if I told them not to do so.
* When we go outside for happy hour or some other team activities they will see any random black person and say either he looks like he is my brother or something like that

so i reverse google image searched both of her sonograms. the results came back from a website called blackinfantmemorial.com and i was instantly infuriated. how can you take someone’s dead child’s pictures and try to gain attention from it? well, i made 2 collages and posted comments with both of them on her post. how do people even edit sonograms to have their name on them, i wondered. so i went to the iOS store and downloaded UltraSoundPrank. the picture she used is LITERALLY the only sonogram on that app that you don’t have to pay for. this is a bad situation all around, she’s asleep so she hasn’t saw any of my comments or anyone else’s yet. but i really don’t feel like i’m wrong for it. that’s someone’s child that you’re using. that’s someone’s son that you’re making think he has a child on the way. so many people are telling her congratulations and it’s clearly staged.

And don't get me wrong, I love dogs...I just love kids more. 

My 3yo nephews had a pretty severe athsma attack shortly after I picked him up from preschool last week following a coughing episode at the daycare. This is a typical allergic reaction for him and he's been hospitalized in the past.

My sister reminded the preschool owner that her son is allergic to dogs and the preschool/dog owner told my sister that she keeps the dog away from my nephew. She then changed the suject and called my sister out for my forgetting to sign the kids out when I picked them up.

Keeping the pet allergens away from my nephew when the dog is there all the time just doesn't seem possible. Not to mention the little guy LOVES dogs and will do anything to get close to one.

The athsma attack scared me to death and I don't think the owner is looking out for the health and safety of my nephew. WIBTA for calling in an anonymous tip about the dog? Are there any other options? 

Finding another daycare/preschool for my sisters three kids is not an option at this time. My sister is afraid that if we call the health department then the owner will find a way to kick her out and she will lose her job.

249,Not the A-hole,"For the past 6 mnths I have been going to a therapist and when I started my treatment, we went over some of the policies and I agreed to the cancellation policy of giving >24 hours notice. 

At the beginning, I wanted to schedule frequent sessions as I had a lot of availability. He had limited availability and could only see me every 3-4weeks. In Jan. again, I wanted more frequent session but he had a vacation planned & had limited availability so he could not fit me in for ~ 4 weeks.  

In the past 6 mnths I have had a total of 6 sessions. Besides those 6, I rescheduled 1 session with > 24 hours notice, cancelled one session with <24hours notice (for which I apologized and paid the cancellation fee of $90) and took his next earliest opening. Two days ago I called to reschedule my session for this afternoon(once again, providing >24 hour notice). I gave my availability for the remainder of this week and for next week, to reschedule. 

Today: He called me this morning and wanting to have a “heart to heart”. He started probing as to why I rescheduled, I explained I have been happy with therapy and that it’s strictly a scheduling issue. I reminded him of how during my last session (2 weeks ago) I discussed over extending myself and am working more than one job at the moment. This is one of the reasons I am in therapy.  

However, he didn’t really seem to take this as a good enough response? He kept saying that it wasn’t personal but clearly if I’m having scheduling issues that maybe this is not the best time to seek therapy and kept talking very vaguely about the situation. He then said “do you catch my drift”? So I responded with: “Are you saying that it’s best if we end this professional relationship?”and he said “no, no, that’s not what I’m saying, but can I get you to agree to a consistent schedule and a more than 48 hours cancellation policy?” I  agreed to the new cancellation policy.

I explained to him that I had no idea this was causing him such an inconvenience since this is the first time he has mentioned ANYTHING about it being an issue. I provided him with more than 24 hour notice, and the one time that I didn’t, I was very apologetic and paid the cancellation fees. He said that he didn’t want me to feel like this was coming out of the blue but that he has overhead fees and it’s not good for my treatment to not be consistent nor is it convenient for all parties involved. 

Anyways, I agreed to the 48-hour cancellation policy, and he reminded me of my next 2 scheduled appointments. I checked my calendar and reassured him that I would be present for both of those sessions. 

He then proceeded to say: “I think we need to scheduled anther 4 sessions right now, and have an agreement that if you miss any of those sessions that this therapy is terminated.” 

I thought about it and replied with, “ actually, I think it’s best if you cancel the two current appointments that I have scheduled and that we don’t schedule any future sessions”. ",26,25,0.92

She finished her 5th divorce two years ago, and for these two years she keeps asking me questions that also insult me.

 “How did you get a man at 30 with kids? It’s because you’re so skinny.” 

“Do I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha”

“You has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.”

“Did you only talk about sex with them?!”

For two years I’ve brushed off the insults, and replied: “ You’re in a small town” or “focus on yourself , and someone special will come around”

Finally she asks for the billionth time “How did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don’t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can’t I get anyone?”

I replied honestly and said: “ You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It’s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.”

This launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me.

265,Asshole,"So, recently my father passed away. He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. 

Anyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. 

So I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way.

> During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both ""recently applied"" and other who had been ""accepted"" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.

My entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a ""mistake.""

I took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.

But then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?",431,1074,0.91

268,Not the A-hole,"I had travelled to and was staying in a hotel in the United States with 5 of my coworkers. We had driven from Canada hence had our own cars. The reason was we had to be at our clients office for a month, hence we arrived on Monday Morning and left Friday evening. Note that our company covers our accommodations.

We work longer hours due to tight deadlines, and hence are never out by 5. The hotel we stay at shares a parking lot that they own with other local businesses, but parking is free for hotel guests till 5PM on their checkout date. 

Since we usually leave around earliest 7PM on a Friday, we have an issue with parking, as our passes expire at 5. Note that this is a very crowded city and parking is minimal in other places. Every year (this is my 4th year on this client), the hotel has never given us trouble and has always gladly extended our parking.

Last week, on the Friday, our last week there (we had stayed there M-F for 3 weeks and this was our 4th), the front desk employee told my coworkers before I had gotten down to the lobby that he couldn’t extend parking. They told me when I got there (it was their first year on the client, where as it was my 4th), and I told them this has never happened. Therefore, I went to speak to the front desk employee. 

I told him that we were giving his business over 25K in business (granted our company is paying for it) over the 4 weeks we stayed, so extending our parking for 2 hours shouldn’t be a big deal. He snarkily responded that to use a service, you have to pay for it, and my coworkers understood that concept, implying that I didn’t understand how it worked. This infuriated me, so I asked him if he understood how hospitality worked? He said he did, and I asked to speak to the manager. 

The manager came over, was shocked to hear what happened, and gave us our extra hours of parking. I assume she reprimanded the employee for how he behaved as I mentioned to her what he had said. Looking back now, I feel bad, as that is the first time I’ve ever had to talk to a manager, and I didn’t want to get that guy in trouble. Also, we could have just expensed the extra parking costs to our company, but to me, it was the principle of hospitality, if we are paying 25K, 2 extra hours of parking shouldn’t be a big deal.

AITA for potentially feeling entitled for parking and calling the manager? 

EDIT: just wanted to add that I never raised my voice or caused a scene. Had an honest conversation where I merely stated facts. I just wanted to have a conversation to see why it was a problem when it hadn’t been for 4 years. I’m not a confrontational person, and likely would have let it go, but the employee was very condescending to me. This was what irritated me and made me ask to speak to a manager 

This is how the interaction went: 

Me: Hey, seems like there is an issue extending our parking. It’s never been an issue in the past. Is there a problem? 

Him: : sir, if you want to use a service, you have to pay for it. (In a very condescending tone)

Me: ... well we spend a lot of money here, and this has never been an issue before 

Him: your employees seemed to have no problem understanding this. (Still condescending)

Me: *upset now with the way I was talked to* do you understand how hospitality works? Can I talk to your manager? 

Never once did I raise my voice or demand anything. I was more there to inquire until I was talked to in that manner ",74,42,0.89

But recently, it seems like she’s just sort of moved in with us.

We have a cleaning schedule but she’s not on it, which is annoying as hell since she always makes a huge mess out of the kitchen and she doesn’t ever take the trash out. Plus anytime I walk into the kitchen I’m forced to see them practically dry humping and or making out.

I pointed out that she doesn't read anymore and therefore is not a book nerd, and shoud make a different username. She defended herself saying that she is still a book nerd because she regularly listens to audiobooks. I tried to explain to her that this is not the same, because listening to something doesn't take as much brain power as reading it does. Audiobooks are like the cheap easy version of a real book. I don't thinks someone who *listens* to bools can classify themselves as a *reader*.

He’s finally “dying” and her family has seen him 3x in the past week. She sent me a picture (1) of him the other day, basically just laying there with his mouth open. I feel bad for him, but in my eyes she was just showing me him.

Today she sent me a few (3) pictures of her and him, then her, her grandpa, and him. Them smiling or whatever, him, obviously just laying there not even knowing they’re taking a picture.

279,Asshole," 

Let’s take it back six years to 2013. It’s the day of my college graduation. Since the ceremony begins fairly early, my eight fraternity brothers (I know) and I decide to get up even earlier to get properly tanked. After a couple hours of drinking, we get together to pose for group photos in our grad caps. 

During the last photo, I decided to it would be hilarious to surreptitiously hang my flaccid wang over the waistband of my shorts--the idea being that no one would notice my exposed Johnson until after the picture came out and we’d all have a laugh. It worked, and we did (though one of my friends was annoyed that I ruined the photo.) 

I didn’t think much of it until later that morning when I realize one of my friends has posted the photo on Instagram! Naturally, I freaked out and made him delete it immediately—but at this point had already been up for an hour or two and garnered it’s fair of likes and “haha omg” comments. Needless to say, I was pretty fucking pissed at the time and to be honest, it still irks me a bit to this day. But when I confronted him about it, he basically said if you didn’t want this on social media you shouldn’t have done it.  

So look, I know how incredibly immature this was to do in the first place. And I know, that real lesson here is to keep your dong in your pants at all times. That said, this was a photo was taken in the company of solely my closest male friends—not intended to be shared with the world. So did I have this coming? Or was my friend being a major dick?

I started crying and sobbing and he was comforting me, but then I remembered the photographs and told him that I would have to show/tell his girlfriend about it and then he began begging me to keep it a secret, but I told him I couldn't, but then he started offering me money and all of these things because his girlfriend would be really upset.

Well, I thought then that if he is using me then I should also use him back. I didn't accept the money because I wasn't sure if it was illegal + I didn't really want it anyways. I told him that instead I wanted him to take me out to dinner because I thought it might get him to see me in a different way.

He seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches.

My fiance got very upset with me for not wanting to help her. I couldn't stay there anymore and left to sleep at my parent's house. My fiance called me and said that he's very disappointed with me and that he's letting X stay until she finds somewhere else to sleep.

So for the past few weeks or maybe a few months, one our friends Jack started to have interest in Kacey, he would always ask her to go eat with him, to drink with him, etc. Now living with Kacey, she tells me that she doesn't want to really hang out with him and that she really doesn't like him like that. Every time Kacy gives in to hang out with him, he's always tried to come over after, the last time this happened Kacey ended up locking her door and leaving him in the living room after constantly telling him he can sleep on the couch. 

A few days ago it was Tina's birthday. So Both my roommates and I, along with a few of our friends, including Jack, went to go out and drink and celebrate. So we had fun and moved on to some karaoke to continue the night. Now, at this point, both Tina, and Kacey are pretty wasted, I was a a little past tipsy but not too drunk. Now I know Jack wasn't drunk at all, he arrived about 2 hours after we started drinking and was mostly there for the karaoke.  So, the night is winding down, and I call us an Uber. Before we leave, I overhear Jack talking to Kacey that he's going to come over later, I ignore it and hop in the uber and head home with my roommates. So back at home I asked her if Jack was coming over and she said she doesn't know and she asked if I could tell him not to. 

So I texted him saying that we're all about to go to sleep so now isn't a good time to come over. Then about 2 minutes later he texts me, he's here. I ignore the text. Then about an hour later he text's me. ""I ptfo'd in my car"". Again I ignore that text. Then I get bombarded with texts like, ""be a bro"", ""yo let me in"", etc.

At this point I know everyone is asleep, including Tina so I ignore the texts again. Then about 10 minutes later, with my room being closest to the front door. I hear someone there. So we have an electric lock that requires a 4 digit pin to get in, and for about 30-45 minutes I hear who is presumably Jack incorrectly guessing our pin.

I placed the baby on the bed, and no exaggeration, he gets up and says he has to ""pee"", walks to the bathroom and closes the door. Is it even possible to muster up a turd approximately 3 seconds after waking up? The crazy thing is, this is so predictably routine. Mind you, most of my getting ready habits have died, I no longer have time to blow dry or fix my hair, and I never put on makeup. I never have enough time. He doesn't seem to care that this affects me. He just begrudgingly carries on with his day of taking care of the baby in between dumps.

I am willing to bet that he spends upwards of 4-5 hours per week on the toilet. In the course of the hour before I leave for work, he will absolutely go to the bathroom AGAIN. As we all know, men are not skilled in the area of efficient poop timing strategy and it takes them a bit longer. I get that. I also get that men do other things in the bathroom, and I am cool with it. But this is my only day to have an easy morning. Every other day, he leaves the house before we even get up. Part of me thinks its some kind of OCD tendency that he needs to poop without the baby around. And he won't have a chance all day unless he does it while I am home. I don't fucking care anymore. Grow up and poop like the rest of us.

&#x200B;

I expressed my agitation and explained to him that if I wasn't home, he would have to figure it out. If it were me leavinng the house every morning, he would have to find a way to poop whilst taking care of the baby. It doesn't seem very cool to me that he has no problem whatsoever doing this every single morning he is home. I yelled that he needed to ""make it quick"" and he still was on there for 10 minutes. After I finally got to take a shower, he was hostile, cold, and argumentative for the rest of the morning. I went to put on a baby show and he shout from the kitchen ""I WAS WATCHING THAT."" Really dude? You were watching Hota's closet makeover on the Today Show? GTFOH.

290,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I have been together since college, married for \~4 years now in a commitment ceremony. Found wheelchair-suitable housing last year and moved in together.

The obstacles to us becoming parents are:

1. Financial. We split rent and utilities 70/30 every month. She works P/t at $10 an hour. I work F/T at $15.25. TL;DR - we absolutely could not afford her to stop working entirely AND the expense of a child. We'd be slowly going broke every month, at best.
2. Medical. She was born with Spastic Cerebral Palsy and has a 50-50 chance of dying if she gets pregnant. None of her female friends have accepted her request for surrogacy. We REALLY don't want to hire one either, too many horror stories.
3. Emotional/Mental. We both have...a fair few issues we're working through. Mostly childhood traumas on her end & poor memory/ADHD on mine. We've achieved a stable but fragile state of harmony, but without giving out TMI I can pretty safely say that if the kid is anything short of a junior saint we're going to be at each other's throats.

I have exhausted literally every higher-paying job I qualify for on several job search sites as of last month, to no avail. I've thrown out or donated 80% of my electronic gear and most of my old hobbies to make more room in our apartment. We went to couples counseling (which helped) and I've tried to help her keep in touch with her friends.

Meanwhile, for the past few years she's been constantly back-and-forth on the issue. At several points she's literally set a date to try for a child complete with Fun Times, we've bought tests and commiserated when they came back negative. She has also (supposedly) picked boy and girl names out already and talked to adoption agencies.

Yet nothing ever seems to come of the latter and she also takes her birth control pills every day without fail. Whenever I try to VERY GENTLY remind her ""pills = no baby"" or ask if there's been measurable progress on the adoption process she either gets angry, deflects the issue, starts crying or all of the above. It's become a conversational landmine I can't even approach without risking a ""boom"". Trying to approach the issue of children issue otherwise either ends inconclusively or in a minor-to-major meltdown, no matter HOW hard I try.

All this lead up to a conversation this morning where I tried to politely tell her that we needed to put this issue to bed. We're not getting any younger, higher income does not appear to be forthcoming, and I'm just plain tired of the stress of going back-and-forth on this issue for going on half a decade. I love you honey, I'm not going anywhere, let's hug on this and let it go.

...suffice it to say that her meltdown rivalled Chernobyl and Fukashima put together.

GF will not budge. She wants ""her own"" kids and to me that's really selfish. I understand why - since it's your biologic compulsion to reproduce - but logic can override impulse and I'd rather have none at all or adopt. It just makes more sense.

In the past I’ve never thought it was a big deal to have some of the salad or veggies.  Last night though the fridge was pretty empty of options and one of her diet microwave meals didn’t look half bad so I had it.  She got really annoyed saying that she was planning on having that.  She said it’s not fair to her for me to eat her food since her diet is restricted and I can eat pretty much anything.  I feel like if I’m buying all the food if I want to have one of them I should be able to.  Especially considering the lack of other options and that she has several other dinners in there.

293,Asshole,"My daughter (I'll call her Ashley) has a therapist she started seeing a year ago. I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.

Now Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.

My daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.

My wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.

tl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?

298,No A-holes here,"**Context**: my dad remarried last year. His new wife never had any children of her own;  when she came into the picture, my siblings and I were living independent/semi-independent lives. She's lovely, but very spoiled and sheltered for a woman in her mid-fifties. I have seen the woman cry because she doesn't get her way, it's not pretty.

I'm a solo mum to a very well-behaved seven year old and finishing my BA. Usually, he goes to class with me and he actually likes it, but I have a three hour class once a week that ends around 10 PM. My dad and his wife live close by, they love playing the part of the indulgent grandparents, and my dad's wife is okay with watching him once a week.

**Problem**: last week when I picked my kid up, he was bawling over trivial shit. My dad's wife asked him to not take home a book - this specific book had been my brother's, but he gave it to my dad, who in turn passed it on to my kid - thinking my brother still wanted to keep it. We go home and he insisted he was upset over the book, but I had the feeling it was something else.

I mentioned this to his counselor and after his weekly play therapy session, she tells me that my kid expressed why he's upset. My dad's wife has been having her older brother over for dinner nearly daily and she's pushing my kid to interact with him. The main issues my son has with this are:

* all my kid wants to do after being done with his homework and reading is to be left alone to play Minecraft or with his toys;
* my dad's wife will turn off the tv/take away the tablet/shoo him out of her bedroom so they can all have dinner and ""family time"" together, calling her brother my kid's uncle;
* my son just doesn't like her brother (he calls him ""the sad adult"", which is ... accurate), so pushing interaction between them makes my son feel deeply fucking annoyed and uncomfortable.

My kid's counsellor tells me he's having trouble expressing the big feelings of frustration and stress that pushing these interactions on him is causing him, and it translates into outbursts like crying jags over ""nothing"".

My dad insists that something is wrong with my kid, anything from blood sugar to ""sociopathy"" (which, what the fuck, dad?). I am hesitant to mention to him what the actual problem is, because I pretty much know that telling them what the real problem is will mean dealing with a middle-aged woman throwing a tantrum.

I've decided to take my kid to that class with me from now on, since I'm three weeks away from finishing the term anyway and also because I'm not okay with this situation.

One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think. So I tell her that you can do what you want and I won't care unless it affects me. She gets angry and accuses me of being a bigot. AITA?,268,267,0.86
300,Asshole,"I grew up with an abusive alcoholic mother.   It was hell and as a result I don’t drink at all and don’t like being around drunk people.  

When I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn’t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  

When we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn’t drink that often anyways so it wouldn’t be a problem.  

The first few months that’s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she’s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I’ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I’m projecting my mother’s problem on our situation.  That she’s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it’s not really about her being abusive, it’s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  

After this last time it happened she’s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we’re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  


Edit:  to save from replying to the same questions a bunch of times I’ll just answer them here.   

She agreed not to be drunk around me.   She said that she would stay at a friend’s place when drunk.   I don’t care about a drink or two, but she’s been coming home obviously shit faced and trying to lie to me about it.

301,Not the A-hole,"Gf and I live together.  I works full time and she works part time.  It’s been going ok except for some disagreements on how we spend our free time.  My gf never wants to do anything.  It’s like pulling teeth just trying to get her to go to a bar.  And once we’re there she’ll want to go back home almost right away.  Don’t get me wrong, I like relaxing at home sometimes too, but I also need to have more than that on my days off.  

I’ve tried to come up with a solution.   There’s this app, meetup.   It basically lists all the social activities and groups going on in town.   It was a huge list and I went through it suggesting things to her.   She shot them all down, wouldn’t even try one.  Who doesn’t like trivia night?!  

So I gave up.  Save for going out to eat occasionally I let it go.  A buddy of mine wanted to get back into bowling and asked me if I wanted to join a league with him.   It sounded fun so I said sure.  When I told my gf about it she got upset with me.  

She says that between my weekly game night and now bowling, I’m going out of my way not to spend time with her.   She says she didn’t move in to feel neglected.  I tried to justify it by telling her she never wants to do anything, but she just said that it shouldn’t be such a chore to spend time at home with her.   That during the week we’re too busy to connect like we used to and weekends should be about us.

302,Not the A-hole,"Hi everyone- throwaway for reasons. 

My ex boyfriend and I have had joint custody over our dog for 2 years now here in California. I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. 

I ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.

Once I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a “ concrete jungle “ in NYC. 

After countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me
but only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. 

When I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven’t heard from him since and it’s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she’s still legally MY dog.. I’m sure he’s plotting to take me to court now. 
Am I the Asshole?

Edit- For everyone coming at me saying I’m selfish because this was all unfair to the dog... seriously? I LOVE MY DOG. I would never just leave her in my house all day cooped up. Being able to work from home gives me a lot of freedom & my dog gets 4 walks a day with one of those walks as a trip to a dog run/park as well. Not sure if this also matters to you all but half the time I’m in Weehawken and there’s a lot of parks as well too. She gets toys, treats & love. She is a Mini Australian Shepherd. I would NEVER bring her over here if I didn’t think she’d have a shittier life.. you all need to realize this about me. 

Also, I bought her when I was not with my ex, and he met her a few months after. It’s not like I did this to intentionally be selfish and try to “win some battle” with him. We never even broke up on bad terms. Been heartbroken about this whole situation. I appreciate everything he did taking care of her while I was in the process of moving. Will eventually text him sometime by the end of the week and Venmo him back a bit of money.

306,Not the A-hole,"On Monday a parent of another girl in my daughter’s class got in touch with me over Facebook.   She was asking me for help dealing with a situation between our girls.   She had pictures of text conversations between them both and my daughter had been being quite nasty to her classmate.  There was also a few of photos the classmate had posted with what I was told was my daughter’s account making harsh comments under.  I told the other mother that I would speak to my daughter about it.  

This seemed really out of character for my daughter so I wanted to get to the bottom of it.  When I first spoke to her she denied it out right.   Then I showed her the picture evidence and she said that she was just joking and that that was just her relationship was with the other girl.  I didn’t buy it.  This girl wouldn’t have gone to her mother if she wasn’t upset about it.  I was just getting no where with my daughter.  

I’ve read the horrible news articles about teens harming themselves over bullies so I am taking this very seriously.   My boyfriend(not the father) suggested blocking her devices from the WiFi until she straightens up.   I didn’t even know you could do that, but he had it finished within minutes.  I also told her I would be monitoring her texts from now on.  

She just keeps telling me what year it is and it’s impossible to survive without internet.   She also brought up classwork.  As far as classwork I told her that for the time being she can walk herself to the library and use the resources there.   I’m not very internet literate so I’m really not sure if I’m being overly harsh.

307,Asshole,"Edit : HOLY SHIT you guys what the fuck is wrong with me! 

Thank you all, I needed this wake up call, I was only 3 comments in before I could see I’ve been a real huge fucking asshole.

My daughter is so fucking talented and besides that she’s a really good kid who’s mostly respectful, never in trouble at school and listens when it’s important. 

I’ll be taking your comments seriously, and will NOT punish her under any circumstances for being playful and having fun, what was I thinking?

FYI, she is already in drama classes and has been for years, in fact last year she had to audition as the school got a little more funding and therefore could be pickier. She’s good enough to get into a selective theatre class and I’ve been questioning her quirks. 

Lesson absolutely learnt/learning - can I come here for all my parenting tips? 

My daughter is 10. I love her dearly. She’s smart and creative, a million times smarter and more interesting than me. 
She enjoys reading and drama, and has friends but doesn’t like to spend too much time with anyone in particular. 

What she does like to do the most is create movements or oddities with her body. She’ll practice practice practice until she can do it, and then find another thing to practice until perfection. 

I wouldn’t mind so much if she chose things like beat boxing, or hand clap games, gymnastics or something similar. She isn’t interested in perfecting handstands or cartwheels or making music or learning dance steps. 

What she perfects is eyebrow raising, eyeball moving, ear wiggling, nose flaring, raising her leg sideways to her body, twisting her arms behind her head, bending her fingers backwards, walking in unnatural ways and her latest - getting her top lip to cover her nostrils. 

It might not sound like a big deal, and it isn’t. But it’s ugly, especially the covering the nose with your lip one. 

My sister and mother both do it out of habit and that’s where she saw it and decided to do it too. 

The eyebrow raising, nose flaring etc doesn’t really bother me but I do have to tell her to stop sometimes because she’ll incessantly tell me to look, and it’s the same thing over and over again. 

But I explicitly told her she isn’t allowed to do the nose to her lip thing because it doesn’t look nice. But telling her to stop just makes her do it more. What’s more, my sister encourages it because she knows how much it irks me. My sister said I’m stifling her creativity by telling her what she can and can’t do with her face.

But being able to do these facial things and weird arm and leg movements has no positive benefits I can think of. I can think of negatives though, like her hurting her joints when moving in unnatural ways.

Quite simply, I don’t want her to do this. I want her to use her tenacity for something useful, or energizing. 

I’ve told her she’ll be punished (no tv, no phone, or something similar) if I see her do the nose thing again. 

AITA for wanting to control what my daughter does with her facial features?

308,Not the A-hole,"So me(24/F) and my roommate, let's call him G(27/m), have recently moved in together. We were not very good friends beforehand- but since we moved in together, he has been trying to be my best friend. I state this because it feels like it makes him feel like he can get away with more things and cross more boundaries this way.

However, the major issue at hand for me is financial things. He eats my food, and justifies it by saying he made a meal for us- when I didn't ask for it. I don't have that kind of money as someone who's out on her own for the first time. The MAJOR issue is that he insists on turning the heat up to 80, when we pay gas separately. We decided on a 50/50 split of all utility bills which was great for me at first. So, I decided to talk to him about this and tell him that 80 degrees especially during springish weather is not financially smart and I would prefer him to keep it lower. He would then go behind my back later, after I turn it down, to turn it to something like ""79"" so it's not technically 80.

So, being at my wit's end, I ask him if we could change the dynamic of the bills considering he sees a higher temperature as something worth it to him- whereas for me, that high of degrees honestly has me sweating. 

He says no. He says that in the adult world, that's one of the challenges you deal with as roommates, and he doesn't consider it a ""50/50"" roommate arrangement if I'm only paying a third of the heating bill. So, I decided I'm going to get a smart thermostat that connects to my phone- and will allow me to lock the temperature from being changed while I'm gone, in my room, etc. WIBTA?

*  I don't have any children, or family. My sister is the only one I know and she's on the other coast. I'm 25.

*  I'm in New York which has some of the toughest grandparent rights laws which further complicates things. I'm afraid of giving birth then having custody taking away from me.
*  My financial situation is... okay. I can support my baby and I if I budget down.
*  My relationship with my in-laws was never friendly. They didn't approve of me and despite trying to warm relations with them they never reciprocated.
*  Some people are questioning why I'm trying to move on so fast and saying I'm awful for it: The baby is growing and I can't hit pause. I need to make up my mind sooner than later.

313,Not the A-hole,"(We're all college students sharing an apartment/room with each other. We moved in in September, so we've known each other for a while now. This happened several weeks ago with her then-new boyfriend.)

Usually, when they want to have sex, they will ask for the room for a few minutes and lock the door. On this specific occasion, I blacked out drunk at a party the night before and slept like the dead, until the early afternoon. At which point they decided to have sex in our room. I guess in my blacked-out state I had submerged completely under the covers, and they didn't see me in there when they got started. Also, I'm on the top bunk, and she's on the bottom. Apparently, my room mate checked beforehand to make sure I wasn't there (going so far as to climb my ladder), but she still didn't see me.

I woke up well into them having sex. As soon as I woke up, I realized what they were doing, but I could also tell that they had max 30-40 seconds left. Something triggered in me to play dead; I immediately woke up with the thought, ""They must not know I'm here, oh god"". I thought that maybe I could sneak out afterwards. Unfortunately, on her boyfriend's way out, he happened to spot the back of my head. As soon as he left the room, I bolted, but they were both aware by now that I had been in there. We all apologized, laughed, and that was it. 

&#x200B;

Today, one of my *other* room mates walked in on them having sex. I guess the door was unlocked. They were all talking about it a few minutes later, and I joked, ""Wow, (room mate), you're two-for-two now"" and laughed. She didn't think it was funny. She immediately started yelling that it was my fault for not ""making as much noise as possible"" when I realized what they were doing. I suppose that that's true, but I was never mad about it happening in the first place. I pointed out that I had been more asleep than I previously thought humanly possible, and that I only woke up towards the very end, but she wasn't having it. I also didn't see anything, if that's worth mentioning. Still, she said that it's my fault that it happened, and she's mad at me about it. Personally (and this might make me the asshole), it seemed weirder in the moment to start yelling at them for not knowing I was there. I never really raise my voice in the first place (it's a big problem, I can barely even honk when a car's gonna hit me), and I didn't want to have a huge falling out/argument about it (we're a ""sex-positive"" apartment, so I figured that it might be spun the wrong way in conversations about me later). I tried to play it off like it wasn't a big deal (because with all the shit that happens in this house, it's really not). Maybe joking about it made me the asshole, I don't know.

320,Not the A-hole,"I(17M) have had a crush on my GF(17) since we were in middle school. I have honestly been really awkward around girls because I have a heavy lisp. 
My SO was the only girl I ever dreamed of being with, so I asked her out as soon as I finished school. It honestly feels surreal even now. I was bullied for my looks and speech so I never thought I could have a girlfriend. Having someone I like besides me when we go to the theatre or on a walk is the best thing ever.

I tried to be the best boyfriend possible. But I couldn't help but shout at her yesterday. She has this thing where she tells me to keep on saying the words I had trouble pronouncing, and then proceeds to laugh till she cries. I told her I didn't like this, but seeing her get joy sorta made me feel happy in a weird way too, so I went on with the 'joke'.

Since we had dated for about 2 months, she was gracious enough to invite me to a family dinner yesterday. She had a joint family, so about 17-18 people of various backgrounds, shapes and sizes. It was a really daunting task for me since I have terrible social anxiety but I thought I did a great job introducing myself.
It was great till 2 full hours. Then my GF told me to narrate a story of how I asked her out. And I kinda pronounced suck as shuck.
She then laughed and said that was the sole reason she brought the topic up. Made me tell the word again, and her whole family laughed. I told her to change the topic, but she then told me to keep on with the words, and made me say about a dozen words so that everyone could laugh.
Her uncle's kept asking me different words too. I felt horrible and told her I wanted to go ASAP. But she took her time...when we got out to part ways, I instantly shouted at her saying she shouldn't treat me like that when she knows I hate it. She told me to calm down and discuss it without overreacting.
I apologized and said I couldn't do that and went home.

She isn't picking up my calls or anything now, I don't know.

Was I too much of an asshole?

Edit:

 I sort of tried to communicate with her, she told that me that if I apologized and promised to never get angry at her again, she would leave me. So I told her it would be better if she left anyway since I didn't want to be an amusement thing to her and her family. She told me I would get nowhere in life and was ugly and all when I told her it would be better if we part ways. I just told her I wished her the best and I knew she could be a good person and cut her out of my life.

Pretty sure she is going to twist the whole story in school and I am going to be ostracised, but I honestly am just happy because I am able to introspect and see that she wasn't being a good person.
I understand that I should not have shouted, but honestly that was the first thing that came to my mind after I already told her I hated it and it made me cry about 40 times, and she herself has seen me get severely beaten and bullied. I should have ideally just calmly broken up then and there, but I am not perfect...will try to improve myself in the future though!

Thank you so much for the encouraging and enlightening posts.

Helped me a lot to gather the courage to break up with her. She was my first girlfriend so it was honestly hard. ",176,701,0.94

322,Not the A-hole,"There's a fairly long backstory here but its relevant to the post so bear with me (TL;DR at bottom).

Our neighbours over the back bought their house a few years ago and proceeded to almost completely demolish it and rebuild it much larger. We were fine with that - there was a lot of noise and dust for a couple of months but it was only temporary. As part of the rebuild they installed solar panels on the roof, high level security flood lights and lots of windows (this is relevant later). This was all fine except one of the security lights shone right into our house. Next time I saw them, I asked them if they could angle it down a bit so it wasn't shining into our house. They moved it a bit but it still shines in. We've got used to it. The solar panels and windows also reflect the sun into our house from time to time. That's to be expected if you live near other people. Houses have reflective surfaces on them.

Then they asked if they could remove our hedge and plant a new one on their land. I agreed because TBF our hedge was a bit old and badly maintained. So then there was no boundary between our garden and theirs. Fine but their dog kept coming into our garden and leaving ""little presents"" and their kids kept knocking balls in and trampling our flower beds to get them. I mentioned this to them, they apologised but nothing really changed. I didn't bother mentioning it again. 

They then asked if they could trim one of our trees that was overhanging their garden. I agreed and offered to do it for them but his brother is a tree surgeon so they said they wanted to do it - fine. We were out when the brother came round and we got home to find he'd removed 3 of the trees in our garden. I was annoyed but didn't say anything in the interests of neighbourly relations. They were self-seeded trees anyway, not as if we'd bought and planted them.

Then nothing else happened for a while. This year, we decided to have an extension built on our house and took the opportunity to have solar panels fitted to our roof as well. They were installed a few days ago and whilst they were still being installed, the woman from the back came round to complain to the builders that the solar panels were causing glare in their house.

I was pretty gob-smacked. They were complaining about something that they had installed years before us, not to mention the security light that ensures we don't just get glare during the day but through the night as well. I've just ignored it and haven't been round to see them.

TL;DR neighbours at the back install solar panels and security lights which glare into our house. Then complain about us installing solar panels that glare into their house.",133,752,0.96
323,Asshole,"This is a just throwaway account to ask this question.

For some context, both myself and my friend are 17 turning 18 later this year. I'm heavily against any form of alcohol consumption and drugs as I am am well  aware of the risks and consequences associated with the two, I don't think I ever intend to drink. Most of my grade, as well as my friend don't share the same concerns as I do, many of them have been drinking for years. I have a couple friend's  who also don't drink, but this one friend in particular has been influenced by those in my grade (and out of curiosity) to try drinking, and intends to at an upcoming party (she's never been to one, nor have I). Since i'm not going to the party, I've told her to not drink and voiced my concerns (technically it's illegal since the drinking age here is 18) but she's already invested in it. Today I was more persistent and again pressured her not to do it, I admit I may have come off as a bit pushy since I was irritated due to some other people mocking me for not drinking. Anyway we started arguing about it and a couple of my other friend joined the conversation and took her side, which was even more frustrating. We ended the argument both pissed and upset with each other. I'm at the point where I don't think I should care anymore. I am genuinely worried about her but I don't think theres anything I can do.

324,Not the A-hole,"We’ve been together for almost two years and have very different opinions on what to do in certain situations. When I want to do something (that will not effect her or harm me in any way) and she thinks I shouldn’t do it, she always tries to guilt me into doing what she thinks is right.

Usually I do my thing, depending on the situation.

Note: Tomorrow references Wednesday 3/20 and we are both seniors in high school.

Situation: I want to skip school tomorrow to finish a study guide and homework for English class, as well as grind out the last couple hours of an online recovery course I’ve been taking. We aren’t doing anything in class tomorrow and it’s an extra long day. My attendance is not important to me and there is nothing I gain or lose (except for sleep) out of going tomorrow.

If I go, it’s 6.5hrs I’m sleep deprived, unable to work on anything I need to get done. I have music classes I pay for afterwards and will only be able to squeeze in 3hrs to get my work done before I have to get sleep so I’m not sleep deprived for my unit test on Thursday.

I could put off my online class for the weekend, but I’m trying to finish it by Thursday so I can talk to a counselor and drop my TA class so I can get out early(long story). The study guide MUST be done by tomorrow or I’ll be fucked for my test. The English homework I think is due Friday but I’m not sure.

My girlfriend wants me to go to school tomorrow regardless. She believes I’m obligated to go because it’s school. I’m arguing with her about it.

325,Asshole,"My bro knows my actual account so needed to make a throwaway for this one. 

&#x200B;

In short, my brother was always the nerdier one of the two of us and as a child and young teen, I was a bit of a bully towards him. In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.

&#x200B;

Throughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. 

&#x200B;

I'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a ""weirdo"" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.

&#x200B;

So after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.

327,Not the A-hole,"So based on my name, I can’t drink. I don’t have anything against it, I have a super low tolerance and get really emotional (anger issues, start crying) if I drink alot and vomit. To me drinking is a sensitive topic.

During parties and outings my friends who are all heavy to medium weight drink like mad. They don’t force me to drink, but they do this thing where they keep pushing me to reach a goal. “You gotta take one more shot” or “reach that point in the glass”. I already feel terrible on the inside, so I just say no, i’m not pushing my limit risking vomiting all over the place. They call me names and place sips of shots at me. At this point, smelling alcohol makes me wanna vomit, so I decline again. They stop, but they still call me out. This has been happening for awhile now, where I decline and names are called.

Recently it has been irking me the wrong way, because I hear it every time I go out, and not just with close friends, acquaintances as well. I came clean and told them to stop calling me out on it every single time I’’m tired of hearing it. One of them basically said, stop being a pussy about it when you get called out. This is just guy talk, no one here actually forces you to drink, if you’re not drinking a lot, you will get called out, Don’t shift the blame on us if you can’t handle it. 

At that point I got furious, I started yelling “how its is my fault when I can’t drink you can get to call me pussy. Im tired of it”. Again, got called sensitive, and its just how guys talk. I kept yelling and screaming because I can’t control the situation. To them, it is not their fault and those little remarks/call outs is not pressure/forcing me to do anything. I can walk away from drinking altogether, but I have to endure the name calling each time because it’s what guys do and I’m being a pussy about it. I feel like they don’t have my back, and now I’m just a bigger pussy to them.

AITA for being to sensitive, and it is just how guys talk? Also, AITA for yelling at my friends in this situation?",62,42,0.84
328,Not the A-hole,"I have a kindergartner, and about a month ago the teacher called me and said my kid called another classmate a name and the parents wrote the teacher a letter about it because their kid was upset. So the teacher tells me she read the letter to my kid and he was required to apologize to the classmate and write an apology note. He apologized at school and had the option of writing his apology note at home or school. He chose home. 

I picked him up from school that day and the teacher reminded me about the note. I asked if I could see a copy of the letter so I could make sure we addressed all the concerns of the other parent. The apology note would be a lot different if the note was “my kid was upset and embarrassed and doesn’t want to be around this other kid anymore” versus “what little jerk called my daughter a psycho and when can I expect his head on a platter”. Teacher said I could not see it, even with the other kid’s info blacked out. She told me she read my kid the letter, but refused to let me see it.

I went to the principal and got the same answer, so I took it to the school board, then superintendent, and the district superintendent. All of them have maintained that it would be a breach of confidentiality to let me see the letter. I believe the confidentiality was broken when the teacher read it to my son, which she now denies doing, of course. So the story hit our local news and I did the bad thing and read the comments on the story from the trolls. At the time I felt like I was doing the right thing, holding them accountable for reading a letter (from a parent to a teacher) to a kindergartner and then telling me I had no right to see/read/hear the contents.

He proposed once while drunk three years ago (without a ring) and I told him yes- IF he asked while sober. He never did and he gets visibly uncomfortable when I even mention the word anymore and changes the subject. 

I don't even want to bring it up anymore. I feel like I'm being dismissed for wanting marriage, like it's not a big deal. I feel like he just ignores that it IS a big deal to me. I'm falling out of love. I feel like what I want means nothing to him. I'm starting to resent him. I don't want to do an ultimatum. I told myself I'd leave at the five year mark if he was still avoiding the discussion but couldn't make myself do it. I don't want to make an ultimatum, it feels like I'd be forcing him into it and marriage should be 'fuck yes'. 

Additional info: We have lived together five years. I worked more hours and a more stressful job than him for most of that time and supported him through a year and a half of unemployment, but have been responsible for all household chores the entire time, minus his laundry because apparently I never do it right. I prepare 90% of meals, if I don't feel like cooking we get fast food. I'm almost 30, he's just over 30.

332,Not the A-hole,"I have two official roommates and one of them has a girlfriend. She's a really nice girl - friendly, sweet, etc. And she's spending 5-6 nights a week at our apartment - maybe arrives around 5 PM each day, doesn't leave until 10 AM and comes back again at 5 PM. I'm having doubts about being resentful of her presence because she's not overtly getting in my way. My two roommates and I have our own bedrooms and bathrooms, and our electric bill is not even that high, despite her always showering at our place. I don't necessarily want her to pay rent - it just bothers me that she's freeloading. I signed up and paid to have TWO roommates - not three.

Sure, there are small things that her constant presence cause: she uses my cups and sometimes leaves them overnight, so I have to wash them to make myself a cup of tea in the morning while she's still sleeping. She takes up space in the fridge, so I have to dig through her stuff to get to mine. She and my roommate often take up the kitchen to make dinner together. But these things are small enough to make me doubt that I have a case against her being here all the time.

333,Asshole,"Yesterday our 3 year old went on a little adventure. My husband came home from doing some errands, we chatted for a bit in our kitchen, leaving our son to play on his own like we always do in an adjacent-but-not-in-eyesight room. He usually watches TV for a bit after his snack, it's been the routine for a year now. Color us surprised when he managed to unlock the front wooden door, open it, unlock the front glass door, and open it, get down our porch all without us noticing. We noticed after about 10min and we freaked out. 911 and 3hr later, he's brought home from a few blocks away: full of mud but otherwise O.K.

I'm not asking if we were the assholes for not paying attention, because I know we full well were. I do want to ask about our neighbor though and if me blowing up at her was justifiably assholish.

334,Not the A-hole,"Friend recently had a bachelorette party in Vegas, about 15 guests, everyone had to travel. The guests were a mixture of grad (including me), undergrad, and a few high school friends.

&#x200B;

Sister is MOH, but nobody really took charge organizing. There were a few things the bride-to-be wanted to do, including a open bar Ferris Wheel and a Drag Brunch, but they were about 2-3h of the entire weekend.

&#x200B;

Grad friends and I tried to research things to do and take advantage of our time, but the undergrad friends were impossible to move. In response to any suggestion, they would hem and haw and reject all ideas by wasting time without ever suggesting anything. We asked the bride many times what she would prefer, but she just always said she was fine with whatever.

&#x200B;

Grad friends were interested in going to a Vegas nightclub. The first night, we got dinner nearby then went to some regular bars next to our casino. Fun, but basically not any different than we could have done locally. The next day we brought the idea up again, but the undergrad friends expressed doubt about lines, cost, the dress code, and some worried they would be charged a cover if the bouncer didn’t find them attractive enough.

&#x200B;

Later we went to a Thunder Down Under show based on the recommendation of the high school friends, and afterwards we spent at least 20 minutes standing outside while people debated what to do next. Nobody else had an idea.

&#x200B;

Undergrad friends were hungry, so grad friends and I suggested they (and bride who was also hungry) eat while check out the club before it opened. If it seemed like a douchey place then we could come back, if not they would come meet us. We did that and we tried to call them and tell them we got on the guest list, but they only told us they were “lost” and seemed incoherent.

&#x200B;

Ended up going to the club anyways instead of spending the night with the bride, and we stayed there for several hours. It was very fun, and it was by far the cheapest thing we did the entire weekend. Got our cover waived because we dressed appropriately and got there early to avoid lines, got free drink tickets, and after a while our promoter came in and made his own drinks that he also gave us for free.

&#x200B;

Later found out that the rest of the group spent the next hour and a half going between different fast food places and went to bed by 11:30. Which makes it hard to regret ditching them. It was very expensive to go on this trip, and I feel like it would have been a total waste if we hadn’t done some Vegas-specific things. But I do feel badly that we didn’t spend the night with the bachelorette. She hasn't expressed any dissatisfaction with the weekend, but I still feel guilty.

335,No A-holes here,"My husband and I both came into our relationship with children. My child lives with us full time and I receive child support. My two step-kids live with their mother (one is in college now though) and my husband pays child support. We're all very geographically distant but everyone is involved to the extent they can be. All of us are lower middle class, with similar incomes and cost of living.

I started a saving account for my son just after I split with my son’s father, roughly 10 years ago. I budget the child support separately and any remaining CS money goes into my son’s savings account. When I told my ex I was doing this, he voluntarily started sending a bit more child support to up what would go into savings. I put 50% of all my son's holiday money in there and his dad occasionally tosses a bit more money at it too. The plan is to gift this money to our child upon some as of yet undetermined adult life event. I project this account will be somewhere between $20-$25K by the time my son graduates high school.

My husband has gifted two years of college tuition and all major living expenses for that time to each of his two children, paid through a work related benefit. He doesn’t have any additional savings set up for them though and I don't know if their mother does either. It's highly likely that she doesn't as saving has never been one of her strengths.

So, I was complaining about a banking error in my son’s savings account when my friend made a comment about how unfair it was that my son would eventually be given this large sum of money while my step-kids will not. I was more than a little taken aback. I explained that the savings account for my son had never used joint household money for funding and came directly from the child support I received from his father; It had nothing to do with my husband or my step-kids. She was still quite angry and insisted it was wrong not to be strictly equitable no matter where the money came from.

Now I’m not sure what to think. I’ve always viewed it more like I was saving my son’s own money for him.  The child support was never “mine” or my husband's. My step-kids' mother was equally as capable of doing something similar with the child support she received, especially given that she has always received significantly more in child support than I did. On the other hand, it certainly isn't my stepchildren's fault if their mother didn't do this. It is very likely that they would see this as being unfair and mean too. I'm not willing to short my son and I'm also not interested in being viewed as the stereotypical Wicked Stepmother, but I can't make 40K appear out of thin air in the next several years.

It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.

Bf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said ""You look silly!""

We were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, ""oh yeah, oopsie,"" then turned to him and said, ""I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing.""

I thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said ""way too fucking rude, I'm going outside."" I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says ""outside. now."" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside.

I wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked and I kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. He eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. Am I the asshole?

340,No A-holes here,"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 5 years. We have been planning our engagement for a bit, and I had one big rule for the proposal and that was that he not involve anyone else in the proposal but us. I don't want to get too far into the backstory, but my ex husband essentially went behind my back to ask my parents for my hand, and I ended up forced into the marriage by pressure from him and my parents. My boyfriend knew this and definitely knew my rule because I asked him over and over not to include other people.

In spite of this, he decided to propose by first asking my children (from my first marriage) for permission and then included them in the actual proposal by having them hold up signs during the proposal. I wanted to be happy in the moment, but I was so hurt that he went against the one request I made.

I ended up taking him aside and asking him why he ignored what I asked of him. He told me it was different because they're my children and us getting married is their decision as much as it is mine and his. This really hurt me given that he knew how important my autonomy in the decision was to me. I told him I couldn't say yes to the proposal given the circumstances.

My children are furious with me and my oldest won't even speak to me. My friends called me selfish for not seeing the thoughtfulness in his proposal. I feel like no one is on my side, and I'm starting to wonder if I'm the problem. Am I an asshole for saying no to his proposal because he asked my children for permission and then included them?

Edit to add: thank you for your input. My boyfriend and I talked and he apologized for ignoring my boundary and for putting me in a bad situation. He sat down with my kids to explain everything. Hopefully things will get better, but the engagement is on hold for now because it is still tense.

342,Not the A-hole,"Okay so before you judge;
I'm in my mid-20s female and ever since I was 16, I knew I didn't want kids. I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. 

But I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity.

343,Asshole,"Ok so this is weird.

My girlfriend and I have been looking to move in together so we’ve been searching for apartments. My parents recently onformed me that they’d be moving to Phoenix, AZ in August so I would need to find my own place. 

A lot of the apartments were too expensive for our budget but we found 1 that we’re happy with. The complex was very nice and the lost cost we were told was 890/mo for 1 bed/1 bath. We were also informed of this application where if you and whoever are living in the apartment are making less than 32000 collectively a year then you apply for the “bond program” (I think it was called) that let’s you live in their studio apartments for less rent (about 550 a month not including utilities) We asked about the availability of the apartment and they told us that there are a lot available right now so it’s not like people are scrambling to get in.

My gf has been looking for a new job and would like to switch to full time when she finishes college. I told her that she should wait until we apply and get the verification that we apply for the program to actually go full time and she agreed. We wouldn’t apply until July. (She’s not struggling for cash or anything and i would help out if that ever were the case, this would strictly be to save money in the long run).

We also started trying to attack our debts together and would be basically living like poor people for the foreseeable future until we were out of debt. So this program would give us a head start. After the leasing period, if your income rises above 32000 a year you’d be asked to move into the normal studio (which is the same size and specs as the bond program one).

We cooould afford to live in the normal apartments comfortably but it would take longer to pay off our debts.

344,Not the A-hole,"throwaway for obvious reasons.

This evening I was discussing with my boyfriend about possibly coming up for a concert, this concert/event would last until literally 11pm. I live about an hour and a half or so drives away, and across a border, but I told him I would be more than willing to not only make the drive up there, pay for my OWN ticket to join him in the festivities but also, 'sleepover' at his place. I haven't gotten to stay over in a long time, so this would be ideal. 

This is where things got a bit strained in the convo, because, instantly, it went down like this:

BF: 'Sleepover? What are you, 10?'
Me: 'You know what I meant, I can stay over at your place! It would be a fun day and we can enjoy sleeping together.' 
BF: 'You sound like a 15 yr old girl when you use the word 'sleepover' 
Me: '??? What do you want to call it, then?'
BF: 'Spending the night?'
Me: 'It means the exact same thing.'
BF: 'Still sound like a little girl saying it.' 

I wasn't exactly upset by this nor irritated, but I felt like this entire situation was oddly strained and kind of ...odd? I'm not sure what to think but it's clear I upset him in some way or did something wrong by context. Is using this word really 'girly' and a bad idea to do so? I felt like it was appropriate and ok, it isn't like I was trying to say we'd have a SLUMBER PARTY WITH MOVIES AND CONFETTI! but, a 'sleep over' which to me, makes perfect sense.

346,Not the A-hole,"I'm 27f and my husband is 30. We tried for a few years to have baby, long story short, it didn't work out and we ended up going through a couple rounds of IVF.

Fast forward. We find out we're pregnant and we are super happy, like over the moon ecstatic.  We couldn't wait for the 12 week mark to tell people, and started working on a nursery right away.

However, we go to our scan and find out we are having FOUR babies. Four. That's insane. I'm cutting a lot of backstory out because honestly, it's hard for me to talk about. At the time, my husband and I are just in shock, but happy we have healthy babies.

Now, I'm a small woman, 5'0 and very petite. At my next scan, it was suggested I consider aborting two of the pregnancies for the sake of my body, and to be honest, I was quietly considering bringing this idea up to my husband anyway because of the money involved with raising four children. We could afford two babies, but no way could we afford four.

Me and my husband are distraught that this is our reality, but we went home and tried to figure it out. From our latest scan, we know we have identical twin girls and two fraternal boys in there. If we go through with the selective abortion, which we most likely will, I brought up that I would like to keep the two girls as they are identical twins (I'm hoping they have the 'twin bond') and also, to be honest, I've always wanted girls.

My husband is on board with this, but as soon as I told my mother and sister the scenario they kicked off, calling us selfish, entitled, saying we are searching for designer babies, etc.

The way I see it is that we have to make a choice which babies go if we do this, and it breaks our hearts that we are in this position but we need to do what we can for the sake of our children. This story sounds so tragic, like a soap storyline or something but it's honestly the hardest thing I have ever done.

So, my question is both AITA for having a preference in this?

348,Asshole,"Okay so here is the situation. So my girlfriend and I recently moved in together, because of this we sometimes get in little arguments over stupid stuff. Well yesterday we had one of those arguments and it put both of us in a bad mood. We end up making up, we have dinner together, watch TV everything seems fine. So we go to bed. Usually I initiate sex but tonight she does. Our usual routine with sex is foreplay and such, until she cums, then we start having sex. Well no matter what I did she couldn’t cum and this probably went on for 20 to 30 min. So she gets annoyed and says “I’m not going to cum, I’m going to bed goodnight” and rolls over. She says it with kind of an attitude. Now she’s extremely wet, and up until this point everything was pointing in the direction of sex. So I’m like what the fuck and I say “are you serious, are you really going to tease me and then just go to bed”. So I roll over and a minute or two passes by and then she rolls back over initiates again. And we start having sex. And I ask “is this pitty sex?” She says “yes”. So I said “fuck this” stop having sex and go take a shower. When I get back we have a little argument she calls me an “asshole” I say “I’m not having fucking pitty sex”, we end up going to bed. This morning we apologize to each other. I still wanna talk about it when we both get home from work but I’m still confused about the whole situation

I feel like she could’ve easily still been into it, or could have cum later during sex and that her abruptly turning over and giving me attitude because I couldn’t make her cum is kind of a dick move. I also think she got in her own head, because I can almost always make her cum and that it wasn’t my fault to begin with. But then again me getting mad at her for not wanting to have sex and getting even more annoyed because of pitty sex is also kind of a dick move. I don’t know what to think.

For all his faults, he is an amazing father and his family still are my saving grace on most days and are nice people. Kids are very attached to he and family. We live in NW Florida. 

Six months ago I met and fell madly in love with a new guy. We have a ton in common, including our love of theater. He is moving to LA to start a small theater company with a rather large inheritance he got from his dad's estate. He asked me to come along.

I've considered myself a tomboy and I've been told based off text- only conversations that it is hard to tell I'm a girl based off language alone.

Derek didn't like the advice he got and then went off to declare girls are bad and disloyal blah blah the works.

Someone mentions me to get my attention and input. Looking at his past messages I say his attitude is why he's rejected. He asks why a kid should be in this conversation and I explain I'm a woman and that's why my perspective might be useful.

Somehow he turns this into a problem that I'm a bad and weird person for hiding the fact I'm a woman and trying to trick people into being ""just friends""??? (I never deny being a girl!) I exited out and didn't think much of it.

357,Not the A-hole,"In every marriage there are these titantic struggles of right and wrong.  In our marriage, this is but one of many.  It's a tale that instantly enflames passions, and is the source of many snide remarks.  Although this happened last summer, my lovely wife brought it up (again) recently and she wants the good people of AITA to render judgment.

Here's the story:

Last summer I was working from home and our kids were obviously at home doing kid stuff.  It was morning time, and my wife had to run to the nearby grocery store to pick up something.  I can't even remember what, but it was no more than three bags of things.  Nothing particular heavy.

Anyway, my lovely wife has a habit of locking her keys in her car.  Of course, she locks her keys in her car on this trip.  To solve this dilemma, she called me to come pick her up.  Now, let me set the scene properly.  All three kids (ages 9, 5, and 5) were eating breakfast and I was writing emails.  Things were happening.  I get this call to come pick her up, and say something like ""Uh, can you just walk home?  The kids are eating breakfast and I'm working"".  Her response was ""The store is less than two minutes away.  Just pack them up and come get me.""

Now, the store is really close.  We can almost see it from our second story.  It's less than half a mile as the crow flies.  The walk is basically to cross two neighborhood streets, walk through an undeveloped field, a crosswalk intersection, and then you're in the store parking lot.

In my mind, walking home is kind of nice.  It's not far, and it's not like she had a ton of stuff.  Her reaction was. . . the opposite of that.  She wanted to be picked up, I doubled down and said, ""I don't want to pack up all the kids and stop what I'm doing.  Either walk home or wait in the Starbucks for me to come get you.  Give me like 20 or 30 minutes.""  She didn't take too kindly to that, and walked home - I think mostly to spite me.

So people.  Am I the asshole here?

It’s not as bad as many of the people you see on TLC’s Hoarders, but to give you an idea of how bad it is, my entire life my closet (which doesn’t have a door) has been overflowing with my dads clothes. Both of the coat racks in my room are stuffed full of his clothing, underneath my bed and in my dressers he has boxes of his clothes. His own closet is also full, as well as our living room, dining room, garage, storage unit, and my grandmas house and her garage as well. Because I don’t have enough places to put my things, my room is constantly a mess. As a child I was never allowed to have friends over because of how messy our house always is. 
I have been begging my dad for years to clean out my closet so that I can use it. I am sick of seeing his things in my room. I feel like I don’t have my own space, not even inside my own room. 

Recently, I had a realization. I am a fucking adult! I deserve to be respected by my dads. I took an entire day emptying my closet of his things and placing them in nice stacks in the living room for him to deal with. I removed literally 50 pairs of shoes from my closet as well as 10 leather jackets, about 30 belts, and I swept and cleaned my room as well as I could. I was so proud of myself. I put my clothes in my closet and tidied up my room. It was the cleanest I’ve ever been able to have it.

My dad came home just as I was finishing up and noticed his clothes in the living room. He proceeded to have a meltdown and yelled and me and I ended up leaving in tears and staying the night at a friends house. The next time I came home all of my clothes were piled on my bed and his stuff was pushed back into my closet. I was devastated. 

My room is now the messiest it has ever been. I have no motivation to clean and I feel absolutely disheartened. I just kick things around my room instead of putting them away because what’s the point? The rest of our house looks like a pigsty anyways. 

When I complain to him about my dirty room, he shifts the blame. “Well it’s your fault for not cleaning.” He acts like my effort to take back my closet was at no cost to me. I spent a whole day getting my room in shape for it all to go to shit.

We were seated and the waitress came to take our drink order. Other guys got waters, I asked ""Could I get a lemonade?"" She said, ""No. \*pause\* Haha just kidding!""

I don't know if it was the long hours, lack of sleep, or what, but this bugged me. She made the same dumb joke numerous times even though it never got a laugh, and seemed to ONLY make the joke to me. The other two guys got straight answers each time.

He said no. I either go out with nothing but a bikini on, or get nothing for a reward. I don't think this is ok. He is willing to humiliate me in front of thousands of people just so he gets the satisfaction of finally dragging me out in a bikini (a long standing issue that he has wanted resolved) and refuses to compromise. 

I am willing to show off my stretch marks, my imperfect skin, and all of my other insecurities, except the razor bumps...which look absolutely terrible. He won't budge. His reason? I shouldn't give a damn about what people think. He doesn't, so why do I? I have changed my personality a lot for my huaband through this marriage, but this is the line I refuse to cross. I am not willing to humiliate myself, make myself so insecure I cry, and force myself back into a depression just because I want my reward. 

He thinks I'm being ridiculous and should just get over it if I want my reward. I think he is trying to put too much on me along with his refusal to my small compromise. 

AITA for not wanting to go past the boundary of my comfort zone for a reward he's willing to give me in trade?

Edit#1: I know this was his offer, and I am willing to put the bikini on. This has been something he has wanted me to do for years...even at 230lbs he wanted me to go to the beach in a bikini. 

But the razor burn is where I draw the line. He wants me to go out in the razor burn, knowing very well what it will do to me mentally, so he can break my ""give a shit"" meter so I can be like him and not care about anything, ever. 

As far as im concerned he is 100% dead inside emotionally. He doesnt care about ANYTHING, and he wants me to be the exact way so dealing with me will be easier. He has personally changed my personality to be more ""go fuck yourself"" over the years, and I almost can't stand it. I am losing myself.

370,Not the A-hole,"So I love wedding TV shows. It's my guilty pleasure purely because of the drama. My boyfriend has always been pretty okay with it, he's fine with listening to me rant about it.

However the other day he snapped at me while I was watching a video about this Youtuber buying wedding dresses off Wish (The latest video of a Youtuber that I subcribe to). He told me that when I watch videos like that it makes him feel like I'm pressuring him to propose. It was very out of the blue because we've never really discussed getting married. Neither have we made any super concrete plans about our future together other than the usual ""You're gonna stay with me forever right?""

Nowadays when I watch whatever relationship thing that comes up such as 90 day fiance or Married at first sight, he just goes ""Tsk"" and plays his video games. I have tried explaining to him that I'm really not trying to force him to propose and that I just like the shows but it doesn't really register for him.

His outspoken disapproval at the shows honestly makes me feel like I'm an Asshole for watching it. But I do think it's a ridiculous thing to be sensitive about. Please let me know what your thoughts are and thank you in advance.

371,Not the A-hole,"So, my husband has long been irritated by the sounds I make while I eat.  To be clear, I am not smacking or talking through food in my mouth or chewing with my mouth open -- your face just naturally makes some noises when you eat.  I get that it can sometimes grate in a quiet situation because his chewing noises sometimes annoy me too, but since he can't help it, I chalk it up to I'm being irritable and I keep it to myself.

Usually, if my chewing sounds are annoying him, he will say something like, ""I'm really sorry, but that is annoying me so much!"" and then he'll take his food and go in another room.  This has always mildly hurt my feelings, but I also can understand the irritation factor, so I have mostly just dealt with my feelings about it and moved on.

Last night, we were sitting on the couch.  He was reading, and I was watching a show with headphones.  I was eating a snack while I watched, and he tapped me so I would pause the show, so that he could tell me, ""You are making the most disgusting noises ever while you eat that.""

I got so annoyed, and I slapped on a phony smile and a syrup voice and said, ""You make the most disgusting noises every time you eat too; you just don't know that because your wife doesn't feel the need to humiliate you each time.  It's called graciousness."" Then I put my headphones back on and went back to my show, but I was too self-conscious to continue eating my snack, so it just sat there.

His whole mood changed into a sulk, and he thinks I am the one who is an asshole.  But I think he's the asshole for needing to be told that it is rude to make someone self-conscious about something they literally cannot control.

374,Not the A-hole,"Hi everyone. My first roommate (20, M, we'll call him R) wants us to move out of our tiny townhome into a bigger place so his girlfriend can live with us. Currently it's just the three of us, me (20, F), and another roommate (20, M, let's call him J).

 Our place is great, it's less than a mile away from the university we all attend, rent is extremely cheap, I get my own bathroom (the boys share the large upstairs bathroom), hardwood floors, quiet neighborhood- the whole nine yards. R already lives in the master suite already, which is the size of J's and mine room combined, and mind you that's still really small, my bedroom has enough to fit my full bed and a chair and that's about it, but I'm so busy I'm really only ever in my room to sleep. Recently, R's girlfriend (19, F, let's call her L) has spent the night at our apt every night for about the past 5 months, I'd say. I have no problem with that, she's super nice, is respectful of all of us, etc. but she complains that it's always cold (we barely run the heater to keep our utilities low + the big windows make it hard to keep warm, anyway) and that R's bedroom is way too small. She has her own apt nearby but her roommate is moving out at the end of the semester. 

She brought up just her and R moving into a place alone when our lease ends this summer, but R isn't ready for the commitment of living alone with his girlfriend (dating for 2(?) years)  so he wants all of us to move into a bigger place. R, J, and I have been friends for a long time, and I really like living with them. I have made it very clear I'm completely open with moving as long as 3 conditions are met: 

1. It's still close enough to walk to school (R and L have paid for the expensive parking passes, J and I usually walk of take the bus), 

2. Each of our rents doesn't go up more than $100 (including L who would be paying rent, now.) and 

3. I still have my own bathroom. 

Am I being unreasonable? J and I are the only two roommates that are completely financially independent (both from single parents, my mom barely makes enough go sustain herself, and J's mom has 3 younger kids) while R and L both have their parents pay a cut of their rent. 

We had a big talk last night, looked at apartments and R & L said I was being unreasonable to want all 3 of those things, so I asked why should we move? Why doesn't L just move in full-time with us? Why don't they just move out into their own apt and J and I find a new roommate? Or why doesn't she find another roommate and we keep the arrangement we have now? I think I hurt her feelings and I really don't want that, but I'm also not giving up such a good apt because one person who doesn't even live there is unsatisfied with it.

Am I the asshole? Or should I be more open to compromise?

Edit: Good news! Thank you all of for the reassurance and great advice! They had made me feel like such an ASSHOLE and I was so worried I was being unreasonable. I stuck to my guns and turns out R had a long conversation with L and told her he's not ready for the commitment, and she's looking for new apartments herself! I'm not moving baybee!! L's, upset, just a little, but who cares she shpuld never had any authority over my whole living situation!

I work as a server at a half arcade half sports bar Restaurant on the weekends. (Thurs-Sun)
I attend school during the week (Mon-Wed) so I’ve had it blacked out of My availability on the online scheduling program since my first day 

This week was spring break for the Local schools in the area so they scheduled more servers than usual throughout the week to counter. However, I was not on spring break as my college didn’t follow the same schedule as the county. 

So I get a call Monday morning asking where I am. When I tell them I’m at school my boss starts to get angry saying it was spring break and that these dates were blacked out for taking time off. I tried explaining about how my school had Spring break last week and I wasn’t aware that my schedule had changed. He then seemed to not believe me when I said I was at school and said he’s treating today like a last second call out when I told him I can’t leave school for my shift.

We dated for alittle over a year and in that time I developed deep feelings for her. A year ago we broke up because I found out she was cheating on me. I admit it took a toll on me but we decided to stay ""friends"" mostly because we work together.
   She ended up staying with the other guy and got pregnant. Our relationship after the breakup was mostly random text here and there and the occasional greeting when we saw each other at work. In the last few months she has been texting me more saying she made a mistake. That she hated her life and she regretted getting pregnant because she know her relationship isn't going to last.
   At this point I don't have feelings for her. I just tolerate her because of work. A few days ago she had the baby early, it was only alittle over 1lbs. I recieved a bunch of messages from her saying how upset she was and how she wish things were different. I said congratulations and haven't messaged her since. I think she has been looking at me for support but honestly I don't remotely care about her or her newborn. In my mind she got herself in this situation, so its karma.

I know that he is lonely and also that guys can often get neglected in receiving affection if they don't have an SO (I don't think he's had one since early college). Honestly though its just becoming way too much.

He forces me to hug him every single day multiple times. He is much bigger and stronger than me so he will pin me down until I do it. If I try saying no he'll just laugh it off and say i'm being selfish and it's about what he wants. When I really put my foot down and get serious or angry he will get angry back and say he was just joking and that he doesn't like being around me as much anymore. He will the ignore me and will not help me with things (I am 20 so he gives me some support) until I feel that I have to hug him to get rid of the tension. Then it's right back to his usual behavior. 

I do not mind hugs themselves and I find them enjoyable. But usually I'm only giving them to people when I'm leaving for some time or for a special event. From him though I absolutely hate it and want it to stop. I do not want to be forced to give affection to a person like this or be a replacement for a girlfriend.

383,Not the A-hole,"My husband passed away 10 years ago at 27 from a motor vehicle accident.

At the time of his death, he had not spoken to his mother or step father in 4 years. By his account, he never intended to speak with them again and didn’t want our children around them, communicating with them, receiving gifts or cards, nothing. He had a whole story made up that he planned on telling the kids when they asked about his parents, about how sometimes there are bad people etc. They were abusive to him growing up (not to mention raging bigots), there was always tension between them. At the time I met him, he wasn’t close to his parents at all, barely spoke, saw them once a year if that, but no drama as neither side invested that much effort in the relationship. 

The final falling out had a lot to do with me. His mother was very overbearing and disrespectful to me while I was pregnant with our first child. My husband tried to put a handle on it, her reaction to him trying to establish boundaries is what killed the relationship. His mother refused to acknowledge or modify her behavior, to the point that she seemed psychotic. His step father joined in my spewing hateful words to my husband. He cut them off and we never looked back. The decision to end all communication was his and he took it seriously, he sent a cease and desist to her at one point when she kept sending packages to our house.

After the accident, his mother reached out to me trying to basically plan the funeral. I told her that she would neither have a hand in planning the funeral or be in attendance. I told them they could have their own service if they felt so inclined, but they wouldn’t be at the one I was having for him. My brother told them both that they would be removed if they were to show up. She tried demanding some of his remains which I refused.

Our babies were only 3 and 1 at the time of his death. My decision about his parents attending was based on the fact that he himself said they were dead to him, and he never wanted them to be around his own children. My babies were at their fathers funeral, I didn’t want two strangers to all of us there.

My now 13 year old daughter asks a lot of questions about her dad, naturally. She just recently learned that she has another grandmother who she hasn’t met, she had a lot of questions.

I tried explaining that I did it to honor her dad. She slammed her bedroom door, yelled some things at the door, I heard the words immature and petty several times.

384,Asshole,"Posting from an alt account, sorry it's kind of long.

My school has study rooms in the libraries that I always book to study in. They're fairly large meeting rooms that can fit about 4 to 6 people comfortably, but because my friends and I are on vastly different schedules, I usually end up booking and studying alone in them. How this system works is that every night (at 12AM exactly), the booking for the following week opens (i.e, today is a Monday, the booking for next Monday opens etc), so how some students including me have learned to game the system is to camp on the page and refresh as the clock hits 11:59:59, usually meaning that we will definitely get the time slots we want.

The system only allows each user to book the room for 5 hours max/day, which works out well for me, because my breaks between classes are 4 hours usually.

The main reason why I always book the room is because I have massive social anxiety. When I study in the communal rooms, every time I squeak the chair or drop a pen or even type too loudly, I feel like everyone is staring or complaining even though reason tells me that they probably don't care. Another reason is my classes are usually from 9-11am then 3-5pm, my break coincides with the lunch crowd (meaning that more people are there fighting for communal study room seats).

Recently though, my friend told me that people have started complaining about ""certain parties hogging the study rooms"". I understand how 1 person in a 4 man room might be ridiculous so sometimes I'm ok with letting a couple of strangers join me in the room, but other than that, I don't see a problem with it. I'm only booking it for 3 to 4 hours max, 3 days a week. I don't see this as ""hogging the rooms"" non-stop. Besides, if other people want the room, they can duke it out with me over the booking system at midnight.

AITA in this situation?

For context, I'm male, 20, my friend is female 27. I ask said friend if she wanted to get some food. She agrees and offers to drive. Couple other friends want to join the order so they decide to come too. Before we leave, something comes up and I have to stay behind so I just tell my friend what i wanted to get and offer to pay her back. I should also mention that she wanted one of the items that I told her to get. 

So they leave, I attended to my situation, and they come back 30 mins later.

She hands me the food and says "" they ran out of the item we both wanted, they had one left and I kept it for myself.""  I get it and since she drove I thought it was reasonable. Then she says that instead she got me something similar that I didn't ask for. okay, I guess better than nothing. Then I check the other items and I find out that everything I ordered, a total of 4 items, NONE of them was what I ordered. She said they ran out of most things and so she just got me things I didn't ask for or need because she thought I would want it. 

I asked her why she didn't  text me and she said that I never reply or take to long. I told her that I appreciate that she offered to drive and get food for me but I didn't ask for these items and the fact she couldn't be bothered to text me before getting me stuff I didn't want is beyond me. she demanded I pay a certain amount for them that I didn't expect to. On top of this, when I asked for a recpit she kept saying she knew the amount I owed her and that a receipt wouldnt change that.  w.t.f. 

So we argued for a bit, and then she said if I didn't pay for the food she would take it back, so I  let the food go and she straight up takes it, and asks our friend group (who btw were all listening into this argument) if anyone wanted my food for FREE( I feel like this was a power move and was meant to make me feel like shit). I got so mad. So I tried to stay calm, packed my shit and left. the whole situation pissed me off. I usually get mad and react with anger but I've recently been working on personal development and this reaction is not common for me so everyone was a bit shocked. the aftermath, i haven't seen or talked to anyone in that friend group and I'm starting to think I'm at fault, should I stand my ground, or AITA and i should apologize. 


Also, a side not, later that night the same friend offered to drive me to McD's but I declined because of how shitty she handled the situation. Maybe I'm over reacting. What do you think Reddit?

388,Not the A-hole,"Living a healthy lifestyle is important to me, and it's important to pass it onto my kids as well. I have a second grader who I have brought up (so far) to be very involved in the kitchen, what we eat, diet and exercise. 

She came home with a note from her teacher the other day asking to please send her with more ""appropriate"" snacks and lunches. I thought for a minute that maybe I accidentally grabbed one of my Quest Bars or something for her and asked my daughter.

For her morning snack, all the other kids had something like cookies, fruit by the foot/gummy snacks, etc. My daughter's absolute favorite snack ever is pickles, and she has said herself that she's never that hungry at snack time because we have a nice high protein breakfast, I put in a cut up pickle for her along with a babybel cheese in case she *was* hungry. The teacher commented on it.

Lunchtime came around, and I guess a similar thing happened. My kid goes nuts for anything spicy, so for lunches this week I made a cold spicy sesame noodle dish with lots of peanuts, shaved carrots, etc. Her friend wanted to sample it so she gave some to her friend, and I guess it was crazy spicy for the friend and she cried to the teacher. This is what sparked the note. 

So I explained that she shouldn't share ""spicy"" foods with her friends, and figured I'd skip the pickles next time. Well, it wasn't good enough. Just yesterday, the teacher sent home a letter to everyone explaining that she's requesting we make sure to send ""age appropriate"" foods to school, and gave examples of things like a PB & J, snack pack pudding, fruit cups, etc.

I called the teacher and asked her about the note. Teacher became very judgmental and said to please just remember my daughter is ""a little kid"" and that she doesn't need to worry about eating ""adult food"" yet. I asked if there was some kind of school policy about this, and she became very icy and said ""No"" and ""This really shouldn't be a big deal.""

This might be where I fucked up. I told the teacher that I'm the parent, and there's nothing wrong with my child's diet. That when she (the teacher) has kids, she can feed what she might she'd like, but that unless there's some kind of school policy, I will continue to send my kid to school with the foods I pick. Teacher got huffy and hung up. 

Just to double check, I asked my daughter two things: Does she LIKE her lunches? (Enthusiastic yes about most of them!) and ""Are the other kids making fun of you?"" because I know that can be an issue. She said no, and that sometimes they even ask for a pickle too.

396,Not the A-hole,"We were playing together and one of our teammates was doing stuff that was a bit questionable. 
My boyfriend noticed that the username of the player was girly and started talking about how bad girls are in video games and kept referring to girls as bitches. I got frustrated by it and asked if he thought I was bad too since I happen to be a girl and he replied that I would be if I didn't have him.

I decided to just stop playing after that match. We texted a bit back and forth about this, he said I was a whiny bitch. He also said I was no longer a female in the wild so I wasn't that bad.
He complained that I took offense when he didn't say anything offensive.
I told him it was really uncalled for and that he can't look at one girl playing and say that all girls are bad, we have run into so many ""bad"" players that were guys and he said nothing about it.

I don't know if I overreacted about it, I got mad and I did call him a dick two or three times. I told him to not play with me if I'm so bad and that he definitely has some sexism in him. I didn't really get to say much else as he was ranting on about how girls don't have hunting instinct like guys. 
He has taught me stuff in games that he played before I started, that I won't deny and I've been thankful for it. I just really disagree with what he is saying and I don't think it's weird that I took offense.
What do you guys think, did I overreact? ",328,638,0.93
397,Not the A-hole,"Had a family dinner this past weekend. It included myself, my fiance, my sister, her boyfriend, and our parents. My sister got divorced maybe a year ago and has a boyfriend. I really like him, he's great. And they are so great together! I'm happy that she is finally happy. I've known my fiance for 10 years and have been 'together' for 6 or 7 years. Things are great with us, too.

At dinner, we were talking about old memories and laughing. Generally having a good time all around. We eventually talked about how much dating has changed over the years and now the majority of people meet online/through an app. I should mention here that my sister met her boyfriend on a dating app. Nothing wrong with that, it is 2019. Then my sister brought up my ex because I had met my ex online but before all these apps were status quo (12+ years ago).

Back then, I got sooo much shit from my family about how I met my ex. They all were less than nice to me and to him and it's something I've never forgotten. That relationship lasted 2.5 years but eventually we broke up but for other reasons. When I look back, I do have the 'what the hell was I thinking' reaction that everyone has when they think about their exes but I also have a bit of sadness and anger towards my family about how I was treated. So obviously, I don't like going back there. My sister just kept talking about my ex and how unsafe meeting people online was back then and I'm so lucky he didn't end up being a sexual predator or serial killer! She and my parents were talking about my ex and how horrible he was while myself, my fiance, and her BF just stayed quiet. Honestly, my ex was a nice guy, just not for me, so I took offense to what was being said as I was also being painted as being foolish.

I'm not proud of what I did but I loudly said something like ""Ahhh, this must be the portion of the family dinner where we all talk about our past relationships! Does anyone else want to talk about their exes? Dad, how about your exwife from when you got married at 20? Mom, anyone? BF and fiance... do you want to talk about any of your exes? Sister, how about we talk about your exHusband or exBF? I heard exhusband is finally selling the house.""

It was dead quiet for what seemed like an eternity until I was told I was wildly inappropriate. I mentioned that I thought it was wildly inappropriate at all to bring up anyone's ex while everyone's significant other is sitting right there. There was an argument. Fiance and I excused ourselves and we went home.

Got some texts afterwards about how I ruined dinner and I should apologize but I don't think I'm the one who should be apologizing. I see this as a 'you can serve it but not take it' situation so I don't feel I owe anyone an apology. AITA?",317,3223,0.98
398,Asshole,"Hello everyone,

I have been with my (now ex) fiance for just about four years and recently broke off our engagement due to his parent's racist remarks at a restaurant.  We were to be married in June of this year.

To make a long story short, we met at a work conference in 2015 and maintained a long distance relationship (he lived in CA, I lived in N.C.) and made it work.  We got together for about a week every two months or so, and during this time, I met his family and he subsequently met mine when we were in each other's towns.  There were no red flags, not even a hint of how racist his parents really are - I ultimately found this out a few weeks ago.

We (me, him, and his parents) were out to dinner a few weeks ago and this little boy, must have been six years old or so, accidentally tripped our waitress resulting in dropped plates and food getting all over his mother and father. 

I had never seen such a dramatic shift in mood, but my future father-in-law stood up and started spewing A LOT of hateful remarks about people of other races -- I'll spare you all the details, but it was extremely vile and disgusting stuff.  People started recording on their phones.  It was a HUGE scene that left me VERY embarrassed and ashamed to be there - what makes matters even worse was that my mother-in-law did not disagree with him; she sat there nodding her head in agreement  My fiance didn't say anything,he just sat there. He didn't acknowledge what his father said, but the fact that he just let it go and didn't stand up to him was very telling.

The day after this incident I drove over to his house and broke off our engagement.  Understandably, he was very upset and naturally we had a big argument which I'm sure the neighbors heard.  I know he didn't say anything at dinner and I asked him point blank ""Are you a racist?"" - he did not answer, only turned away.  I'm not sure what that meant.

I had absolutely no idea his family was like this and a big life lesson I have learned is to spend more time with a partner's family before making any decisions.  I simply can not be with someone whose family harbors so much hate - the apple doesn't drop far from the tree.

What conflicts me is that his family paid for the entire wedding - everything from the venue, to the dresses, to the food, to the decorations.  Me personally, I don't come from a lot of money and would have been happy with a nice backyard wedding.  But I know they spent a lot which makes me feel terrible.

Does this make me an asshole?",690,1154,0.91
399,Not the A-hole,"I've run a D&D for a group of 6 players for 3 years now. I'm the DM as well as the host. One of my players Dan asked to bring his coworker Brian to the game. We agreed and Dan would help him out while he learned the game.

First couple sessions went fine. I've played with new players before and I understand there is a learning curve with D&D. Dan did a good job helping him fill out his sheets and explaining how to calculate rolls. All was well. Then after the 3rd session Dan was still helping Brian with almost every single roll or decision. Brian just either didn't absorb what was being taught to him or wasn't really listening and learning from it.

I talked to Dan one day and asked if Brian was enjoying the game. Dan said Brian liked playing with us, but he didn't seem to care about the rules.  I explained to Brian that we really needed him to understand the rules.  Having to show him how to do everything each turn was slowing down the game and burning through our limited play time.  Brian said he ""just wasn't a rules kinda guy"" and I repeated that it was important for everyone at the table.  He seemed to agree and said he'd read up.

Well Brian didn't show up for last week's session and Dan said he'd been badmouthing me and calling me an asshole. He also said I'd implied he was stupid for not knowing the rules. This isn't true.  Eventually the entire table got to talking about it and everyone agreed we were losing a lot of game progress because of Brian. Dan agreed to talk to Brian and try and smooth things over but make sure Brian knew we needed him to know the rules going forward.

Fast forward to this week's session and Brian comes. Everybody is in good spirits until we get into our first big encounter. Brian is right back to needing Dan to help him do everything again and the table's mood plummets. We end up ending the session early because two of the players want to leave early. Later that night I went into a group chat for our play group and asked if anyone would object to me kicking Brian out since he refuses to learn the rules and talking to him solves nothing. Dan objected saying we just needed to give him some time while everyone else agreed it was for the best. I explained to Dan that I'd given Brian ample time to learn the basics and that if he hadn't figured it out by now he probably never would.

Dan wasn't happy about it and said that if I wanted Brian gone it was up to me to tell him. I texted Brian and told him he was uninvited to the group since he refused to learn the rules and it was ruining the game for others. He responded telling me I was an asshole and that I could go fuck myself. Dan has been cold to me since so I am leaving him alone. Everyone else in the group agrees with the decision and while I still think I did what was right I feel like an asshole for kicking him out when he seemed to enjoy playing with us.",22,43,0.89

402,Asshole,"Some quick background.  My wife and are mid 30 professionals, together for 7 years with 2 kids, age 4 and 2.

&#x200B;

So, my wife has been getting more and more upset lately with the fact that after she goes to bed I like to load my vape and smoke some weed, often resulting in me falling asleep on the couch until I eventually wake up (usually around 4am) and crawl into bed.

I smoked weed before we met and during the onset of our relationship, when I still had a lot of ""me time"".  Obviously as our lives started becoming less about us and more about our family, my weed smoking slowed.  Just recently though, weed became legal where I live and I got back into it, more frequently.

When I began smoking more regularly, she let me know, that she has never been a huge fan of hanging out with me when I'm stoned.  I don't see a huge difference in my personality when I smoke, but it is obvious to her, so I agreed that I wouldn't smoke when we were together.

My wife has always been an early to bed type person (like 10:30ish), whereas I have always been a night owl (1ish).  So, lately I use that time when my wife goes to bed smoke my dope and reddit or watch youtube or movies or whatever.

The issue she says she has is that I often end up falling asleep on the couch and either she will wake up without me in bed and feel the need to come downstairs and wake me up to come to bed, or when I wake up on my own and come to bed, I'm disrupting her sleep.  My wife is a light sleeper, and in the past would use earplugs and a blindfold when sleeping to block out any possibly stimuli, but sine we had kids she doesn't use earplugs because... kids.

I have tried coming to bed when she goes to bed, but I just lay there watching netflix at a volume that is barely audible until I fall asleep at my usual time, and it is miserable and makes me feel resentful.

We've talked about all of this and have come to an impasse.  I tried to explain to her that I enjoy the few late night hours that I have to myself to do the tings that I enjoy and I don't feel they have any significant impact on her.  She does not agree and feels that waking up in the middle of the night to ""bring me to bed"" or my coming to bed is a huge interference in her sleep.

&#x200B;

So, AITA?  I have no idea and await your judgement.

&#x200B;

Edit: People are concerned about my kids being exposed to my weed.  Just to clarify, I do not smoke/vape in the house and I put all my supplies away in their secure place before I even step outside to do my business.

&#x200B;

Update:  Thank you all for you input and advice, I truly appreciate it.  The wife and I had a talk last night and then a fight, and then a talk.  At the end of the day, my relationship is more important than anything else and I will be cutting back on the amount of dope I smoke and will also be setting an alarm when I do smoke to ensure I don't pass out on the couch until the wee hours of the am.  She also admitted outright that the weed smoking was a large part of the problem, not just the disruption in her sleep, but through our talk she came to a better understanding as to why I smoke and why I need that alone time after she goes to bed.  We both felt better after all was put out in the open.

Thanks again for the perspective and insight that I had difficulty seeing for myself.",138,73,0.92
403,Not the A-hole,"I live in small 2-bedroom apartment in a very large & expensive city. I often sublet the spare bedroom to people who come to town for extended stays. I provide them with everything they need bedroom-wise...bed, nightstand, dresser, TV, linens, and of course they are welcome to use any of the amenities I have in the apartment. Every tenant signs a sublease with me listing the rules and expectations of the house. One of these rules is my guest policy: 48 hours max. 

&#x200B;

Currently, I have a roommate who has been taking advantage of this policy. First, it was a guy she was seeing that was spending multiple nights in a row. Then, another friend came to visit from out of town. This friend was originally scheduled to stay for 4 nights, but I reminded my roommate of the policy she had agreed to, and now he's only here for 2 nights. Last night (while her friend was still in town) she told me her mother is coming to stay with us next week. For 4 nights.

&#x200B;

Again, I remind my roommate of the policy she agreed to, but this time she pushed back. She said things are ""pretty tough"" with her family right now and she would really appreciate it if her mother could stay for 4 nights. I stayed firm on my no (beyond 2 nights). My roommate was not happy about this and is clearly very upset with me.

&#x200B;

Am I being ridiculous here? I was very upfront about this rule, and I live by it, too, btw. I also offered to help her mother find an affordable housing alternative for her visit, because if things are as ""tough"" as roommate says they are, there are certainly options available.

&#x200B;

TL;DR I have a strict 48hr guest policy for sublets in my apartment. Roommate has a ton of guests, now wants mother to stay for 4 nights and insists that I should allow it because ""things are tough"" right now. I still said no.",32,41,0.96
404,Asshole,"My ex was everything I wanted in a partner except for ambitious.  That’s what proved to be our downfall.  He was a “kitchen assistant” at his uncle’s restaurant.  Basically washing dishes, bussing tables, and general cleaning.  I tried talking to him about looking for other work, something he could make a future in, but he was happy there.  

So I broke things off.  I thought it best to be straight forward with him about it.  He didn’t yell or cry or anything really until I had finished.  Then he coldly told me that he would eventually take over for his uncle when he retires and had been being trained on how to run the business for years, was that ambitious enough for me?   

I tried to say yes!  It was literally all I wanted was to know that he had his sights set higher than washing dishes for the rest of his life, but my ex kicked me out of his apt and wouldn’t have anything to do with me afterwards.

It seems like it's good for people to remember that at any point the advice they are reading regarding their 20 year marriage might just be coming from someone who isn't even old enough to buy a drink, or shave. The thought of marriages and careers and lives being changed all because a 15 year old with no life experience told you to ""get out"" is actually incredibly scary to me.

This isn't to say no 15 year old is ever going to have good advice. Honestly I knew a lot of teenagers who were more adult than any of the 30 years olds I know to this day. But it is still incredibly important to remember your advice and judgement might be coming from a high schooler. Take everything you read here with about a pound of salt, a single grain won't do it.

So I know it's been awhile but I figured I might as well update as it's a bit of a crazy story.

So I was at work when I got a text from the GF telling me she was at the cop shop making a report and that when I got home make sure the doors are locked and if I saw BF call the cops on sight. I'm so stoked right I've just been ***waiting*** for the chance to call the cops on this guy. I get home and I'm prob too over zealous. Someone knocks on the door and says her name a few times. I can't really see outside but the voice sounds like the BF to me so I tell her its him call the cops. She asks me if I'm sure because the cops are going to sic the dogs on him. I say yes. Turns out its just our other male roommate and I feel like a total ass. I talk to him and he tells me he really doesn't think BF would come back since he knows cops have been called. I disagree.

The next night she asks me if I heard what happened. I didn't and she tells the story of how he had been hiding in the cellar so he had been IN THE HOUSE the whole time which is freaky AF. In the middle of the night he came into her room and grabbed her phone away and said all this stuff about how he would be better but refused to give her her phone even to set an alarm for work. She had to play a long for her safety but in the morning she got a chance to grab the phone away she called 911 and ran into the back alley. He chased after her but cop cars pulled up on either side and got him. It sounds like something out of a movie to me its wild. It sucks that she was so scared that she couldn't just yell that he's here and we'd call 911 but I learned he has threatened lots to kill her and light the house on fire if she told anyone. I'm just so happy he's in jail now and she doesn't have to suffer at his hand anymore. She's been coming out of her room more because as I suspected he had been forcing her to stay in there so he wouldn't get jealous of her interacting with any other male roommates. So the update is basically asshole is in jail and the GF is noticeably happier!

Context: It was a Friday night and we went for drinks after work. We started as a large group and split off and moved to a busy bar. We managed to get a booth and we had all had quite a lot to drink. Throughout the night people were moving around the building and getting split up making it difficult to find each other. As I checked the last train my phone died so I left and noticed a backpack left at the booth we were at, I took it with me assuming it was a colleagues. When I came in Monday it was clear this bag didn't belong to anyone, we searched through to find some identification but the bag was largely empty.

Now, a lot of my friends kind of live on the way home....only if I drive another route and not the fastest route for me. If I choose to give 1-2 a lift home, this will add maybe 20-30 mins to my journey home (as I’m not going the fastest way home). I honestly do not mind this at all.

However, it’s when 3 or 4 friends want a lift home too, this will easily add another 15 mins per person, meaning it will add another 1hr to my commute so it takes me 1hr 45 mins instead of just 40 mins or so. 

AITA? 

It makes me not want to go out and meet up with my friends because I don’t want to catch public transport back home (long commute), but I also don’t want a long commute having to drive all my friends home. (You can’t exactly say “I will drop only 2 people home, but the other 2 I won’t”). I’ve thought about dropping all my friends at a more closer area to their home so they can catch the cab home (and at a location that’s on the way home for me), but then if it’s late at night, I feel bad I might be putting them in a risky situation.

419,No A-holes here,"Gf and I have been dating since August and she moved in with me at the beginning of this month.  Before she was living in a shared house and once they found someone to rent her room she came to live with me.  

It really didn’t take long before things went south.  She’s pretty messy, she picks fights over dumb stuff like tv, she’s been smoking inside when I’m not around even though she agreed to go outside to smoke.  She’s also gotten really controlling about what we do in our free time.  All she wants to do is sit around here and if I go out without her she’ll get mad.  Lately she’s also been saying she wants to quit her job and find something else which is a huge red flag for me.  

It’s just not working out.   I know we’ll probably break up when I tell her I want to leave, but if this is what living with her is like it’s probably for the best.   I wouldn’t just let her go homeless, I’d give her time to find another house share, but part of me feels guilty.  She can’t move back to where she was before so she’ll have to live with new people.

420,No A-holes here,"Hey guys, I am just wondering if I would be the asshole for asking her to stop asking me if I love her. (TLDR at bottom)

A little backstory: my past girlfriend has been cheated on in her last 3 serious relationships. When I first met her I literally fell in love with her day one. We spent 10 hours talking in her car 10pm till 8am. It was crazy. We then spent the next 3 days together hanging out as new friends. After a while of flirting back in forth I asked if we could go on a date. She said no, she didn’t want to be hurt / hurt me. I talked to her for the next month and eventually we started hooking up. After a while she said we had to stop as I kept asking to be in a relationship. We stopped, we tried to stay friends. Didn’t work. The break ended up finally getting us into a relationship, this took 6 months. She had a lot of break downs saying I would get sick of her and it wouldn’t be worth he risk but she finally changed her mind. YAY. 
 
Now to the present. We have been dating for a year. She asks me on an almost daily basis if I still love her, I say yes, she says reallly, I reply yes. Now this both frustrates me, but also makes me feel terrible. I feel like I’m a shitty boyfriend and am not making her feel appreciated/loved. I brought this up with her and she said “ no your great it’s all in my head “. 
She still asks me for this validation, it’s really starting to frustrate me a lot as I tell her daily I love her without her asking. This in turn makes me feel like I’m not doing enough and feel shitty. Would I be the asshole if I told her I really need her to stop as it’s effecting me even though she has trust issues. 

TLDR: spent 6 months getting a girl with trust issues in a relationship. 1 year in and she asks me daily GENUINLY if I still love her and it’s getting to me, would I be the asshole if I ask her to stop. ",28,42,0.99
421,Not the A-hole,"Okay I'm going to try to explain this as clearly as possible. 

Lately my husband has been ""playing the Devil's advocate"" in every conversation we have. If he had a horrible day at work and comes home and vents to me I generally end up on the ""boss man is an asshole train"" (because he fucking is). All of a sudden he will flip.and try to explain WHY his boss acted like a dick. 

Or when we were talking about the game we both have played our entire marriage. He will be complaining about the way the game has been broken during the latest expansion. I will join in and affirm that it's the reason I'm not playing anymore. Boom he flips and starts like defending the devs. 

It's driving me crazy and really makes me not want to talk to him. Like at all, it gets really old to have every word coming out of my mouth second guessed and picked apart.  I've told him how I feel about it but he says it's more fun to have conversations if everyone has different views and that I'm being too sensitive. He gets weirdly aggressive during these talks, nothing physical but like he makes shit way bigger than it really is. He gets really intense I guess is what I would explain it as. 

So, AITA for wanting my husband to change the way he's been communicating with me lately? Am I being too sensitive?",46,31,0.93

I however like my job and wouldn’t leave it.   I’m also not interested in a long distance relationship.  So if she does join up it would end the relationship.  

We were talking about it tonight and she asked me if I could handle being a base wife jokingly.   I  was honest with her about what I said above and she got angry with me.  She says it’s not because I said we would break up, but because we were just casually talking about it and I could have just gone along with it.   I’m genuinely confused, I thought being honest about my feelings on it was the best course.  ",26,51,0.97

So there is my roommate, an ok person BUT I cant communicate with him in any way, he always stays in his room and comes out just to cook. I have just been asking him for the past months to keep his sh%% clean, but I always get ignored. 

He won't wash the dishes until he run out of them, won't dump the garbage until theres no room left and all the shit roommate thing. But thats not all

3 months ago he got his new gf, who his as stinky and naughty as him, and they directly started living together. They produce loads of trash that sits there for weeks, and there's a ton of trash everywhere everytime. I asked them more than once to PLEASE take at least the trash out every other day but ignored.

I'm really pissed because I always keep all my stuff in place and I also have people that comes over.

I didnt want to come to this but since 3 4 days ago there is this shit stink of fish everywhere in the house, and that's not even bothering them. Since im really fed up, I will just expose them as soon as I get home and eradicate this problem.

424,Asshole,"I’m a girl and I work in a pretty laid back restaurant. The majority of our staff are also women. 

The environment is generally pretty chill and we’ve all become decent friends. We’re all happy to help each other out by swapping shifts/covering them if anyone is ever sick or busy etc. 

Get ready for TMI. Personally, I don’t have much trouble when it comes to my period. I rarely get cramps, and when I do just taking a couple painkillers fixes it. I do get kinda crabby and emotional sometimes, but I try not to let it ruin my day/shifts. 

However, all the other girls I work with often take days off as a result of period pain. 3 times in the last month I’ve gone out of my way to swap and cover shifts to help out my coworkers who ‘can’t’ work as a result of period pain. It’s beginning to annoy me because they’re taking multiple shifts a week off for something that I barely consider painful. 

Of course I know that I can just decline to take/swap a shift, but last time I was approached by a girl to cover a shift, she called me a dickhead for not taking the shift even though I said I wasn’t busy (I didn’t have anything planned but I didn’t want to work another shift, especially for someone who I believe is overreacting to the amount of pain they’re experiencing) 

AITA in the situation? Particularly when I decline to take a shift that I would’ve taken if the person was genuinely ill? I just really don’t feel that period pain is a good enough reason to not work. ",307,309,0.88
425,Not the A-hole,"There’s a girl I’ve been seeing for about four months now.  Things have been going good.  We have a lot in common.  

Earlier today though she told me she had to have a serious talk with me.  She told me that she is schitzoeffective, which upon my own research is like schizophrenia with added mental illness on top of it.  She also told me that she didn’t work like she told me, but was on disability for this illness.  I really didn’t know what to say.  She explained that she hadn’t told me until now because in the past when she’s been upfront with people about it they start treating her like she’s either dumb or dangerous and that she’s neither.  That she just wanted me to get to know her before I judged her for her illness like people in her past have.  

I was as tactful as I could be.   She wanted to know if I had any questions, but I felt like she had been lying to me the entire time I’ve known her so I didn’t really want any answers from her, I wanted to do a little research about it on my own as I don’t really have any experience with this kind of illness. 

So I told her I needed some time to think and went home to read up on it.  From what I’ve read it is unfortunately a deal breaker kind of thing for me.  While she might be stable now and could be for a long time, it’s likely that there will be multiple breaks for her.   There’s also a lot of evidence that this illness can be passed on through the mother’s side of the family so if it were to ever get that far any children we would have would be at risk.   She’s a great girl and I wish her the best, but it’s just too much for me to handle.  

I don’t know how to go about telling her.   I know she’s had a lot of bad experiences with people turning her away because of her illness and I hate to add to that list, but I feel like if I lie it’s going to be obvious that I’m lying.  ",44,34,0.88
426,Not the A-hole,"My best friend had been dating this guy for about two months when she told me she was going on a road trip with her boyfriend. This road trip would’ve been about 8-9 hours. 

Initially I was super uncomfortable with it since I’ve never met him or spoken to him and she absolutely refused to let us meet or tell anyone about him,, especially her parents. 

She said she was going to be gone for three days and I saw her last on Friday. We hung out and she had all her bags with her. She told me that she told her parents that she was gone camping with me which is the first red flag of this story. She also said that I was the only person she told she was going on a trip to and the tplaced all the responsibility on me. 

We both live in the same neighbourhood about five minutes from each other and this lie didn’t even make sense. Before I could say anything else she left as her boyfriend picked her up. 

Three days later and I haven’t heard from her at all and I was getting worried. She promised she would tell me when she got there but nada. She was off all social media and my texts weren’t going through and I couldn’t contact any of her friends since she refused to let me meet them too. I may be salty. 

I started getting anxious as I kept thinking she might’ve been murdered or had an accident so I went to her brother first and told her what was going on and then we both spoke to their parents. Her mom went into hysterics and we immediately went to the police department to file a report. 

The officer working with us was encouraging me to try and hack her social media to find information as well as find the social media of her boyfriend. Eventually they were able to reach her boyfriend and it turns out she flew to Cuba and didn’t consider the consequences of her lies. 

She said I broke her trust and that I ruined our friendship because I was worried about her. AITA?

We’re all adults btw. I realize she can do whatever the hell she wants but it was unfair to me and I feel like I did the right thing. I miss her so much but she treated me so poorly. Am I just too clingy or should I have just not gotten involved? Smh 

Edit*
Best friend and I are both 20, her boyfriend is 25+ 

The police actually told me to keep trying her social media. It was how we found out she left the country and the name of her bf and pictures of him. She was boutta be on the news. ",71,222,0.97
427,Not the A-hole,"So about a year ago I popped the big question. I was deeply in love with my girlfriend and everything felt amazing. That is until she transformed into a bridezilla in front of my eyes. 

Ever since we got engaged all she can do is talk about the wedding, which was fine at first but it started to consume her. I thought that I would get some say in how the day was going to go but everything I suggest is immediately shot down. The only choice I got to make was my tux and even that had to fit her God damn color scheme. 

Well things really started ramping up when her mother came down for the weekend. She's your typical trailer trash woman who married into a successful family. All her ideas are awful and tacky yet my fiancee laps it up like a dehydrated person in a desert. When I try to bring it up with her she tells me that this is ""her"" big day and I should just be supportive. I told her it was my money and that I should have more say in how it's spent. Her mom picked out maroon table clothes with flowers and suns on them, I feel like it's a funeral for a carnival worker. She even suggested we have beer kegs on tap.

So the last straw was that her and her mother, without my consent, used my credit card as a payment on a venue down by a river instead of the church we discussed where my family has attended for generations and made many contributions, the pricing was even a little cheaper minus the price of the hall afterwards. Who wants to get married next to a stinking river full of flies and whatever other insects will float around, on top of all the people who will just waltz up to the river to enjoy the day while were trying to get married. 

I finally had enough so after she told me what she did I cancelled the payment on my credit card (after spending hours dealing with my credit card company) and told her she could either set up a date at the church or find someone else to marry because I've had enough of this. She's spent the last couple hours bawling her eyes out to her mom and making me seem like the monster after she went behind my back. 

Am I the asshole in this situation? 

TL;DR:  my fiancee became a bridezilla and won't let me make any decisions and her and her mother have teamed up against me. She chose a venue without my consent so I cancelled the payment and told her that she either goes with my choice of where we get married or we aren't getting married at all.

Update 1: Thank you everyone for your great responses. It has been pretty eye opening to say the least, I'm going to confront her in the morning. I'll post another update for anyone still interested.

Update 2: I tried creating a new thread but don't understand how the filters work. Here'what happened after. 

I got a lot of great advice from my post last and the main thing that I took away was that someone using your money for large purchases behind your back is a big red flag. Well it turns out you guys were right because I decided to look into our finances regarding the wedding and found a lot more than I bargained for. 

I have a large savings account that I have been putting money into for the last 8 years or so, about a year back my fiancee ran into some vehicle trouble and it was a hassle so I gave her access to my account in case of emergencies in the future. This same account is what we were using for a lot of the wedding expenses. We agreed on a maximum price that we could spend out of it and everything else would have to come directly out of pocket. I don't often keep tabs on the account because really it's in the back of my mind, I put money out of each check into it and move on.

 Well after all this went down yesterday I decided to check all my finances and found out that not only had she exceeded the limit we had agreed too, but that some of the money coming out didn't make sense. She had transfered almost $2000 to her mother recently. I confronted her about this today and her answer was that her mom needed the money to come down because she can't be spending her money right now due to a new business venture her mother and father are involved in. I was angry because it's bullshit that not only is the mother and father not helping with the wedding but we have to pay for them the entire time too. These people are pretty well off so it's pretty ridiculous. That wasn't the end of it though because after more arguing my fiancee told me that she paid for her mother and her dad to come down last time too and it wasn't a big deal and that I didn't even notice the money was gone so who cares. 

After learning all this I told her the wedding was off for now until I get a chance to think things through. She cried and begged for another chance but I wouldn't budge I told her I need time. She's staying at the hotel with her mother tonight and I'm not sure what I'm going to do yet. I'm so mad right now and feel really betrayed. I don't know if she's the right one for me anymore. 

We have talked over the phone recently but still haven't gotten anywhere. It's a pretty tough situation all around. 

Thanks for listening everyone. I'll update more if you're still interested.

428,Not the A-hole,"I am relatively new to the subreddit and decided I should participate more than just by casting judgement on others. I guess it is my turn to be judged.

This happened some time ago.

My grandfather and I were super close. Essentially he played the role of my father. We were best friends.

He worked as an operator at a steel refinery. He was one of the guys that controlled the huge machines that put the billets on the rollers etc. It was a physically toxic environment which resulted in emphysema as well as lung cancer.

Near the end of his life, he suffered a heart attack which landed him in hospital. The family rallied around him, and we would take turns visiting him, taking care of him, taking his favorite snacks / magazines etc. We all spent a lot of time in the hospital with him just to make sure he wasn't lonely.

At this time, I was in training for a new job and was in the final evaluation phase. During the last week, we were called to the hospital by the doctors on three different occasions to ""say goodbye"" - the doctors were convinced he wouldn't make it through the night each time. Granted, his organs were shutting down one by one and was basically only alive because he was hooked up to a dialysis machine. 

Keep in mind, each time we got the call from the doctors, we all took our turns saying good bye. He was no longer conscious at this point. We were all shattered, basically having our final words with him each time. Each time we got the call, we dropped everything so that we could go through to see him.

On the day that he died, we got another call from the hospital saying that we should come say good bye to him. This time, I refused to go. I had already said my good-byes and was way too emotionally raw to have to go through it again. Part of me felt that we would just get the same call the next day, and the next after that. I think I was in denial that he was actually dying, telling myself that he will pull through it. Needless to say, he passed away that same day, and since then I have carried a lot of guilt with me for not going the last time. 

AITA for not going one final time?

429,Asshole,"So let's get it straight, I am not. I'm bisexual but my bestfriend isn't. He is straight with little to no fragile masculinity. To be honest, we haven't known each other for a while, he's been my classmate for 5 months but he has been the most wholesome friend I have ever known. Of course, its hard not to fall in love with him, especially with his humor and intelligence. 

When I was trying to move on with my boyfriend, our chats casually transformed from words of encouragement to flirts. He made it easier for me to move on. Although you can still see that he is maintaining a barrier between us, like he doesn't flirt back when I flirt but still calls me baby and stuff.

I know he isn't serious with his flirting, like he was only messing around. But even so, I wanted to take it to another level. As a joke, I invited him to be friends with benefits with me, to have sex with me, but I meant it deep inside. He agreed immediately, saying he doesn't want to be a virgin anymore, and that sex would be the perfect stress reliever from academics. He was even more excited that me. Sexting, video calling, buying condoms, and he even scheduled a hotel for us to do it.

So we hit it off, it was the happiest day of my life. The way he talks, he chats, his eyes, his kisses, I just THOUGHT he was mine, that he was in love with me. I was so happy that I told half of my friends about it, and I know I shouldn't have done that especially for something so private, but I was just so happy that no amount of common sense made me do the most reasonable thing to do. 

After a week, he blocked me on facebook and twitter. It's been 3 months now and he still hasn't messaged me back. I've said sorry in real life and he still won't start talking to me. I just miss my bestfriend and I miss talking to him.

So he was angry at me for inviting him to have sex even if he was more excited to do it. AITA?

430,Asshole,"I was born, raised and went to college in Philadelphia but my fiance is from the south. Last year his cousin got married at this plantation and it was really beautiful and had a nice aesthetic and since we were getting married in the South I wanted to have a plantation wedding as well. Obviously I don't support slavery in any way but it's just a pretty location to have a wedding and evokes southern charm with the antebellum themed houses and beautiful backdrop.

&#x200B;

When we started planning the wedding, I asked 6 of my friends to be my bridesmaids. One of my bridesmaids I was  best friends with in elementary, middle and  high school but drifted apart a bit when we went to colleges in different states. We are still friends but  definitely feel college change us in many ways. She became very passionate about social justice issues and black identity (she is biracial- half black half white) which is great but we don't relate as much as we used to although I still love her. However, she is completely against the idea of a plantation wedding. She says it's like having a wedding at a concentration camp and plantations were the settings of terrible practices towards slaves . I really think this is an unfair comparison. People were killed at concentration camps and those are set up as memorials to the holocaust.

&#x200B;

But she is very adamant about it and says if I have a plantation wedding she won't be my bridesmaid and won't attend my wedding. I think it's a bit ridiculous and dramatic to sacrifice a 15 year friendship over something so petty and give me an ultimatum. It's a piece of land that has culture and history. What's worse is that it's making some of the my other brides maids uncomfortable now and they are thinking I should just have the wedding at a different location.

My boyfriend started smoking early in our relationship and he was the typical lightweight new smoker. It was fine when it was only a few times a week but now he's smoking everyday too. Everytime I smoke he wants to share with me, which I wouldn't mind except for when he's high he either is very physically rough (playful but he's stronger than me so I regularly get hurt) or he acts incapable of doing anything and makes me do everything. He often pays for the weed for both of us so it's not about the money but about how we interact when he's high. He's just having a good time but I get sick of the roughhousing and laziness. 

I still plan on letting him smoke whenever  he wants but AITA not wanting him to smoke with me anymore? Even if I smoke 5-8 times a day? 

Edit: Our relationship and everyone that smokes is not automatically  ""tOxIc""

432,Not the A-hole,"So, there's this FtM guy I used to date when he, let's call him Dan, was still she, let's call her Kate. We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.

This led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.

So, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. 

So this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.",153,174,0.91

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.

However, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.

437,Not the A-hole,"My one coworker (Jen) is very openly gay, which is of course perfectly fine with me. I only take issue with one word that she uses often, whether she’s referring to herself or to someone else: fa***t. 

According to Jen, people use to call her this when she was a teenager. She says that as a lesbian, she is allowed to use the term. I suppose it may be some kind of empowering act for her to own who she is, which I understand. 

However, today I finally snapped. The sound of “fa***t” is just so grating on my ears! It’s like my entire body recoils when I hear it. I wince every single time. 

Jen and I have worked together for months, and today is the first time I built up the courage to say something (I’m pretty shy, so it takes A LOT for me to finally complain about something; I generally just go with the flow). 

“Jen, would you mind not using that term around me in the future? To be honest, it makes me very uncomfortable.”

She seemed taken aback, and reiterated that other people used to bully her with the term. I replied that my position remains the same; it makes me deeply uncomfortable for her to be yelling “fa***t!” across the office, especially when there are clients nearby who may overhear. 

Jen got quiet, then took an early lunch break and never came back to the office. I’m worried. Am I the asshole?",30,32,0.84
438,Asshole,"My girlfriend (18 F) and I (17 M) have been dating for close to a year now. With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. 

&#x200B;

Well, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.

My girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?

About a week or two after moving in, he took up a full time job (previously self-employed) where he regularly works 8 to 12 hour shifts. He gets maybe two days off a week. I am currently self-employed and I can only work when he's off since we don't have anyone to sit for her. 

However, I'm finding watching her 24/7 to be exhausting. I have severe anxiety issues and recently went through some depressing events that have made it even worse. I feel somewhat disappointed in myself because this stage of her life should be easy, especially if I have nothing else to do all day, yet it feels like even doing basic chores is difficult. I've also been having anger issues that are out of character for me, and I get scared that I could end up hurting her even though I know I wouldn't do that. 

If the baby is still awake by the time my husband gets off work, or on his off days, I beg him to watch her for a while. I feel bad for doing this knowing that he has worked all day, and I usually wait at least an hour or so for him to settle in and relax before I ask. A lot of the time, he'll usually point out that he's worked all day and I haven't, but I'm just so exhausted. I know he works hard but taking care of a baby on your own can be hard work too.

She was going to spend the rest of the month in her apartment then move into my place, and she's been spending most days over here anyway gradually moving some of her stuff in.

This is fucking gross, so fair warning. For the three days straight she's been over I've noticed an odd smell when I picked up my toothbrush. I wasn't sure what it was so I rinsed it and kept using it as normal. One morning she asked me if I had noticed anything different, but refused to elaborate when I asked for an explanation so I was on high alert now. I left my phone running in the washroom peaking out of the towel cabinet that faces the sink, and I totally get how invasive that was and if it turned out I was wrong I was prepared to admit to it and accept the consequences for my assumptions as they came. I know I'm the asshole for that, but that's not what I'm asking.

Turns out she had been rubbing my toothbrush inside her pants in the mornings as she wakes up before me and putting it back in the container. When I got my phone and seen the video I was livid, and confronted her immediately. She reacted like it was a gigantic joke, laughing, trying to hug me and saying she wanted to see how long it'd take for me to figure it out. Apparently she viewed it as a prank.

I felt incredibly disgusted and betrayed, I feel like it's disrespectful and not at all a prank and it's unhygienic. It's not even like she did it once, she had been doing it for days. I told her to get the stuff that she had brought over in the past few days and leave, that I didn't want to be with her anymore.

She's absolutely dumbfounded I could see this as anything other than a harmless prank. It's her opinion that it shouldn't matter because I washed it before use anyway. On one hand, she's been so inconsolable and has been begging me to reconsider so much that I'm second guessing my decision to end it and wondering whether I'm being too harsh. On the other hand, if this is her idea of a prank and the sort of thing she can do, not only do I not trust her in my house around my stuff, I don't trust her in general.

So I have seen her naked more times than I can count and my gf has never once said anything about it.

So last week we went on vacation and my gf asked Beth to dogsit for us while we were gone and she agreed. So before we left I wrote a note detailing the ins and outs that she would need to be made aware of. The final note of the list was me letting her know that we put up security cams in the house. I did that with a little bit of humor by saying, ""Friendly reminder: We installed security cameras so if you do the horizontal tango while we are gone, we will know and we will watch... repeatedly.""

My girlfriend saw the note before leaving and didn't object to it at all. She just laughed and called me an idiot. So the first night my girlfriend tells me, ""Looks like she found your note, she jiggled her tits in front of the camera."" So I laugh and open my phone to take a look.

Now comes the tricky part. 

After 8ish months of our relationship we had an ""engagement"" in his house, after I came back from my 2 month trip. He proposed with gummy bears and I said yes hugged kissed had sex etc.. It was huge highlight of our relationship and one of the cutest moments we had. After that sometimes we would call each other fiance/e and make statements that we are engaged. But nobody knows about that because its between us. 

Now, a few hours ago we were having a casual conversation and word fiancee came up and I told him something along the lines ""but you know we are not actually engaged"". He got upset and I quickly explained that I still mean to marry him and Im still promised to him but that it wasnt real engagement since nobody knows about it. Then he said he cant actually propose me because we are too young. I agreed with him and stated that I in fact dont want him to propose now but I just made sure he knew that wasnt real engagement. 

So since that talk he is deeply hurt by my words and says something must have happened for me to say it and doesnt understand how its not real.

456,No A-holes here,"So, my daugther will be turning 17 in a month and wished to dye her hair turqouise/blue for her birthday.
I honestly don't see a problem with that, hair dye is temporary and she's old enough to decide what she wants to do with her hair.

Well, my wife disagrees. She thinks it's a sign of teenage rebellion - I told her I doubt that since my daugther asked us if that would be and acceptable present - and is worried people will think she's ""rowdy"" and that our family will look like we have problems. 

I tried to talk it over with her, but she thinks it'll result in her grades getting worse and her slacking of in general. (I really don't see the connection.)

I love my daughter and know how badly she wants to dye her hair, so would I be the asshole if I just took her to get her hair dyed for her birthday?

to clarify since someone asked: 
yes, my wife isn't the biological mother, i am, in fact.
my daugther is the child of my ex-boyfriend, but i've been together married to my wife since my daughter was four.

After reading your replies I agree, I shouldn't go behind my wife's back, but, being honest, I don't agree with her reasoning.

My solution would be to tell her and explain to her why I want to take my daughter to get her her dyed and why I disagree with her on this.

If I'd go with that, would I still be the asshole if I take my daugther to get her dyed *after* telling my wife why I am doing this?

//final edit:

First of all, thanks for your opinions.
many of you suggested to use dying hair as a reward/letting her get blue hair and dye it back if her grades slip - while I understand what you think, I won't think it's a good idea. I don't want to treat hair dye as a privilege for behaving well, I think she's old enought o decide on her own.

More importantly though - I talked to my wife and rven showed her this post. While she still opposes blue hair, she sees that she was too controlling.
All three of us sat down and I'm happy to say we found an agreement and my daugther is getting her hair dyed a darker reddish-purple, which she is happy about, too. My wife also said she'll think about other colours once she sees how this one looks.

A lot of women go to fancy ski resorts to wear expensive outfits, drink at bars, and party, but my girlfriend means business. She can ski circles around me, and I'm 100% proud of her. 

Usually she dresses nicely to ski, since it's a fashionable ski resort and she's a fashionable person. However, this weekend, she said she didn't feel like dressing up, and instead just wore black snowpants, an old parka, and a hockey jersey. I didn't see anything wrong with it. She also wore a pair of my old skis with the bindings adjusted to fit her boots and a black helmet. What I'm saying is, anybody who saw her would have thought she was a man. 

Anyways, we were in the gondola with this old couple. My GF (her helmet was still on) rested her head on my shoulder and we were holding hands. The couple must have mistaken her for a dude, because they gave us a weird look. The old lady whispered something to her husband. Then my GF took off her helmet, and they looked really confused when they realized she was a girl. 

We were making conversation with them, and then, just as we were about to exit the gondola, the old lady goes, ""Oh, we thought at first that you two were gays. Thank God."" She laughs and expects us to laugh with her. I reply, ""That's really fucking narrow minded of you. You should be ashamed of yourself.""

A few minutes after my order arrives, two elderly women come by and asks if they can sit at my table. I told them ""no, there will be another table that opens up. I'd like to sit alone."" They responded, ""no, we're going to sit here because there's a lot of people and it's busy."" I don't know or believe if they waited in the ""table"" line because the only way to get a table that I noticed is to be seated by a waiter - my guess is they came from the quicker to-go line and found my table with 3 empty seats. After I tell the older women no again, they begin to pull chairs to sit, but the couple next to me quickly grab their stuff and say they're leaving while offering their table. The guy tells me in a snarky tone, ""I hope you enjoy your trip."" ""I sure will,"" I responded. The older women were then joined by two other older women who asked if they could share the table, and the original two older women bad mouthed me about how rude and mean I am. I ignored it, pulled my laptop to take up the whole table, enjoyed my breakfast, and left within 20 minutes.  
  
I waited in the longer line and want to enjoy my breakfast alone. I didn't want to be sitting at a table stuck listening to their conversation or socialize out of politeness. AITA for refusing to share my table?",45,32,0.9

470,Everyone Sucks,"My husband gave me his cheap $2 drugstore headphones after he bought 2 new pairs of Apple headphones for himself. I misplaced them after a while but didn't really care since I dont use headphones often. He asked a few times where they were, and I was honest, saying I don't know but I know they're in the bedroom. He brushed it off each time, saying they're mine now and if they're broken not to ask for another pair. I didn't even ask for this pair but whatever. 

Yesterday, I cleaned out our son's bassinet to put into storage. Since he's too big for it, it was full of eventual hand-me-downs for our next child. Low and behold, beneath the tiny baby clothes, the headphones.
Plugged them into my phone and ran a bath. As I'm sitting across the room waiting for the tub to fill, I realize the headphones no longer work so I threw them in the bathroom trashcan. 

This morning, my husband goes to the bathroom and returns with the broken headphones.
""You're gonna break them if you keep leaving them wherever."" 
I respond that they're already broken, I found them in LO's bassinet and they don't work anymore.
""If you kept better track of them then they'd work.""
 I just said I found them that way. 
""They won't just break out of nowhere.""
 No but they're cheap, cheap headphones do that. ""Stop making up excuses for why you broke them."" I slowly explain it to him like he's 5. 
""See how I haven't said anything? That's because I dropped it. Shut up already."" 
You haven't said anything because I'm still talking. See how I'm done now? It's amazing how quickly I can shut up when you don't interrupt. (He always complains that I bitch too much, but he never let's me actually speak.) 
He then calls me a hypocrite and turns the argument to a different subject while I keep saying ""this is about headphones, not an argument we had last week.""
He ends by calling me an asshole and storming out of the room.

471,Not the A-hole,"Sorry for formatting, in mobile. Throw away. I keep on having these guilty feelings I need to ask some people about.


So I had been dating this girl for almost 2 years, we were both 20, young and in love, living in a small one bedroom apartment. We both went on to be diagnosed with depression after the incident and some other earth shattering events. But to the story at hand.


We were in one of those big relationship defining fights. Those fights that last for awhile and emotions come out so raw that our immature minds couldn’t properly comprehend all of it. The crux of it was simple. She was contemplating opening up our relationship so she could “sow her wild oats” in college. I’m as new age as they come but I had a problem with it and wanted to stay a monogamous couple. 


The fight progressed and in the end she wanted to take it all back. I couldn’t accept that, I needed to cool off, it felt like my entire world was spinning so I went into the other room to breathe. (It’s a one room apartment so I couldn’t go anywhere). While in the living room I heard the door to the bathroom slam. I heard her yelling about how she doesn’t want to live. I ran to the bathroom door scared.


I heard her frantically searching and slamming through the drawers. I heard a loud crack and a cry. Then it repeated, and repeated.


Throughout this time I was saying her name asking her to open the door and to stop. The bang and whimpers continued until I backed up and ran into the bathroom door. The door frame was weak and buckled allowing me in (we had a really cheap apartment, think projects level). When the door swing open I saw her hit her head on the wall again.


I immediately grabbed her, wrapped her in a weird bear hug type deal and brought her to the bed in the other room. There she laid next to me and cried for awhile. My head was still spinning but I knew I had to do something. I remembered that 9/11 in our area allowed texting. While she was laying down sobbing I quickly texted 9/11 our location, the situation and to please hurry.


My rational at the time was that she just seriously attempted to hurt herself. As selfish as it sounds I was nowhere near capable of handling the situation alone.


The police came, they talked to us apart. Took us in squad cars to a local hospital where she was admitted to a psych ward after a review. 


After talking to my friends on the matter I was told that I may have handled this wrong. I was informed of the terrible realities of inpatient care. As well as the stress it puts on a person going through a bad times. I feel like shit for hurting her.




TL:DR:
Girlfriend and I had a big fight over the state of our relationship. She locked herself in the bathroom and hurt herself. I broke in the bathroom and stopped her. Contacted the police and she ended up in inpatient care.

472,Asshole,"Okay, so my wife and I are expecting our first child. She is 7 months along and we got an ultrasound yesterday to check on the progress (my wife’s medical issues caused the OBGYN to be extra cautious). 

During the appointment, the tech was pointing out our daughter’s different body parts, telling us where the legs and feet are. It was the first time we didn’t really need the help, because we could see our baby looking like a real baby. My wife started crying, and I was comforting her, when she said the words. “I can’t believe I’m making a human being.”

I kept comforting her, but I waited a few minutes and, once the tech was gone, gently reminded her that we are both the parents, not just her. I also told her that saying she’s “making” the baby on her own is not accurate, since I provided half the genetic material. 

My wife was still emotional at this point, and she started crying again thinking I don’t appreciate what she’s putting her body through to be pregnant. Obviously this is false, especially since her pregnancy has been so tough that I’ve attended at least two doctors appointments every month. I show her with actions, not words, that I appreciate her. 

I just don’t think it’s fair to claim I haven’t contributed something to making our daughter. She is still upset the next day. So, AITA?

473,Not the A-hole,"I DM for a group of 5 people: Will, Lorraine, Ben, Issac and Holly. I met the latter three at uni, while Will and Lorraine (a couple) are friends of a friend. I'm not am experienced DM but I really like this group as there's always a fun atmosphere around the table. As an additional advantage, the group doesn't have anyone that's a creep which is a real luxury. A while ago we were watching a bunch of YouTubers playing some D&D who were dressed up as their characters. I can't remember who suggested it but somehow the idea that we should do the same got floated around and as it sounded like fun, so everyone agreed. Next session everyone had their costumes ready and everyone looked great considering that we didn't have much time/budget. The session went really well. All of the group seemed to be acting in character way more than usual and as we wrapped up I chalked it down as a really great night and got a lot of great feedback from people there.

A few days later though, Holly messaged me privately outside of the group chat, saying how the costumes Lorraine and Will were wearing had made her feel uncomfortable and that she didn't think they were appropriate, that they were unnecessarily showing off and made the rest of us look inadequate, even if it was unintentional. She also asked me to ask them to wear more next session. Now, I wouldn't say anyone at the table was unattractive or overweight, but Will and Lorraine are both highly physically active people and have the bodies to match, and their costumes didn't cover a lot.

Will's character is a monk, and his costume was basically Dhalsim off Street Fighter: shirtless and with warpaint covering his chest and face. Lorraine meanwhile plays a sorcerer and was wearing a woven bikini top, harem pants and African style body paint (apparently you can't get elf ears for black people). As a DM/DND player in general, I like to think I have a really low tolerance for creeps and the usual shittyness that can come with a hobby mostly populated by nerdy guys and take every complaint I get about someone's behaviour seriously, but I'm not sure I can with this. Like if they'd showed up wearing, say bondage gear I might've had a word but they made sense for them as characters, they weren't showing any more skin than you'd see at the beach, and the outfits themselves wouldn't be out of place at a music festival and the designs were inventive.

Everyone else sent messages saying how much they enjoyed the last session and the effort people went to for their outfits so it just seems like a shame to stop doing it because one of us is made uncomfortable by a bit of skin (as far as I know, Holly hasn't mentioned it to Will or Lorraine). So yeah, am I an arsehole for not taking this seriously? Like I get having body issues, but I'm not sure being intimidated by physically fit people and being uncomfortable around them is a good way to go in life and the session we had in-costume was one of the best we've ever had.

474,Asshole,"I am 35, my wife is 32. We have been married for 11 years and have 2 daughters, 10 and 6. She is currently 4 months pregnant with twins.

I am an engineer for a hydro company and work 8-4 each day, 40 hours a week and sometimes overtime. My wife works full time as a nurse consultant for a pharmaceutical company.

But otherwise she takes care of the house, the kids, and also does the cooking. I tell her she’s doing a LOT of work for someone who is pregnant with twins, and suggested that she take maternity leave early (she originally planned to leave around 7 months). I also suggested that she should think about staying home with the kids and maybe working from home after the birth of our twins. 

She felt insulted by my suggestion and said she wouldn’t feel right, not working and just staying at home. I told her I earned enough for both of us and she should just take it easy. She was originally planning on having her mother come and take care of the kids and babies while she went back to work after a month or so. She told me that her mom is planning on staying “indefinitely” and “thats how its done in my family”. I know that after her mother gave birth to her sister, her grandparents literally moved in with them for 10 years, helping to raise the both of them while her parents worked.

I’m not okay with this idea because although I like my MIL (57), I wouldnt feel comfortable having her live with us, especially for an indefinite length of time. I also don’t like the idea of my wife continuing to work while pregnant. I don’t want her to go back to work as soon as she gives birth. I just want her to be there for the kids.

I don’t want an outsider interrupting our daily lives. She helped us out for a few months after the birth of our youngest, and there was some tension after a while. But my MIL wants my wife to go back to work ASAP after having kids. I really don’t understand the rush and just want my wife to be taking care of our children. 

I told my wife this and she said I’m being rude and unreasonable for not wanting her mom to live with us. And that with 4 kids, she needs extra help. I volunteered to take paternity leave for a month or so and she said thats a “dumb idea”.

475,Not the A-hole,"I live in Colorado, a legal state. I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.

My sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.

About an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said ""I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.""

She had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.

I panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*

Even my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.

I feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine.

For context here is some back ground:

Will be married a year in June right before our daughter is due. I am filing for divorce this month even though in my state it will not be finalized until after she is here; I moved home from his military duty station (3000+ miles away) to my family, to escape a mentally and emotionally abusive marriage. There has been sexual harassment from him that has fueled most of the destruction of our relationship. Combined with (my speculation of) him having BPD and refusal to get treatment, abuse of alcohol, physical violence like punching holes in walls when he was politely turned down from sex & the fact we could not agree on counseling or therapy until I had already decided it was best for me to remove myself from the situation. 

He makes me cringe. I have had nightmares of him sexual assaulting/raping me. The thought of even seeing him at her birth fills me with dread and anxiety. He acts like it’s no big deal. He is very entitled and narcissistic. 

I am considering not letting him be in the actual room while I am laboring/giving birth. At first I figured I would just do it all by myself and have only doctors/nurses in the room. But since I have decided I would probably only like my mother and my step mother in the room. As I feel they would be the most respectful, helpful and calming people to be there with me on that special day. I fear if I let stbxh in the room, he will make things uncomfortable and it will make me very anxious and ruin the special day. I feel sometimes I am being selfish, but then again giving birth is a lot of trauma and I feel like I deserve to be comfortable. Help!",55,110,0.93

As I’ve gotten older, I kind of wouldn’t care if older kids were there but absolutely no little children.

During her pregnancy she decided that she wanted to leave her job and be a stay a home mom.  It definitely made finances tighter, but we managed.  

Our daughter is two now.  Lately my wife has been talking about wanting to return to school.  She wants to take business administration.   When I asked specifically what she wanted to do with the degree she had no set idea and just said that it would open a lot more doors for her if she returns to work.  

I’ve tried involving her in our finances.  She really just seems purposely blind to how tight things are on one income alone.  There have been multiple times that she’s bought things that we can’t really afford.  I just don’t see how we could make her going back to school work.  Tuition and books aren’t cheap on top of the day care we would have to get for our daughter.  

There’s another reason why I’m unsupportive of her going back to school.   Early on in our marriage she went to college for Vet tech and was adamant that this was the path for her.  Two months in and she decided that it wasn’t for her after all and just quit.  It was a state school, but still quite an expensive investment not to get any return on.  I’d be more conflicted if she had an actual plan with what she wanted to do with a business degree, but just opening doors doesn’t seem like a good enough reason to me.  Open doors don’t guarantee anything, it’s rough out there employment wise.

Context: I'm 19 Uni student

GF 21 senior at my Uni

We aren't living together.

&#x200B;

My GF and I have been dating for about 4 months now and we're both quite serious hoping this relation ends in marriage. We had been having unprotected sex for a while, until about two weeks ago when my GF asked me to start using protection since some of her friends were getting pregnant and got her shook.

She had gotten pregnant once in high school (where the guy's parents paid for the abortion) and so I understood that she did not want to go through that shit again so I agreed. We went to the drug store together and she suggested we got the really thin one so it'll still be good. (They are suuuper expensive for a uni kid living alone in a foreign country, like $10 for a box of 5). Anyway. We got back and started getting at it. It was my first time in a while using a condom and so I may not have been the best at putting it on but after some fumbling about I managed to put it on and we went at it.

Skipping the fine details of the sex, the condom was broken when I pulled out I had already finished believing the condom was an almighty balloon. I freaked out A LOT and it got super awkward really fast. It was about 2 days after her period so the chance of getting pregnant wasn't astronomically high, however the possibility was still very much there.

We talked about what we should do and I strongly suggested that she got the day after pill as even if the chance was not that high it's much better than having to go through an abortion. A day after the sex she told me that she wasn't in a great mood because she was tired from going to the Gynecologist which I simply had assumed the visit was for the day after pill (we live in Japan and you need to have it prescribed).

She messaged me today saying that she isn't feeling well since 3 days ago which match up to her ovulation and we're freaking the fuck out that she maybe pregnant.  Turns out she hadn't taken the pill.  Going to the main point of this if she is pregnant, I'm not massively keen on paying for the abortion, like I've mentioned before I'm a broke Uni student and my GF is living with her parents and is decently well-off. I will be fine paying a portion of the costs of course, but I feel like she should have taken the pill and it's not exactly my fault for the condom breaking. Maybe I'm just freaking out early and it isn't actually a pregnancy.

idk...

am I the asshole??

\[Edit\]

Thank you for getting my shit straight, 

Info:  
\-the unprotected sex was way before her period and so the possible pregnancy is from the broken condom

\-I may not have been smooth at putting it on but it was properly on

\-When I said I wasn't keen, I meant to pay full price.  I understand that paying half is more than reasonable. Although I wished she had taken the pill causing it to be cheaper.

492,Not the A-hole,"So I was at a bar with some friends. We were enjoying ourselves, but not overly so and none of us were more than a little buzzed. We were sitting at a table and my friend across from me had her jacket hanging on the back of her chair. 

I see this guy come up, kind of stumbling and looking pretty drunk, and he grabs my friends jacket and starts looking through the pockets. Immediately in my head I am thinking he's trying to get her wallet or phone or something, so I stand up and yell ""Excuse me, what the hell do you think you're doing?!?"" He immediately backs off and claims he was just looking for his jacket and thought it was his. 

1. It's on my friends chair
2. She is a very petite female and her jacket was tight fitting, no way this guy would've fit into it
3. ASK us if you can look at the jacket

I explain these 3 (to me logical points) to him and he absolutely freaks out telling me I am overreacting and to chill the fuck out. He eventually goes away. He later found his jacket (different color and material from my friends) but decides to come wave it in my face and call me a bitch. 

I felt I did the right thing trying to defend my friends property. The part that kills me is that my friends agreed with him. None of them were really concerned and said he was just innocently looking for his jacket and that I needed to chill. 

Maybe he really was just looking, but I've heard way too many stories of being being robbed, assaulted, etc and being too polite to stop it when they had the chance.

493,Not the A-hole,"Pretty long, so TDLR at the end.

I wasn't even planning on having a maid of honour to begin with. I asked my three closest friends to be bridesmaids, and I didn't want to choose a ""favourite."" I was thinking it would be fun to plan my hen do (bachelorette party for those in the US) together as a group. But one of the girls, my best friend from high school, said she wanted the job, so I thought ""why not?"" I was actually kind of touched that she cared enough to volunteer.

Anyway, almost immediately after offering she got a new job and a new boyfriend. She pretty much stopped responding to my messages (not even wedding-related stuff, just normal conversation), and when she did reply her responses were short and blunt. When I did mention anything wedding-related, she was snappy and even occasionally hurtful. I thought maybe she had a lot on her plate (she works in a stressful industry and this is her first real job in it) but it's been months now and things haven't got any better. 

I asked her if she was upset with me and if she still wanted to be MoH, and she seemed really offended, and just said ""why would you ask me that?"" She then showed interest for about a day before going back to being weird again. 

I asked her to save an hour or two for me this weekend where we could get some planning done (I thought if we did it together it might take some of the pressure off). She said fine. Time we set to meet rolls around and I hear nothing from her. I message asking where she is, get no reply, and after an hour of waiting give up. The next day I get a message saying ""sorry I was at my boyfriends.""

I know this all sounds petty, but the wedding is getting closer and no planning for my hen party has been done. The only thing that is sorted is the date, which I did myself. It hurts even more because our best man is making a huge effort for my fiance, where as my MoH can't even been bothered to respond to my messages. The thing is, if the situation was reversed I'd be making a huge effort for her because I care. My fiance saw how upset this is making me and asked one of the other two girls to help, but she's not really a ""planner"" and hates making decisions, so again everything has stalled. My other bridesmaid is travelling the world and won't be back until a week before the wedding. 

I feel really lonely and friendless, but I'm also not sure if I'm being a bridezilla and expecting too much. Am I the asshole?

TDLR: BFF asked to be Maid of Honour and offered to plan the hen do/bachelorette party, then ditches me with no explanation. Not sure if I have a right to be hurt or if I'm being entitled/a bridezilla. 

Update: Thanks for the advice everyone. At least I know I'm not a bridezilla! This whole thing has made me realise that our friendship has been going down hill for the last year and I just didn't want to admit it. I had a tough time at the end of last year after being made redundant from my job, and I realised she was acting like this then as well - ignoring my messages when I needed to talk or acting like I hadn't mentioned it and avoiding the topic, and to be honest I'm exhausted. If this was someone I was dating was this hot and cold I'd have told them to fuck off by now. It sucks because we've been friends for 15 years, but thanks to this thread I've realised it's best to just leave her alone in general and organise the party myself (even though that makes me feel like a bit of a loser).

Payday comes and goes, no sign of the money. I sent him a message about it. He said “oh yeah, sorry I forgot, I’ll do that now” 

Two weeks pass and still nothing. I message him again. He said he’d send me the money. Still nothing. He was then avoiding me so I wasn’t able to see him face to face. 

I messaged him again and he didn’t reply.

7 months have passed since the day he promised to have the money back to me by. I’ve not been able to get hold of him, nor have I seen him. 

This weekend just gone, I was out at a restaurant and I happened to see him as I was being seated at my table. He was on what looked like a date. 

Now at this point I could see he was acting kinda boasy because he had ordered about 5 starters. It’s worth noting that this is a pretty pricey restaurant. So I decided I’d go and say hello. 

I pulled up a chair at his table and started chatting to him about how he is and how I am etc. 

I then proceeded to pick up a fork and try a bit of the food. He looked a bit shocked, but it was good food so I tried something from one of the other plates. At this point his date (I’d learnt that this was their second date) said to me, “excuse me, but this is our food. What do you think you’re doing?” 

I looked at her and said “Well since I’m pretty much funding this meal, I figured I may as well sample what my money is getting.” 

I then said to my friend, “it was nice to see you, I’ll leave you to it. We can catch up another day.”

I then left to go back to my table. The people I were with, a party of 10, had very mixed reactions to my behaviour. Some were in favour of what I’d done, others not so much. 

So I’m asking you lot, AITA?

They basically let me focus only about school so I finished it in 3 years. I found a job after that and started working right away. Pretty quickly after I was more independen, I started to not be attracted to the person I was dating. I broke up with them after three months of feeling like this. They basically told me that the only reason I dated them was for their money. On some level I think it might be true, but am I an asshole for that?

Never cheated or anything like that
They took it pretty hard
I didn't really try to work on it, just broke up and I felt pretty happy

504,Not the A-hole,"Me (23f) and a few of my friends went to a bar for my birthday this weekend. I don’t go to bars often and this is the first one I’ve been to since my 21st birthday. 

Anyway an hour into the night I went to the bathroom and was surprised to see a bathroom attendant there. Again, I don’t really go to bars or clubs so I don’t know if this is a typical thing to see. She had a bunch of stuff on the bathroom counter like perfume, spray deodorant, wipes etc. She also had a tip jar. I instantly felt bad because I didn’t have any cash on me. So I waited in line and only used the soap and paper towels that the bar already provided, said thank you to her and walked out. I did use the bathroom two more times that night.

On the third time I was about to leave and she started yelling (like actually yelling) at me saying how ungrateful and privileged I was for not tipping her. I told her that I’m sorry but I didn’t have any cash. She kept yelling and told me to find another bathroom and not to come back. 

I understand that she probably gets paid below minimum wage and relies on tips, but I thought her reaction was a bit uncalled for. What would you guys have done in that situation? What do you guys think: AITA? 

Edit: Thank you for the responses! Part of the reason I wrote this was because I felt a little guilty for not tipping because I know she cleans up horrible messes other people make.

 I only mentioned it once to my brother like, ""hey 'the girl' stepped on my laptop after I told them no running around in the room, you mind giving me half so I can get a new laptop"" and him and his wife immediately thought I was the biggest douche for asking!!

Before we actually hook up tho, she wanted to hangout with me to make sure I wasn't a catfish or something. Not something I've ever been accused of but fine by me. We arrange for me to pick her after work and watch a movie.

I go to pick her up at 7:30 PM (the time she told she got out of work) and wait until 8:00 for her to actually leave. We get late to the movie but the commericals before the movie were still playing so we're good. We leave at 9:30 because of her strict parents and her curfew. We talk about how her parents are super strict and mine are super religious and would kill us if they found out we're doing this and laugh about it. I dropped her off at home and said told her goodnight.

The next day I text her if she was still interested in hooking up and when she was free. She asked me if that was the only thing I thought about. I told her that it was since we agreed to have no strings attached. She called me an asshole and said I'm just like every other guy. AITA for only wanting sex with her even though we both agreed to only have sex?

508,Not the A-hole,"During university my roommates (also friends) were very bad at turning off lights in common areas. I had discussed it with them at length before but their logic was they weren't paying for utilities so who cares. Fair enough. 

The issue was that this meant sometimes when the bathroom light was on it didn't mean anyone was using it. We also tended to kept the bathroom door closed/open regardless of if it was not in use. Essentially what I'm getting at is that sometimes the bathroom door would be closed with the light on and no one in it. So I would often just try to door to see if it was in use. 

One day my friend has his girlfriend stay the night. That night I go to use the bathroom to brush my teeth and open the door and she standing their naked so I quickly close the door apologizing and head back to my room a bit embarrassed.  I tell my friend about what happened and he just said don't worry about it so I just forgot about it. 

The next day around noon (when I generally wake up) the same thing happens when I'm going to use the bathroom to brush my teeth again. This time my friend is in the living room so I look at him and just with a look of defeat say ""does she not know how to use the lock?""

He said that it was my fault for not checking if the light was on before trying the door and that I should be the one being more considerate

This kind of caused a fight between us cause it had happened multiple times. But neither was willing to take the blame.

509,Not the A-hole,"Okay long story but I’ll keep it short. 

Back when Toys R Us went bankrupt my husband and I went to go look and see what stuff was on sale. We bought a few things but more specifically bought a pretty expensive stroller that was like 75% off even though we had no kids at the moment. We had been talking and making plans to hopefully get pregnant in the next year or two and we both conceded that buying the stroller was a good option. 

Fast forward a few months and I found out I was pregnant. I was super excited and happy but he immediately acted a little off. We talked and he said he wasn’t excited about the timing but happy to have a baby. We told our friends and family and shortly after I had a miscarriage. 

It’s been approximately 7 months since the miscarriage. We still have the stroller and it’s sitting in the closet. Yesterday would have been my due date. We were at a party and some guy who knocked up his gf, who we know but aren’t friends with, was at the party. All of a sudden my husband yells across the room in front of 15-20 people “HEY CAN WE GIVE THEM THE STROLLER? WE HAVE NO USE FOR IT SO WE MIGHT AS WELL” I didn’t want to be seen as a major bitch so I simply said yes. 

Well today we got into a huge fight about it. Not only did he put me in the spot by not consulting with me but I feel like he’s completely disregarding everything we had talked about previously. It’s like he’s completely oblivious to the fact that one, I kept the stroller because I’m hoping to put a baby in it soon, and two he doesn’t care about how I feel during this time. 

I blew up and told him I felt like he didn’t care, he stayed silent the whole car ride, walked inside the door and immediately headed for his PC and didn’t event apologize. Am I being an asshole and over reacting here or is he being a fucking douche? ",26,39,0.94
510,Not the A-hole,"A bit of backstory; me and my GF have been together for 3 years and a year ago we found out she was pregnant. I'll admit at the beginning I was not supportive, its my biggest regret. I did a 180 when she was about 4 months along and since he was born he is the best thing in my world. My GF and her sister have always been close, they tell each other everything. Her sister has always been a bit off, thinks she's never in the wrong EVER and the entire world is against her. 

About a month ago, when my son was 4 weeks old, she was angry that her Mom was not giving her enough attention (she bought herself a puppy a few weeks before my son came along. The puppy is a nightmare, and she doesn't discipline it or even take care of it). Since she was not getting attention from her mom she got her puppy and started saying ""Look at the baby. Who's a good baby?"" To the dog and brought him over to my son. The puppy is feisty and squirmed almost scratching my son in his grandmothers arms. I got mad and took my son into my GF's room (we've been staying with her mom since they live far away). When I walked out of the room she called my son a dumb baby and said he was ugly. She came into the room later and told me to give her the baby, I told her no. My GF agreed I did the right thing, but her sister decided I hate her and is taking it out on her mom. She screams at her mom constantly about nothing and told her mom that no one can drive her mom's car (we have been borrowing it while we are here to get around) not even her mom can drive it only her and she will drop her mom at work and keep the keys during the day. 

After a month of her screaming and saying everyone is ruining her life she decided that her dog is more important than her nephew. Her brother was playing with her dog, which she didnt like, he was rubbing its belly while she screamed ""STOP RAPPING MY DOG!!! IM CALLING THE POLICE IF YOU DON'T STOP NOW!!! WHY DONT YOU GO AND TOUCH (GF'S NAME)'S SON'S DICK INSTEAD!!!"". My GF had to stop me from confronting her because I was livid. I decided then that she would not see my son until she got right. 

Last night we were at our friends house, we are a few days from flying back home. She texts my GF angry because her brother told her I dont like her. She started saying some really fucked up things to my GF about her, my son, and me. My GF told me what she was saying and showed me the texts. She told my GF that I dont love my son because when we first found out I wanted to abort. I regret thinking it everyday, he is the best thing and I dont know what I would do without him anymore. I snapped and called her some really bad things to my GF and almost cried because it hurt that bad. I have now refused to let her come visit us and told my GF she should stop talking to her.

511,Asshole,"Long time lurker, first time poster. 
My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost two years and at some point in our relationship I managed to mislead him into thinking that my middle name is Aimee. 
It’s not, it’s May. I have definitely told him that my middle name is May at some point early on in our relationship and I understand that it’s not that significant so why would he remember? 
Anyway, I’ve technically lied about my middle name in three different incidents and the truth came out on accident a few minutes ago and he told me that it’s “so weird” and calling me a liar and ignoring me. 
My plan was to drag this out for as long as possible (we’re pretty committed, wanting to get married, etc.) and one day he would find out and it would be awkward for him or something at the worst.  It was a long term plan for a practical joke I guess. 
I think my only crime here is that it was a bad joke. AMITA ???

Tl;dr: i lied about my middle name. The truth has come out and my boyfriend is now offended. 

Edit: So Aimee is my grandfather’s first name so like it could make sense if that was my middle name i guess. I never went by my May or Aimee so there were rarely any occasions where it would come up at all.  He was just trying to guess/remember my middle name one day and I told him he was right when he wasn’t. ",40,47,0.91

513,Not the A-hole,"Molly (21) and I (23) have never really gotten along, even as kids. As an adult, she's just kinda an entitled brat. Molly gets upset when the tiniest of things aren't exactly how she likes it. Like, she pitched such a fit about the tiniest of hard water spots on glasses at one point that my parents just switched to using plastic cups to avoid her rejecting 10 glasses before finding one she deemed acceptable. She is the type of person who has literally told me she is better than me because she doesn't curse. Not implied, no. She explicitly told me that she is a better person because I say ""fuck"". She has also said things like I don't deserve my (now-)husband, I don't deserve to be happy, etc. My husband and I also have established that when we have children, she will not be allowed alone with them due to her tendency to hit first and ask questions later with brother's kids. She has a wild temper and will fly off the handle rather easily. Generally, she is the type of person who, if she were a friend rather than my sister, I would have cut from my life completely.

Leah (18) and I get along really well. I love to spend time with her, talk to her, etc. Our relationship is good and we have a lot of the same problems with Molly, only I don't bother hiding it from our parents at all anymore.

Now our mother has gotten involved, saying it hurts Molly's feelings how I treat my sisters unequally. Examples of things our mother has a problem with:

1) Leah was a bridesmaid in my wedding. Because of her comments about my relationship with my husband, I absolutely refused to have Molly in my bridal party.

2) I promised Leah a few years ago that I'd buy her a tattoo for her 18th birthday. I was planning to get her a little $100-200 tattoo. Then just before her birthday, our Grandfather died. Leah and Grandfather were very close. Tattoo got put off for a bit, then I decided to call it both her birthday and Christmas, so she could get a more expensive memorial tattoo. So my husband and I paid $500 to get Leah this tattoo. Normally we wouldn't have gone with such an expensive gift, but I thought it would be a good way for her to cope, and it has been. (For reference, Christmas gift for Molly was worth about $50, which is the high end of what we do for gifts usually.)

3) We received a $100 gift card to Total Wine as a wedding gift. I brought it up to sister joking about how I didn't know what to do with it because my husband and I don't really drink. Her suggestion was ""Give it to me."" Apparently, when I laughed and said no because she was underage at the time and ""Nobody needs that much alcohol."" This got twisted into Molly apparently thinking I said she isn't worth that much.

Other than that, I just don't talk to Molly much. I avoid her because it often just starts an argument to talk to her. But I avoid most of my family because growing up with my parents wasn't easy and they are a real drain on my mental health.

I looked up their facebooks and they're both young and attractive.

I told my boyfriend I didn't like the idea of two girls just hanging out at the house with him, but he assured me they'd only really be there to sleep. Still, I told him outright I really wouldn't like them coming over, and he said he'd talk to his mom, who eventually replied that it was her house so if she wanted a family friend over, she can.

Don't get me wrong, he's nice. Doesn't insult me, occasionally pays for dinner (he's a student), says he loves me, etc. But he doesn't always take no for an answer. For example, on Friday he was over at my place. We were spooning in my bed watching tv and he tried to put his hand up my shirt to rest on my stomach. I said no and pushed his hand. He fought me back and clearly didn't care that I didn't want his hand there. Once it was settled on my stomach where I didn't want it he asked why, and I said ""I don't like when your hand is under my shirt like that."" Instead of pulling back and saying ""oh sorry"" he left it there and was like ""I think it feels nice"". He also puts my hand under his shirt the same way. I don't like that either.

Anyway, lately I've been dreaming of paying off all my debt, saving a bunch of money, and moving to Toronto (big city in Canada; basically our version of NYC). I also want to get hot AF, dye my hair, get a tattoo, and get my belly button pierced.

But, I want to do it alone.

I want to do it alone because I'm polyamorous so I would like to hold out for a relationship that better suits my needs once I move. I also would like to change the name I go by, and my boyfriend has already said that he would not call me by any name other than my first name, even if it was still a legal name (ie my middle name).

Please don't tell me that I can reinvent myself with him around, or that I don't need to move, or whatever. I'm aware that I don't *need* to be single and I don't *need* to move, but I also feel as though due to familial abuse and my boyfriend's lifestyle (very sedentary with lots of junk food, and 100% happy working a mediocre job with crappy hours, driving a shitty vehicle that only has insurance because of bandaid fixes that have now worn off, with toxic friends who don't have anything in common with him and who can't treat his girlfriend with respect), I wouldn't really accomplish the level of ""reinventment"", if you will, if I don't.

&#x200B;

My friend made a bad joke about cocaine, and a french guy overheard and decided that he was going to use this opportunity to slide into our group of three girls, placing a hand on my friend's shoulder and pushing into our closed circle. The first words out of his mouth were ""Oh, cocaine? I'm new to Japan, I just moved here, perhaps you could show me where to get some good stuff."" Cocaine is EXTREMELY illegal in Japan. If you got caught with it, you'd be deported for life (after a stint of imprisonment). Going up to a group of girls you don't know and asking them where to find cocaine is stupid.

&#x200B;

We told him we were from Hokkaido and going home early tomorrow (a lie but whatever), so we had no idea where to get drugs in Tokyo since we're just as new as him, and walked away. He followed us to our table. He sort of sneered and went ""Hokkaido? What's that? Where is that anyway?"" My friends just turned away and decided to ignore him, but I was irritated. I can't stand people who MOVE to a new country and know nothing about it. So I spent the next ten minutes lecturing him. Japan is a small country. I asked him why he would move ANYWHERE without knowing shit about the most basic geography. You don't have to know every prefecture, but Hokkaido is a huge and popular island that anyone living in Japan should know of. I also told him that if the only way he could think to hit on girls was to insert himself uninvited into their conversation, follow them when they walk away, and ask them to walk him through the process of obtaining drugs, he has no game. He asked me ""what should I do then? How should I talk to women?"" I told him he could try growing a personality instead of using ""I'm new here"" to make people empathize with him.

&#x200B;

He was pissed. He asked me ""How many countries have you even traveled to? Did you study their geography before going there?"" I told him that YES, I do have the ability to do a basic google search and learn a bit about the place I'm going to. But this is a different level. He's not there for a week on vacation, he's MOVING there, and should definitely know more. He called me a bitch, told me I was unwelcoming, and said I probably hate other foreigners.

&#x200B;

With about 30 minutes left in the flight I took my daughter to the bathroom one last time. I told her it was the last chance to go before we landed because we would need to sit with our belts on. So, we went, she did her business, and we went back to our seats.

&#x200B;

Everything was good until we were about to land and my daughter started saying she had to use the washroom again. I said she would need to wait until we landed because it was unsafe. Once we got on the ground we had to sit and wait for our gate. At this point our daughter started getting antsy saying she has to go ""so bad"". I decided that once the flight got to the gate I would take her and my husband could meet us at baggage. I was hoping people would understand.

&#x200B;

Well, airports right... we continue to be delayed for another 10 or so minutes and the FA comes on to tell us that a few people had connections and asked people to remain in their seats until those people disembarked and then everyone else could go. At this point my kid is squirming uncontrollably, so I decided I would get up with the connection people and run her to the bathroom. We get to the gate and I get up (along with everyone else lol..). I kindly ask people if I can run past. People get out of the way and I ran off with her. Husband stayed on for our carry ons and with everyone else.

We made it to the bathroom and daughter went. Was definitely not a false alarm. We went down to the baggage and got there as others from our flight were starting to come. We were one of the first. Husband was still not there so our row likely had not disembarked yet.

I honestly didn't know what to say, I was actually kind of shocked someone would act that way. She walked away and stood on the other side of the baggage claim throwing daggers at me.

521,Not the A-hole,"Basically my parents, her parents, and nearly all my friends are calling me the asshole for breaking up with my pregnant girlfriend (it's my kid) so Just looking for perspective here. I'll keep things as objective as possible and happily accept my final judgement.

&#x200B;

3 months ago we found out that my gf (or ex now) is pregnant. It was a big surprise since we take precautions (condoms, BC) but she said it might've been a broken condom + she was bad about staying on BC routinely. Regardless, it was confirmed she's pregnant. I'm 21 and she's 20.

&#x200B;

I took the news badly at first. I became surly, didn't talk, and just kept to myself for 2 whole days right after she told me. I was terrified and did NOT want to be a father at all. I just needed time to adjust to the news. I think she expected happiness from both of us as she imagined I'd scoop her up and kiss her and cry tears of happiness after hearing she's pregnant (I know this bc she even referenced that scene in The Office where pam/jim find out they're having a baby).

&#x200B;

Our relationship during this time was extremely rocky because she wanted us to be engaged before the baby came, and I dragged my feet. I took her to all of her appointments, paid for as much as I could afford, and was there 24/7 for anything she needed. I guess it was more emotional connection that I just couldn't force through and she could tell.

&#x200B;

A few weeks ago she sits me down and tells me she lost the baby. She says she had stomach cramps and then she miscarried. I was asking her a lot of health questions (I didn't know if a miscarriage this late into a pregnancy was normal?) and she kinda waves me off and is like don't worry I'm ok. After this our relationship's getting slightly better only because I'm slightly more relaxed now. She could tell and asks me to be honest about how I feel about the miscarriage. I tell her I'm sad it's happened so suddenly and mostly still worried for her but deep down I am really relieved because I 100% wasn't ready to be a father.

&#x200B;

WRONG answer. She starts screaming, crying, throwing things at me. She says she's not miscarried, that it was a test to see my dedication and I've failed it completely. In short we fought for like 3 whole days after this, with little sleep bc she'd randomly throw cups of icy water on me if I dozed off. At the end of that I said I can't do this anymore and broke up with her. I told her I'll be there for the baby and I'll pay my share of whatever is needed but I can't be her boyfriend and I can't marry her.

Now friends and family are all telling ME that I overreacted, that its just pregnancy hormones and could I blame her?

So basically I finished washing dishes and was ready to go I said I was gone to my morning manager as I’m clocking out the night manager who makes the schedule ask where I’m going. Basically I say home and that I’m done he says you know we need you until 5 and there’s gonna be more dishes so stay until someone comes for night shift. I say I gotta go and leave so AITA?,16,57,0.96

525,No A-holes here,"Sorry for the akward title, wasn't sure how to phrase this succinctly 

Also spoilers: compared to a lot of posts here this is probably pretty tame, but it's been bugging me so I thought I would ask.

Oh my days off from school and/or when I work closing shifts I swing by the local Coffee Bean to grab coffee and breakfast. One of the girls who works there mentioned she seems me around her apartment building all the time. We realized we both live in the same apartment building called ""[Street Name] Court""

I was still half asleep from working the closing shift last night so I just absentmindedly said something like ""Oh wow, I'm in unit 201, which one are you"", didn't really think much of it. 

Immediately her tone/body language changed and she said ""I'm not telling you that dude"" and then I overheard her commenting to her coworker about how oblivious I am for asking.

Am I the asshole here? Like, we established we both live in the same building, I was just trying to continue the conversation before I got my coffee rather than stand there in awkward silence. 

It's 100% her business if she doesn't want to tell me where she lives, but she was the one who brought up that we live in the same building. 

I don't know, it's minor but it's had me second guessing myself all morning. Maybe I just need more sleep and coffee. 

E: forgot to mention that this isn't some coffee shop I recently started going to. I've been going there for years, long enough for said employee to memorize my name and usual order

Also worth noting; our apartment building is only like 30 units. It's really small and saying you live there is already giving out somewhat specific info about where you live ",127,154,0.95

529,Not the A-hole,"I tried to write this out yesterday but I guess I was too wordy lol. 

Alright long story short:

Due to some issues last year me and SO were given the opportunity to crash at a friends to avoid being homeless. 

We did not pay rent as it wasn’t asked of us but we cleaned the whole house regularly, did their chores, and provided food for ourselves and for them. We made ourselves be scarce and unless invited to hang out with them we stayed in our designated area and avoided using any of their utilities. We even stayed locked in our room for hours to make things easier on them to avoid any conflict with their extended family. 

When we ended up leaving we were in a better spot financially as SO came into some money and we offered essentially back rent and then some. We offered what their roommate was paying at the time. We offered countless times in different ways and each time they declined it. 

Due to them declining we rebudgeted and allocated those funds to something else. Fast forward to us leaving suddenly they started demanding money like we never offered them any. We told them why we rebudgeted and we would still pay them back if they wanted however it would be in chunks rather than one huge payment. 

Well after that conversation they decided it wasn’t good enough and started spreading lies and rumors about us. It got to the point with what they were saying that I was afraid to let my guard down. So I cut off contact and encouraged SO to do the same. 

Would I be the asshole if I didn’t pay them like they’ve been demanding? Honestly if they reached out and apologized to SO about how hurtful they were I would ignore what they said about me and most likely pay them back for their kindness. I’m not sure what to do. 

To be clear: when we moved in to begin with they did not expect any money or any help with food but we offered food we bought with food stamps and tried to offer them money throughout the time we were there. They accepted the food but declined any money. So we did our best to pay them with keeping the house spotless and such. ",19,34,0.97
530,Not the A-hole,"Little backstory: I basically can’t talk to my parents about anything because if I even begin to, my 5 year old sister will start screaming because she’s not the centre of attention and if she’s asleep or not there, my parents are too tired to fully pay attention to what I have to say (which I don’t blame them for seeing as they both work and taking care of my sister is a really exhausting thing to do) 

I (17F) am in the process of looking for a suitable university to go to (I’m in the UK). I have an open day in a week and today I reminded my parents about it. That’s when my mum asked me if she could go with me. 

The thing about that is that I wouldn’t mind my mum going, but that would mean my 5 year old sister had to go as well. I told her that I wouldn’t want my sister there because I don’t want her messing about while I’m trying to find out more about my future (I basically decided I want to go to this uni but I’m going there to find out more) because that’d be distracting for both me and my parents. 

She got a bit mad at me saying that but I think it’s reasonable. She went on to say that when she went to my brothers uni open day last year in a different uni there was a lot of things for little kids to do. That’s when I lost it.

I started yelling about the fact that this is my future I’m talking about and all she seems to care about is the fact that my sister could have fun at my potential future university. I don’t want to be overshadowing in that day in the way that my parents focus on my sister all day to make sure she’s okay instead of focusing on my future, which the day is basically supposed to be. 

I know that the day is basically for me to find out more info not my parents, but I’d still appreciate it if they could at least pay a bit of attention to it since they don’t really listen when I try to tell them about it myself.

Did I overreact? AITA? 

Edit: few people are asking me about me setting up babysitting for my sister. I should’ve mentioned this but the original plan was for me and my dad to go alone, meaning that a babysitter wouldn’t be necessary if my sister doesn’t come with me. My mum saw this as a fun day out, which annoy me. ",26,54,0.95
531,Asshole,"Today I was at the store with my 2 y/o daughter. She's a really good kid , so I rarely have to apologize for something she does or my bad parenting decisions. I often get compliments on how well behaved she is and her calm temperament, but make no mistake, she is still a toddler, so we have our moments.

We are at the checkout line and we are 2nd in line. They're two cashiers next to each other at a counter, so there is a lady in front of me (lady #1) and another lady in front of me (lady #2) , but off to the right a bit, maybe 2 feet away from us. My kid is acting up a little and trying to run off from me in the line, but no one has noticed us and no attention is being drawn. I grab her hand and she giggles a little loudly, as she thinks it's funny, then drops her toy she had in her hand. She gets down to retrieve it, but when she gets up she is very close to lady #2, and in that split second she thought she was me and hugs her legs from behind, her head landing between her legs, right under her butt.

I quickly called out my daughter's name to help her realize,Whoa, that ain't mommy. The look on her face when she realized that she was hugging a stranger was priceless and a funny  honest mistake. I'm laughing and herding my daughter back over to me. this lady turns around and she is pissed. She was about 25 and she was giving my daughter a look as if she was a 40 year old slimeball who just grabbed her ass. 

I get not all people like kids and I respect that, but I thought she was going to hit my kid with the look she had on her face. She continued to stay turned staring at my daughter with a scowl of hatred. Now I'm already laughing, but I'm a nervous laugher on top it. So when I see this lady acting like she is about to unwind on my kid, the laughing just continues. The lady then glares at me and I cant help myself.. I keep laughing, but I glared right back. I said nothing. Normally I'm a pushover and very easy and quick to apologize for anything and everything, but the fact that she seemed so offended by a kid accidently hugging her, it almost wanted to make me see red. I hugged my daughter and then looked up at this woman who had the most ugly twisted face at this point and I just smiled and raised my eyebrows as to ask if there was a problem here.

This whole thing lasted maybe 15 seconds, but fuck that time lasted forever. Lady #1then turns around and is now just staring at me and my daughter as well, shaking her head a bit in disapproval. That gets me thinking, wow, did I just make a parenting fuck up that I should have apologized for instead of laughing at this woman and her reaction? So was I the asshole in all of this?

Normally i would apologize at the drop of a hat, but the way this lady looked at my daughter with such hatred really just pissed me off badly. What do you guys think? Did mama bear mode get the best of me? I kinda fear I'm the asshole


Edit: I'm the asshole. I could and should have easily diffused the situation with a quick apology for my daughter's accidental hug, but I just laughed in a way that could be taken very offensively. That's where I fucked up and should have shut up . To the random lady in the store, if your reading this, I'm sorry! My daughter thought you were me.

532,Not the A-hole,"I have no issue with porn, but I'm not comfortable with the NSFW subreddits, because of the interaction. 

I made this clear very early on in my relationship. My now-boyfriend (at the time we were seeing each other) was on r/gonewild and I said I was uncomfortable with NSFW subreddits. We had a bit of an argument, but he said he understood my point of view. He said he didn't really go on them much anyway and would unsubscribe. He then unsubscribed in front of me then and there. 

Today he was sitting next to me on the sofa at my parent when he suddenly looked worried and clicked onto something I knew wouldn't interest him. I asked him what he was looking at and he kept trying to show me pictures of a demolished building. He eventually showed me he'd been looking at some half naked teenager.

537,Not the A-hole,"I babysit my friend's 8 year old daughter 2-3 afternoons a week. (she has a 2-2-3 custody set up with her ex-h) I pick her up from school and she hangs out at my house and does her homework for about 2-3 hours before my friend gets off work and picks her up. 

&#x200B;

We agreed (in writing) that she'd pay me $20/day for this, which isn't a ton, but her kid is quiet and well behaved, so it's not really a lot of work. This was going just fine for the first half of the school year, every other week she'd pay me $100. Since the beginning of February however, she's had one excuse after another as to why she couldn't pay me. 

&#x200B;

The first time it was legitimate, her car had a mechanical problem that needed to be fixed for her to drive it safely, sucks, but that's life and I wasn't upset. The 2nd time she didn't pay was a bit fishy because she claimed that  her work had a problem with it's payroll software and thus she would have to wait an extra week for her check. She works for a large bank and so I didn't quite buy it, but I figured she had another life emergency pop up and was embarrassed. (After this week's issue, I asked another friend who happens to work in IT at said bank about it, and she confirmed there wasn't an problem.) I gently reminded her that she owed me $200 by this point, and she assured me I'd have the full amount on the next payday.

&#x200B;

This Friday comes along and I notice she's posted a *huge* haul from Sephora on facebook, easily $250 worth of stuff if not more, with the caption that she'd needed to treat herself on payday. This irked me a bit, since she always complains about how she's short on funds, but I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt since she could've had a gift card or something.

&#x200B;

My faith in her was not rewarded when shortly after seeing this post she called me up to tell me that she had an unexpected expense and wouldn't be able pay me once again. While it might not have been the best choice on my part, I brought up that make-up didn't seem to be something that was more important than paying for childcare. I admit I was a bit short with her, but I didn't raise my voice or insult her.

&#x200B;

This set her off and she told me that I was classist by saying people with a limited income should never buy themselves nice things, and that life was so hard for a single mom and I'd never understand. (I'm honestly not sure I'd class someone with 50-50 custody as a single mom, but that isn't a hill I want to die on)  I wasn't in a mood for a blowout so I just told her that if she couldn't pay me she'd have to find alternate arragements for her daughter going forward and ended the call.

538,Not the A-hole,"I recently got engaged and took some time off to visit our parents and start planning. First stop was mine and then his.

I suffer from chronic pain and take a variety of meds which cause a decrease in appetite and nausea. I haven’t disclosed my illness to my in-laws, but a few nights ago I could hear her complaining about how I’m too good to eat what they cook. I let it go.

Yesterday, fiancé took me around his hometown. On the way back, he remembered to get beer, but we were already pulling into the driveway. I was tired, so he dropped me off. His parents were waiting for me in the living room, angry.

Future mother-in-law - FMIL: You really think you can pull the wool over our eyes, don’t you? You think you can bring drugs into our house?!

Me: *motioning to a seat because my legs hurt*

FMIL: No no! You stand! How dare you bring this disgusting bullshit into our house!

I reach for my cellphone and she yells at me to keep my hands at my side.

FMIL: I don’t care how legal this stuff is. We don’t allow this garbage in our house! *She pulls out a plastic wrapped package and I immediately know what it is.* My husband took a bite out of it and got sick! 

I’m pissed off right now because this was at the bottom of my luggage! And then she starts going off about how many pills I take (again, wouldn’t know if you hadn’t gone through my stuff) and how her son doesn’t deserve a druggie. She takes my package and shows me where FFIL took a few bites and threw up soon after.

It’s been 10 minutes and my fiancé is back. His mom asks him if he knows all the medication I’m on and how I brought pot into their house. He can’t get a straight answer about how they know about my medicine, but then he glances at the package and just sighs.

Fiancé: Mom, it’s soap. Even says African Black Soap.

He broke off a piece, headed to the kitchen, and washed his hands with it, showing them the lather. FMIL fired back saying that she’s never seen soap like that and that this doesn’t explain the amount of meds I take. They say they’re justified in what they did because they want the best for their son and since it’s their house they can go through personal belongings at will.

I let them have it. I start screaming and cussing because I’m exhausted and tired. I can’t remember everything I said, but my throat has been a mess from all of the screaming. FFIL tried to give me back the soap, but I kind of threw it at him saying I didn’t want his gum disease. Terrible, I know.

We’re staying at a hotel and not talking to his parents. I feel I could have gone about it better. I wanted a good relationship with my in-laws and we’ve always kind of gotten along... now I feel like I fucked up badly.

543,Everyone Sucks,"My friend had her bachelorette a couple weekends ago. The two ladies organizing her bachelorette sent out an email about the bachelorette in September (6 months prior) asking us to RSVP. I initially said I could go, but between September and March my work schedule changed (which is not unreasonable I don't think?), and I was only able to spend the Saturday night instead of both Friday and Saturday. I emailed them a few weeks prior to the bachelorette about this (even though I hadn't heard from them at ALL yet), and I got no response. Five days before the bachelorette, I got an email detailing the entire weekend and the costs, which amounted to $430 per person, for approximately 15 girls. I told them I could only make it the second night, and they said that since everything was already booked, I would have to pay for the AirBnb, bus and driver they rented out for the weekend, the prix fixe wine tasting and luncheon on Saturday afternoon (which I couldn't attend). They were able to exclude the cost of some miscellaneous items (not sure which) but that I would still need to pay $370.

Am I being unreasonable in thinking that paying $370 for one night (which basically included dinner, a bus taking us to and from the club, and a bunk bed for the night) is WAY too much? They didn't consult us at all about costs, or what we would be doing, etc. in the six months between the invitation and the email outlining the event. I emailed her back saying that I was surprised at the costs, and I offered to pay for the AirBnb, (because obviously they had to book a house big enough for everyone for the whole weekend - they weren't going to get a new AirBnb the next night to accommodate changes in numbers), the private bus (even though it would've been WAY cheaper to get Ubers) and the Saturday night prix fixe dinner. She responded saying that they already paid for everyone's wine tasting and luncheon ($150) on the Saturday morning/afternoon, and that it would be unfair for her to absorb the costs because I RSVP'd initially. The poor bride got sucked into it, because she then ended up texting me separately asking me what the problem is, etc.

Am I being an asshole here?!

&#x200B;

EDIT: Just adding a few details about communication. We got an e-vite 6 months prior asking us to just RSVP as ""Yes"" or ""No"". The details of the invitation said to expect ""wine tasting, dinner and dancing on Saturday"" and that details would follow (but they never did). There wasn't any Facebook group or group chat or anything, we weren't told of the specific activities or costs. I ended up emailing them a few weeks prior to the bachelorette because I still hadn't heard anything, and to tell them that I couldn't make it to part of the bachelorette (but that I was willing to pay for the AirBnb and the transportation). Didn't get a response. Five days before the bachelorette, I got an email outlining the details of the weekend's activities and a request for an e-transfer for the full amount.

550,Asshole,"Bit of a backstory, my boyfriend and I began dating three years ago and I met his family and everything was fine.

Thing is, his family appeared to be really nice to me but then I found out they talked behind by back and insinuated that because I'm a good match [Their opinion, not mine] he shouldn't ever let me go but they still constantly berate me. 

His father and stepmother constantly scrutinize what I wear, the price of what I wear, etc so I mainly don't meet with his family often, at all really. I just feel uncomfortable being around them because of this but my boyfriend supports me, he's great.

Point of the story is, his mother is the same.
One time we were having dinner at my MIL house and I asked my boyfriend for some coke (not in a bad way at all, I speak very lovingly to my boyfriend always, he's wonderful). I wasn't comfortable walking up to the fridge and getting anything.

A week later my boyfriend and his mother went to brunch and she explained to him how she thinks our relationship is one sided and gave the example that I asked him for coke as if ""I were a princess"" and I didn't get it myself.

This other time all three of us went on vacation and I took two bags, my boyfriend took one. 
Walking towards the hotel room, my boyfriend grabbed one of my bags so I wouldn't have to carry two.

When I went to the bathroom to change to a bathing suit, I literally heard his mother whispering ""See, this is why I say your relationship is one sided, why couldn't she carry both her bags? She expects you to do everything for her."" and my boyfriend asking her to ""Just, stop.""

Fast forward to today, my boyfriend and his mother were (yet again) having brunch. A package we were expecting arrived, so I texted him about it then told him a couple of other things about the day. Just telling him my mother wouldn't be in town, etc.

His mother then got angry and asked to collect the check because he's ""with me everyday, you need to cut off on your obsession to her"". Now, I need to emphasize that we texted for 6 texts total. Nothing drastic, and it was just a specific moment. I had just woken up so I hadn't spoken to him. My boyfriend got so angry he texted me about it, and I got angry back because I'm just tired of the ""one-sided"" drama. I texted my boyfriend back that if he didn't ""fight"" with her about this I didn't want to see him today because he isn't standing up for me and our relationship.

My boyfriend and I get along wonderfully, we have a very healthy relationship (thank god) and we're always down to do whatever for each other. We're together every single day, for the most part of the day and his mother basically never sees us. So I don't get why she presses on this so much.

It was going great till 2 months ago, I got an opportunity to become a key member of an emerging company. I was a bit reluctant because of the work hours but my SO convinced me to go for it since there was a massive salary hike too. 

 It required a lot more extra effort from my part and I often work 12-16 hours a day now. I ended you liking what I did, and my salary almost doubled. The ratio was now about 5:1 in terms of how much we contributed. Not saying I don't let her treat herself with our money, I obviously did... but I expected to at least come home with less dishes in the sink and vacuuming done.

Apparently not, I often end up staying up till 12 am and wake up at 4am. I confronted her about this yesterday. She goes out to watch movies and binge watches Netflix, something we used to do together, everyday. I honestly couldn't handle it anymore.

Yesterday,I didn't shout or anything, I just told her that we should honestly consider changing the agreement and she should ideallydoing a little more work. When she said that I had promised on the 50/50. 
I told her straightaway that I couldn't handle it.
I told her that I would be fine with doing a good amount of things, just not an equal amount or the majority of the work load. 

She suddenly just broke down and slammed the door shut. Saying I was supposed to be a good guy but I had somehow made it all worst. 
Mostly because of the door muffing my voice, I shouted and told her I did my fucking best being a good guy for the people around me.( but I do confess that there was a trace of anger and aggression.) She told me to fuck off and I ended up sleeping in the other bedroom.


Today at work I was getting bombarded with messages from her friend's on how I am being a complete moron and should better bring a box of her favorite chocolates by the time I reach home.


I am at a local library now, honestly a bit stressed out....I genuinely need some help and even constructive criticism is welcome.

I honestly might be the asshole, this is probably more of a confirmation. I am ready to listen to criticism and improve myself in any way possible.
I am just stressed out.


EDIT:I pay most of the bills, we have a joint account where I contribute roughly 5 times more as her. I wanted to clarify since someone asked, thanks. She works about 30-40 hours a week, and I work about 90 hours now. I wanted to clarify since some of you seen confused about that too. 
Sorry for not wording it too properly, I am honestly a bit tensed.

I am not worried or arrogant about making more money, I earned thrice as much earlier too, and we have a joint account. The main problem is honestly time from my side.",105,33,0.9

We were casually talking about what we'd do if I became pregnant, and he said that a DNA test would need to happen once I had the child. His reasoning for this is because he doesn't ""want his family's name ruined"" over a girl, referring to his family's strong background within the military and line of ancestry. He insists that it's not because he doesn't trust me, but rather more of a reassurance thing.

I would never even think to cheat or betray his trust in any way. Am I wrong for having my feelings kinda hurt over this?

Update: I did not tell him it made me upset or start a fight over it. I would not refuse to take the test if it gave him peace of mind. It just caught me off guard by him saying something like that.",1196,2960,0.95

Edit: I didn't really expect to get this much feedback, to clarify what I was caring more about was her safety. At first she told me she only did it to pre-game with her roommates, what she informed me on after was that she got more coke from someone she didn't know which was what upset me.

555,Not the A-hole,"So my best friend who I’ve known since primary school, let’s call him Will. Will is a racist.

He was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn’t really know much about all of that. 

By the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he’d whisper to me behind that guy’s back a racial slur directed at him, so that’s pretty minor and that’s not too bad.

But it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply 
“their (n-word) faces made me angry”

So at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there’s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he’s insecure about his weight, he’s Anxious about most things, and I’m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.

So yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media’s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven’t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?

Edit: I forgot to specify that he really detests any professional help for his issues. He says it’s “bullshit” and “fake”",185,654,0.92
556,Not the A-hole,"Went for brunch today and checked in for a 45 minute wait. Me and my boyfriend (we’re gay) sat down in some chairs to wait to be called back. Some straight couple comes in and is clearly upset that the wait is so long. The guy asks me to stand up so his girl can sit. I say no, a little shocked that someone would ask a stranger to give up their seat. The couple is young and looks to have no medical issues, and I’ve been here longer so why should I give up my seat? The guy gets angry and says verbatim “Dude you should always give up your seat for a lady. What’s your problem?” I’m not here for the drama, I’m here for brunch, so I just ignore him until we get called back.

AITA for not following society’s golden rule “ladies first”? As a gay man I’ve always wondered if it’s rude to not feel like it’s my god given responsibility to do anything and everything I can for a woman in public. ",120,274,0.91

558,Not the A-hole,"Tl;dr at bottom, it got lengthy 

So about two years ago I ordered food on my phone from Panera Bread. I parked my car (within the lines) in the Togo parking spot that has a ten minute maximum. The parking lot was really full as it was lunch time and this place is right next to a military base. I go inside, make my drink, grab my bag and head back out. There’s a woman putting in her baby’s car seat in the spot next to mine and she is blocking my way to the driver door so I just stand and wait. After a few moments she hits my car with her door, but hey she’s got her hands full and my car has been through worse so I don’t say anything. She hit it a few times just trying to adjust the car seat and get it buckled correctly. Then she looks up and sees me waiting. She tells me essentially that I am not allowed to park next to her since she has a baby on board sticker and that it’s my fault she hit my door because I should have known that. I told her I didn’t pay attention to her car when I was parking and that she could’ve loaded her car from the other side (which was empty) or she could park farther away if she needs more room (she was directly in front of the door) and that since I’m in the lines and did not exceed my time I did absolutely nothing wrong. In the end she argued a bit, flipped me off and I grumbled “fuck you too, lady”. I’m not sure if she heard me or not. I know it was unnecessary to say that it was just me being angry at how entitled and snotty she was. 
I assumed that since the baby was fairly small she was just tired and grumpy overall. So AITA? Do people actually not park next to people who have those signs. I thought those were just for emergency services in case of a crash. It’s been two years and I still think about it whenever I see one. 

TL;DL: Lady says I should not of parked next to her because she had a “baby on board” sign and I was blocking her from fully opening her back door even though I was in my lines. We argue a little and she flips me off so I said “fuck you too” AITA? ",172,335,0.9

My husband married me despite his parents objections. We are very much in love. But I told him I don’t want his parents to visit us because they always cause fights and arguments.

565,Asshole,"UPDATE 3: Lots of YTA intitially, NTA afterwards, Just clarifying 1 thing, this was checked by commentators below for the app I used, Indeed I did pay Per Hour, Not Per Room or Sq ft. Im not making that up or lying and if you see the name below you can check for yourself.

(Repost letter count)
tldr: I hired a cleaner for a certain number of hours, i lied about the size of the house because i only wanted him to clean the bottom floor (so it hired him for 4 hours), he cleaned it so quickly so there is time to work on the upstairs but he is angry that there are more bedrooms and bathrooms than listed, even tho ive told him he doesnt have to finish it all, only the time i hired him for.

So, I used an app to pay for a cleaner to come today, Its something me and my siblings do when we use our parents house when they travel (we are between the ages of 17 - 22 so we can pull together enough money for it) and when they are away, we have more freinds over than usual, might have a house party. They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can. But hiring a proffesional with their tools and solutions really helps.

Its really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.

I played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or it would've 
 have hired the cleaner for much longer.

So it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.

Hes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says ""THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED"" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.

Hes still huffing and getting annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hired him for and then leave. Even if its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.",911,5072,0.93

I hoped the conversation would just move on, but it seemed to trigger more stories on the topic and when he was done his dining companion jumped in with his own detailed vomit story. I tried to focus on the conversation with my husband but they were speaking loudly and the details were turning my stomach so I interrupted them and asked if they could change the topic of their conversation since we were eating. 

They did change the subject - but awkwardly it became about how I was eavesdropping on them and how they felt they couldn’t talk freely since they were being watched. It was an uncomfortable meal and my husband was annoyed that I said something and made things awkward. He said I should have just excused myself for a few minutes if it was bothering me and the conversation would have changed (though our food had just arrived - I wouldn’t have wanted to let it get cold and had no idea when this topic would have exhausted itself!)

Of course I’d love to do it, but I have a fear of going outside on some days. It sometimes gets to a point where I can’t leave the house to go shopping or hold a steady job. I’ve told her about it before but she just thinks I’m faking it to get out of doing stuff and paying my way through life.

I’m more worried for the dog’s sake that if my mental health gets the better of me one day, nobody is going to walk him, so do I have to grin and bear it anyway? It doesn’t help that the last time I walked him, he barked at 2 pit bulls who jumped on him and would have mauled him if I hadn’t had him on the lead to pull him away.

Of course this isn’t a case where I don’t want to walk my dog, it’s more “sometimes I’m too scared to leave the house by myself, let alone while I charge of an animal.”

I told them them all that I had read on the internet that eating only apples was the healthiest thing for you. When I first told them they thought I was joking, but they underestimated how committed I would be to a joke. So, whenever in the presence of one of my friends (or friend-of-friends/coworkers/etc who knew them) I was very careful to only be seen eating apples or drinking apple juice/cider. 

Apples whole, apples diced, apple sauce, the inside of an apple pie, baked apples, candy apples with the chocolate shaved off, etc. 

Finally after about a week they bought that I had become an Appletarian. They started giving me information about how unhealthy it was to only eat apples, and growing increasingly exasperated by it. Some of them even got angry.

But I wanted to stick with the joke. Finally, after the end of 3 weeks, I walked into what I was told was a movie night but was actually an intervention for me. 

They were all super concerned about my well being and had all sorts of information or whatever. Finally I started laughing hysterically. They were confused as hell so I told them I had been faking it the whole time and had been eating real meals outside their knowledge. I even took out some beef jerky from my pant pocket to prove it and munched it. 

I thought they'd appreciate the joke but they were actually really annoyed. My girlfriend even broke up with me over this because a few days ago I had ruined our date night when I told the waiter I only wanted apples because I was an Appletarian and had ""embarrassed her for a dumb joke"". 

In my opinion the joke was solid and they should appreciate my commitment to the prank. 

But, did I go too far?

588,No A-holes here,"For a little context, me and my girlfriend have been dating for 8 months now.. I'm a black man and she's half-white half-Chinese. She's the funniest person I've ever met and is a legitimately sweet and caring woman.  Safe to say, I'm in love with her, but recently our relationship hit a rough patch.

One night, she calls me and tells me to come over to her house. She usually only does this when she wants to have sex, so I jump in the car and get there quick. When I get there, it's clear that she's a bit nervous. She invites me in. I ask her what's up and we talk for a bit. She gets all flirty with me, but that's normal and whatever. Then, she finally pops the question.

""Hey, OP, can we try something different tonight?""

""Depends. What do you want to try?""

""I know this is gonna sound weird, but I need you to be open-minded and not judge me.""

""I'll keep an open-mind, sure.""

She reaches to the table behind her and brings out a pair of handcuffs. She explains to me that she always wanted to try a slave/master roleplay with me. She elaborates that she's always had fantasies about completely dominating ""a strong man like myself"", and how her status as a woman in society means that she doesn't have many chances to be ""in control"" when with a man, so she likes to play it out in the bedroom. However, as she goes on, I feel more and more on edge about the situation. Considering that I minored in African-American Studies in college and the simple fact that I'm a black man living in America, I think it's understandable that I'm a bit wary of the implications.

When I bring this concern up, she gets defensive. She explains that this isn't a race thing and that she's done this with her non-black boyfriends in the past. She admits that she took a while to bring it up because of my race, as she didn't want me thinking she's racist. I leave, saying I need to think about it.

It's been a few days and I still don't know what to do. Ever since that night, whenever we've talked, she's brought it up and asked me if I felt that it was okay. I keep dodging the issue though. Every time she asks she seems more frustrated with me. Hell, I'm frustrated in myself for not just sucking it up and doing it for her. I get where she's coming from btw. I get that people don't really have control over what they're turned on by, I have fetishes myself that she's indulged in. However, my conscience is telling me that I can't really do this, and it's looking like this might be a dealbreaker for her and for me. She's perfect in every other way, but this fetish is so against everything I hold myself to.

So, WIBTA for wanting to break up with her over this?

EDIT: Thank you guys for the criticism. Y'all are right, I didn't straight-up say ""no"" and I kept dodging the issue, which is  my fault. I kind of just hoped she'd get the memo when I brought up the racial aspect, but I guess I should have been more communicative and put my foot down.

Girl with the puppy moves about two months later. Girl remaining, I don't know what the hell her problem is, started to slam her door hard enough the walls/floor shakes. Has people over late into the night and is rowdy. I try asking her to stop, she ignores me. She's brought the other girls into this.

After Christmas break, it worsened. I spoke to my RA, she said to just talk to them, she ""promises they're nice"". Nope. I go to housing to ask to be moved, and when asked, I explain. RA's boss is contacted, RA gets mad at me, yells at me, slightly yells at the other girl. Completely shuts herself away from everyone.

Door slamming and 2 am parties continue. I tried talking to her tonight, but she doesn't answer her door, but I hear, ""It's bugging her lol"". I slink off into my room, whatfuckingever. They get very rowdy, and the door slams four more times with wall/floor shaking.

590,Not the A-hole,"My husband (32m) and I (31f) have had issues with his hobby for the last few years. Without getting into specifics, it takes up the majority of his time when he’s not working and he has invested tens of thousands of dollars into it (not sure exactly how much - he hides it from me). We fight about it often as I feel like myself and our daughter (3 yo) always come in second when it comes to the hobby. If I try to plan things on weekends for us to do as a family I have a rare shot at actually finding a window that works for him. It’s also been a long snowy winter for us so our daughter has been cooped up inside. The last family outing that wasn’t just a dinner or visiting family was in October. 

He’s been away for the last week for work and will continue to be gone for another week. While talking on the phone tonight I mentioned taking our daughter to a really good museum a few hours away the first Saturday he’s back. I figured I had a good shot of that Saturday being free as he would have worked the previous 2 Saturdays so he shouldn’t be on call. He informed me that he had a competition related to his hobby that Saturday and I needed to pick another day. I refused to pick a different Saturday (museum is closed Sunday). He then said that I should pick another activity that’s open on Sunday and I refused to do that as well. 

The reason I refused is because we’ve played this game before. If I move the plans to another day - something always comes up (work or hobby related) and then it gets pushed again. And again. And again. Until we just never do it. And I really want to take our kid to THIS museum. It hits all of her current interests and she will have an amazing day. And she deserves it after a winter of playing inside and doing well in school (she has a few delays so she was able to start the special ed preschool a few months ago and has been making huge strides). I’m still planning on taking her, and told my husband we will just go without him. He got upset with me that I wasn’t willing to budge on the activity or the day. 

I know he wants to go and do things with us but I feel like if we were really a priority that he would pick us more than he does. I’m getting tired of us pushing everything in our lives back to make room for his stuff. I get that he’s made a commitment to this competition but he’s attended more competitions this winter than days he’s spent with his wife and/or kid. I feel like giving him a firm ‘this is the day we are doing this - come or don’t come’ is plenty fair. 

Edit: I feel obligated to give some new info that might influence judgement. I’ve been informed that for this competition he’s had it planned weeks in advance and has paid a non-refundable deposit. I did not know this weeks ago or was it mentioned during our argument. ",87,93,0.94

We were talking about weight and I expressed the dissatisfaction I’m experiencing after dealing with multiple ongoing health issues over the past few years. My friends friend (let’s call her “Jane”) jumped down my throat about how I could “eat more” and “if you’re fat what am I.” Jane then went on a long rant about how some people can’t help being fat, and how she’s only overweight because of her health issues.

So I said many people have health issues but still figure out ways to take care of themselves. She said she has hypothyroidism, so unlike me she doesn’t have energy to workout.I explained that I too also have hypothyroidism, and that in fact, I don’t even have a thyroid. But that I still manage what I ate even when I can’t go to the gym. 

 I also said that I understand you gain some weight dealing with thyroid issues but not enough to become morbidly obese. That it’s very rare to have a health problem that makes you gain enough weight to be THAT overweight, and hypothyroidism definitely isn’t one of them. At some point people have to acknowledge that some weight gained is their fault and not their disease. She started crying and told me I was fat shaming her, and my friend agreed. 

She’s made a lot of comments in the past about my body, and has implied I have an eating disorder (I don’t, like at all). She always tells people I’m only skinny because I don’t eat. (Also a lie).

The party was...awkward. I had earlier told her I could only stay for 1-2h because pregnancy has been making me really tired, but so many people seemed to some kind of excuse to show up late/leave early, so the dinner for supposedly 16 people ended up with just 8 people (3 were her family). 

The staff kept asking if we would like to move to a smaller table, but she kept snapping that people were coming. Other friends did show up throughout the night, but they just came to munch/down shots & bolt. I could tell she was upset, so I decided to stay all the way until her cake came because I felt bad. She delayed the cake cutting until past 11:45 (dinner started at 8:30) because she kept hoping more people would show up but nope. 

I was tired & starving the entire night since she did the ordering for the entire table, so there wasn’t much I could eat. I’ve developed gestational diabetes too & most of the food she ordered were raw, alcoholic, shellfish (I’m allergic), or full of carbs/sugar. I have to log my food for my diabetes management & I only had:

* 6 roasted Brussels sprouts
* 1 tablespoon of sautéed spinach
* 1/2 tablespoon of creamed spinach
* 4 thin slices of steak (no more than ~25g/0.88oz total. Meat makes me nauseous during pregnancy, especially when it’s rare, but I needed to eat so I forced myself)
* 3 small mouthfuls of pasta 
* 2 teaspoon of bone marrow
* 1 slice of bread from the free bread basket (I know I’m not supposed to eat too much carbs, but I got too hungry)

2 days later, she told me to transfer $161 to her. She initially claimed it was $212, but I think someone else went “wtf” & she said she made a mistake and did the math wrong. 

It was her birthday dinner & she did all the ordering, so I assumed she was paying. If I knew I had to pay, I would’ve ordered my own food & actually gotten to eat (a main course would’ve only cost $30-80). 

To make it worse:

1. I overheard the waiter telling her the several appetisers were on the house since she knew one of the managers. She charged for them anyway. She sent us an excel spreadsheet instead of the actual bill to hide it. 

2. She ordered for 16 people & 20+ people came, munched, and left, BUT she split the bill only between 9 people —her & her family, the 4 people who cared enough to stay all the way until the cake cutting, & the boyfriend of one of her friends, who came to pick her up & decided to munch on some of the leftovers since there were a LOT left over.

602,Not the A-hole,"For starters, I'm a sixteen year old and my parents have been divorced for almost all my life. They aren't hostile to one another and are usually very civil. My dad remarried and my mom is still single. This week is spring break for me, so I was at my dad's for almost the entire week. 

Yesterday I went to a friend's (let's call him Sam) house to hangout after my soccer practice. My dad had dropped me off to practice and one of my other friends took me to Sam's house as I don't have my driver's license. 

All goes fine until about 10:45ish when my mom texts my dad asking where I am. My dad responds, ""He's at Sam's house, right?"" (I told my dad I would be going to a friend's house Friday and Saturday the day before he dropped me off. I also reminded him the day of as well)  My mom interprets this as him not knowing where I am, instead of the logical thinking that,"" He's at Sam's, unless you've heard otherwise?"" This causes my mom to go ballistic, calling my phone multiple times and texting me multiple times as well.

However, I did not see the texts or calls because my phone automatically goes to do not disturb at 10. Also, I don't always keep my phone near me as I try to actually hang out with my friends instead of be on my phone the entire time.

About 45 minutes after she goes ape shit, I see the texts from my parents ( my dad had texted me a bunch too because my mom told him that I was avoiding her or something). I responded to my mom like this: my dad knows where I am, (she asked if dad knew where I was) Sam's parent's were ok with me staying the night, (they were) and that I had already told her throughout the week that I was staying the night at a friend's house Friday (3 times in fact). 

What's even worse, Sam tells me later that my mom had called his parents (who were asleep) multiple times around MIDNIGHT. On top of that, my mom texts me back that I need to start being more responsible and I was acting like a brat. 

Today she is still mad at me and now wants me to download an app that lets her track me 24/7. My dad brushed this whole thing aside because ""being a single parent is hard"".

Don't get me wrong, I'm so grateful to have parents that care about me, but I don't think her behavior can be swept under the rug because ""being a single parent is hard"". AITA for still being mad at her?

TL;DR : Went to sleepover at friend's house and  notified my parents the days prior. Mom forgot about this and blew up mine and my friend's parent's phones up around midnight. Says I was being a brat because I hadn't told her every single detail of my day or because my I ""made my own plans"" without them knowing.


Edit: I have told my mom that I won't be downloading a tracker app. I will however try to communicate better with her when I go out.

I have a tricky situation I’m going through as of late.  I’m in a long term relationship.  We aren’t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We’ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She’s 19. 

My “stepdaughter” and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn’t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  

After that I’ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I’m still kind when I’m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  

I thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I’ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fiancé loves having her here, but I’ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fiancé and I.   

I really feel like I’ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it’s time to push her out of the nest.  I’m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don’t really care how she takes it.

She wanted [mountains](https://i.imgur.com/XosK7eI.jpg) on one wall, and birch trees on another. Now, my sister's mother-in-law(SMIL) normally is the go-to artist in the family and I think this is why things went wrong.

My sister provided paint, but the top two blues were too close in color. I mixed them with white and a darker blue to get them to contrast a bit better. Every other range is base color. After 10 hours the project is done barring a streaky spot at the bottom that needs to be filled in-we had run out of paint. She had posted pictures of my work on facebook to help promote my budding business and I got a lot of nice feedback/inquiries.

SMIL also painted rainbows on my niece's wall, but had stated she didn't want attention, so she didn't get a FB post. She also left a somewhat bitter comment on mine, so my sister messaged her to tell her that they appreciated her work, and that my niece loves her wall. SMIL responds with how she was exhausted from the work, it took a lot out of her, it's unfair, and how she feels taken advantage of but does painting because she loves her family.

The next day my sister calls me up crying. It turns out SMIL was over to help with last minute things and had snuck upstairs with the paint. She filled in the streaky spot, then began ""touching up"" my mountain ranges--the range that I had mixed paint for, and used the paint straight out the can. When my sister caught her she flipped, and SMIL panicked and tried to wipe half-cured paint off the wall stripping it down to the raw white bottom, effectively ruining the piece.

Over-stepping boundaries has always been a problem with SMIL. I **don't** think she was trying to ruin my piece. I think she was trying to play the hero (""I fixed some mistakes Readylamefire made!"") and get involved in something that didn't belong to her. The portion she was 'touching up' was a part I had gone over with a fine tooth comb because I knew there would be no second chances on it since mixing the exact color again would be near impossible. My sister demanded she leave but she ignored her, continuing to try and fix it. Now I have to go actually fix it.

Now, I have a right to be mad, but here's where I think I might be the asshole:  
I want to send a firm worded letter to SMIL. She constantly does stuff like this. This was my first time doing something like this for my family, and I worked really hard. She had no right to start trying to alter the work I had done. It meant something to me. **However if I do send something to her, it'll trigger drama, and my very pregnant, stressed sister will undoubtedly be caught in the middle.** It's the one thing holding me back, and I'm leaning to being the bigger person/not saying anything to SMIL at all.",50,280,0.97
616,Not the A-hole,"My group of friends have a once a month game night.  It’s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It’s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  

One of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she’s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  

She’s nice enough I guess, but she’s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she’s really not that interesting so it doesn’t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I’ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  

Another thing that’s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I’m gay.  I’m not the “gay bff” type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She’s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have “girl talk” with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I’ve tried to be tactful with her since she’s my buddy’s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don’t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  

No one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don’t know how to tell him.  I’m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  “The group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We’d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. “.  ",149,1503,0.97

618,Everyone Sucks,"Alright, so, I've been working as a Dishwasher for just under a month at a small, locally owned restaurant. I'm assigned to work with this other guy who's been working there for about two years. He knows I'm new, but let me clarify I'm new, but not stupid. This is a really simple job that involves running dishes through a dishwasher, occasionally scrubbing, putting dishes away, mopping, and sometimes helping bus tables. I was capable by day three. It's really simple. My Co-Wrker loudly complains that we're going to get out very late tonight. (Closing time is 10:00, but dishes don't usually get out until 10:30, because we have to wait for all customers to be out, so the cooks can stop cooking, so they can give us their dishes.) 

He keeps complaining, and the night manager and him are friends outside of work, and they both are standing five feet away from me, whining how much they hate 'newbies'. (They never mention me, or my name, but it's pretty heavily implied.) I'm getting really annoyed. At about 10:00, after 6 hours of listening to him complain, I decide I'm going to go as slow as possible, ask every dumb question,  and  make so many mistakes, we're going to be here way late. If he wants to complain about me being slow, I'll give him something to complain about. 

We eventually wind up clocking out at 12:14, (Almost 2 hours after we usually would) and my Co-Worker informed me that I ruined his plans after work with his friends. I give him an 'innocent' shrug, smile and say, ""Sorry, I guess I'm still learning."" 

AITA? Or was that just the right amount of revenge? ",23,76,0.93
619,Not the A-hole,"Yesterday, I took a final exam for one of my courses (this is university btw) and I looked up to check the clock to see how much time I had left when I noticed the guy next to me had notecards underneath his test. Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.

This exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).

When I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.

Now some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.

TLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.

Edit: When I said ""They did not return."" I meant just the two guys, the professor did.

I only told four people, none of whom are in the class or know anyone in it. Two don’t even live in my state and I told them over text message.",658,3635,0.95
620,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I are going through a rough patch as far as money.  I’m the only one working.  We have no children.  

She is the WORST with impulse buys.  Our house is very literally packed with stuff she keeps buying without consenting me.  We have almost no savings because she can’t seem to control herself.  She buys gifts for both our families for no special occasion as well as our friends.  There’s been more than one occasion where I didn’t know about it until we were going out the door to go meet them and she would bust out a brand new air fryer or bag of video games or shit from Bed Bath and Beyond.  The list goes on and on.  She even “loaned” her sister the money for a new refrigerator without telling me until after the fact.  

I’m at the end of my rope.  I’ve talked with her about this so many times I’ve honestly lost count.  Nothing changes.  She says that she will talk with me before buying anything, but then just keeps on doing it.  And then is genuinely surprised when I get angry.   I don’t know how many other ways I can discuss it with her.

I was noticeably sick- runny nose, sneezing, coughing... but I was covering my face with a tissue and trying not to breathe on anyone. A little old lady (maybe in her 80s?) comes up behind me and asks if I'm sick. I thought she was being empathetic, so I gave her a small smile and said, ""Yes, unfortunately I am."" She replies, ""Oh, well I don't want to get sick. You don't mind if I go ahead in front of you in line, right?"" and then she starts to walk in front of me.

I was kind of taken back by what she was doing, so I said, ""Actually, *since I'm sick*, I think I should probably go first so I can get my medication and head home to get in bed"" and then re-took my spot in line.

622,Everyone Sucks,"I work about 60-65 hours a week M-F, normally getting to work before 4 am. It’s a very physically demanding job and I’ll normally lift and move 18-20,000 lbs per day.

My wife doesn’t work. She stays at home taking care of our two year old. Thing is she also doesn’t do much housework, as the house is always a mess unless I come home and clean after working 14+ hours.

This year we’re getting a refund of a few thousand dollars. I have to get new tires for my truck, pay off a couple things, and I was wanting to put a down payment on a vacation a few months away. My wife has told me she’s planning on buying a new, high end camera. She’s not a photographer, I don’t know what she needs a nice camera for. But she says if I get to spend the money on new tires, she should be able to spend some on something she wants. 

tl;dr AITA for thinking my wife doesn’t have the right to spend part of the tax refund that came solely from my income.

Edit: I’ll clarify since a lot of comments seem to be focused on what she does at home. I in no way mean to imply that she doesn’t work hard taking care of our child. She does and I appreciate her for that. BUT that being said. The house is always a mess, I’m the one to pick up his toys, the sink is always full of dirty dishes, and the garbage can is always overflowing rather than being replaced. I know it’s difficult to take care of a toddler. But I just don’t understand how she’s never able to do anything else besides take care of him.

Edit 2: Maybe I could’ve worded my post in a more favorable way towards my wife. We have a great relationship and communicate clearly about finances and money. I don’t view my income as “my money” and we make any big purchases together. But idk, somehow a refund seems different. Also she’s onboard with the vacation and excited about that. The camera just seems unnecessary.",1056,2769,0.94
623,Not the A-hole,"Background:

(This happened when me and my cousin were 14 & 15)

One day me and my cousin had the idea of building a tree house, one problem, we didn't have a tree. The tree on our plot of land was a sickly pine that was nowhere near able to hold 100+ pounds of wood. But, we had a next door neighbor, she was an amazingly kind old woman who'd never had kids. On her plot she had a beautiful oak tree that had to be hundreds of years old. We'd went to her asking to build the tree house, and she'd said yes before we could finish asking. We got lumber from a Home Improvement store and set out that summer to build our fort. Once it was finished we felt so happy and we played in it until school started again. 

Here's where the issues arise:

Later that year the woman died of natural causes and her daughter put her home up for sale. Luckily, the daughter had put a note with the lease asking that the new owners let us have our tree house. May of that year a family moved in, an older couple with two sons. We'd had no issues until that summer, we went over to our tree house to see the two boys up there painting the walls. We went up, thanked them for painting for us only to be met with:

""Painting for you? This is our tree house now, we moved in so you can't have it.""

We'd tried to explain that it was us who built it so we should share it at least but they wouldn't budge. We felt utterly devastated and helpless. Later that summer, the family announced that they'd be going on a vacation and wouldn't be back for 3 weeks. Me and my cousin set out to get revenge.  Day by day we dismantled the tree house and stashed the lumber in our shed until nothing was left but some nails we couldn't retrieve from the branches. As you can imagine, the boys came over livid but my parents sided with us and nothing more came of the situation.

624,Everyone Sucks,"My GF is an absolute sweetheart, the downside is she has difficultly disappointing others or potentially hurting their feelings. We just moved to a new area and one of her friends now lives within walking distance of us. He is a good dude but comes off as lonely and needy, which can get tiresome and annoying.

My GF and I are a little introverted and enjoy our alone time (together and solo). Her friend started getting into the habit of showing up unannounced or inviting himself over via text. Since he is more her friend than mine, I asked her to tell him that this is not acceptable. Despite finding it annoying as well, she couldn't bring herself to do it. So I decided take matters into my own hands. Foolishly I didn't tell her this, which is one of the reasons I might be an asshole. 

The other reason is I probably could have gone about this in a better way. I chose to confront him in person to eliminate any misunderstandings. He shows up last night, I answer the door and let him in. I immediately open with: *""Look dude, we need to talk"".* Followed by:

*""This is not a hangout spot. If you're bored, go be bored somewhere else. Stop inviting yourself over and showing up unannounced, if we want you here we'll let you know.""*

My GF was in the other room, she overheard me and was too embarrassed to come out. He looked shocked and left without saying a word. My GF told me that I was too harsh and that I should have vetted my words through her first. I apologized and agreed that I should have spoken to her first. But I feel my level of harshness was appropriate to get the point across. 

She wanted to text him to apologize and straighten everything out. I asked her to explain the situation to him, but don't undo the boundary that I established. She agreed, but unfortunately he is now ignoring her texts and calls. I do feel bad for how the situation turned out, she may have lost a friend because of my actions. I plan to apologize to him but I am firm on the boundary. 

Am I the asshole? Also suggestions and guidance is welcome.

**TL;DR**

GF's friend kept inviting himself over and coming over unannounced. She couldn't say ""no"" to him. I did instead, but I was rude about it. He is hurt and won't answer her texts or calls.

**UPDATE**

Thanks to everyone for their replies, advice, etc... I'll try to read every comment and reply to a few. As far as my GF's friend goes, he is still ignoring calls and texts. We've decided to give him time and space, we will try again in a few days. After that, in my opinion it is up to him to reach out. ",104,298,0.96

643,No A-holes here,"I live in a house apartment with a total of 5 people (three upstairs, where this takes place). I've been in the house for almost two years, and for as long as I've known it, it's been a pretty ""college"" house. Some of the decor is rather *tasteful* (read: sexual), and the living room is pretty regularly used for drinking and/or smoking pot, with the occasional parties being thrown. Admittedly it's kinda trashy, but there's rarely anyone over that isn't also college-aged, so the house environment is hardly ever a problem.

Last month, I was working in my room with my headphones on when out of the corner of my eye I see a child darting across our living room with no one else around. I confronted my roommate about who the kid was and why she was alone in the living room. He explained that his father was picking him up for work, but that he came early to hang out but was also in charge of his five year old daughter. The two of them had stepped out to talk and hang out on the porch, leaving the child inside with the TV on.

This all took me by surprise because a few months back (but with different roommates), the house agreed that we aren't very kid-friendly and that children probably shouldn't be coming in. This wasn't a house rule or anything, just a mutual feeling we all had. I didn't think we would have to discuss the matter again when our current roommate moved in, but I told him that I didn't feel comfortable with a kid hanging out in our living room and to at least give a heads up if his dad is gonna bring his daughter over. 

I feel like an asshole because now I'm the only person in the upstairs apartment that thinks this is a problem. My roommate is pretty free-spirited and doesn't think it's a bad environment for his five year old sister, and my other roommate (his partner) is majoring in childhood education and loves kids, so is also okay with it. My downstairs roommates think it's weird, but don't wanna involve themselves in something happening exclusively upstairs.

I’m working on getting my own place soon but since I just graduated from college it’s kind of hard to afford my own place. My girlfriend adopted a shelter dog recently. Her previous owner neglected her and she spent most of her life in a cage. Since she was neglected she was never house trained and she can be destructive around the house.

My dad begins going on a tirade calling my girlfriend a lying bitch and telling her that he’s going to throw her and her damn mutt out. Throughout him yelling at her I stay quiet and don’t intervene. He tells me he’s disappointed in me because I betrayed his trust. I tell him I’m sorry and that from now on the dog will be caged. After he leaves my girlfriend is in tears because I didn’t say anything while he was yelling at her but mostly because I sided with my dad and will now be enforcing his rule.

Well I stood firm in my beliefs and took it from her when she came home.   Of course she’s furious with me.  Thanks ex.  She’s barely talking to me.  Her point is that she hasn’t even done anything and that it’s not mine to take.  Her dad gave it to her.   ",737,2162,0.93
647,Not enough info,"She always does it, she’s sleeps until like 3 in the afternoon and she know I will want to go out on Saturday with my friends. She always gets pissy when I come in her room at 11:30-12. We’ll in sorry but I don’t want to lay around in the bed all day.

She takes forever to wake up and I want to go out and do things. I get that she wakes up early all week but so do I. She barely takes care of my 7 year old brother and frankly isn’t much of a mother to begin with. During the week I do most of the looking after. I do everything she wants specifically so I can go out on weekends.

I already agreed to respect her rule of going out one day and staying home the next. Still, she still gets pissy when I want to go out with my friends. She used to yell at me about not going out and how I had no friends. NOW she gets pissed when I want to go out with friends. 

This isn’t a new thing, I’ve started this about a year ago. If I ask her the night before she gets pissed too. I’m not sure what to do, when I stay home she doesn’t spend time with me anyway. I just sit in my room and don’t talk for a day. So I’m not sure what the big fucking deal is. It’s obvious she doesn’t care to spend time with me.

My brother doesn’t care when I leave either, sure my step dad might not like it but he’s always pissed at me for something. “Don’t wake me up for this shit.” Okay but you sleep until fucking 3 PM and I want to fucking do stuff. I can already see some of you saying she’s depressed, I’ve told her to seek therapy or something. She’s been like this for years. She refuses, says it’s for weak-minded people. Guess who goes to therapy? Yep me. 

My mom has a past of abusing me, so it’s not like I bust her door open and jump on the bed screaming or anything. I crack the door shoo my brother away and creepy around the front of the bed to whisper at her. She still gets mad. Like I get no one wants to be waken up but you have kids - kids that you refuse to take care of - but kids none the less. I never woke her. Up when I was little out of pure fear of what she’d do.

I’ve finally gotten the courage to do it. All she does is angrily bitch at me and most of the time give me 0 answer to the one question I asked her. 

So AITA for thinking my mom sleeping all day is bullshit?

 I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.

Am i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I ""lost"" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?

Edit: For those who asked, I thought he had left the house earlier. The roommate told us he was going to see his mom who was in town. All the lights were off except in the spare room where my bf and I were. I guess he must've been in there for 30 or 40 minutes. Totally agree I'll knock in future.

653,Not the A-hole,"Bit long so skip to the tl:dr if you want.

So me (22) and my gf (21) were chilling in the living room watching TV and she initiated sex - recently I had lost attraction to her because of her weight gain so I just wasn't in the mood for it at that moment.

The loss of attraction was because she wouldn't make an honest effort to work on it and ignored my advice (only given when she asked). It was a constant cycle of:

**Her**: ""I need to lose weight""

**Me**: ""Why don't you try this?"" (said in a nice sincere way)

**Her**: ""Ok"" and then she wouldn't try, and she would gain more - doing obvious things she know's or I have said isn't helpful (again, I would mention these things only when she asked and in a gentle way) like constant snacking.

At the start, she wasn't like this and it's been a noticeable difference: maybe 40 lbs gained. She constantly mentioned it to the point where I started influencing the way I saw her: at first I wasn't bothered, then I started to notice and be bothered more and more. Even so, I always said honest positive comments where I could and never negative ones.

So back to when we were chilling watching TV, she then says ""I know I don't look how I used to so I get it if the attraction isn't the same or you've lost some to me"" to which I replied: ""Yeah I guess things have changed, but that's not why though I'm just not in the mood, and regardless I want you to know I still love you and will always support you, you're still beautiful"". In my head I was like, she's opening up and being honest and we can work through it.

Nope, the next few days she literally shut down and started blaming me for making her feel bad, saying she can't believe I said that to her, and how sick she felt that I would say that. How she feels horrible now looking at herself and thinks I've told everyone I know that she's fat. How it's mean as she's trying her best. I apologized again and reiterated how much I love her and I'm still attracted just like she said it's changed a bit. This happened months ago and she still brings it up and says it was really hurtful I said that and still affects her.

I believe that honesty is important in a relationship and I didn't want to lie about something that I knew we both realized. Am I the asshole in this situation?

**tl:dr:** My girlfriend brought up that she knows the attraction between us has changed because she's put on weight, I agreed with her in a sincere way still saying I loved her and she's still beautiful and now she's blaming me for saying that and saying it's hurt her really bad and she feels awful now looking at herself despite me always supporting her, never mentioning her weight and trying my best to help her lose weight when she asked me for advice (which she ignored).

657,Everyone Sucks,"I have been working as a Legal Assistant with a law firm for just over six years and walked off the job yesterday in a fit of a rage.  For these six years, it has been a wonderful relationship -- my employer is a solo practitioner and I was his first and only Legal Assistant until yesterday's events.

My employer recently hired a new Associate who took it upon herself to treat me like absolute shit.  As a Legal Assistant, my duties are LEGAL related, ie; editing and drafting documents, calendar management, processing client payments, filing documents at court, phone coverage, etc.  However, the new Associate assigned me her PERSONAL duties:  Grocery shopping, driving across town in traffic to buy her favorite chocolates, making returns to clothing stores, driving to her house to let maintenance technicians in, etc.  She yelled at me a lot.  I would get panic attacks and dreaded coming in to work.  I would have no problem performing these duties if I was a PERSONAL Assistant, but I am a LEGAL Assistant and my objective is to ensure everyone in my firm has their LEGAL responsibilities in order.

At first I obliged, seeing as she was new and I figured my employer would have a word with her.  This went on for two months and every day I grew that much more resentful.  Finally, I had a private meeting with my supervisor a few weeks ago and even typed up a note detailing my frustrations and how I am being taken advantage of.  He promised me he would speak with her, but her demands continued.

Yesterday was the last straw; While working at my desk, I overheard her talking about me to our Receptionist.  She wasn't exactly pleasant - stating how I'm not up to par with her standards and how she spoke to my boss about me.  She was telling our Receptionist how much they pay me and said she wants to lower my pay.  My blood started boiling and I could feel myself about to lose my shit.

I have no idea what came over me, but I walked to over to our filing cabinet, pulled out all of our folders, and dumped all of their contents to the floor.  I imagine it was about 40-50 clients worth of papers.  I then grabbed my things and walked out of the office before telling the Associate ""Go fuck yourself, you stupid bitch.""  She was absolutely shocked.

On my home, I was seething.  Still pissed off when I got home, I texted my boss saying I will not be returning to work Monday and that he'll have to find himself another Assistant.  Both her and she have tried calling, texting, and e-mailing me, but I haven't responded, except for one text where I sent her the middle finger emoji.  

This morning I felt a twinge of guilt, as I know it was HER that made me miserable and not him .. but then again, there was no loyalty there.  Fuck you Sweta, I hate you!",542,4673,0.98

660,Not the A-hole,"I used to work a corporate job, so I know standards of conduct. You don’t show weakness. You keep certain things private.

Coming out of a severe bout of depression that cost me my previous career, I decided not to live that way anymore. I wasn’t fooling anyone. 

I have serious damage to my memory, my ability to multitask is gone, and my energy isn’t enough for full-time. I’ve been working on these problems with teams of medical specialists. This is as good as it gets for now.

I’m working my way off disability in a simpler, lower-paying job than the one I had before. In the job interview, I had to tell them why I was there. I was honest.

At first, I cried often and I made a lot of mistakes. I’ve been steered away from some tasks and put to use in other ways. But I didn’t ask to be given more grace than my employer could spare. Even so, my boss gave me a lot of room to grow slowly and was very understanding.

A year later I am doing much better, well enough that I can pass for normal most of the time.
Sometimes people ask me about my past, my education, and then ask why I’m not working at a high-paying job anymore. If they’re polite about it and I’m comfortable, I tell them that I can’t do what I used to because of brain injuries. I skip the details and shrug it off as “life happens”. It’s the truth. I’m not ashamed. It’s not like I’m endangering anyone in my position.

Recently, a person senior to me at work, L, has decided to coach me on how to present myself more professionally. She’s pushing me to lie. She tells white lies about other stuff, but always in a savvy business way. Her skill works to the company’s benefit. I’m not comfortable with it, but I’ve never seen it go badly for her/us. 

The other day I was talking with a coworker in front of L. I turned down an invite as it was at the same time as my therapy. L corrected me for saying “therapy” and told me I should have said I had a different kind of appointment (make one up).

I’m annoyed by this because 1. It was a private conversation in which everyone present knew my issues anyway, 2. You don’t have to be crazy to go to therapy, 3. Even if there’s stigma, I’d like to live in a way that rejects that, thereby reducing fear and 4. I used to be a respected professional, I know what the expectations are, and I’m ignoring them on purpose. We’ve talked about this. She knows that’s what I’m doing.

Oh, and the few times I’ve ever called in, I’ve told my boss the truth. If I have a cold, I’ll say so. If I can’t do people today, I’ll say that. It’s rare. I don’t want to change the way I do this.

My boss knows everything and hasn’t weighed in. Unless she’s pretending not to be involved and just gave L free reign instead? But I guess I could be costing us something in terms of trust or reputation just by being open? 

I don’t want to be ungrateful and stubborn. AITA?",21,115,0.95
661,Asshole,"So I was on the bus yesterday and it was packed. But this lady was so big that none was able to sit next to her. Now I had a seat on the bus for a while but as a student I give up my seat to other people as thats my schools expectation. But the entire time i had been on the bus this lady had been sitting in a 2 person seat by herself. Now when I get on its already full with many people normally standing and it really got on my nerves that this lady had the audacity to take up 2 seats. But when a lady who was deep into her pregnancy and her SO got on the bus it really annoyed me. after 2 or o minutes and no one had offered them or her alone i worked up the strength to ask her if she would get up and give her seat to the couple.

&#x200B;

Thats where i stuffed up. So i asked her politely if she would give up her seat so the lady didn't have to suffer with the pregnancy as badly. (Something along the lines of ""Excuse me ma'm would you mind giving up your seat so the lady over there could sit down so its a less unpleasant experience for her, if you could i'm sure they would greatly appreciate it)

Apparently this was super rude and she got really offended and started shouting that i was 'fatphobic' and rude and that she would report this slight to my schools headmaster and get me suspended or expelled.

Her plan would be for us to rent a beach house with them on the water which sounds great except it will be the middle of August and depending on dates we will have a 4-6 week old newborn.  The travel time to this destination is only 3 hours so I don’t have an issue with that so much as the other factors which are: this location is a small beach town and literally every activity on trip advisor etc is the outdoor/active type (aka no museums or indoor tourist spots to go if the weather is too hot), average temps in this area tend to hit 80s/90s during this time and newborns can’t wear sunscreen or regulate body temperature as well as adults can so there is a very good chance one of us will be stuck in the house with the baby and not able to join the group for long periods of time, if the baby is colicky (fingers crossed this is not the case) I don’t want the added stress of taking a trip with minimal sleep, and the birth will likely be a c-section so depending on healing I may not be able/cleared to swim yet.

I (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn’t feel very motivated because I’m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I’m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs & empty the dishwasher. He was in a game & said yeah yeah.

No sign of him and an hour later my wife said she’d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she’d get me to cut the wifi if he didn’t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn’t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can’t quit without risking a stand down for several days).

When I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable & put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this & that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back & so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.

He was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge & got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can’t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD & Aspergers so can’t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) & stormed downstairs.

Ten minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over & over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.

Wife calmed things down & later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn’t exchanged words.

Anyway, so just over two weeks ago we were out for a birthday dinner for my younger brother; it was him, my girlfriend, my mother, grandmother and  me. 

We were sitting there, all was going well. Suddenly, out of nowhere, my mother starts talking about how Muslims shouldn’t be able to live here (Australia). My girlfriend gets upset by this, as she is very sensitive on the topic of equality, excuses herself and gets up and steps outside. 

I however, remaining at the table decide that I should speak up against her. I said “can you please not make such racist remarks in public please?” She argues that it isn’t racism, and that her points are “all true.” 

I tried not to escalate things much further, so I simply said “can it just wait until we get home?” But she kept insisting on trying to convince me it wasn’t racist, and that if my girlfriend has a problem with it, that’s her concern. This annoyed me. I said “don’t imply that I can’t think for myself, this DOES upset me.” 

Anyway, I got up and said I’m leaving, and everyone else followed. 

When we got home, My grandmother swung around and said “Majora46’s girlfriend, don’t you ever leave the table! That was very rude. I don’t appreciate being called a racist.” It’s worth noting that nobody actually called her a racist. 

I said “she didn’t do anything wrong,” and my grandmother insisted it was embarrassing that she left, and I said “what’s embarrassing is sitting with people making a bunch of racist remarks in public.” 

My grandmother said to me “don’t you ever come to my house again, don’t ask me for anything ever again,” and I just said “alright fine, I won’t.” 

When I came back, I apologised to my grandmother, but she continued being hostile, as did my mother. I refused to apologise to the latter, because I don’t feel as if I have done anything wrong to her. She then complained about us (my girlfriend and I) laying around the house not doing anything, but that isn’t true.


I started to get worked up at this point. I felt as if I were being attacked for standing up against racism. My girlfriend pulled me back to the room saying I needed some space to relax, but my mother kept coming at me. She said I’m talking to him.” my girlfriend replied “he needs some time to calm down” but my mother started screaming in her face, and things kind of died down a bit after that

When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn’t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I’m gay. She asked me and I told her that I’m actually straight. Well since then she’s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I’m not watching gay porn. Well it’s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she’d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old.

674,Not the A-hole,"So for context, I am a white female, my boyfriend is a black male. Whenever I say something he thinks is silly or doesn’t make sense to him, he says “N###a what?!” to me. Almost every time, I say please don’t call me that. It seems condescending when he says it in that tone. It’s hard to explain his tone online, but to me, it seems like he’s talking down to me. The way he says it sounds like he is talking to a crazy person or a child. Today, we were having a conversation about something serious, and he said it. It was over something I had said that he disagreed with, he responded with  “N###a what?”I told him not to call me that anymore, because I’m his girlfriend and I don’t like it. He said it’s his vocabulary and he’s not changing it, and I’m just on my period. I told him that I’m being rational, that I’m his girlfriend and he can call me something else. He said only white people think of the word as a negative thing, and I said no, it’s not about race it’s about the way you say it. To me it has nothing to do with the actual word, it’s just the tone of voice he has when he says it. I feel like he’s talking to me like a child. Am I being too sensitive? I got angry at him because he said I was just on my period. He refuses to stop calling me that, he says it’s just part of how he talks.

677,Not the A-hole,"So I work at a restaurant 6 days out of the week. I work so much because I'm the only person who can host in the morning, and expo on Friday and Saturday nights so that leaves Sunday as my only day off every week. When I first started working there I only worked 3-4 days a week, but as they got short of staff they told me they needed me to start working on my days off or I would loose all my shifts, so I did. At first I was still getting 2 days off a week so it wasn't too bad but I've been working 6 days a week for months now and there is no end in sight. I miss out on a lot of things because of this but being a good employee is important to me so I try not to let it bother me too much.

As of late however, I have been completely burnt out over this to the point where I am getting depressed and my anxiety is through the roof at all times. I have collage classes, family responsibilities, and a couple personal things that take up a lot of my free time so even on my day off I don't get much time to myself.

One week ago exactly I was at the absolute breaking point so I went in and told one of my managers that I need Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday off from now on for personal reasons. She said that as long as I could pull off the last schedule we had out at the time I could take those days off starting this Monday.

I was at work tonight and I went to thank one of my more asshole-ish managers for allowing me to change my schedule despite the fact that I was the only one who could work certain days. She told me that my other manager had not informed her of this and that the manager who approved it didn't have the authority to make decisions like that. I explained that I needed the days off to her again and told her that if they couldn't give me them off I would understand but I would have to turn my two week notice in.

She told me to email her the schedule I wanted and she would take a look at it, so I did. This upcoming weeks schedule just came out and I am scheduled both Monday and Wednesday so I guess it wasn't approved. Im going in tomorrow at 3 with my notice in hand but I can't help but feel like I'm being unreasonable.

Am I the asshole for even asking for days off that I know they need me on?",17,28,0.91
678,Not the A-hole,"Wednesday I called a local salon to set up an appointment. I asked for a full highlight and cut, and asked how much it would be. She said that both the highlight and cut would be $193 and I set up an appointment for later that day. 

I get to the salon and my stylists sits me down and says, “ok, so I have you scheduled for just a partial highlight, let’s get started!” I correct her and say I scheduled a full highlight and a cut. She says that the receptionist only scheduled me for a partial highlight and if I wanted to get my hair cut as well, I wouldn’t have time for a full highlight. This annoyed me but I smiled and said it was fine since my hair is already pretty light, not a big deal. I then ask the stylist the price (just so I don’t get swindled). She replies she has to go check with the receptionist because she has the price chart. 

She comes back and just starts on my hair without a word, so now I can’t walk out if the price is too high. Ok whatever, I’m sure it’s the same price. Then when she’s almost done putting the product in my hair, she tells me it’s gonna be $223. I say the receptionist told me on the phone that a full highlight and cut was $193. The stylist is NOT happy, responds that my hair took more product than usual because it had been about a year since I’ve highlighted it and when more product is used the prices goes up, but she then says that since I was quoted at $193 she’ll give it to me for $193. I’m happy :)

So I get done with my hair, I love it despite not being able to get the full highlight, and I go up to the receptionist to pay. She hands me a receipt that says $155. I wanted to be honest so I told her that she had quoted me at $193, and I’m pretty sure it’s $193, and I ask her to double check the system. She checks her computer again TWICE, double and triple checked, and she said, “oh I made a mistake earlier, it’s actually $155, how nice!” So I’m pretty stoked, I give a goood tip, and I leave. 

Like 20 min later this receptionist frantically calls me to tell me that she had made yet another mistake, and that it actually was supposed to be $193, and I had to come back and pay the difference or give my credit card number over the phone. I told her that I’m super busy and that I couldn’t give her my card number because I was driving and that I’d call her back. At this point I’m SUPER annoyed. This receptionist scheduled me for the wrong styling, and the salon gave me three different prices! 

I forgot to call them back. They called me again today asking me to come in, and I told them I’d come in later this week, but I’m thinking about just going in and talking to the owner. I asked this girl to check the price TWICE before I paid, I wasn’t trying to swindle them. It was her mistake, and I don’t want to have to go all the way back there for it when I tried to pay the full amount while I was there!And I being an emotional asshole by not wanting to go back and pay?

679,Not the A-hole,"Context: [TL:DR at the bottom]

My boyfriend [19] and I [F18] have been together about a month and a half. We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. 

Now, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. 
I'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. 

Well, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. 

We were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. 

He was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. 

He paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. 

I was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...


Well he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. 

Here's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. 

He promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. 

TL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just ""teenage boy syndrome"" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. 

Am I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?",158,292,0.93

682,Asshole,"I am 21 years old (close to 22) and have been with my boyfriend since we graduated high school. I was extremely sheltered and therefore, expressed my sexuality very early on. My sexual awakening happened at around 11 or 12 years old. Now, I have an incredibly high sex drive, have some kinks, and absolutely love sex. I consider myself pretty sex positive. 

&#x200B;

I, like many women, didn't discover orgasm for a long time. It's not for a lack of trying. I spent my teen years masturbating with just about everything I could get my hands on. I think part of it is my clitoral hood making things difficult. 

&#x200B;

During sex, it's even more difficult. My clit is far from my vagina, making friction with my clit almost impossible in most positions. 

&#x200B;

So, all that being said, I have faked orgasms. I love sex and have never wanted to discourage my partner, I am his first girlfriend, and what started out being a white lie to make (who I thought was just a fuckbuddy) feel happy, has turned into an elephant of a lie to the man I want to spend the rest of my life with. I partially did it, because I have such a higher sex drive than him. I didn't want him to think I don't love having sex with him. When we first started dating he had a lot of insecurities.

&#x200B;

The sex is honestly amazing too, that's what's so hard. I've came a handful of times with him, which is honestly shockingly amazing. I've told him a partial truth, and I think I'm going to come out and say it. I think he's going to be crushed and angry (understandably) I guess I know that I am somewhat the asshole, but to what level? And WIBTA if I kept it to myself for longer?

683,,"Much in the way that TIL has a list of facts most people already know, what I’m suggesting is a list of frequently-posted behaviours that are almost always NTA.

I believe doing this would combat the r/relationships vibe of the subreddit, especially in the new section. 

Examples of frequently-asked posts:
* AITA for cutting off a friend/family member?
* AITA for breaking up with my partner?
* AITA for saying no to someone who asked me out? 

I’m not suggesting the mods ban every post that contains certain behaviours - but posts like those above are always NTA unless the OP was cruel or hostile. I’m suggesting that, unless there’s an *extra* behaviour OP can point to and say “I’m worried that’s where I screwed up”, then the question should be considered a repost that’s already been answered.

I understand posts can already be reported as validation seeking, but I believe having a clear list of common NTA’s would help prevent the mountains of (often validation seeking) reposts. Also, I think having a list would encourage community members to report more validation seekers, as they’d be more clearly identifiable.

I’m very curious to know what other community members think. Is this a good idea? If you disagree, why? What are some commonly repeated topics that you don’t like seeing? 

EDIT: new question - if you’re not keen on this concept, what about instead of using a list as a guide to remove posts, using it as a guide for which posts require more context? Situations vary wildly, yet so many common posts feel low effort and repetitive to me. If you’re wanting to break up with your partner, what part of your behaviour in the scenario makes you *feel* like the asshole? Just a new idea.",76,188,0.79

685,Asshole,"So,my ex and I had what I thought to be an amazing relationship. We technically lived together in our college dorm, and we spent a lot of time together. We were both really happy with each other, and would constantly tell each other what we loved about the other and whatnot. She was a huge part of my life, but was having a hard time with the college environment and eventually left. I also had to take online classes at home for a semester, so we were really far apart.

I thought that we'd be able to do a long distance relationship, and I thought it worked for a while. There weren't really any problems. But overtime we'd talk less and less. There were times where she's disappear for a week without any word, then suddenly come back. She told me she ignored all my messages because she wanted to be alone for a bit. That's perfectly fine, but I'd at least like to know that,so that I don't worry that she'd disappeared for a week. This happened a couple times, then this past Christmas she said I should try to look for another girlfriend.

To this day, I still don't really understand what happened. We had a great time, then suddenly it's all over. I haven't heard anything from her in a few months, she won't reply to me at all. I message her maybe once a week at most. Maybe only just a few times a month. I'd just like to know if I did something wrong, because if I did I'd like to fix it for next time. I also want to know how she's doing, because I know she's going through things, and I just want to make sure she's ok. I've heard absolutely nothing, and I feel bad for bothering her, but I just want to get some answers. So am I doing the wrong thing here? Should I just leave her alone?",37,36,0.84
686,Not the A-hole,"So about 4 months ago my GF and I started to notice a pretty severe black mold problem in our apartment. I live with my girlfriend and 3 other roommates in a 3 bedroom apartment. The problem continued to worsen. The landlord consistently failed to remedy the situation. Finally, we decided enough was enough. I got with all my roommates and we discussed our options. We all came to agreement that everyone wanted out of the lease “at all costs”. 

Luckily, I have a family member that is a lawyer and specializes in property and tenant disputes law. I told my roommates I could contact him and he would help us free of cost. They all agreed this was a great option. 

After contacting my family member, he sent a letter to our landlord. Basically it gave them the legally required time to fix the problem or else our lease would be cancelled after a month from when they received the letter. It also said that it would be best for both parties if they just flat out let us out of the lease. 

After this was explained to me, I went straight to my roommates. My GF and I showed them the letter and asked for their approval. Which they quickly gave us. I told them explicitly there is a chance the lease could end sooner, so look for a place no later than the end of the month. After that my family member sent off the letter. 

A few weeks after this we receive notice the landlord is letting us out of the lease. We need to provide them with the date we will all vacate the apartment. As soon as we heard this we texted our roommates informing them of the situation. My GF and I had found an apartment for the end of the month, as I had informed the others to do as well. We told them we would be moving out at the end of the month and we asked them when  they would like to vacate and end the lease. One roommate then told us it sounded like we had already made a plan and were leaving them “high and dry no matter what”. We then informed her the lease would not end when we left, but instead when they found a new place. In the past we have even offered for them to stay with us at our new place until they can relocate. 
We also told her we would still help clean our part and assist them in moving as much as possible even if we leave first. 

She is currently being distant and somewhat cold to us. We do not want to leave her high and dry in the slightest, but she believes we are. AITA?

tl;dr GF and I gave roommates notice of lease cancellation and told them when to expect to leave. They gave their approval. Lease cancellation comes along weeks later and they say we left them high and dry.

687,Asshole,"20M in an Asian country. I have always dreamt of studying in the University of Cambridge, and this year I got a place to study social and political sciences there. Problem is that my family's finances has taken a hit after my mother lost her job, so paying the >150k USD (over 3 years) of international student fees would be a massive strain on them. It might even mean emptying their retirement fund and taking away resources from my 15F sister. 

I've promised my parents that I won't go to Cambridge if I can't get a full ride government scholarship - then I'd be stuck in a law school in my country at heavily subsidised rates. But the way scholarship interviews are going, the chances of me getting one seems really slim. As far as possible I don't want to put that burden on my family, but at the same time it'd be really fucking stupid for me to give up my dream school and future career prospects just for them. Am I above wrecking my family's finances for my own future? Should I be? I don't know.

When I was 16 my best friend passed away due to leukemia and I was really depressed and down for a while and my mom used to constantly tell me to get over it and what's done is done so I'm kind of desensitized to loss and tend to get over it quickly.

Heres some backstory. My mother seen some bunk bed lifts things on Pinterest and decide she wants one in my room. Now I do have to say my room is very small when standing in the middle of my room I can touch both sides of the walls and only have enough floor space to sit crisscross. Needless to say it’s small. 
When my mother brought op the idea of a bunk bed I tried to indirectly say I didn’t care for it but I knew she was just trying to occupy herself with something because she unemployed and suffers from mental illness. 

So I said
“ you don’t have to worry about all that. It’s gonna be a hassle. I’m fine without it”

I would say this every time she brought up trying to get materials for the bed.

Well she came into my room and threw in a bunch of boards that she got from a friend. I brought up how she doesn’t really have the materials to do it such as something to cut the wood, she was just hoping that she could use some random sized/ type of wood and it would work out. I also said that I didn’t want her to build my bed because she’s never done something like this before and we live in a rental house.

I told him that I was paying rent and the utilities were included with the number (which he just raised by 100 because he just moved to another city for a job and wants to buy another house out there), and he told me these were the rules and ""buy a fucking fan"". That didn't sit well with me.

Being in the computer science program at my uni has helped me meet a ton of different engineers, including one of my best buds who now works as a project planner/construction manager for a hospital. I asked him about the loudest fan he could possibly get me and he really came through with a fan that they use to dry floors which essentially sounds like a small air craft is taking off in my room. I told them that I got the best fan I could find so the AC shouldn't be a problem anymore. So for the past week I have put that fan on full blast while I am working on my stuff and they are starting to tell me that this needs to stop, and I just keep telling them ""It's hot in my room but this fan really does the trick"".

700,Not the A-hole,"I have a fairly long hair. It’s a bit up my waist and it’s also one of the few things I am confident with in my appearance. For the standards of the place where I live, it stands out a lot.

So, every now and then, people talk to me about it and the subject of cutting it always comes up. There’s two scenarios that might happen in this kind of conversation.

The first one is when somebody suggests that, if I ever decided to cut it, I should donate the hair that I’ve cut. That one doesn’t bother me, since it’s implied that I would have wanted to cut my hair in the first place. It’s clever, since it would be kind of a waste to not donate the hair, and I always agree with the person that I would do it in that case.

But the second scenario bothers me A LOT

Sometimes, people will just come to me and say “you should cut it to donate, since it’s so long”. I get uncomfortable in this case because I don’t know what to say. People just straight up tell me what to do with my hair and it makes me feel bad. 

Also, how should I answer that? The person is suggesting for me to do a good act, if I say that I don’t want to, I will look like kind of a selfish person. I just don’t feel comfortable cutting it at the moment and the amount that I cut to maintain it is not enough to donate.

One of these days, somebody said it to me, with really similar words as those I used above. I got upset about it and told them that I didn’t want to because I was not comfortable with it. I also said to them that it was not a nice question to make. They treated me like I was an asshole and I have been thinking about it.

I told her that I loved the dress, but we still weren't sure if we'd be able to make it due to cost. She was very upset, and told us that after all she had done for us, she at least expected us to be there for her.

&#x200B;

After, my husband told me he felt guilty for missing her wedding after she had been so nice to us. Along with the clothes she gave me, she has also given us her old car, and other misc. stuff.

&#x200B;

We decided to sit down and crunched the numbers again since I just got a raise at work. If we put a little bit aside each month, and pull some money from our saving, we should be able to afford it.

&#x200B;

I’m still nervous though. If we have any unexpected expenses, we’d be in trouble. And let’s be honest, if something goes wrong it’s going to be when we are broke.

&#x200B;

So, AITA for still not wanting to go to the wedding after everything she's done for us? I feel like a total piece of garbage.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you everyone for your comments. 

A few people suggested that I sell some of the clothes. I think that's a great idea! 

I spent the night sorting through, and came up with a pile of things to sell. I did some research and if I sell everything for half of its retail value, I can make over $2,000. 

SIL is moving to a city 8 hours away, so she won't notice if I sell some of the clothes. 

Thanks to you guys, it looks like we will be able to go after all ❤",125,390,0.97

704,Not the A-hole,"So, my brother (Sean) has a long-term partner (Melissa). I see them regularly as I still live at home for university.

On 3 separate occasions, she stole from me. In my own home. She stole some makeup from me, then $30, then $40. This was about 1-2 years ago, and I know it was her; I'm not proud of it and am aware it was a terrible thing to do, but I looked through her makeup bag and found the concealer. As for the money, she was the only one home between the times of me seeing it in my wallet and seeing it gone.

At the $40 point, I was done. I texted Melissa something along the lines of, ""hey, a bunch of my money went missing. If you happen to know anything about this, please lemme know! If not, ignore this, sorry. Trying to figure this out.""

I never got a response, but what did happen is that Sean came flying over to my place. Rather than talking, he ended up physically assaulting me which landed me in the ER for a night.

As we were waiting to talk to the doctor, my mom straight up asked me not to tell them what really happened, and when I did anyway, she interjected that it was “just a sibling spat.” She also asked me not to call the cops.

I never got an apology from Sean or Melissa. My mom has apologized for not being on my side, but I think her prior actions clearly showed me where her loyalties lie (even if unconsciously).

I put my anger aside for the civility of the family. I've made it seem like I'm not upset with them anymore and that it's all water under the bridge, but in reality, I'm still boiling. My mom knows, which hurts her a lot, but the two of us have actually formed a pretty good relationship since the incidents (she *apologized*. Nobody else has, and I can understand why she rode the line between us).

As I said, I'm still mad and, quite frankly, I don't care enough to work it out at this point. That may make me the A too, but I feel like if it wasn't spoken of or worked out at the time, there's no point in doing it now, years later. And I just don't care.

Here I should specify: I would never cut my parents out. But, I'm afraid in that cutting out Sean and Melissa, mom'll willingly cut herself out of my life as well, seeing our relationship as ruined beyond repair even if she wants to keep it. She'll see me as immature again, and I don't know what that'll do to us, and whatever she chooses to do, my dad will follow and do too without question. But I literally don't give a single shit about Melissa, and it's bordering on being the same for Sean by extension and because of his actions, and I really just want them gone from my life.

Once I've moved out after school ends, I don't need to be around them. I don't need to be civil. I can forget they existed, and it would be easy (but it would really hurt and blindside my parents). If I did so, WIB a petty A?",59,284,0.95
705,Not the A-hole,"For the past 2 months, my boyfriend (29M) of 4 years has been obsessed with the idea of opening up a cafe. That's all well and good -- it's his dream and who am I to stand in the way of it. The problem though is that he wants me to put in almost all of my savings and take out a loan to make it work because his credit score is shit, he has no savings, and I can just ""borrow from family anyway to save on interest"". 

With that in mind, I started asking for details. I don't think it's going to work. Why? Because he's dead set on this location that has 3 other cafes in a 0.5 mile radius (selling the exact same thing), plus, there's no concrete plan other than ""trust me I know what I'm doing"". Told him all that on Tuesday and it escalated into how I (28F) shouldn't have wasted money going back to university because ""no one will hire a 30 year old fresh graduate anyway"", and that if I hadn't gone I could've invested in our future instead. 

A mutual friend of ours also thinks that I'm in the wrong and being selfish in choosing what I chose so that's great. Our relationship is hanging by a thread atm since we haven't spoken since that conversation despite living under the same roof.

706,Not the A-hole,"So, I've been having this problem for a while now with my roommate. But basically, his girlfriend makes ridiculously loud moans and screams during sex late into the night on weekdays that keeps me awake.

I've asked him numerous times to just have his gf not do that since it is something he can control and me and my gf are quiet when it's late on a weeknight out of common courtesy.

Well, it didn't stop. 

Anyway, since I'm at my wit's end for him not respecting my wishes, I've decided that whenever it happens to make grotesque, gargoyle noises beneath them and scream it out of my window until I kill their mood as a way to put a stop to it.

The noises are kind of, like, SKREEEEEEEOOOOOOOASH! SKREEEEASCCHHHHH! followed by snorts and the like.

So far, it has proven about 50% effective, and he is asking me what I'm doing downstairs. I brush it off like it's no big deal and I really don't know what he's talking about, citing it's probably my other roommates playing video games. His audibly loud gf (amazingly) seems able to stop her moaning and screaming during sex whenever the first floor Gargoyle rears its ugly head.

AITA for making gargoyle noises to ruin my roommate's mood with his gf because he won't respect my wishes to not have audibly loud sex in the middle of the night on weekdays?

708,Not the A-hole,"My high school had a yearly trip to a summer camp type of place just before the start of the school year. Big hills, cabins with shitty AC, and rickety-ass bunk beds that take a fucking gymnast to climb to the top.

Our cabin's group slogged all the way up to the top of the hill, where our cabin was. One girl (call her A) was overweight to the point where climbing up to the top bunk was dangerous, so we made sure that she got a bottom bunk. I also managed to get a bottom bunk, being a senior (this will be important later). So, our chaperone (not a teacher, a lady we'll call Mrs. C) wasn't there. I asked a teacher, and she said that Mrs. C would be arriving later. Okay, whatever. We left our stuff around the bunks and went and did summer camp things.

When we got back, everyone was dead tired. I was ready to pass out on my ultra-convenient bottom bunk, when we find that A's stuff was in a corner, and Mrs. C's things were on her bed, and Mrs. C still was not in sight. A was not going to confront her about it, so I gave A my bunk and resigned myself to climbing up Mount Fucking Everest just to sleep. 

When Mrs. C returned, I told her what had happened, and as politely as I could, pointed out that it would have been more polite to wait for everyone to return before moving someone else's things and staking a claim on a bed. 

She told me to watch my tone, and that she deserved a bunk because she was the chaperone.

So I shut up, and let things go, but ranted about it at home and to some trusted friends.

Tl;Dr A chaperone kicked a girl who couldn't climb out of a bottom bunk, and when I asked her to be more considerate she shut me down. Am I the asshole?

709,Not the A-hole,"I found out I was pregnant the same day my step sons mum confirmed she was pregnant. This seemed to really worry my partner about his son having so much change in both households. 

When we first found out his immediate reaction was “well, we know what to do because we aren’t ready”  and I burst into tears. When I met my partner he said he fell in love with me because I was just born to be a mother and I felt the same. His son was my best friend. I have helped raise him since he was 6 months old and he is now turning 6. 

When I calmed down I reminded him how much I wanted to be a mother, and that I understood the circumstances weren’t perfect but that I never really thought they would be. He didn’t take to this well and ignored me, but stood firm On terminating because; 1) step sons mum being pregnant. 2) “I’m not ready”. 3) less than perfect financial situation (I receive a disability pension and he runs his own business(when he wants))

I completely understood reason 1, because we spent the last 4 years in court fighting for the 50% custody we have of his son now. The ex wife of my partner has severe mental issues and used her son as a pawn to make my partner suffer. 

What I didn’t understand was, could you be “not ready” after you’ve had your first child? Why I also struggled to understand this is, my partner is a great dad but he’s struggling at the moment with being motivated so I do a lot even though I have multiple chronic illness’s. I look after the house, his son, and the business book work. So when I imagined having a child, I felt I’d be doing most of it on my own, another issue entirely obviously; but I just want to be a mother so that didn’t really bother me (at the time). 

We went through with a medical termination in week 5 of my pregnancy. Immediately I told my partner how much I felt deep regret for our decision. To my shock he said “me too, I didn’t think you’d actually go through with it, but it’s probably for the best”.Over the next few weeks/months I continually discussed how broken I felt given the situation. At one point I stayed with my dad for 1 night for some support (and because my partner was acting very unsupportive). My partner told his mum I had a miscarriage and had been feeling depressed. She didn’t know the truth about anything. 

Since this has happened my partner has been researching guns, and has asked he put money aside to purchase a gun safe, guns, equipment as well as club membership and weekly club visits etc so he can shoot. I discussed how unfair this was in my opinion. We just had a car break down, he said we couldn’t afford a child, I have specialists I need to see. Anyway. Well, he’s paid for his gun license. He’s going ahead with it. I’m really struggling with this and feel I need to leave. Am I the asshole for feeling this way?",46,103,0.93
710,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because some coworkers browse reddit. I had a new coworker who started and I was his ""work buddy"". He was mid-thirties and came from another similar company. I was supposed to share a cubicle with him, show him around, take him to a welcome lunch, answer questions, etc.

&#x200B;

Within the first two hours of meeting him, he commented nearly half a dozen times on my race (I'm tan and half-Asian)... at how I must be smart and good at my engineering job. To clarify, 1) he's not Asian and 2) despite most of my company being  white, I don't recall a single other person ever commenting on my race.

&#x200B;

TBH, I wasn't all that offended (more of a sad cringe) and he seemed to have an odd sense of humor. He kept reminding me he was Jewish by saying things like ""we're a couple of the smart guys. Y'know. You because you're Asian and me because I'm Jewish and good with money"".

&#x200B;

I ultimately decided I didn't want to share a cubicle with him since his comments rubbed me the wrong way. Most corporate policies require that you go directly to HR (versus causing scenes in the office) so that's what I did. Two weeks later he's been let go for ""inappropriate behavior towards fellow employees"".

712,No A-holes here,"My wife has a horrible habit of talking during shows. Most of the time she comes in halfway through whatever it is and immediately starts asking to be debriefed on the entire half she missed, then asks follow-up questions about details you have to piece together through watching. Other times we'll watch things together, and every 30 seconds she'll go into what I like to call review mode, where she explains at length her opinions on what happened in those past 30 seconds and talks over the program which makes it absolutely impossible for me to follow. 

I've brought this up gently multiple times including offering to pause and catch her up on things or discuss it during commercials, telling her I'd love to talk about it more in depth after the program ends and she says sure but immediately starts talking again. Over the course of our marriage it's started to wear on my nerves to the point where when I sleep I dream of mini versions of her circling my head saying ""so what's happening now?"" over and over. I find myself getting a bit shorter with her and saying ""shh"" or ""let's listen to the show"" more often. 

The other day we were watching Interstellar. It's a movie where the experience is really important. We came to an important part in the film, the mood was great and I was totally immersed and at outdoor volume she started talking over the movie about what was going on and how she'd feel if she were the characters. Went on uninterrupted for a good minute which completely ruined an important scene.

I was so frustrated I just paused the movie. She asked what I was doing and I told her I don't find it enjoyable to watch things together anymore. She got upset and asked why and I told her that I've been asking her for years to stop talking during programs yet she keeps doing it, and it ruins the experience for me. She said that talking was how she enjoyed the movies, and that she liked being able to talk to me during the shows to spend time together and that asking questions was part of the experience for her. I countered that it felt like she didn't care about my experience at all, and that there were other ways to talk about the programs that didn't interrupt them and even quick comments would be better.

She's been really down since last night and I caught her watching one of our shows alone and crying. I sat with her and she said she just felt really bad that she ruined my experience. We're looking at compromises now but I feel like a fucking asshole. I never meant to upset her or make her feel guilty, I just wanted her to see my frustration.

713,Asshole,"My older sister, Jane, was recently arrested and charged with fraud. We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.

This is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.

I know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's ""guilty of a lot of things.""

Last night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.

Amy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.

Of course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.

714,Not the A-hole,"I’m almost 28 and after some surgery I got addicted to prescription painkillers like oxy and Percocet. 

I eventually graduated to heroin and got clean when I was 26 but relapsed after only a couple months. At the time I was more or less homeless but me and this other guy “Jack” squatted together in this abandoned building for a little while. We looked out for each other and we always had Naloxone on us in case we needed it because the local needle exchange would give it out to known users in the city. 

I ended up overdosing after my relapse because I over estimated how much I could actually handle at that point and luckily Jack came back at the right moment and saved my life. 

After this, I have been fully clean for a little bit over a year now. I haven’t seen or heard from Jack for a really long time, I’ve moved into my own decent apartment, I have a decent job and I have always just assumed that he was dead by now. 

Well we live in a medium to smaller sized city so I guess I shouldn’t be too surprised that I would run into people I knew eventually. 

I was out going to my bank, which is in a sketchier part of the city, and I hear somebody call out my name. I turn around and it’s Jack. 

I can immediately tell that he’s super strung out and he goes, “Wow look at you. Guess you finally managed to get better.” 

I’m feeling nervous as fuck because I don’t trust strung out junkies because I was that strung out junkie not too long ago. 

He tells me that he has been trying to get sober for the past year but nothing has been working out. Then, as I expected, he asks me for help. He asks me if he can crash at my place or if I can help him out with some money to go to a rehab since he says that I now look like, “I can spare it.” 

I had nor do I have any desire to let an actively using heroin addict stay at my apartment. And I don’t want to give him money because I know for a fact that shit will not go to a rehab. 

I tell him that I don’t think I can do that for him but I wish him luck.

He says I’m a “fucking asshole” and that I’d be dead if it “wasn’t for him”. To be fair, he is right. I would’ve died without him. He then just spits at my feet and walks off. I left feeling pretty shook up. 

I thought at the time that I was making the right decision but I don’t know anymore. He did save my life and I could very well be in his position or dead instead of where I am right now. But I also don’t think I am ready to be around people like that at this point in my recovery. I’ve lost all of my family, who want nothing to do with me and my only friend left helped me get clean and I don’t want to drag him back into this world so I don’t have a lot of people to talk to about this besides my sponsor. 

AITA for refusing to help Jack? He saved my life but I don’t know what I can really do for him.

724,Asshole,"First time poster. When my (26F) boyfriend (24M) and I first met (before we started dating) I knew he was a smoker. My biggest line in the sand with dating was always ""I will never date a smoker"". Well, wouldn't I be damned that I fell in love with that guy. When we started dating I made it really well known that this is a big deal for me and that I wouldn't be able to continue with it. 

I am a singer (professional opera singer) and an asthmatic. I also find smoking to be just the grossest thing ever, it is just a complete turn off. To add insult to injury, not only is he smoking cigarettes, he also mixes cigarettes and pot together (smoking batch). And if anyone knows about that is smells even worse. He smokes a lot of pot. I don't even have huge issues with it, but he's outside multiple times a day smoking and is spending a lot of money on it. 

He comes inside and even when he brushes his teeth I can still smell it coming from his lungs and I can't help myself, I start coughing.

I understand it's a habitual addiction mixed with a physical addiction. He tried going on stop smoking aids but it doesn't stop the pot smoking. My therapist (who I was seeing for another issue) says that making peoples with addictions feel shame only makes their addictions worse. Every time I try to bring it up nicely he just gets all upset and calls himself a failure and does nothing about it. People say that quitting smoking is a ridiculously hard thing to do and that I am asking him too much, but in reality I think my health and my needs matter too, and I'm not blowing away my money and health.

725,No A-holes here,"I really need some perspective here, because this is causing a huge problem in my relationship.

I have a friend that I used to be best friends with in elementary school. About 4 months ago (when I was single) we found each other on Tinder and decided to hang out and catch up. We had a really great conversation for about 3 hours in a public place. Afterwards, he kissed me, and things escalated to another sexual activity - though not outright sex. After that we decided to keep in touch as friends, and haven't spoken since. 

Fast forward to today. I'm in a new relationship, and he knows about my sexual history. My friend texted me and told me he'd be coming to my city and asked if I wanted to get coffee. He even expressly said that sexual stuff wasn't necessary (which may sound weird, but we had left the possibility open the last time we talked 4 months ago). I told him I was seeing someone now, so sex stuff was definitely off the table. He was very supportive, but still wanted to meet up because we're friends. 

My new partner thinks it's absolutely unacceptable that I would consider meeting up with this friend, and he doesn't see why I would find value in maintaining a relationship with said friend. He says that no girl would consider staying friends with someone who would be open to the possibility of having sex with them. He's basically saying that nobody should ever be friends with people that would fuck them if both parties were consenting. Again, his point is that the only people you should be friends with are people who would never conceivably fuck you under any given circumstances. From my perspective, I really liked connecting with someone from my childhood, and the sexual stuff was more of just an impulsive afterthought that I would never do when I was in a committed relationship. I understand his concern, but I want him to trust that I would not behave unethically, especially since I've been completely open with him and have not tried to hide anything. 

Please let me know what you think. AITA here?

727,No A-holes here,"So, the background.

I have been with my girlfirend for almost 5 years now, and every year we always go to her families home to celebrate big events ( New Years, Name-day, our country version of chrimas ect). Often this involves her parents and her little sister.

This year she had been through alot of stuff in a short space of time (Car accident where she broke her wrist, insurance issues and suing other party for injury). as a result of her broken wrist, she could not do her job effectively enough, so she was not to go there  for  5 weeks. so she has worries about keeping her job too.

With a week left to healing was complete, we planned to go to her parents house again for holiday celebration. But I was away at work the week before this, and said I would catch up and appear a few days later than normal (but before holiday main day happen). 

But I got ill, I had a sniffle and a temperature, normal cold stuff, so I just gave a heads up to her that I might not be 100% when I get there, but I was still coming (was finishing packing my clothes, it was only a 2 hour drive).

She texted back saying she was sorry I was ill, and that it must suck, but said don't come over for holiday, because she did not want to get ill and maybe miss time off work more. and also later mentioned maybe not getting her parents ill, who are in their late 50s (But it felt like excuse, as it came many texts after the 'I dont want to be ill' text). and her little sister always came over every year ill with cold and others got ill from her. so that is good, but not me? 

So I was short in my text reply and said 'Have a fun  holiday', and she said we should talk later, but I did not want to because I felt hurt and rejected in family time holiday, so I did not speak to her yet, and she is back tomorrow (after gone a week).

She said it was understandable, I am still hurt and thought she was freaking out too much and was selfish.

728,Asshole,"For reference we have been dating for almost 6 months now and everything is amazing about the relationship except this one issue. She won't tell her family we are together. Her family is very religious and she follows the religions beliefs, but very very loosely. She refuses to tell her family about the fact that we are dating because she is very worried that her family will kick her out if the house and that her church will kick her out as well. 

Those are very valid concerns and I understand them, however I have offered reasonable accommodation for if those things happen. For instance, I have my own house and I have told her I would like for her to move in with me, she can even bring her dog too, I have no issue with it. If she is kicked out of her church I told her I will help her find another church to worship at. She still will not tell them and it's beginning to impact my self-esteem immensely. 

Her parents know that something is going on because several nights a week she will stay at my place and won't go home. She tells them she is staying with her best friend who is about to move to another country for a PHD program. The excuse can only last for so long as the friend moves in April. I've been thinking she needs to come clean and tell them so that I don't lose the respect of her parents entirely. 

Over the last few weeks I have been pushing the envelope a little bit so to speak and have been asking her when/if she is going to tell her family so that we can take the next step in the relationship (moving in together). Her response is that I'm pressuring her too much and I'm making her feel shitty because I'm ""putting her on a timeline"". So I guess the real question is... AITA? 

EDIT: For those asking, she is 21 and I am 27, both done with school. There is nothing in her religion that says anything about not being with someone who isn't part of the religion. Furthermore, both her older siblings have SO's and told their parents they were dating from the start, parents were totally fine with it.

EDIT 2: For those saying I'm forcing her to choose family or me, I've never laid that ultimatum down. I've simply asked if she is going to and if she has a plan to do so. I've never said I would leave if she doesn't and I've never said it's them or me. 

EDIT 3: For clarification; she has been in other relationships before me and has always told her parents about it right away, they were fine with all of them unconditionally. This is partially why I don't understand why telling them about me is such a big deal.",44,37,0.89

No, he wasn't a past boyfriend, or anything like that. The man's name I have inked on me was a mentor of sorts and our relationship was strictly platonic. He was more of a father than my own, that was the nature of our relationship. He was a kindly older man who had no children and he helped me get clean. He passed a few years back of a heart attack. As a tribute to him and my recovery, I have his name immortalized on my wrist. I have explained all of this to my fiance and he claimed to understand at the time. ",484,2938,0.96

734,Not the A-hole,"So this happened last week and I’m still bewildered by it. 

We went to the Elton John concert at Madison Square Garden. It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.

We’re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they’re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. 

I was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton’s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. 

Well, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. 

The older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. 

So, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.

It’s an Elton John concert. True, it’s not the kind of music that you’d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn’t we be allowed to?

AITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?

735,Not the A-hole,"5 Months ago a friend of mine, we'll call her Jane, was approached by her husband who had decided that after 3 years of marriage he wanted a poly relationship. She refused and multiple fights ensued. Jane reached out to a married pair of mutual friends to see if she could move in with them. They didn't have room for her, they were staying in a 1 bedroom loft apartment. They then reached out to my wife and I to see if she could stay with us, since we had a guest room.

&#x200B;

We agreed and she moves in with us and our 4 kids. Since she works at a big box store and doesn't make a lot of money, we tell her she can pay rent in helping my wife(SAHM) with the house and kids as well as work towards getting a license and a full time job.

&#x200B;

In December she tells us that she interviewed for a position at a company in phone sales, but was turned down and told to apply for a different position in Jan. We started taking her driving and teach her all we can, however the state has a very particular way to parallel park that I don't know (I learned in a different state) and tell her she needs to have a driving school teach her for like 100 bucks.

&#x200B;

Feb rolls around, the company doesn't post a job opening and I tell her to start applying elsewhere...to this day, I think she's put in 2 applications. I also ask if she's set a date to have her license by, she says ""I haven't but if you want me to I can"", I say it would be good so go ahead and do it. She stops helping as much around the house and starts staying in her room until 30 min to an hour before her shift starts.

&#x200B;

In Feb, we buy a new house and I pay to have all of our stuff, including hers, moved. On closing/moving day we find out that Jane has a doctor's appointment AND has to work, she also hasn't gotten a ride for either. Moving is finished and Jane complains about the room (2nd largest in the house, with her own bathroom). She complains about the movers. She complains about everything.

&#x200B;

In March I tell Jane she needs to get her license by the end of the month. She gets salty but agrees. She tells my wife she has no money, but made the appointment anyway.

&#x200B;

This week is the straw that broke the camel's back. Jane is hooking up with a guy at work (who has a gf), he applies for a 3rd shift manager position. Doesn't have it, just applied. Jane VOLUNTEERS to go to 3rd shift. No consulting her only way to get to work/back. I'm fucking livid.

&#x200B;

I tell my wife I'm done and want her out. My wife says to wait until the end of the month to give her notice and give her a chance to get her license since I told her to get it by the end of march. AITA for being completely done and wanting her out regardless?

&#x200B;

EDIT - Thank you for all of your judgements and advice, I have talked to my wife and we have agreed that we will sit down and talk to her tonight. Starting April 1 we will no longer be taking Jane to and from work, license or not she's on her own. We are then giving her until the end of April to move out.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2 - My wife and I had the talk with her today, she understands that starting April 1 she's on her own for rides and is expected to be out by the end of April. All she had to say was ""Ok"" over and over, then she went to her room to cry. My wife then broke down and cried.",48,160,0.95
736,Asshole,"I (45M) married my wife (45F) 18 years ago. We have to kids, one boy (15M) and one daughter (13F). We're both from UK.

I met her when I was 18 years old. Now this backstory is really important. I come from a working class family and didn't have much, but due to outstanding grades I was able to go to University of Oxford, which for my family was amazing. It was a struggle though, because we didn't have much in terms of money. I considered myself grateful to god to be let in though (even though I believe I earned it). 

That's when I met with my wife. I met her while at Oxford. We met in class and pretty much hit off right away. But I have to say, she was more in to me than I was to her. We began dating shortly after. I wasn't sure whether I 100% was in to her but I did like her a lot. 

She was also...much richer than I. Her family was wealthy and they had connections. They accepted me very quickly so I kept dating her. After finishing at Oxford it didn't take long to find a job, we kept on dating and eventually after some years I popped the question. 

We have kids, and we both have high paying jobs. I'm sure I would have had a high paying job even IF I didn't stay with her, due to the prestige of Oxford, however I have to be honest, the stability her family provided was a major reason why I stayed with her.

I have NEVER told anyone that I've never truly ''loved'' her the way she does me until recently, I told my friend (also 45M) and he said it was pretty fucked up. I reasoned that circumstances were quite different because her stability was a reason for my deciding to be with her, I think you can't entirely remove that aspect. Needless to say, he was shocked.

I have NEVER cheated on my wife ever. I've never been tempted to, but I guess I'm not ''in love'' with her the same way she was me. ",119,124,0.81
737,Not the A-hole,"Here's some backstory.

I've been with my boyfriend for 1 year. I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. 

Now he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. 

Now he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, ""it doesn't hurt if you use lube"", ""pleassee"", ""I promise it won't hurt"" and his favourite, ""But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.

He's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?

EDIT: Thanks to everyone for giving your opinions on this. I've decided I'll be breaking up with him in a few hours. I don't know why I didn't realize he was basically one of the manchildren r/niceguys talks about all the time. He was always very pushy with sex, trying to make me do things I didn't want to do in the bedroom, or just everyday life, I always thought he just had a very high sex drive and that the way he treated me was normal.

I've now realized that wasn't the way people should treat others, and that having a high sex drive is no excuse. If you guys want an update of how the break up went, I'll be happy to make another update.",1460,3764,0.89

741,Everyone Sucks,"Title may sound a little simple but the issue is pretty complicated and I would appreciate some input.

I am a uni student living on campus and about four months ago, after a night out, a few friends and I went back to their accomodation. We were hanging out in their kitchen for a bit and when they said they were going to sleep I excused myself and headed out. On the the way out of the kitchen I saw a bottle of teriyake sauce and I just decided to take it with me for whatever reason.

It sat in my kitchen for a couple days, I didn't use it and didn't really know why I took it but because its only worth a couple pounds I wasn't really bothered about it. Then my mates messaged me telling me that the person whos it was wanted it back and so I went back and gave it to them.

Now four months later I recieve a letter telling me that I bullied this person by taking their sauce and they reported me and I must attend a hearing with the disciplinary committee. Well that was yesterday and whilst I thought I would get a slap on the wrist boy was I wrong....

They called me a thief,  said how would I like it if someone did that to me and even equated it to murder somehow to which I laughed and the police officer ripped into me for not taking the issue seriously. At the end they told me that I would recieve a university and a halls warning which I was blown away by. If I get one more of those it means I'll be kicked out of my accomodation and likely kicked out of uni.

So theres the story, and I was just wondering if ITA? I know I shouldn't have taken the sauce and being drunk isn't an excuse but I did return it and this sort of thing is always happening at uni, people use eachothers food and breaking stuff is a common occurrence. I really think this has been blown massivly out of proportion and don't think that a bottle of sauce should be threatening my place at uni. It means I can't really drink while I'm here because I might do something that I think isn't a big deal and get kicked out.

Edit: To people saying is that all I did, yes its literally just that. I have never met her or talked to her and when I returned it just gave it to my mate. She is meant to be a bit crazy or whatever but I don't really know because I haven't ever talked to her. I have not left out any details, this really is the full, random story.

Edit 2: Thanks for all the feedback guys, I always like it when an AITA has mixed views and its interesting people are divided from this. On reflection I do think its an asshole move from me to take it and Ill try to be careful with drinking and messing around in the future. I also should pay more attention and should have returned it immediately as eventhough my experince is that no-one cares there might still be someone who does. I do also think she is an asshole for not dealing with it in an adult way and reporting me ages later and escalating it when I had messaged her and was willing to converse and apolagise about it. Whilst I do think uni massively overacted, I now understand the position they're in and that they have to act on a report of theft. However I do think they had no right to intimidate me and be agressive during the hearing. I appreciate the feedback and Ill be much more careful in the future :)",115,141,0.93

745,Not the A-hole,"I have a group of pals who I’m not exactly close with, but we hang out together from time to time. Among them is a man who I don’t particularly like because he’s a massive misogynist. He often spouts sexist bullshit like “women are dumber than men, all they care about is shopping, they’re too irrational and full of drama” etc. Because our circle is mainly men, most of the time it just gets laughed off and nobody calls him out except me.

A year ago, he told his wife he didn’t love her anymore. (Unsurprisingly, she didn’t react well.) A few months after he disappeared and we haven’t heard from him in a while. Turns out his wife filed for divorce, kicked him out of their house, and called the police on him and claimed he was trying to rob and assault her when he and a friend went to pick up his things, so he’s now living with a friend and feeling pretty depressed. Someone suggested taking him out for drinks to cheer him up and when I was asked if I would go, I said no thanks. A couple of people called me callous and said that I should have more compassion for him, but I really don’t feel bad? The police call sucked, yeah, but as for the rest... Wouldn’t say it’s exactly karma, more like things happened exactly as he’d expect them to, so he should feel vindicated. I haven’t met his wife but he has always had this toxic view of women, so I wouldn’t be surprised if he knew she was manipulative from the start but thought it was just “her being a woman” and married her anyway. Don’t know if I can blame her much either, living with someone who hates your gender must be taking a serious toll on your mental health, not to mention being told they don’t love you anymore. (Yeah, I know I’m making a lot of assumptions here) I’m not saying what she did was right, but I still can’t feel much compassion for someone who willingly put himself into a bad situation, and who’s a sexist jerk to boot.

In the past my grandparents have always gotten me like a gift card or some money or even some socks and underwear. My mother is a bit more on the fortunate side in terms of money and I usually always get something pretty nice from her. Which she did not dissapoint, cologne and some other things. However this year, I visited my grandparents to which they gave me a tin of dominos and the game yahtzee, my aunt didn't give me anything at all. I wasn't upset but I was almost underwhelmed as while I have played them in the past, it was when I was very young. Haven't played any sort of board game since that point. AITA for being upset about it? I mean I'm usually a very easy going person but they gave me dominos and yahtzee and I really can't figure out why I'm so upset about it. I've always been happy with simple things like socks and such from them even when I was as young as 12 but I don't know why this rubs me the wrong way. AITA for not just appreciating the gift?

Alright so before you get on and yell at me for anything. It's not exactly as harsh as the title might suggested it. So I was dating this guys let's call him John. John and I were an happy couple, I lived everything about him. His personnaility was amazing his physique was a tad feminine but I actually liked it a lot. I was falling in love pretty hard and we never really had a complete relation or sex. We've been together 7 months and he pleasured me but I actually never had the occasion to pleasure him in return. He has told me about 3 months into the relation he had a micropenis and was really shy about this so I didn't really mind doing cuddles and stuff without an actual penetration because I respected him and his insecurities. 

Now, foward to 7 months into our relation (about 2 weeks ago). I talked to him and asked him if I could do anything to make him more comfortable because I care for him and I wanted to show him it's not a problem to me. Which really isn't as I'm bi and I don't have any issues with sizes. He said no and told me in a really rude way that it was none of my business and I should just enjoy what he is giving me. I was really sad and frustrated so I left his place and went to a common friend of our. The friend told me that John made her swear to not say anything but in fact she used to be a girl and is on transition for 6 years now but never did the operation. I felt betrayed and lied too. I was so angry. I slept it off. 

The next day I went back to his place and ask him to tell me the truth. He told me I was stupid and it should not matter. I replied it does matter if it's a lie. He told me I was an asshole and I should just love him the way he his and he shouldn't have to specify he was transgender. 
He clearly soenst see my point and at this point I broke up with him. 

Now everyone seems to think I'm this transphobic asshole who left this poor person and his family are sending me messages almost everyday to remind me how awful I am and how bad I broke his heart.

He was really scared that is leave him if I knew and reacted badly because of that, I explained it was the lie and not the actual transgender thing. We agreed to be friends and I'll be sure to help him out when he will go dating I'll be there for him and we are happy like that. His family is still against me but at this point I don't care.

Couple weeks ago my (Ex) girlfriend came out to me and told be that he was a guy (Gender wise, physically is a girl mentally isn't, and was a girl when i was dating him) . After a few days of deep thinking and a night out with the boys I decided that the best way for me to respect his decision was to break up with him for i am straight and i am a guy and therefore i like girls and he isn't a girl so therefore i'm not attracted to him.  I felt really bad and still do, i made sure to let him know to talk to me if he needed anything and he seemed to understand why i did what i did. But guess who didn't?

The GSA club at my school.

The GSA club at my school has a huge influence on who is hated and who is supported and can quickly ruin one's reputation, soon after i broke up with my gf (IBUWGF) his new GSA friends ( Since he was trans he quickly very much supported by GSA (As he deserves to be)) started to call me Sexest, homophobic, trans-phobic and racist (idk why racist i guess if i was sexist and homophobic why not add in race)  all because i broke up with a newly trans guy.  This made it so most girls at my school wouldn't talk to me and my friends were afraid to be associated with me anymore

Am i the Asshole or are they (GSA)?

She also convinced him to move from his friend's house to a hotel for a while but that cost all his savings and he had to move back, he regrets it so much and I thought it was a bad idea from the start.   

He's out of money for food so I gave him $300 .At first, I'll do anything for him, let him stay in my apartment on the couchm spent all my days off hanging out with him trying to calm him down. After so long... the situation hasn't advanced at all for six months. I've been so stressed and I don't want to do anytihng about it. I only contact him if he seems in crisis, and I gave him money because he can't afford food otherwise, but I don't want to do this indefinitely. I've been so worried, even though my actions have accomplished nothing, it's hard for me to do work. I just want to run away from this whole situation and not think about it. But at this point, if it keeps on like this, I'm giving all my monthly vacation savngs to him, so indefinitely I can't escape this situation.   

So, now what? Am I the asshole? When I try to act the good sibing it feels like nothing is happening since fall, I'm 100x happier when I ignore his situation and all his texts. But if I keep ignoring I don't know what would happen. Please advise.",43,69,0.95
767,Asshole,"Okay, the title makes me sound like a brat but here's the thing: I can't cook. My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.

I was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:

Me: Hey, what's for supper?
Mom: Whatever you can find.
Me: So, nothing?
Mom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.
Me: I can't cook, you never taught me how.
Mom: You're 17, you can figure it out.
Me: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.
Mom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.
Me: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)
Mom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots

This argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.

But anyways, AITA?

EDIT: I should have made it more clear: my mother doesn't trust me in the kitchen. She will not allow me to learn how to cook because she thinks I would fuck it up. She is contridicting her own damn self when she tells me to teach myself. If it where that easy to teach myself than believe me, I would've done it by now. But having your mother screaming at you for stirring the noodles wrong and then taking over instead of helping you is really annoying.

UPDATE/EDIT 2: I turned off notifications to do homework and go to bed. Wow. It's very clear that I am the asshole. And I have to agree. I should not have given my mom attitude. I apologized to her this morning and asked her to at least teach me the basics. She refused. I see now that the only way I'm gonna learn is to do it myself.

770,Asshole,"Grad student here. Our class size is small, so we get to know our classmates well compared to other grad programs. Since we started seven months ago, I've noticed one of our married students (Sally) hanging out a lot with another guy in our class (Jake). Sally's husband (Terry) is back home working, and they've been married for over a year.

&#x200B;

Sally and Jake always sit next to each other in class, walk between classes together, and even hang out just talking when class is over. When they hang out, they talk for about an hour, sometimes more. Their body language when talking is usually flirtatious. For example, Sally will sometimes punch Jake in the arm when laughing, or they'll get super close when showing each other something on their phone. Other times, their conversations appear more serious. I first noticed them hanging out five months ago, and they do this 4-5 times a week. I also saw them on a walk together late at night, and they often go to the lab together outside of class.

&#x200B;

A couple of my close classmates have also noticed their behavior. It became super obvious when Sally and Jake recently practiced one of our clinical skills on each other for two hours during class; everyone else was able to get it done and swap partners after half an hour. We started making inside jokes about them and will take pictures of them together as a way to confirm our theory.

&#x200B;

It's bad enough that I wonder if I should send Terry a message (anonymously) saying that Sally may be emotionally involved with her classmate. It takes a lot of trust to spend months at a time apart from a spouse, and from what I've seen, I believe Sally is violating that trust by spending a lot of time with Jake. If I were Terry, I'd want to know if my spouse may be emotionally involved with someone else. Also, If I were Sally, I wouldn't spend one-on-one time with someone of the opposite sex nearly as much as Sally is.

&#x200B;

AITA if I send Terry an anonymous message with a couple of pictures telling him Sally may be involved in an emotional affair?

772,Not the A-hole,"This post is the result of me trying to be as open-minded as humanly possible and thus far failing. So I'm really just hoping the judgements here will either help me along on that path, or confirm that my initial feelings are correct. 

Anyway: I (f/20) have been dating this guy (m/24) for a little under a month. Obviously I find him very appealing on a lot of levels. One thing to note is that he really enjoys dirty talk during sex (which I don't really mind provided it's not too degrading). Recently, though, he crossed what is to me a major line - he used a racial slur in a very derogatory way. 

I was naturally quite upset, and asked him to explain himself. He said that he'd been in the habit of engaging in race-play with past partners, and so he slipped into it here in the heat of the moment (a defense I've never found compelling, for starters). Now, I'm familiar with race-play as a concept and I'm not eager to shame people who like it. But IMO slipping into it because he's done it with other partners is sort of like calling me some other girl's name during sex... only this time, he's grouping me and said girl together in his mind because we're the same race. That to me is entering fetish territory, which I consider to be semi-racist at best, entirely apart from the fact that he has that slur on speed-dial. 

We've talked this over extensively. He's repeatedly apologized for calling me that without asking first, but he's very offended by the notion that said slip-up might be evidence of some underlying issues that need sorting out. In essence: both of us think the other is an asshole at the moment. If we can't resolve things I honestly can't see the relationship going much further. Measured judgement would be pretty useful here.",25,28,0.89

Last night we both drove down so I could introduce her to my mother.  I was crazy nervous for it to go well.  The plan was to go there introduce them and then all go out to Olive Garden.  

When we got there everything went well until I asked my mom if she was ready to go eat.  She said she had a surprise for me.  She had made my favorite meal for me with plenty of sides and dessert.   There was so much food.  It was really sweet. 

My gf is a little picky about what she eats.  We went to sit down and she just outright says, “I don’t like any of this kind of stuff.  I’m going to Grubhub Olive Garden.  What’s the address here?”

There were so many options and she didn’t even bother to try anything.  My mom didn’t say anything, but knowing her it definitely hurt her feelings.  I was livid on the inside about how rude it was, but didn’t say anything about it.  Gave her the address so she could order and was mostly quiet the rest of the night.  Gf seemed oblivious to how rude it was.  

Since then the most I’ve said to her about it is that she could have at least tried some things and if she really couldn’t stomach it then order delivery.  She just doesn’t get it though.  She says she knows what she likes and shouldn’t have to eat what she doesn’t.  It wouldn’t have killed her to at least try something when my mother obviously worked so hard on everything.  

I’m still mad at her about it.

I don’t think this was some “power move” by my mom.  That’s just not her.  I think some of you have some weird family dynamics that someone cooking all day is some invisible slight to you.  I really think my mom just wanted to give my gf a taste of my childhood.

I was excited not only because i was going to the city but cause i was going with him.

she lives in the city they started dating like 3 months ago. Although I was confused I told him that i was happy for him

It hurts cause he knows that i like him and i didn't even know that she existed until Monday so why are you talking about her so much now.

780,Not the A-hole,"On mobile, standard formatting apology and all that.

A few months ago, my family (mother, stepfather, brother, and stepsister+husband+kids) decided we would take a family vacation to a popular theme park. I do not know stepsister very well (but i do like her and the family) and this is the first vacation we will be taking together. I made it very clear during planning that my family (spouse and child) would not be able to front $500+/night for a special hotel, but that our price point shouldn't stop others from staying at said hotel as we're all going to end up at the same place during the day anyway. We proceeded with some minor planning and i decided it would be best if my family stayed across the street in a cheaper hotel. I made that very clear as well.

As the vacation booking is getting closer, my stepsister and parents have decided they would like everyone to stay at the more expensive hotel because it keeps the family (especially the young kids) in one place, and expensive hotel is where stepsister and family/parents would like to stay. I told them i would love to, but we really can't make that work financially. I was pleaded with a bit, but eventually everyone backed off when i think they realized that no, i wasn't just being ""stingy"".

Yesterday, i received an offer from stepsister that her family would pay the difference so we could stay in the nicer hotel with them to keep the young kids together. The difference is at least $2,500. I nearly shit myself. $2000 is about what we're paying for the entire weeklong trip. I barely know them. I know they are well off, they've bought my child expensive gifts in the past, but certainly didn't expect this. It's clear this is a ""no strings attached, we just want to have you come along"" type of offer. I stammered a very polite ""oh thank you so much, but we couldn't possibly accept"" type of response and left it at that.

This morning i get a call from my mother who says ""stepsister said they offered to pay for you to stay at super expensive hotel and you said no, so now we all have to stay at your poor person hotel so the kids aren't separated"" (paraphrased, but know that is the gist of it and my mother is truly an asshole). I explained i was uncomfortable with accepting that much money from them, and that it shouldn't stop the others from staying in a different hotel. She told me i was ""ruining everyone's vacation"" and that i should be ashamed of myself. Spouse says that if the tables were turned, we would offer them the money as well and not think anything of it, so we should accept. I haven't gotten a chance to see stepsister (I'm seeing her this weekend), but I worry she will be resentful for making them feel like they can't stay in the nice themed hotel because we are not as well off.

781,Not the A-hole,"My MiL, Rose, and I don’t have the best relationship so I want an unbiased perspective on the situation. Hopefully, I can present it as such.

Rose has another granddaughter that is 9 years old. Everyone calls her “chi-chi”, her real name is Amber. When I asked how the nickname came about, I was told that Rose had a dream that she had a granddaughter named chi-chi when her daughter was pregnant. This is before they had her real name picked out.

Rose has dubbed my daughter “Chulie”. At first, I didn’t know if this was a Spanish (my MiL is Cuban) term of endearment or not but later found out it isn’t. I’ve asked her multiple times to stop using the name, especially while she’s still learning her actually name. 

Her defense is that “she responds to it more than she does to her actual name”. This is because she watches her while my wife and I are at work, roughly 8 hours a day. I told her that she’s still learning her name and she would respond to anything she was called by 8 hours a day.

I thought Rose had stopped calling her by the name around July, around my daughters first birthday. However, when family came to visit at Christmas time, I heard it again and threatened to kick them out of my house.

Some points to consider:

-My mom is Vietnamese and calls her youngest grandchild a term of endearment, but not as a replacement for their name.

-my siblings and I all go by nicknames, but ones we gave ourselves in childhood. Not one that was assigned while in the womb.

-this nickname was also chosen prior to my wife and I deciding on a name (not sure if it came to her in a dream this time, though)

I understand that this is something grandmas do, but I’m personally not a fan of the name and don’t want it to stick with our extended family.

782,No A-holes here,"I [26m] have been dating gf [25f] for 4 years now, living together for 2. Generally, our relationship is pretty good - we rarely fight and our life together is fulfilling in all aspects except our sex life. Like most relationships, we started off having sex once a day, but that quickly tapered off. Around the 6 month mark she informed me that she does not enjoy sex that much, and would prefer it to occur around once a week. I would like it to be more frequent than this, but I respected her wishes and I generally initiate once a week. 

However, throughout our relationship she has enjoyed using her vibrators/dildos without me (yes, I have asked to use it on her and she has turned me down) 3-4x a week. I don't have a problem with this necessarily - of I course I wish she was using that energy with me, but I get that sometimes people can be in the mood for masturbating and not sex. I watch porn regularly and she doesn't like it, but hasn't explicitly asked me to stop. 

That leads us to the issue -  recently, I purchased a sex doll for my own use. It has a face, but it is clear that it is not a real human. I enjoy it more because, for me, it feels more real. However, gf freaked out and told me to get rid of it. I feel like this isn't fair to me - I spent a good chunk of money on it and its not exactly returnable, and to me it seems like its basically the same as the toys she uses. After all, she has a dildo and it certainly isn't shaped like my dick.

784,Not the A-hole,"I matched with a guy on a dating app, and we hit it off right away. We had a lot of interesting video chats and about 3 weeks after our first talk we decided to meet up.

Since he was happy to drive during rush hour just to meet me (which could easily double his travel time) I said I would be paying for the entirety of our date. This included tickets for 2 separate events (researched and agreed upon by both of us), and dinner in the evening (restaurant we both liked), which he insisted he would pay for. We also agreed to keeping it very casual.

He travels the 1h40m to make it here, and we meet at a local mall. Immediately I can tell something is off, he's looking half disappointed, half annoyed. After we exchange a ""hello"" hug, next words out of his mouth are ""Just look at all these people walking around, is everyone is making more money than I am? I bet I'm the poorest person here"". 

Things kind of went downhill from there.

In between any casual and familiar conversation we had, there were several comments like: 

* Oh we have the fancy seats? Oh wow, people will look at me and think I'm some kind of rich spoiled guy. *(I could afford ""good"" seats (not insane VIP ones, just good ones) so I went for it)* 

* Oh yea, of course you would be driving a brand new BMW, I don't know what I was expecting. I bet that's the least expensive car in your parking lot *(my car is not brand new, just... clean and scratch-free)* 

* Of course you would need a reservation for this place, I mean, why wouldn't you? Look at this, I'm scared I'd break a glass, and it will cost me a week's rent. I am definitely out-classed here. *(it was just a nice restaurant I would expect to find in any average-sized town)* 

* Your hair is so soft, and you smell so good. What kind of shampoo do you use? -Never mind, I doubt I can afford it. 

...and many, MANY more.

Just picture (if possible) someone having a half desperate, half smug expression, and quite the defeated tone while making them. I either chuckled, remained silent, or changed the subject after each one.

However much I liked hanging out with him, every time he would make a comment like that, I felt incredibly uncomfortable. We had discussed our jobs, and his income is average nationally, somewhat low for his area, which is significantly poorer than mine, mostly because mine is STUPID CRAZY expensive. It is also the home of many well-known companies, and the salaries are highly competitive, if only to compensate for the insane cost of living. For where I live, I make average money at best.

The next day, I messaged him that while I appreciated his company and think he is a great guy, I would not be pursuing another date with him, and wished him all the best.

So, in a way, it is not inaccurate to say I don't want to continue seeing him because of our difference in income, but more specifically t was his comments/behavior when it comes to said difference.

785,Asshole,"This one I'll try to keep short.

So my boss is already an older woman. Runs her own business. I basically assist with administrative stuff. She constantly tells me to do things which I do, but she forgets she told me so I get reprimanded. This has happened many times and I can't do anything about as she doesn't use email or whatsapp or anything (last week she called me out for hiring someone that she had told me to hire, because someone else quit, and many more situations). Only phone calls and one-to-one. It's gotten to the point where I am really frustrated and decided to do only what I was told, nothing more and nothing less.

2 weeks ago she fired a woman and obviously she needs to be paid. Well, when she decided to fire her she told me ""I took care of it and I told the supervisor to tell her she's done"". Usually I let the person in accounting know who left the company and who was hired, but since she told me she took care of it, I understood that she also let that person know of the firing, so I didn't. And I didn't do it out of malice, I just assumed.

It's been two weeks since the woman was fired and if she doesn't get her severance soon she can sue, but since my boss already called me on the phone to reprimand me for not informing of the firing, I don't want to remind her because it's extremely frustrating to be punished for doing what I'm told.

She constantly tells me not to challenge her with anything, as in not to disagree. Like, yesterday during lunch I told her we needed water bottles, and then 3 hours later she called me out... for not telling her we needed them.

I don't recognize the number right away, but on my end there is a conversation to scroll up to from two years ago. Turns out she was someone I matched with on tinder, and chatted and exchanged numbers and made plans with - and she was in contact right up to literally the last minute of the day we had plans, she ghosted me literally as I was getting ready and showering after having come home from work. Not kidding, just a couple hours earlier she was responding and discussing plans.

So not only was I shocked she remembered me, but thought it was bold and ballsy that she messaged me after what she'd done. So I told her that, asked what happened to her. She claimed she didn't remember doing that and apologized at first, then said she ""made some bad choices and ended up in a bad relationship and finally realized her worth and got out"" and also mentioned that it was ""probably when her life was blowing up and her son's dad went to prison and a bunch of stuff"".

So I accepted it and forgave her at first, chatted a bit more - but then we realize that apparently when she contacted me, although she somehow still had me in her phone, she mistook and thought I was someone else she knew with the same name - which explained a lot.

So following that I jog her memory a bit as to who I actually am (I didn't mention tinder before) and bring up highlights of our conversation, once again reiterating what she did. This time she sounded a little less remorseful and apologetic though - ""yeah, sounds about right, I probably did the same thing to other people, life got crazy"".

Eventually I gave a little more detail to help pinpoint who I was until she finally remembered. To which she said ""yeah, so I might have come home then and not bothered cause I was gonna be moving soon"". That's it, no apology, just shamelessly using that as an excuse as if that's normal.

Sure, she doesn't know me and she's just one person and this incident wasn't something that affected me greatly in any way, but I was shocked with her complete sociopathic lack of compassion in her words, how she sees basically anyone she doesn't know as disposable and therefore okay to do that to kind of like the ""#wastehistime201x"" meme a while back. She didn't seem to even understand that what she did was shitty, just kept deflecting it with ""there are bigger things in life"" and ""it's weird to be upset about something so insignificant"". But no, it's not about not being over it, it's the apathetic attitude she has about it.

So, I told her that I guess if she does stuff like that on a regular basis, the stuff that happened to her that she mentioned is probably karma.

I happened to start a new job in January so I have 0 free time for anything now, especially when she lives an hour away and was my baby sitter (but stopped babysitting to plan her wedding) so now I also don't have a babysitter.

So now we're a couple days out from the wedding, there is no real plan, she barely answers my texts to try and figure out what's going on. There isn't even a rehearsal. And she keeps making plans without saying anything to me and then getting irritated when I can't participate because I wasn't given notice. I couldn't attend her bachelorette party because I had to work, told them all that day wouldn't work for me, but it's my fault apparently. 

I'm so over this whole thing. I really don't want to go. I don't want to be a part of it. It's exhausting and stressful and has sent my anxiety through the roof. So would I be the asshole if I told her I didn't want to be part of her wedding 2 days prior? 


Tl;Dr : Friend is having a cluster fuck of a wedding in 2 days and I don't want to be her maid of honor (or even in the wedding at all) anymore.

791,Asshole,"Using a throwaway because a lot rides on how you guys vote. Basically if I ""win"" my husband has to go real estate shopping with me in our city's historic district all weekend long. If he ""wins"" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. 

So last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. 

He didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice ""heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake"" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. 

My side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. 

His side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first.

797,Asshole,"Hi everyone, I’d like some input. 

My wife and I struggle to make ends meet. We strictly budget everything down to the dollar, without a lot of wiggle room. This includes our groceries, which we have a set $ amount we spend, no more. 

Recently our DD dropped the milk and spilled it. It was 5 days to payday and we’d already done our grocery shopping. My wife said she’d figure it out. I know she has a little money stashed for herself that she’s gotten from selling some of her clothes recently, so when she came home with milk and a bag of chips for the kids as a treat, I figured she must have decided to dip into that. Boy was I wrong. 

The next week I noticed our food was a little...higher quality. A couple of brand name things, even a roast on Sunday with asparagus. I figured she must have gotten some killer deals, but when I asked she said “oh no, I found a bunch of money off coupons.” Then she showed a few to me. 

They were those “Earn 0.07$ a gallon” receipts you get at the gas station. She had gone there and dug through the garbage! She said she got about 5$ worth of these receipts the first time when we needed milk, and went back the next week for more, netting about 30$ total. 

I was speechless. I asked her how she could lower herself like that. She replied that she did it for our kids. When I asked why she didn’t use her money she had saved, she said it was hers and she was saving it for something special. 

I’m so disgusted guys. I can’t believe she did this. I don’t even want to look at her. She on the other hand is mad at me, and says I’m an asshole for being mad, and for expecting her to use her saved money instead. AITA for expecting my wife NOT to dumpster dive?

Edit: OK! I am definitely the asshole. After reading all of your comments, I really thought about it. I talked to my wife, and told her I was sorry for the way I acted. She is annoyed but willing to forgive me. I was actually mad at myself. The reason we are struggling is because I was in an accident a few months ago. I slid through a stop light on an icy road. It has permanently affected my ability to work in the trade I’ve worked in for 15 years. I’m on disability through my employer but it isn’t even half of what I used to make. We are getting by, but it is tight. And I don’t know what we are going to do when it runs out. My wife is stretching every dollar (she takes care of the finances). I guess I was just mad at myself because I can’t take care of my family anymore, and lashed out. I’m going to give her a foot rub tonight. Thanks for the honesty guys. ",3571,18171,0.84

The backstory

My wife and I have been married over ten years, two children, two incomes, in our forties, and have a relatively healthy relationship. We communicate pretty well, enduring no significant challenges like cheating, abuse, money problems, except for one: our sex life. Mis-matched libidos is a common issue, especially after children, age, and life comes into play, and that’s totally fair, but If I'm a 9, she's a 2. It's something we've discussed with some difficulty, but openly. I'm still very attracted to her. Oh, there’s no religious influence.

We've been on about a 2/3x a month average for a few years, far less than my ideal, but tolerable. We’ve discussed it, with shallow promises to work together, but no real change. I backfill with porn, which she is fully aware of and has zero issue with. Our last child was born 6 years ago. More context: when we do have sex it is intimate and pleasurable for us both. Reading between the lines: I am a giving partner, ensure she comes, and we aren't pushing any uncomfortable boundaries afaik–I'm not forcing her to do anal or dress up like my mom is what I'm saying. She has two vibrators. Masturbation is part of our intimacy, it's not taboo at all either together or alone. Her private sex life is her business, assuming it's not harmful to our marriage.

Around September the frequency has dropped to 1 or 2 times a month, no obvious external factors would indicate why. At this point my frustration has resulted in my not initiating at all.

Important side note: About a year ago, I went to her nightstand for a phone charger (routine and not inappropriate), and when I put it back a day later, noted one vibrator was in a completely different place. It's purple and hard to miss. This occurred during an extended dry spell and it irked me. I asked her about it, she flatly denied using it, I dropped it and haven't been checking since then. You'll have to trust me on this one.

The main story

Last week while making our bed, close her nightstand drawer and realize the vibrator is missing. We hadn't had sex since early Feb, only twice this year, and hope maybe it's charging (my birthday soon). Nothing. Monday before a trip, I take a picture of the top drawer: no vibrator; and bottom drawer: vibrator.

I came home and checked. Vibrator back in the top drawer, now the one in the bottom drawer is missing. I call her out, without mentioning the photos, and she straight up denies touching them, angrily stating,""If they've moved, someone else moved them,"" goes upstairs, puts both in my top drawer, and leaves for work. Yeah, I'll be headed over to [r/relationship\_advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice) next.

I just sent her four before-and-after pictures without comment. AITA?

tl;dr I took photos of my wife's vibrators and showed her to catch her lying about using them while ignoring our sex life.",603,1261,0.93

I have wanted to get a dog for years, ever since I had to put down my childhood dog. I think it will help with my anxiety and depression issues as well as just be a great addition to my life. With our current apartment we have a fenced in yard and what I think is enough space to add a medium sized dog. I take care of all the animals, since they are mine, and would do the same with the new dog. My boyfriend has had to feed the cats like once or twice mostly when I was out of town but otherwise does nothing for their care. I want to start looking for a dog to rescue and add to my family. He doesn't think we have enough space and doesn't want to live with a dog ""yet"". We're planning to stay in this apartment for a while, so I don't know why the space would be an issue now and not later. I asked what I could do to help him feel ready for a dog and he didn't have an answer. I'm currently working part time and in school full time with most of my classes being online. This means my schedule is flexible and I'm home most days, which seems perfect for introducing a new pup. I feel like he'll never be ""ready"" to live with, not even take care of, a dog and that since he won't have to do anything with the dog it shouldn't be that big of a deal to get one.

Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. 

She feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition.

811,Not the A-hole,"Some years ago I met a girl - Sophia [21F]. We instantly found a lot of common interests and despite living in different cities, we soon became very close friends. Inevitably I fell for her. She didn’t. But after meeting her in person a few times we became fuck buddies on her initiative.

Over a course of a year I found myself devoting a lot of time to her. I remember moments where Sophia would demand I talk to her over the phone, despite being away with family. But everything else was amazing as I never had such a close friend.

We would talk everyday over the phone. Every few months we would meet and have sex. While Sophia was away at home she would have one night stands with other guys.

I felt unrequited love which really hurt me. There would be moments where I wanted to walk away but she would just beg me not to leave her as I was her only friend. And she would shower me with affection and intimacy. This would make the pain go away and I would stay. I really didn't want to lose a friend too. I wanted to simply stop loving her.

This cycle of pain and affection would repeat for years until I became numb to it. In the meantime - she would become more and more depressed and thinking about ending her life. I tried to be there for her but it started getting harder and harder to console her and deal with it as she was against getting any real help.

For the past half a year I really improved my life and met a lovely girl wich whom I started a relationship. Even thou Sophia was supportive of it - soon she became very jealous.

Over a course of a month it spiraled from being needy to threatening ending her life if I would not leave my current girlfriend. Sophia would constantly barrage me with texts and calls. She would say how much she loves me and made a mistake. How she would change and make everything right. She would send me nude photos of her. After saying a hard NO to her - Sophia ended up in a psych ward. She was diagnosed schizotypal personality disorder. After starting new meds and therapy she felt better and decided to work on letting me go and just being friends.

The problem is that Sophia still is very needy and paranoid. Sometimes I catch her trying to manipulate me so I would spend less time with my girlfriend or flat out her telling me she wishes that my relationship fail. I am sick of all this behavior and want to cut contact with her and move on. 

But I feel like an ass for throwing out more than 6 years of friendship and adventures with Sophia over a couple of months of problems. In addition her diagnosis sounds awful. I don't want to push her away for being unwell. For the first time in years she started getting help. Maybe I should just have more patience with her?

812,Not the A-hole,"Long time lurker. First time posting. I'll try not to turn this into a wall of text.

I (F19) have been sort of going over in my head whether or not I should tell my mom about the fact that I like girls. She grew up in a very cult like setting where they were pretty much against anything and everything fun because someone did something in the Bible so don't do it or enjoy hell - they were not Christians, they were something way more fanatic so I'm not coming down on Christians. Anyway, she's said several times in the past that she would wonder where she went wrong or feel like a failure of a parent if I ""turned out gay."" But I knew this wasn't really her talking, but more of that cult talking so I never hated her for saying it.

Anyway, finally decided one afternoon to tell her that a recent outing with a ""friend"" off Bumble was more than that. I teared up, and became a lot more vulnerable than I usually am. I mean, it's a pretty scary situation. I thought she was going to look at me different. But she keeps texting on her phone and says, ""That's fine."" She was a bit more nonchalant about how upset I was than I cared for, but later she said she was trying not to make me nervous by looking at me the whole time so whatever. 

Anyway, something we like to do is go in each other's social media accounts and post something to throw off our friends. So while she was napping, I came up, unlocked her phone, and was about to go on her Facebook when I decided to check out audio recordings. Sometimes, she'll record us when we're reading a bad book or a bad movie to catch all the jokes we make and how much we laugh. So I click it thinking it's one of those until I skip ahead and hear myself crying and coming out to her not one week ago. I immediately wake her up and ask her why she did this. She says because it was, quote, ""a pivotal moment, or whatever."" 

I ask her to delete it. Telling her I was unusually vulnerable than I've ever been. She takes her phone, locks it with a new code, and refuses for no other reason beyond what was said above, saying I was being ridiculous. So now I don't know if I really am being. My friend says I have a right to be angry and that it's a violation of privacy. But I don't know.

I considered telling her that I was already with someone, but I found it kind of fun to relive my days as a single man for a brief period, also, something like this has never happened to me before so it was quite exhilarating. After a couple of minutes she asked to exchange numbers which I did to keep up the illusion. We said goodbye and later that day she texted me, so I replied saying that I was already with someone and that I was sorry for misleading her. I also said she was very pretty, and if I was single I would have asked her out in an attempt not to hurt her feelings. She seemed to find it quite funny and texted back saying I had nothing to worry about, we haven't spoken since.

815,Everyone Sucks,"Hello everyone! I'll be using a throwaway account because I have coworkers that know my regular account.

I work at a local hospital where we have our own staff parking. The gate is opened with a card that we pay for monthly. We also need the card to exit the parking lot. There is no one at the gate, only a speakerphone where you can talk to a security guard when you push a button.

One particular morning, I forgot my card. It is a 30 minutes drive home so there was no way I was going back for it. I just pushed the buzzer and asked the guard if he could let me in anyway. 

At this point, I was totally prepared to being told no. I would have just accepted my faith, parked in the street and walked but I figured it was worth a try!

So anyway, I buzzed for the guard and asked. He was very chill about it and let me in without any problem.

At the end of the day, I get in my car to leave and drive to the gate. I push the buzzer and ask the guard to please open the gate to let me out since I forgot my card. 

He immediatly gets mad at me for forgetting my card. I apologies and tell him I'll be careful next time. He refuses to open the gate, telling me he's not supposed to open if we don't have a card. 

At this point, I think he's confused, thinking I want to get IN the parking lot so I kind of laugh it off, explaining that I'm inside and want to get out. 

He didn't appreciate that at all and tells me that no card is no card, that I need to park my car back inside and go get my card if I want to leave with my car. 

Like I mentioned before, it is a 30 minute drive to get home and I have to go pick up my kids at daycare so I'm getting pretty impatient. I tell him that I completely understand the ""no card"" policy, but that I should have never been let in in the first place and if the other guard made a mistake, it didn't give him any right to restrain my car in the parking lot. 

He still refuses to let me out and asks me over and over to park back and come back with a card. 

At this point I flat out told him I would not move, and that there was about 400 employees getting off work in the next 15 minutes, that we'd talk again then. 

I buzzed him again every minute or so, updating him on how many cars I was blocking until he finally opened the gate.

816,Not the A-hole,"Long story short since I'm on mobile, my girlfriend and I live together and have been together for about 6 months - about 3 months ago she started spending a hell of a lot of time with one of our mutual friends, who happened to be a close friend of mine I've known even before I met her. Being the laid-back and chilled out guy I am I just let it happen and didn't worry about much, until I noticed little 'signs' here and there; mainly her mostly ignoring me and spending almost all her free time at work around him (we work together as well) and hardly ever being at home so she could go out and get high with him and crash the night on his sofa, or so she said, and this went on for at least 2 months. I won't go into the details about what happened then but eventually my suspicions and anxiety got the better of me and I managed to find the chance to go through her phone without her knowing, and found out they had been sexting and having an affair behind my back the entire time, while lying to my face about it and denying it every time I brought it up. She had sent him countless nude photos of herself while constantly bitching about me and how she wanted to break up with me to get with him instead.

It's been a month since that incident and we're working things out now, I've decided to try and move past it since I believe everyone deserves a second chance but I don't know, I guess I need a second opinion from you guys.

Edit: So to clarify to the posters telling me that I should break up with her etc. etc. I had made it crystal clear to her that if she cheats on me again, I will find out and we're done for good. I've always firmly believed that everyone deserves a second chance and while yes she gave me every reason to dump her ass, my principles take precedence. In any case, I can agree with what y'all are telling me; all three of us were pretty much in the wrong. Oh well, t'is all in the past.

Edit 2: For those telling me I should have confronted her about it: I did, and it only ended up in a massive, rather pointless argument where I got nowhere, and that along with the fact that my friend had already denied doing anything with her pushed me to find another way to confirm my burning suspicions.

818,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because reasons.

About a year and a half ago, my parents split under tough circumstances. In short, my dad had an affair and my mom found out. It was really shocking and hard on the whole family, as my dad had always been a really stand-up guy, and they divorced a few months after she discovered what was going on. 

My dad is currently in a relationship with the woman he was having that affair with; they live together, he has a relationship with her (grown) children, the whole nine. Recently, he called and asked if I wanted to come out and visit them - I live in CA and he lives in FL. I told him in no uncertain terms that this was not something I would be interested in, as i did not have any desire to meet or get to know his new girlfriend, and likely never would. This was of course not what he wanted to hear. He seemed really upset by the concept that i would \*never\* want to meet her, and while he was not yelling or being aggressive or anything like that, I knew he was very angry and hurt. 

For reference, I'm an adult (24F), I live on my own and support myself entirely, and while I love my dad and always will, a big part of me is still working through the hurt he caused. I don't necessarily think that the best thing for me to meet this person, and frankly I don't see what the benefit of me doing that would be.

My mother has a very old phone, cannot even watch videos with it and using it really sucks. When I was once helping her transferring photos I mentioned that she can have my phone once I buy a new one and that I am waiting for a specific model that should be released in a few months.

So today I ordered the new phone and told my wife. She then asked if she can have the old one and I told her that I already promised to give it to my mom.

I (f, 32) have been in a relationship with my husband for 7 years, we've known each other for more than 10 years. My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6""). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.

A little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...

My husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at ""80% of goal reached"" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. 

Am I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?

And since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.",154,242,0.93
824,Asshole,"My wife is 22, I am 25 and we have a 1 month old baby girl. 

After giving birth, my wife breastfed our baby for a couple of weeks. She says breastfeeding tires her and she gets discouraged when she doesn’t produce enough milk. I’ve read a lot of sources which says breastfeeding is healthiest for the baby. She knows this too, considering she’s a nurse.

But she says she doesn’t think she can do it. I bought a breast pump but she barely uses it. She wants to formula feed our baby. I don’t think this is a good idea. Our baby is only 1 month old...

I don’t get why she would formula feed when breastfeeding is so much more natural and better for the baby. I’ve bought her lots of foods which are supposed to increase milk production. She HAS milk, but she just says she doesn’t like the action of breastfeeding. It makes her “feel like a cow”. I think thats a bit ridiculous.

She cried yesterday and said she says I’m making her feel like a bad mother. That’s absolutely not my intention. I apologized and said I just wanted our daughter to grow up healthy and strong.

825,Not the A-hole,"  

My co-worker who I am not very close, nor do I like very much found out I was lesbian because he was eavesdropping into a conversation I was having with another also gay, co-worker (A) a friend of mine. Now I don’t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I’m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  

Anyway, this co-worker (who I’ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says “Oh you’re a lesbian?”

I tense for a second but laugh it off. “yeah and what?” 

P looks at me and decides I’m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: 

“Wow you don’t look lesbian!”

Ok?

“Have you dated other guys?”

Nah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn’t for me 

“How do you know you like girls if you haven’t dated guys?”

I dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?

“So, are you out with your parents?”

No. 

Oh, and my favourite: “Maybe your last relationship didn’t work out because you aren’t out? And maybe you like guys?”

He looked at me in the eyes and said that. 

He really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn’t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.

“Well thank you for telling me. I’m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren’t and you’re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.” 

It was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here’s the thing. I don’t care for anyone’s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won’t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. 

“Mate I know you mean well but I really don’t care what you think of my sexuality. I don’t need your acceptance or validation.”

He just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like “well I was just saying jeez you don’t have to be so rude” before leaving the bar me and A were working at. 

After that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise.

826,Not the A-hole,"My extended family is small.

I was close to uncle Dave and aunt Marie when I was a kid and they were ""cool aunt and uncle"". They have two boys, Mike and Tony. Mike is few years younger than me and Tony just turned 18. His birthday party is this Saturday and also a reason why I'm writing here.

As years went on my mental health deteriorated but I don't know how much they know since no one ever bothered to ask me anything. What I do know is they treat me as... As if I'm stupid. Like I don't understand concepts of politics, relationships and ""adulting"" altogether. 

My dad and Dave were raised by narcissistic grandpa Tom that died in late October of 2018. Their mom died back in 2001. Grandpa Tom was abusive asshole. He had a sister that was always treat as ""damaged goods"" by their parents and grandpa was sunniest sun there is. They enabled shithead to achieve his full shitty potential, but I digress.

My parents never treated me and my brother any different. Even if they did it wasn't because of our genders. What I do feel when I'm around my extended family is that same dismissive attitude people have when they view someone as ""less worthy"". 

For example, if I were to come to Tonys birthday party it would be expected from me to help with serving people, doing the dishes, etc. I wouldn't be asked and I would end up being the rude one if I didn't help.

When they ask me something I often get corrected about *my opinions* as if whatever opinion I have is wrong. Sorry that I don't hate LGBTQ+ community, my bad. Sorry that my own divorce isn't good enough proof that I know what steps needs to be taken in order to get divorced.

Mike and Tony picked up same behaviour and I don't feel like part of family at all. Just annoyance that comes with my parents.

In early December I had my birthday. Birthdays are important to me.

What ended up being dot on the ""i"" was when uncle Dave called 17 days later to wish me happy birthday with some bullshit excuse. Few days prior he sent me pics of grandpa's dog that he adopted so it's not like we weren't in contact. You may ask ""who does that""? Well, someone who will remember my brothers birthday is coming up (late December) and that they skipped mine. Upsie.

I'm just done. They have a lot on their plate but so do my parents who ask about Mike and Tony, then remember what they were told and follow up with situations. Not because they have to but because they are honestly interested in their well being.

I will not attend Tonys party, I haven't sent him a birthday wish.


My parents and my brother know who I truly am and they know I have more to bring to the table then just ""help in the kitchen"" and be quite around other guests.

And she got quite offended, like I was attacking her culture. She said that her friends and most people in Korea didn't really like talking about stuff like this and that it was a heavy subject.

832,Not the A-hole,"My friend (let's call her Chanel) and I were having a drink yesterday. Our conversation eventually went into the sexy department. It was casual as usual. But at a certain point something clicked. You see my friend has her own apartment, and she has a full time job, and a few extra income, so she has no issue with living space, and she works from home, a few days in the week. She can't concentrate at her own house, which I find odd. so our friend (Elf, that's her name yes.) sometimes borrows her small studio apartment to Chanel, when she is on vacation, or is visiting her parents, so Chanel can work in peace.

Issue that clicked in my head is as follow, our friend Elf is on vacation for about two weeks. So Chanel is crashing there. Elf is kind of a clean freak, she doesn't mind a little mess, but you better use a damn coaster, and you better clean after yourself, and take your damn shoes off in her house. I asked Chanel what she exactly did for the past two weeks. She proceeds to tell me that she basically lived in Chanel's house for two weeks, despite having her own house. She then proceeds to layout that she had sex multiple time, sometimes for multiple days. At that moment something seemed odd, So I asked her if she slept with these guys in her own house, cause it would seems like a drag to hop to your house, and our friends house. She told me reluctantly that she did it in our friend Elf studio apartment, for the last two weeks.

Now I know a 100% our friend would flip the fuck out, if she heard this. Years ago a former friend of ours brought a random girl to her house, without us knowing, the guy sat the girl down on my friends bed put a blanket on their lower half and started having foreplay together in secret, we didn't notice for the first 5 minutes. Elf eventually noticed weird movements under the blanket. When she noticed what the movements meant she flipped the fuck out, and told them to leave and never show their face to her again, she never made contact with him again. I told my friend that what she did was inconsiderate, despite having her own apartment she used her friends to fuck random strangers in it (she is not that much into cleaning btw) and due to her actions she could ruin her friendship with Elf. She told me I was tripping, and she thought I would be cool about it. Chanel then proceeds to tell me that ""It wouldn't be a problem if Elf never knew, so be quiet about it."" now she made me part of damn issue too.

I'm meeting with Elf tomorrow since she just came back from her vacation. on one hand I want to tell her, on the other hand, I don't really like being a snitch, but in this case I feel morally wrong about it. AITA if I tell my friend Elf about it? or should I keep it on the down low?",18,51,0.9
833,Not the A-hole,"First post, and on mobile, so sorry about that! Also this story is long, but I'll try to keep it short.

To sum up the 'special Ed"" part, this guy's been in special education class for most of his life and was put into normal classes only recently. He has trouble controlling his anger and doesn't always understand the flow of conversation, meaning that he sometimes cut people off, regardless of whether they were talking to him or not. He also says things that are very private or embarrassing to others and thinks it's funny. I find it annoying, but I know he can't control it.

I had a boyfriend at the time, and I told him so. Despite this, he proceeded to ask me out. I played it off as a joke and rejected him as softly as possible. He didn't take it very well and was pissed. I tried not to think much of it for the rest of the day.

I later broke up with my boyfriend for reasons that could probably be given its own post. As soon as this guy hears about it (same day) he asks me to homecoming. I tell him no, this time explaining that I just wasn't ready for a relationship and that I didn't want one. Didn't take that well either and started to cry. One of the staff had to take him because he wouldn't get up when the bell rang.

About 2 weeks later he asked me out a third time, and I was so done with it. I exploded on him, telling him to stop asking me and that I would never date him. It was so mean and harsh, I know, and I feel bad looking back on it. He was furious and left.

He still tries to talk to me and once started to ask, but I stopped him and left.

Was I too harsh? Should I have given him a chance?

AITA?

Edit: Not meant to defend myself, but to clear one thing up. The second time he asked me out I told him that I wasn't interested in a relationship with anyone, but also specifically said that I just wasn't interested in him.

835,Asshole,"My son has been seeing this lovely girl for about 4 months.  They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.

The mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.

Regardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.

Thing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.

I absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.

Best Friend’s Mom = BFM

First off, I would like to say that there was no personal motivation behind why I did it. As some back story, my best friends mom owned a cafe. They were struggling with finding employees so I agreed to come in and train for free (important later on). After about a week of training, I started working as a solo employee opening up the place (also important). After working around 3 shifts, we had a disagreement and I was fired. Not upset about it. The next day, they close the place down for financial reasons.

Here’s where the wage violations come in. A few days after the scheduled payday, I checked my bank account and there was no paycheck. I sat on it for a week before deciding to text her asking why I hadn’t gotten paid. Long story short, BFM deflects on the reasoning, gets very mad and proceeds to call me “a piece of work.” 

I really needed the paycheck. Later I posted on a certain law-related subreddit asking what to do. They suggested filing a claim with the Department of Labor. Doing what any sensible teenager does, I check with my friends. They say go for it, so I do. 

Today I got a call from the department. We talked and it was mentioned that I, being a minor, wasn’t allowed to work as early as I had. My agent said it might be helpful to get in touch with BFM to let her know, essentially saying pay me or pay fines.

Well I did and it blew up in my face.

I am a bisexual woman on my thirties. I´ve had more experience in sleeping with men than women, maybe in a 70% vs 30% ratio.

I tend to accumulate a lot of stress due daily life, work, lids, etc, so one thing I really enjoy is having a massage all over my back , neck and arms (just upper body)  from time to time. Not that often, although.

I have a coworker I  feel VERY attracted to, she is a woman as well. Married, kids, etc etc- She is not bisexual.

Our working relationship have developed to a sort of incipient friendship now, that months have passed.

Is sometimes difficult for me because I really feel desire for her and I´d love to caress her and  kiss her (even if full sex is out the picture, od course), but, I don´t think she would be okay with the idea at all.

She knows I haver this sort of crush on her, but seems to tolerate it and doesn´t mention it.

So far, so good.

The topic of massages and back aches came into conversation, and I mentioned I might be thinking into taking a course

(where I live they range from 3/4 months, to 6 months), and might be a nice little addition as an $$ outcome.

I have perdormed informally massages in the upper body to a couple coworkers, who said they were pretty good.

(I wasn´t interested in those women)-

The thing is, when I mentioned, the woman I mentioned earlier in the post said ""cool, you can practice with me!!!"", and now that she mentionates it...I´d love to take the massage course just to have the opportunity to feel/caress her body

(even if it is in not a sexual way).

I´d really enjoy that, but I feel somewhat guilty for having those thoughts, maybe even a little perv. AITA?

About two weeks ago, I was riding the bus home when the kid beside me looks at me and asks;

Kid: “Are you a snitch?”

Me: “No.”

Kid: “Good.”

He then pulls out a can of chewing tobacco and pulls some out and starts chewing some. He asks for a kid to pass him a Mountain Dew can, and continues to chew, spitting into it occasionally. I am a Freshman, and he is a Junior who definitely is not legal age to use tobacco products in my state. I go back to my phone and browse Reddit for the rest of the short ride home. After I get off of the bus, I text the bus driver, who my family is good friends with that a kid in my seat was chewing tobacco and not to mention me during any confrontation that might rise out of this incident. Situation has already been resolved, and I’m just curious if I was the asshole for lying to his face.

TLDR: Kid asks if I’m a snitch, I say no, he starts chewing dip, I tell the bus driver after I get off of the bus.

852,Not the A-hole,"Last week I got into a pretty severe car accident. A friend and I hydroplaned while entering the freeway on a roundabout, which caused the little Yaris we were in to slide into oncoming traffic. We got broadsided by a semi-truck. Amazingly, we both walked away unscathed, with the exception of some back pain on my part.

In the days following the accident I had an amazing outpouring of love and affection from my friends. People brought me food, family from out of state called to check in on me, and one of my college TAs was even cool enough to drop by with some edibles to help with my back pain.

Two days after the accident I got a message from my friend Eliza asking if I wanted some company. I said yes, and asked her if she could do me a huge favor when she got here and take my trash to the dumpster. I live in a second story apartment and getting down the stairs with a bag of garbage and a bad back just seemed like a monster of a mission at the time. Eliza says of course, and everything is set.

Cue to a few hours later and I'm lying on my couch being stoned and pathetic. I hear a rattling at my door and in walks Eliza, who I fully expected, but she also had our friend Wren with her, who I did not expect. Wren can be a bit much in a lot of ways.

After greetings Eliza jumps into cleaning my kitchen, which I appreciated, but I kept trying to tell her that all I needed was the trash taken out. Eliza didn't listen.

I had a basket of unfolded laundry sitting in my living room. Wren jumped right into folding that. Again, I kept insisting that she did not have to do that, and again, I was ignored. At one point, she pulled a pair of my underwear out and I immediately was like, ""hey, I don't like other people touching my underwear. Please stop."" Wren took this as an opportunity to just chuckle, then proceeded to tell me a story about the first time she went to our friend Willowe's house and how she started cleaning and Willowe was uncomfortable and visibly angry, but Wren just kept going and how she could see that same discomfort in me and how she thinks it's funny.

This didn't sit well with me. Who the hell gets off on making their friends uncomfortable?

So I told Wren straight up that she needed to stop. I said I get that she's trying to help, but honestly, I'm sore and high and feeling really violated, which is mixing with my high and giving me this weird anxiety that I really don't like. I kind of snapped. Both Eliza and Wren felt the mood change, so they both left after that and said they were going to let me rest.

I've spoken to Eliza since, but not Wren, and honestly, I don't want to talk to Wren. I don't think it's out of line for me to set boundaries and I don't think it's okay to intentionally cross someone's boundaries, even if it's in the name of ""just trying to help.""",31,41,0.94

""It's important to us that you're happy with your IKEA purchase. If you're not totally satisfied, or simply just change your mind, you can return your products within 365 days. We will give you a full refund of the price of the goods that are returned with proof of purchase and, if possible, the packaging.

Can I test and try the products that I’ve bought in store? 

Yes, you may test and try your products at home! If you decide to return your products, we would prefer for you to send them back in their original packaging.

My wife tries to make many attempts to get them to visit us or eat food she makes for them but they always decline, and she’s always texting or calling them on our behalf for occasions and checking up on them, but they never really text her unless they need her for something.

Well to me it’s not big a deal. I just know that they don’t care about me, so I don’t make a big deal out of it. Like I literally do not care. She’s making whatever efforts she wants for them, and I’ve asked her many times she doesn’t have to because neither do they care.

Well tonight she got really angry because she visited them, and they removed a wedding picture of us from their mantle to make room for another one of my sister’s pictures. She kept going on and on about how feelings are hurt.

My parents aren’t ever mean to her or nothing. They always talk well and invite us for family parties and stuff so I really feel like she’s being petty by pointing out minor problems, so I called her petty and jealous and doing them favors only to get favors in return. She got pretty mad. I don’t think I did anything bad, and she’s being immature and should let it go. But she’s telling me I’m the bad guy here.

So am I the asshole?

Adding an edit to make things a bit clear: they’re never exactly rude or mean to us. They’re fine. They just treat us maybe different compared to my sister and her partner. And I’m not dismissive of her feelings. I’ve told her several times I know they don’t care a lot about us, so I don’t go out of my way to do anything for them either and she should let it go as well. She needs to get over that at some point.

861,Not the A-hole,"I guess the title should really say ""are we the assholes"" since my wife made the decision with me.

My stepson has been a part of my life for the last 6 years, since he was 13. From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.

Anyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him.

He's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.

We have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.

My wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her ""do over child"" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife.

Of course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.

Now that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult. AWTA?

Edit: I'm only going to write this once instead of replying to every comment asking: my wife talked to him privately, we've tried family therapy, they've tried therapy just the two of them. He refuses to work on this resentment. He won't discuss it or talk about it, he'll just make offhand comments about my wife not providing him with the ""extras"" that he feels he deserves, and blaming her for the fact that his father is a deadbeat. We can only do so much if he refuses to work on his hostility, and it's ridiculous to keep an adult in the house on our dime who absolutely hates us and won't work on it.",245,186,0.91

Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.

Fast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did.

863,Not the A-hole," 

My parents (64M, 62F) have been married for 35 years. I (32M) am their only child.

Dad has anger issues and some narcissistic tendencies. He can become upset over even minor things. When he’s upset, he tends to verbally attack, gaslight and manipulate those around him.

Mom is passive and tends to try to smooth things over without dealing with them. Of course this only goes so far, and sometimes there are big fights with my mom losing her composure and crying, and my dad criticizing her for being emotional.

Things got very bad in the mid 90s thru mid 2000s. My dad had career difficulties and didn’t handle the stress well. He took it out on us, and though we had food, shelter and nice things, I can truly say life was miserable during this period due to the psychological abuse he inflicted. My mom had a very serious medical issue (cancer) and he treated her like absolute shit, at a moment when she was undergoing chemotherapy and needed as much support as possible.

**OK, THAT’S JUST SAD. WHERE’S THE PLOT TWIST?**

5 years ago, I discovered Dad had been visiting sex workers in various cities regularly since at least the mid-90s, and lying about his whereabouts during these times. I remember him coming home crazy late and he and mom fighting, and him saying he was just working late or whatever. He was dropping hundreds of dollars on these activities each “visit”, during a time when he started a fight with my mom for spending $20 to take me and her out to lunch.

I had a what-the-fuck moment and fully intended to tell mom. But she was out of town, and I confronted Dad first (maybe mistake?) and he got uber mad at me, talked me into thinking I would be guilty of breaking up the family, etc etc. I’m ashamed to say that I let fear guide me then, and I did not tell her, telling myself I would bide my time. But I never did. And at that point I was much more under Dad’s spell of influence.

I also found out mom had suspected something like this, and confronted him multiple times over the years, but he argued with her until he convinced her she was crazy for suspecting him.

This has been a weight on my soul ever since. I’m a professional artist, and I feel like due to this emotional weight, my creative output has been affected to the point it’s starting to sideline my career. I think the best art tells the truth, and in my heart I feel I’m not honest with anyone when I’m holding this in. Hard to reconcile.

What spurred this post is that I signed up for a meditation class. And with that practice of introspection, I’m realizing this whole situation is making me sick and weighing on me even when I push it to the back of my mind.

864,Asshole,"I feel bad for having to post this up here, but PLEASE PLEASE read my edits. Thank you. 

This is something I've been really debating in my head for the past few days. I really would like to know if I'd be in the wrong if I do this. (Tell me if this would fit better in r/Advice and I'll move it) 

There has been this rumor I've been told by two trusted friends and confirmed by another that a girl at my school was kicked out of our school musical because she was caught drinking alchohol on school property. (She is underage aswell). But I have no hard proof that this is true. 

This girl is also in my community theater show, and I was debating on sending my director an anonymous note to check in with my school's drama director to see if this is true. Because if it is, I dont feel comfortable with her being in this show. Will I be the asshole? 

Edit: The way my community theater works is you must sign many contacts proving your commitment to a show. One of the contracts is specifically that you would not commit any crimes while apart of the show. (Stuff including: drinking or smoking any kind of product). So, she also broke this contract. 

Edit 2: After you all said to, I asked her if these rumors where true or not. She said she got kicked out because she came to practice hungover. So yes, they were (pretty much). 

Edit 3: Alot of people are apparently commenting from other counties asking how old is underage? We live in America, the drinking age is 21, she is 16.

I have decided to ""mind my own business"" as many (many) of you... uh... advised me too. I do realize I made my original post a bit self centered, and I'm sorry for that. I truly did not mean to make this about me, my comment about me being ""uncomfortable with her being in this show"" was extremely inappropriate. I realize that now. I (surprisingly) do care about this person and have had previous contact with her. (Again, sorry for being bratty.) Thank you.",205,215,0.89
865,Not the A-hole,"I went to a bottomless brunch with two friends. Basically, it’s $32 for bottomless mimosas and tapas. The waiter generally comes by, takes your food order, and fills your drinks from a pitcher, then comes around from time to time to refill your drinks. The first time I went to this brunch the service was great. Sure the food took a while but we knew that the kitchen was busy so we didnt mind. We got filled up on drinks probably 7 or 8 times in 2 hours and we never had to ask for our waiter. 

So this time, I make reservations ahead of time. We get there and they seat us kindof in the back near a birthday party, no big whoop. We go ahead and order and get our first round of drinks. This begins the hassle. Our food just doesnt come. It just doesnt. We sit for 30 minutes and our waiter passes our table countless times, never refilling our drinks. The whole time though, he is filling the drinks at the birthday party next to us, even though the birthday party already has 2 other waiters tending to them. Finally after almost an hour, I wave him down and ask him whats up. He says the kitchen is overwhelmed and they are out of mimosas. As he is saying this, i see a bartender mixing a pitcher of them, so I say, “It looks like they are making some right now. “ he looks over, rolls his eyes, goes and gets the pitcher and comes back. He fills each of our glasses half way then leaves to go tend to the birthday party where he completely fills the glass of a VERY inebriated woman and exchanges phone number with her. This is when I lost it. You literally deliver no food and one drink over an hour long period, lie to me, roll your eyes at me, and then get some girls phone number? Really? Finally a runner brings us food. Not our food. Just food. It’s not what we ordered, but our waiter is literally nowhere to be found. We reluctantly eat the food and as we are eating, our waiter appears out of nowhere and slams our check down on the table and walks away without a word. We didn’t ask for our check. He gave us 1.5 drinks and we didnt even get the food we ordered. 

I go to the front of the restaurant and ask for the manager he comes up and hes very apologetic and says he’ll find us another waiter to help out. The waiter never shows up. So we reluctantly pay our bill (I had to go to the register and ask a random waitress to help me out because our waiter had bailed) and we pay for our food. Total comes out to pretty much $100. I know waiters rely on tips, and I normally tip 15-18% minimum, but he literally didn’t do his job and blew us off to flirt with a drunk college girl. We didn’t even get the food we ordered. I tipped 5% on this bill.

I (21) got him the job after begging him to get a job for our entire relationship. I wrote his resume and pretty much applied to the job for him. I quit smoking weed with him last year when he finally started seeing a therapist and psychiatrist. The psychiatrist had him quit to see how it affected his mood and mental health. He was doing great and then started smoking again after a few months claiming he was better now and wanted to smoke. I didn’t smoke at all during that time because he needed the support.

I am in my 30's and live 1800km away.  They are visiting my little family for a few days and I have watched him allow my 1 year old to climb up his legs to stand and then kick him down. I've watched him taunt the dog with a toy, and when my dog finally got the toy, he slapped her quite hard a cross the face and called her a bad dog. He actively terrorizes the cat (who recently had hip surgery) and thinks it's funny when she tries to run away from him, but she can't because she's hurt. I have addressed each one of these circumstances and each time it's ""They were being mean to me. "" or ""No I didn't.""

My other cat recently passed and he deliberately calls her by the wrong name to ask how she died. This question comes up several times a day and each time I say that she had cancer, but I don't think that's the type of answer he's looking for. Either he wants to know specifically about the death part, or he's trying to hurt me. The way he studies my face when he asks is the creepiest thing I've ever experienced.

He also becomes very angry at the drop of a hat over perceived sleights like helping to clean a mess he didn't make or a request to help with setting the whole table instead of just his spot. 

AITA for wanting my parents to remove him from their lives and the lives of the rest of the kids (who I absolutely love and consider my family, the system be damned). I don't think they can benefit him and I know for a fact he isn't benefiting their family. That being said, I'm not a psychologist of any kind and I don't know what traumas he has experienced.

This girl alternated between making fun of me for not having a cellphone or fashionable clothes, and ignoring me entirely. The entire 9th-12th grade class only had about 15 students (I went to a small school), and so it was super obvious that she was shunning me.

This girl had some issues at home (she was adopted as an older child, and she had some trauma related to her birth family), and so I tried to give her a pass. However, her behaviour really hurt me. 

Now: she got pregnant from a hookup right out of high school (very hypocritical; she used to shame girls at our school for not living “Christian lives.” I have nothing against sex, but you shouldn’t have a double standard for yourself and other people). Something went wrong during the birth, and she ended up dying. Is it bad that I don’t really care? She was a cruel, vain, hypocritical person, and her death is no great loss to the world. Should I feel sad? AITA?

I feel that I'm volunteering my time, but the tips I earn through the services I provide should be mine. I've had mixed responses to this and figured the good citizens of this sub could maybe give me perspectives I haven't considered yet.

Also if someone has straight up told me that my tips aren't my own, I will relinquish them, but more often than not I rescind my volunteer offer if it's made clear before the event that I won't be entitled to them. I've never been rude about it, and I've never done it in a way that would inconvenience the event (last minute cancelling).

TIA

&#x200B;

Edit for additional info:  The events vary from weddings to music events, but the bar is always organized by non-profit organizations I am involved with. The proceeds go to the NPO.

&#x200B;

Second Edit: None of the events that I have done have been charity fundraisers. Two of the NPOs I volunteer for are local event and theatre organizations. One holds a yearly event and the other is a theatre. They host various events during the year and provide bar services as part of their funding. These are the two NPOs that don't care if I take home my tips. The third is a music NPO. They host musical events. They are where I got a bit of pushback with my bringing home my tips. Also, not that it's relevant, but my take is usually $20-30. 

&#x200B;

Thank you for all your input. It didn't take long for me to see that there isn't a straight answer here. I can see why I could be the asshole. My reasoning is though, I don't cost a penny, and I provide experienced service. It doesn't bother me to take home the tips that customers leave for me. It's a societal contract that bartenders, waitresses and a large array of service workers get tipped for what they provide. So I will continue to be upfront about my expectations to the NPO I'm volunteering for, and if they don't want me to bartend for them, then that's fine with me. I do lots of other  volunteer work with all three of these organizations, so I know that I am valued no matter what my take is :)",66,37,0.92

876,Not the A-hole,"Been with my husband for over a decade, we met as teenagers and grew up together. I've always dressed and presented fairly androgynous. At various points in my life i'd play up my femme side more and my masc side more. usually i just dress in jeans and a tshirt. femininity always felt performative and a bit uncomfortable to me, but i did occasionally enjoy it. *we did not meet or fall in love during one of my high femme phases so that's not what's up*

He's made lots of shitty comments over the years about my dress. I've mostly brushed it off as him being oblivious but wanting to be good; he would want someone to tell him if he looked weird. The thing is though he makes these comments over normal, fashionable-ish outfits (i'm not gonna be doing any shoots anytime soon but i'm not a slob). He's called me boy, man, dude. Not like in the colloquial like ""sup boys, let's do this"" but ""whatever, *boy*"" if we're arguing and i happen to not be wearing a dress.

i've told him before to cut it out, that it hurts my feelings and i dont appreciate it and that it's not funny when he calls me dude boy and man ""jokingly"". he stops for a bit and starts again in a couple weeks. we had a huge fight about it recently where i asked him to just leave me alone about my clothes, that all i did was put on a flannel over a hoodie because it is fucking cold. he said his preferences are important and need to be considered. i said my happiness as a human being needs to be considered and he doesnt get to control how i dress all the time and that he's been a bit of a bully. he insists we need to compromise. i dont think i should compromise who i am as a person to be a prettier thing for him to look at. I want to stress, again, that i have always been this way and that my dressing this way is not some new thing. he's picked at it over the years but in the last couple years he's gotten REALLY weird about it. during the discussion he said he was afraid of me getting my mental health in order because when i do i start having problems with things. i really dont know if im being delusional here. i feel like he's trying to be controlling, and yes since i started getting help for my depression i've spoken up when i'm bothered (im not a shithead cancelling all our friends or something, but if someone is rude to me i wont smile and simper anymore, ill tell them to not treat me that way)\

878,Asshole,"So I'd been seeing this girl for a few months, right? We met online and hit it off right away, she's very sweet and we had a lot of good conversations. She's a huge romantic, gave me a lot of presents and romantic gestures, etc., throughout our relationship. Not crazy, her family likes me, altogether I lucked out. 

I broke up with her after a few months, under the excuse that I have to move back to my hometown for the summer because of financial reasons. She was heartbroken and wanted to do long distance, and then when I declined, to stay friends. 

The truth is, I'm not physically attracted to her at all (she isn't what could be called conventionally attractive), I could not see myself being intimate with her, and besides all that I do not want to be in a long-term relationship with her. The romantic gestures made me feel horrible because I never loved her like that. I never told her this, and I never will. It's been a couple weeks since we broke up, and I'm doing fine, but by the look of her social media, she is not. Am I an asshole for lying to her, or would I have been more of an asshole had I told the truth?

885,Not the A-hole,"On mobile, excuse typos and format.

So, I got married 5 months ago. Everything went great, it was a beautiful day except... our wedding photos are awful, we had a small wedding and planned it in a month, I took a friend’s recommendation about this photographer and... The pictures were messy, no direction at all from her on poses, my hair and my dress were really messed up in all photos and she never once came to me to tell me or fix my dress, there are very few photos of just my husband and I we actually like. 

Now for the dress part, in my country we have something called “destroy the dress” (or something along those lines) which basically means wearing it somewhere that might ruin the dress but for a photoshoot.

So I would like to hire a better photographer and go to the beach with my husband and take pictures there (in the water, etc) which obviously would take a toll on the dress. I really would like to make up for the wedding pictures, I’ve seen it done millions of times and the pictures come out stunning and my husband really liked the idea. 

I told my idea to my mother in-law and she FLIPPED, she told me how irresponsible it would be of me to ruin a dress that costed my mom so much money (my mom bought my dress) that I was being a brat and my daughter would want my dress and to ruin it just for the hell of it is incredibly immature.

I very politely told her I disagreed and my daughter probably wouldn’t want my wedding dress anyways, I would feel very pressured if I knew my mom was saving her wedding dress for me. Plus, if possible I would love to buy my daughter her wedding dress like my mom did for me (if I ever have a daughter), so I would like to use my dress for something creative and meaningful to us since I’ll never use it again.

She continued to get mad and I changed the subject. I haven’t talk about it with my mom recently but before we found my dress she told me I could do whatever I wanted with it. 

I just don’t see the point of keeping it in a box forever? Mother in-law even made a comment about how if I was her daughter she wouldn’t even let me touch the dress after saying what I said because I was being ungrateful.

So reddit, WIBTA if I ruined my wedding dress for photos?

Edit: I want to clarify I don’t plan on just trashing my dress after the photos, it just wont be wearable anymore. I’ll still keep it and as some wonderful redditors suggested, if my future daughter wants to she can cut a piece to have on her wedding day.",53,58,0.9

My girlfriend ""Julia"" can sometimes be unaware of the social clues people around her are giving off, especially when she has been drinking. 

This was the case last night when we went to go hang out and have dinner at a friend's place. Over the night Julia had a lot of wine and we ended up staying until almost midnight when this happened. 

I could tell that our friends really wanted us to leave so they could go to bed but are too nice to actually tell us to leave. It was getting super uncomfortable and Julia just was not picking up on any of this. At one point when we ended up alone in the living room for a minute I whispered to her that ""I think they want to go to bed. We should head out now."" 

She told me to stop being ""ridiculous"", that they were all having fun and I was trying to ruin her ""good time"". I decided to give it a little longer to see if she would pick up on the hints before I would remind her again that we should leave. 

By the time I reminded her for the second time, it was 12:30 and everybody but Julia was irritated. I asked my friends straight up when Julia was in the bathroom  if they wanted us to leave and they finally said yes. When she came back I told her that they said we should leave but she accused me of lying because I ""just want to go home."" 

I stood up, thanked our friends for having us, and grabbed Julia from behind by her waist, grabbed her stuff and put her in the car. Like I said she's a whole foot shorter so there wasn't much she could do to get out it.

When I put her in the car I told her she was being embarrassing and we were going home. She told me to fuck off but didn't say anything else about it until today when I was at work and she texted me that I was being an asshole last night and I shouldn't have picked her up like that, she's not a child, and she doesn't want to talk to me until I apologize. 

That's the thing, I don't know if I should be the one to apologize. She was the one disrespecting everybody's time and not listening to my attempts to get her to pay attention to our friend's hints that we should leave. I didn't know what else to do at that point.

888,Asshole,"Here is the context:

I had a very busy day at work yesterday and Tuesday’s I also go to the gym after work. My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he’d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was “go go go.”

Driving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some “alone time” to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn’t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there’s anything else he’d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he’s sure because I’m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. 

FIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It’s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that’s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he’s suddenly asking me if that’s how much is left, and I tell him I don’t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can’t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn’t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. 

I poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. 

He thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby.

Me and my girlfriend of on spring break right now. We didn't really want to do much over the break but wanted to take the chance so we decided to throw a casual party for all our friends which included a pot luck. This is where my brother Dave comes in. I invited Dave 3 weeks ago and he told me no. He said he wasn't going to come to my ""stupid party"". W/e, i didn't really care and that was the end of it. Well, until last night when he showed up uninvited and did not bring any food (like we asked everyone to do)

&#x200B;

This is where the main problem comes in, Dave is vegan. Now, I have nothing against vegans, my girlfriend is a vegetarian. It's respectable and it's none of my business. But dave is the stereotypical vegan everyone hates. The hardest part of the 2 years he's been vegan is bringing it up at every chance. He will shame you for your diet while not shutting up about his.

&#x200B;

Out of the 16ish dishes we had maybe one was vegan. The two my girlfriend made were vegetarian but had egg in them and most of the others had meat. So, when Dave showed up he began to complain to me and others that I didn't consider his lifestyle. Along with this, he was actively trashing others dishes. MY girlfriend offered to make him a dish of one of hers without egg in it (she had left over ingredients prepared) and he turned her down, telling her to ""enjoy her chicken menstruation). He also told a classmate of mine that her chili reeked of ""cruelty"".

&#x200B;

As the party went on he would not stop bitching and began to push some of his animal liberation stuff but I decided to just ignore him, until he began trashing me to my girlfriend. He told her that I treat him like crap, just imagine how I would treat an animal.

I was furious at this, so I turned off the music and announced to everyone

My brother was furious but the people at the party laughed at my joke and began to ignore him themselves. Eventually he just slipped out as everyone just ignored him. He texted me this morning saying he wants an apology but I ignored him.

894,Asshole,"I’ll try to make this as short as possible. 

A few years back I met a wonderful guy (we’ll call him Henry) who had come to my city from another country to do an internship. We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can’t sponsor him bc it’s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we’re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn’t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. 

A year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we’ll call him Jake. Now I’m the type of person who doesn’t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don’t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I’m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that’s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. 

The next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He’s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. 

The problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I “lied about being married.” I explained to him many times why I didn’t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I’m a liar. Is he right? AITA

Edit: to the people that think my marriage was a scam or green card fraud, it was not. I didn’t want to go into all of the details about the marriage bc I didn’t want to waste anyone’s time when this was more about if I should have told my new boyfriend sooner or not. But now this needs explaining. 

The person I married was MY BOYFRIEND. We had an apt together. We went to his country together so I could meet his family. It wasn’t a pretend marriage it was just a marriage that we entered into sooner than was ideal bc we wanted to stay together. It wasn’t fraud. 

Edit 2: some of you seem to not comprehend what I am asking. I am not asking you if you think I’m an asshole for not getting divorced. That is none of your business. I’m asking AITA for not telling my bf within 2 months of knowing him that I was still legally married. Please stop calling me an asshole for a “sham marriage.” It’s not the point of this post. 

Edit 3: Guys I kinda messed up. At the time that he found out about the marriage, he wasn’t my boyfriend. The way I wrote this was from the current situation as he is now my boyfriend. 

We had been dating online and we live in separate states. Before this happened, I told him that I didn’t want to call it a relationship until after we met, but I told him that I wouldn’t be seeing anyone else because that’s just how I am. But I did make it clear that until we met and I knew for sure that we would get along in person, I wouldn’t enter into a serious relationship with him. ",708,1764,0.93

899,Not the A-hole,"(I grew up speaking french so I apologize for grammatical errors).

When I was in high school, my sibling and I accidentally hit a car while we were backing out of our driveway. We went to our neighbors house to tell them what happened, but a woman we had never met before answered. We explain that we accidentally hit her car while backing out, and she immediately starts crying and explains that her son just died. We immediately felt worse and tried to comfort her while we brought her out to the car.

Sparing the details, she got really angry at us. She began yelling at us and insulting us, while constantly bringing up that her son had died. She then called the police and made us call our parents because she didn't trust us ""stupid, incompetent teenagers"". The police showed up, and she again reiterated to him that her son had just died before even explaining the situation. The police officer looked at the cars and pointed out the damage along with additional damage which I claimed we couldn't have caused due to its location and the amount of damaged compared to the other dent (it was quite worse). She got even angrier that we weren't taking blame for it, and once again reiterated that her son died and we were only making it harder.

Things got infinitely worse when my dad showed up. She yelled that his ""stupid"" children ruined her car and weren't taking the full blame for it, and as usual brought up at her son just died. Here's one thing to know about my dad: if you insult and/or hurt his children, you are fucking doomed. He immediately spat back at her and started a screaming match, which eventually culminated into this:

Woman: ""HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO ME LIKE THAT!""

Dad: ""I have every right to speak to you like this. My children did the smart and responsible thing by telling you about the accident and giving you their information, and you have to audacity to stand here yelling at and insulting them? Grow the fuck up, you pathetic miserable old cunt!""

Woman: ""MY SON JUST DIED!""

Dad: ""You know? Good for him. Now that he's dead, he doesn't have to be around you.""

Now I know my dad's comment was completely uncalled for and totally rude, and, honestly, I was getting fed up too. I strongly dislike it when people constantly play the pity/grief card. I have never lost a child, and everyone express their grief differently. At the beginning I really did feel for her, but the fact that she kept bringing it up just made it feel like she was trying to manipulate us. By the end of it, I didn't even care that her son had died. That feeling still haunts me to this day.

Am I the asshole for thinking she played the grief card too much, and eventually not caring that her son had died? Is she the asshole? Are we both assholes?

EDIT: I know my dad was being an asshole and I called him out on it. I feel horrible for everything that happened and I did pay for all the damages and apologized to her especially after what happened with my dad. 
Also, I was in high school so I thought it was okay to question damage and I wasn’t using it as a way to get out of shit I just didn’t think I caused it and thought there was another culprit. I know that was a dick move on my part which is why I included it in the story.",99,360,0.92

903,Not the A-hole,"My husband's family has a standing yearly tradition of a family camping trip. It's held on the same weekend every year, and MIL expects all of her kids to come (it's basically 2nd Christmas at this point). It has only changed weekends a couple of times in the last 2 decades, causing chaos, sooo they don't change it idly. Also of important note, MIL organises and purchases everything, then divides the cost by person and each family reimburses her for their portion. No one has a problem doing this, including us. 

I love this trip. I look forward to it every year, because it's often the only vacation hubby and I get. This year however, the camping trip weekend falls 6wks after my due date. 

I made an idle comment to MIL a couple weeks before Christmas about us planning on coming, and massively looking forward to it, while simultaneously hoping that I'll feel up to us coming...basically a hope and plan for the best but mentally prepare for the worst type conversation.

She became visibly irate, and asked WHY I thought we might not come.

....b-because I will have very recently pushed a squashed watermelon out of my baby purse (or if I'm unlucky had my abdomen carved open, rifled through, then slapped back together like a Thanksgiving turkey) and I physically might be in extreme discomfort or pain, rendering the idea of being in an unpredictable, ""rustic"" environment with shared (and probably less-than-sanitary) facilities entirely unappealing?

She made a face and didn't say anything else about it, but a couple weeks later at Christmas, hubby and I's Christmas gift was a homemade gift certificate explaining that our family's camping expenses were prepaid in full. 

I mentioned to hubby that I was SUPER APPRECIATIVE of this gesture, but that I simultaneously feel that she's manipulating me into a position of not being able to say ""no"" to coming on the camping trip, which I dislike. He was irritated with me for seeing ulterior motives in his mom's generosity.

TL;DR - I tell MIL we *might* not be coming on a traditional yearly camping trip due to my having given birth just weeks prior, she responds by paying for our portion of expenses...I feel she's manipulating me/us into coming, hubby feels I'm being ungrateful and petty. AITA?",62,69,0.91

We are good friends, but I wouldn’t say I enjoyed him as a coworker because while he is great at his job he loved disrupting me and giving me a hard time.  I’m gay, and he made a point of telling people at work, so I also have some touchiness around sharing personal info with him.

I don’t mind sharing this information with some friends, but even though I consider him a good friend I just didn’t want to do it.

906,Asshole,"My husband is a veteran, who enjoys everything that has to do with guns. During the week he goes to the range with his friends around 1-3 times. On the weekends he’ll usually be hunting or participating in his rifle association. He also suffers from PTSD, insomnia, and depression so I try to let him do the things he enjoys to help him with his hardships.

Fast forward to the present, I have never hosted a event for my family as I have always been super busy with work. My nephew, who I love very dearly was about to turn 2, so I decided to offer to host the party for my sister since I know her house is extremely messy since she has to take care of a infant.

Once I started cleaning I realized how unsuitable our home might appear to guests, we have many flags, medals, and guns mounted everywhere around the house. I decided that the biggest thing that needed to be addressed were the weapons, so I asked if we could temporarily take them down.

He agreed to take them all down except for one, which is located right above our fireplace. His reason being that his very close friend died literally by his side in battle, and something he had always promised was to keep and honor all of his memorabilia, as he doesn’t have a wife or children. 

He believes removing his weapon from the mantle would be a dishonor to his friend, and thinks that he is already being accommodating enough by removing the rest of the weapons. 

I’m not that satisfied on one hand I do empathize for my husband, on the other I don’t want parents to be uncomfortable with a weapon in their view, especially with kids around.

Any advice is appreciated, if you have any questions feel free to ask. I’m getting ready for work currently so I might not be able to reply quickly but I will definitely get around to it.

Am I the asshole here?

Edit: Wow, just got home from work. I’m blown away that this got so much attention. I appreciate everyone’s replies, I’m gonna try to be as thorough as possible. 

INFO

Firstly, I think my husband is very brave and I’m extremely proud of his service/what he loves to do. I didn’t mean I was ashamed of his memorabilia, I simply was concerned if it would be a little much for a children’s party. I didn’t want any of the medals or awards taken down, just the weapons.

Question and Answer
(I will keep updating as I read, I just got home so I’ll be getting ready for bed/replying as much as I can!)

Q: Is the gun loaded?
A: No, it isn’t. My husband said it isn’t capable of being fired in its current state.

Q: Did I ask him about the party before I had it?
A: Yes, he agreed to it but didn’t know we would be taking down the weapons until after I discussed it with him. I hadn’t been thinking about it prior either, it came into my mind when I was cleaning.

907,Not the A-hole,"The title is a lot less detail oriented so hear me out.

My wife and I will have been married 5 years this summer and it falls on the 26th of the month. My brothers birthday is on the 1st of the following month and he is turning 30. His wife wants to do a surprise trip for him with my wife and I and my sister and her husband. My SIL knows that my anniversary is a few days before and is totally trying to compromise so the trip works out well as an anniversary trip as well. The plan is for my wife and I to pick the destination, go there and spend a few days alone together, then my siblings will come down the following weekend to finish off the trip. 

My wife is saying how she feels like our anniversary is unimportant to me and the trip is all about my brother and his birthday. Which it will be, for 3 days at the end. The rest of the time we'll be alone enjoying our anniversary. She's making planning it very difficult because she keeps saying how I'm putting everyone else before her which isn't the truth. I'd understand if we weren't choosing the destination and having alone time, but the fact is that her and I are picking where we all go, and we'll be alone for a good amount of time before everyone else comes. 

Now for the fun part. My wife's mother apparently booked a timeshare in the Caribbean for the week of our anniversary for the entire family and invited us along. My wife jumped at the opportunity about how much fun it would be, and I told her that hurts my feelings. She's willing to go spend the entire week with her family, but somehow the idea of spending a few days AFTER our anniversary with my family is somehow making her feel unimportant? I told her we can split the time between the spot with her family and then jump to wherever my family goes, but she wasn't having that either. She's unwilling to compromise.

I got very frustrated and told her she can feel free to go with her family, but I'm not going and she can stay home while I go for my brothers birthday party weekend. AITA for trying to combine the trip with my brothers birthday party and making my wife feel unimportant?",26,80,0.91
908,Asshole,"I ordered some Thai food for pickup over the phone and went to get it. The layout of the resteraunt was similar to [this](http://www.girlsguidetoparis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Pont-de-Yunnan.jpg) random picture from Google images. The tables were set with forks and knives.

I took a seat while waiting a few extra minutes for them to finish my order, then they brought it to the table I was at, wrapped up for takeout. I was going to take it to my car but I was super hungry so said fuck it and started eating it there. A minute later a woman working there kindly told me you can't sit if you order pickup and I left.

I would understand if they were busy, but I was literally the only person there and there were like at least 15 seats. I know this is super insignificant but I'm just curious if I was having shit manners or if they are slight jerks / listening to their managers' orders.

910,Not the A-hole,"So this literally just happened/is happening.  For context, we're both males if that makes any difference.

My boyfriend is the type of guy who likes to do surprises.  Now I've no issue with being bought a surprise gift or having a surprise dinner made for me or anything like that, but I do have an issue when it comes to a surprise that involves a trip away/night away/holiday/weekend break or anything of that sort.

Backstory as to why this is an issue.  A few years ago I was diagnosed officially with epilepsy, 

Around a year after this had happened, after struggling through severe daily anxiety, not sleeping, eating properly waking up every morning and being physically sick because I had to leave the house I was signed off work.  I was then diagnosed with severe GAD, PTSD (From the seizures) and agoraphobia.  I didn't want to be left alone and I didn't want to leave the house, I was signed off for a year, put on meds, had therapy and eventually got hypnotherapy which got me back to work in December 2017.  2018 was pretty good, I've improved so much, got back to work, got a promotion, I still had anxiety, still don't really like being out but most days its bearable and I've learned how to cope.  One thing I don't cope very well with is new places, my own town/city I'm cool with because I know where I am and it's just that comfort.  

I've told this to my boyfriend multiple times, please let me know if he wants to ""surprise"" me with a trip away or something because chances are I'll need to prepare myself.

So I get a call just now asking if I'm okay to do something monday night, I'm like, what? He says he's not telling me and I'm like well if you don't tell me what I'm not going to agree to it.  And he just huffs off the phone saying ""it doesn't matter"".

&#x200B;

I text him and ask him to please tell me what he wanted to do, he tells me and said he booked a nice hotel away for the night on Monday, and although this is super sweet of him to do he KNOWS that it's an issue to me and I really cannot afford to relapse.  I text him back reminding what I've said before and I appreciate the sentiment.  He just says ""It's not that far away, I'm going to lose the deposit now but doesn't matter"".  

&#x200B;

I feel like shit now but why should I have to feel like shit when I've asked so many times?! Just because outwardly I may appear to be doing OK, he knows what's going on inside and knows I still wouldn't be comfortable with it.

913,No A-holes here,"We’re all 25. My boyfriend and I have been living together for approx. 7 months, together for 2.5 years.

My boyfriend has a friend from college, “Mark”, who has been causing issues in our relationship since the beginning. I’ve posted about him before:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a96xx6/i_have_an_insane_urge_to_offer_my_boyfriend_an/


To sum it up, Mark has some pent up resentment towards me. My theory is that this stems from two issues. 1) my friend, who he had a one night stand of sorts with, wasn’t interested in anything past that evening. It was also one of, if not his very first, sexual experience. 2) Mark wants his “bro” back, and I’m standing in the way. In his eyes, at least. I never try to bar my boyfriend from hanging out with his friends. Mark and my bf were he last two single guys in the group, but now it’s just Mark. 

Anyways, if he gets a chance to insult or demean me, he does. Whether it be directly, like saying that “all girls that you meet at the bars are whores” (he was at the bar with my bf the night we met), or indirectly by being an absolute horrible houseguest (refusing to clean up his own belongings that he spew all over our house, that was covered in detail in the second link above) he takes full advantage.

The issue is, Mark is a little bit of a jerk to all of our friends, even my boyfriend, so they’ve kind of tuned him out and don’t even notice most of this. But I’m not a longtime friend of Mark, so I notice and I also don’t have the same level of patience as everyone else does. They usually say things like “Mark is always like this” or “Mark doesn’t know any better”. Nah, I’m not buying it. The dude is a grown as man and in medical school, he knows that what he says/does is inappropriate and hurtful. The cherry on top of all this is that on the several occasions when my bf has had to talk to Mark about being rude towards me, he only apologizes to my bf. He’s never reached out to me to offer an apology.

Anyways, I’ve had *enough* of Mark. I don’t care if my boyfriend wants to maintain a friendship with him, but I’m done. 

He likes to come visit and stay the night time to time, about once a month-ish average, but I really don’t feel like I should have to put up with his crap in my own home. I’m also worried that, because we’re renovating our attic and turning it into a lounge/bar, that Mark will be trying to come over more often. 

WIBTA if I told my boyfriend that Mark is no longer welcome in our home? I don’t care if they hangout anywhere else, truly. I just don’t want him here. I get that this will put my bf in a tough spot, because he’ll be inviting everyone over to hangout and Mark will be pissed if he can’t come, but at the same time it’s Mark’s own fault for being such a jerk.

915,Not the A-hole,"Buckle in folks, this is gonna be a long one. Throwaway for personal reasons.

Okay, so I have a massive student debt. About $110k total with about $65k in Parent Plus Loans in my mother’s name. I also have a baby on the way. Currently, I’m paying $600/mo toward the parent plus loan. I’ve asked my mother to reapply for income based repayment as her income has changed significantly (she has none) and I really need the flexibility to prepare for child related expenses. (I’m not planning on paying just the minimum, but if I need to do it one month because I have an emergency, I will.) My husband and I are currently living paycheck to paycheck, making decent money, but paying $1000/mo total toward student debt (income based repayment minimums). 

She is refusing to reapply for the income based repayment despite the fact that she makes no payment towards these loans. She also took out the maximum every year I was in college despite the fact that I specifically asked her not to, as our agreement was that I would pay them back. She claims she used the extra money toward me. There’s no way all the money was used for my expenses. She fixed my car once to the tune of about $700, but never helped with rent or groceries, even leaving me homeless for about six months while I was in school. She probably netted about $15k off these loans. 

WIBTA if I stopped paying these loans if she refuses to reapply for income based repayments? The loan is solely in her name, so there are no legal/financial repercussions for me. I imagine she will harass me to the point of needing a restraining order if I do this. 

Edit: Silver? Wow! 

Update: I told her that I wouldn’t be making any more payments unless she let me adjust the payments (since she isn’t the one paying them) and gave her a deadline of one month to provide the necessary info (of which any reasonable adult should have handy) or apply for the change herself. She’s gone completely nuclear, sending me multiple emails attacking me personally while claiming there’s no way she could come up with the information with a months notice. (The AGI from the last taxes she filed, doesn’t matter what year, and a rough estimate of her current income.) Will be cutting contact with her completely after she either provides the information or misses the deadline. ",145,476,0.94

917,Not the A-hole,"I live on a private lane with 5 houses, the one directly across from me just sold to a young couple with smaller (6 to 10 years old maybe) children. My property totals 10 acres split into 3 fields with a pond, a rather deep creek during the wet season, a dilapidated barn and a newer livestock barn. Also 6 horses and two giant breed dogs not accustomed to children. A kid's delight for a playground, a liability nightmare for me.

They are just in the process of moving in and so far they've been letting the kids just kinda run wild. They haven't made their way into my fields yet but I've seen them taunting another neighbor's dog and hanging on my fence so it's probably just a matter of time. I'm wanting to go over and introduce myself, do the whole polite welcome to the lane bit and ask them to please not allow their children to climb on my fence or enter my property. My boyfriend tells me this is rude and kind of a dick move and if I do that I'm not being very ""neighborly"" or ""welcoming"".

I see this as a safety issue. In addition to the pond, the creek and all the rusty old farm equipment in the barn I've got 2 horses that were late-gelded breeding stallions and can be aggressive if not handled properly plus with this being spring the mares are coming in season which escalates their behavior. Pasture squabbles break out, especially if the horses are competing for human attention or think treats are involved. A hoof to the head can be deadly for an adult let alone a child. In my state horses are considered an attractive nuisance same as a swimming pool. I am appropriately insured as are my animals, my fences are secure, my property is posted, my gates are locked. Fences are easily climbed though and signs have been known to be ignored.

With all that considered, I'd rather look like an asshole to these people than take a chance on their kids getting hurt or worse. My boyfriend thinks I should just trust them to be respectful of the fences and signage until they give us reason to believe otherwise. I'm rather apprehensive about this approach and of course would be very polite entering a discussion with them about this.

So, WIBTA if I went over to them, said her welcome to the neighborhood so glad to have you here and btw please don't allow your kids in my fields for their own safety? I'd find a better way to say it to them obviously.",42,36,0.95
918,Not the A-hole,"A little background. My parents are basically broke right now. I've moved to a new city for a job and right before that, my dad was hospitalized for a psychotic break. 

I just got my first paycheck and I told one of my aunts to tell my mum that I'd sent her $100 because I couldn't get a hold of her and would be busy throughout the day. 

My aunt freaked and asked me why I'd sent so little. My parents are terrible with money so I explained to her that I'm not sending them more to avoid them wasting it. She argued that $100 is not enough to feed a family of 3 (parents + younger brother). She was very passive-aggressive and called me stingy. 

I didn't respond to her little outburst. I didn't send my parents more money. She has since sent me a few more messages asking me if I'm mad at her and telling me not to be mad over the issue. 

I'm not mad. I'm very hurt. I can survive on $20 a week. I was thinking $100 could last them at least a few days. But AITA for not sending my parents more money? 

EDIT:
1. Thank you for all the responses, I genuinely appreciate it and it's pulled me out of the ditch my aunt pushed me into. 
2. I'd like to address a few things I noticed in the comments:
-My dad refuses to acknowledge his mental illness. I offered to get him on disability benefits and he flipped on me.
-My mum can't work, has never worked.
-My aunt was involved because she had called me the night before to tell me that my mum said they had no money to eat. I was busy. I couldn't get a hold of my mother so I asked her to pass the message. My mother is illiterate so texting was out of it.
-Also, said aunt doesn't work so she ""can't help out"". She smokes too. So she did argue that cigs are expensive (I've never bought any, I don't know)
-Younger brother has been swaddled all his life. He's unreliable. I can't do anything regarding that. We don't have the best relationship either and he would never want to live with me.
-I love my parents. They didn't do their best when I was growing up, but regardless of whether they did or not, I'm sending them $100 a week. I'll still have a little leftover from my paycheck to save. So I'm in an ""okay"" spot.

921,Not the A-hole,"Years ago, in 8th grade, I was bullied every day in my history class by a kid who sat next to me.

922,No A-holes here,"In December, my boyfriend and I had sex and the condom broke. I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.

&#x200B;

I come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. 

&#x200B;

My boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.

&#x200B;

So when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. 

I keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.

&#x200B;

tl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their ""honour"". AITA ?

923,Not the A-hole,"Still a bit conflicted on this. Broke up with my ex GF about a week ago. Dated for about 6 months.   

Basically, we met, went on a few dates and things became serious quickly and we sat down and had the “ground rules” chat before we became official (no talking to exes, hitting on girls, etc). Which is totally fine with me, relationships need boundaries and communication. We only had a few requests each, and one of mine was: Don’t disrespect me with other guys...as in - I understood she is a good looking girl, and outside advances can happen - just don’t go looking for it.

Fast forward a little and she posts these stories on her IG asking her (she has like 6000 followers) followers to confide their secrets to her. Obviously guys start saying that things like “you’re so sexy” and “I’ve always had a crush on you”. So I get like annoyed and mention if she could not do that (especially since it’s something I clearly mentioned in our sit down). She says she understands where I’m coming from. Great.

Less than an hour later she posts another few responses from her ‘IG story’ and one of them is: “I’ve always liked you hehe 😍”. So I just snapped a little and told her we need a break. I just don’t feel like she’s holding up her half of this whole thing. AITA?",45,106,0.94

I thought, great, that's fine none of my business and I'm glad she's moving on. We had a small on and off thing in school a few years back but still managed to stay friends after. 

Anyway, recently she keeps sending me Snapchats at ungodly hours of them both in bed clearly naked (under the covers) after what I'd assume was them having sex. The sends wierd messages with them like ""this guy woke me up at 2am!"" or just one word messages like ""hi"" or ""happy"". Mind you this is usually out of the blue and we haven't been talking for at least 6 or 7 hours or even a couple days. 

To me it seems like she's trying to purposefully show off that she's having sex with this guy, I don't really care I just think it's weird to send that sort of thing to anyone.

There was no actual nudity, Just them under the covers clearly naked every time, sometimes sweaty but always in bed clearly naked. 

I'm bi but I've never came out to her and even if she did find out from someone else I've never been the GBF type, I pride myself with being a butch kind of gay (no offence to anyone else, just my preference). But I don't think this is relevant becuase I wouldn't send pics of me with a girl to my male friends, it's still wierd. She knows I feel uncomfortable talking about sex with my female friends, I know it seems immature but I just don't like it.

The guy participates in the pics, arm round her and all that so he either doesn't know who the pics are going to or doesn't know the relationship history. Feel bad for the guy. 

And finally, she thinks I should be happy for her and there's nothing wrong with sending those pics (although not lude, private) so I shouldn't be upset/uncomfortable.

She tells me that she supports any decision I make and ultimately it’s up to me of course - but also keeps banging the same drum on how it makes her sad and that she feels like I’m choosing a car over her. It does flick my guilt switch pretty hard. I’m thinking about just finding a beater for the mean time to try and make the best of both worlds - but it’s hard to let go of this car I’m looking at. 

I rarely put my own desires ahead of people, but this is sort of how I see this situation:

She could be living with me right now, but she’s created parameters stopping that from happening for herself. Instead, she wants me to save more and live somewhere to pay more rent than I currently am.

She’s also quite self aware of the fact that her mindset is stopping her from being able to get what she ultimately wants (living together), yet I feel like a dick for upsetting her because we won’t move out just quite as soon as we could. I feel like a bit of a dick in this scenario, because I do want to move out together and would love to have our own place despite paying a little more and I feel like getting this car would show otherwise. 

However I also don’t feel like my desires are unreasonable - we’ll still move out together most likely within the year and I will also get the car I really want. 

So Reddit, if you made it through all that faff, WIBTA for buying a car?

Edit: Thanks for all the input everyone. I’ll reply to you all throughout the day since I uploaded this just before I went to bed and now I’m at work. 

Edit 2: The financial safety net is more her idea, but something I definitely agree with. It’s a smart move and I want to do it as well. Also, apologies for wording it poorly and making it sound like it’s just me that needs to do it - that isn’t the case. She does as well, and already has. So getting this car creates the whole ‘waiting on me’ scenario. 

Final note: thanks everyone for your input. I’ve actually talked with her about it some more today and she went out of her way to reassure me that she understands me scenario and supports any decision knowing and trusting I know the best course for myself. She made it especially clear that telling me how it bumming her out a bit was just her expressing how she felt about it all, but in no way was intending to sway me towards bailing on the car.

928,Not the A-hole,"Today is my son's 4th birthday. Monday and Tuesday his daycare had to call me because he was misbehaving. In the past we have had some problems and I have done the same thing as always (taking away toys, time out, and writing the alphabet). This morning he woke up and I was very cheerful happy birthday... Etc. However, I did tell him if I get a call from the school that he isn't behaving he won't be allowed to open his presents today. I told my mother this plan and she though I was in the wrong that he's four and deserves to celebrate his birthday fully anyway. Additionally we brought in cup cakes but I told his teacher not to give him any if he wasn't behaving. I'm trying to raise a kid that won't be an a**hole... ",302,886,0.94
929,Not the A-hole,"TLDR My roommates got a second dog without asking as I'm allergic I told them that it was super disrespectful and they should return it or compensate me in some way. They returned it but are making it out like I'm the bad guy.

So two weeks ago my roommate and I were talking about when our lease was over and what we were gonna do I said I was gonna probably move. He said he wanted to stay and have both rooms to him and his wife and that they wanted to get a second dog after my partner and I moved out. I said as long as it's after we move out totally cool with me. 

Fast forward to last weekend they texted our group chat saying that they were looking at puppies in the area. And sent us a pic of the puppy they wanted and asked if we were cool with them bringing it home. We told them we could discuss later that night and come to a decision then.

I lay down to sleep after work day when my partner wakes me up saying that our roommates had come home with the puppy. So I get out of bed so we can all have a conversation with them about it. Now I'm not gonna lie I was pretty pissed seeing as I'm allergic to dogs and it's not hypoallergenic unlike their other dog. But I was calm when speaking to them, I told them it was incredibly disrespectful that they brought the dog into the apartment without asking and that they shouldn't have done it and that as I pay half rent I have the right to say I don't want another dog in the apartment. They said okay and they would return it.

The next afternoon we text them asking when the dog was going to be headed back. They said we needed to talk about it. So they come out and flat out say no the dog is not leaving and that they're gonna just leave it in their room the whole time. Now other than the fact that the poor dog would be stuck in a small room, they already said that about their previous dog which they let out of their room all the time. So we firmly say that's not gonna work. And they just leave. 

Two days later we text them saying hey we gotta be compensated in some way or you need to return the dog. They say that they are going to return the dog and that we are awful people because the two dogs are getting along so well.

So they returned the dog to my knowledge and we've just been ignoring each other ever since. So AITA?

930,Not the A-hole,"For context, I am a 20 year old female, who has been diagnosed with severe social anxiety and depression, as well as high functioning autism. 

I don’t hate people; I’m just horrified of social interaction (most likely because of the above and people were horrible to me as a kid).

For Christmas, I asked for a pair of headphones so the long walks from my house to my job could be a little more bearable (it takes about 50 minutes to get there in the morning). I was expecting a cheap pair of £15 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn’t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.

*Context over, here’s the important stuff*:

I wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it’s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it’s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.

I’ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn’t think it was a problem.
 
However, a friend mentioned to me, that at her workplace, her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn’t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I’m weird) and that everyone thinks you’re an asshole when you do that .

I realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn’t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.

Am I the asshole?

931,Not the A-hole,"So my SO and I are both a little bit messy and I'm not nitpicky but sometimes he goes overboard with that. Like throwing a wet towel on the floor after the shower and not picking it up for hours. We don't live in a fucking hotel and I hate stepping on a wet towel. If I tell him to pick up after himself a bit he sometimes gets mad and calls me 'mom' sarcastically. Which I really hate btw. However today we got in a big argument, I made pancakes and when I put them on the table he took one with his hands and turned to the computer. I told him that there are plates and silverware and he should use this instead of eating with his hands. He got mad, called me mom, said I treat him like a five year old etc. I got mad as well because I don't want to feel like his mom, but I think it is not too much to ask for him to use a knife and a fork if he's eating something greasy. I don't care about crumbs on the floor or something, but fatty fingerprints are so unnecessary. I'm really frustrated now. Am I the asshole here or is he overreacting?

934,Not the A-hole,"A little over a month ago my girlfriend and her parents got into a fight so she came to stay with me until they made up.  I was really clear that this was just temporary until they patched things up.  

It was going fine until she started bringing one of her friends over.   I had met this girl a few times before.  I thought she was ok.  

My girlfriend is like a totally different person around her.   They both get nasty.  Really catty.  There have been a bunch of times that it’s bothered me.  

There was one time I came home and it suddenly got quiet as soon as I came in.  It was awkward so just to break the silence I said something like, “I’m beat” and they both busted out laughing hysterically.   I asked my girlfriend what was so funny and she just told me nothing.  It was kinda obvious that were laughing at my expense, whatever. 

Another time I was in my bedroom and came to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  They were in the living room.  I wasn’t paying attention to what they were saying.  I have no idea what it was about.  I thought it’d be nice to offer to make them some snacks so I started to offer and girlfriend’s friend cut me off and said, “shocker the MAN has to have an opinion about it” in a really nasty way.  I thought to myself “well fuck you too”, but just said “actually nope” and took my sandwich back to my bedroom. 

The situation that sent me over the edge though happened yesterday.   It was my last day off and I wasn’t able to relax much on Monday.   I was in the living room playing a game and they came over.  Girlfriend asked if they could have the room and I go to the bedroom.   I said “nah I’m right in the middle of this, can you guys hang out in the bedroom?”   Friend gave the most sour ducking look and my girlfriend got an attitude.  “It’s just a stupid game, you can play it anytime”.  So I said, “ yeah I can play it anytime and I’m playing it now”.  Friend mumbled something I couldn’t hear and they went to the bedroom.  It’s a small apartment and I could hear them both bitch about me even with the tv on.  

My girlfriend is usually such a sweet and funny person, but when her friend is around it’s like a switch flips and she’s a totally different person.  I don’t get it.   I don’t really want to, I just don’t want to deal with it anymore.  I want to tell her not to bring her friend here anymore.  Also maybe start pushing her to try talking to her parents again.

I served two tours in the Middle East, was discharged due to an injury that I have since recovered from. I’m more than happy to discuss anything about that, but I immediately became hesitant when she asked me if I had ever “taken anyone’s life.” 

I was silent for a couple of seconds before replying, “no, I was lucky enough to not see much action.” She seemed satisfied and moved on, the thing is I have, it’s something that still sits with me to this day.

He also posted yesterday a picture that said ‘if you friendzone me then help me fuck your other friends bestie’.

937,Not the A-hole,"On Saturday night my girlfriend picked me up from my house to hang out and have dinner. I decided to stay the night and go home in the morning. Well It was a wonderful day to go out and take a walk. I even offered to take her dogs for a walk earlier in the morning. Which she said no and gave no reason for. After sitting around waiting for her to be ready to take me home. I thought it would be a good idea to just walk. So I went into her room she was about to shower. Told her I was leaving and I would see her later. She asked if someone was picking me up, I said no I was going to walk. She starts saying I wont be much longer just a shower and I can take you. I said its cool Ill just walk I want to anyways. She then starts making up excuses as to why I shouldn't walk. Its to far, no one walks home, offers to take me home then. I told her it is not that far of a walk, I like to walk and don't worry about. She gets pissed off and just jumps in the shower without saying anything after that. I went for my walk.

Some info about the walk. It was at 11:00am on a Sunday morning in one of the more wealthy parts of town. According to google maps it is 4miles, one street all the way down crosses 2 intersections. No big deal I have walked further then this before.

I was having a wonderful walk get about half way there when she calls yelling and screaming at me for walking home. Telling me I better get in the car when she pulls up. I start thinking to myself what is this nonsense. It is just walk but whatever I will get in the car. When I get in the car she starts yelling and screaming telling me to never do that again and that I shouldn't have gone on the walk. I say it was just a walk it is not that far anyways. I was really enjoying it. She doesn't seem to care and start exaggerating on the distance of the walk. I don't really say much kinda in shock that she is yelling at me like I am a child. We get to the house I get out of the car she slams on her gas and drives off. I then receive a text saying never do that in my presence again. I respond with I will do whatever I want. It was just a walk. This breaks off into a whole different argument that I will spare the details of. Unless wanted.  So Am I? I am very confused on this still.

942,Not the A-hole,"So this friend of mine (lets call him Vlad) is getting married in 2 months. Invitations only arrived about a month ago. He is not having any bridal party and no best man (neither is she for the record). He's a very indecisive guy who tends to go along with whatever is going on but never leads and rarely makes his opinion known. 

Another friend of ours (Miguel) setup a group chat between 5 of his friends to plan his bachelor party as a committee of sorts. After everyone cited interest, after a week no one added anything resembling a plan or idea. I took up the reigns and thought of an idea (vacation house in the mountains with some activity during the day like paintball) and a weekend. Everyone said they were down. 

I message Vlad and squeeze out of him that he wants about 10 people max and weekend long only. No week long party with 30 dudes. I ask him for who he would like to invite; we have a large group of old frat guys which could easily reach the 30. I get no answer. I message him twice more every 2 says. He says he's busy and will let me know. Nothing. I message his fiance to ask him to send me invite list so I know who to invite and make sure people can make the weekend I suggested. She agrees. No response from him. At the suggestion of Miguel, I compile a list of 10 guys and send it to Vlad to add or remove as he wished. Adding that time was a factor. 6 days later, no response.

2 days ago I find an amazing house with indoor pool, sauna, hot tub, fire pit, secluded, enough space for everyone, and at an unbelievable low price that I negotiated with the owner. I call Vlad and tell him that I really need an answer. That I'm not asking a lot from him but this is important and urgent. I tell him I need an answer by 8pm that night (so that I can honor the incredibly generous price I got for the house, I don't tell Vlad this). He agrees. No answer that night. Next day, no answer. 

I vent to Miguel who reaches out to Vlad and gets an agreement on the weekend I suggested and agrees to the invite list I compiled. Still not a word to me. 

At this point, I'm still going to go to whatever bachelor party gets planned but unless I'm asked to do something specific (please bring X, Y,Z, call to schedule this or that) I'm going to take a very firm back seat.

My wife thought she saw it right when he walked through the door. So sketchy immediately. She asked him directly if he had a gun, but he didn’t answer her. I knew none of this until later after everyone had left. We had a nice evening and all, but he tells us the next day that he actually had a gun on him the whole time. He thinks nothing of this, so now I’m wondering if IATA for being mad about him not notifying me of the gun in my house in the first place. 

Don’t get me wrong, I don’t have a problem with guns. I just want to be aware of the number of weapons that are moving in and out my house, especially around my children! Is that too much to ask? I think he is responsible and all, but why not disclose that info from the start? 

Anyways, my main thing here is that if you are going over to a friend’s house (in a decent neighborhood too) to hang out, why not just leave it at home or in the car? Or maybe notify your host that you’re packing? That being said, should guests tell their hosts they are carrying a weapon?

F: Freind
B: friends boyfriend
HR: me 

TL/DR: My friend told me her boyfriend and her age play. When I learned this I physically gagged, and she looked hurt. On a side note, my dad is in jail for sexually assaulting a 16 year old and she knows it's a sensitive subject for me.

Long story:

Backstory: back in 2013 my real dad was arrested for sexual assaulting a minor (also my third cousin). He is going on parole in late 2019 and I've told my close friends this (including F) and they understand it's a sensitive matter for me.

Me and F have been friends for years, and with us both being 16 (sophomores in high school) we have a decent amount of classes together. We are very close and open with eachother. During some classes we able to just sit down and talk, and lunch also. She often tells me about her and her boyfriend, but she kind of talks about her sex life too often. She talks about it constantly, and in explicit detail, but normally it's normal stuff, like bdsm or her daddy kink. I kind of found this weird, but I just figured it was her teenage hormones and stuff. It never really bothered me. 

Me and B are also good friends, hes not AS open as F but you can tell it's there, B is kind of an r/neckbeard without a neck beard (bad BO, uwu anime xd, waifus, and so many bad things in his search history). Overall good and he doesnt bother me much either.

Well, one day in gym we were talking while exercising. She was, of course, telling me about her sex life. She then casually mentioned to me she was into ageplay.

F: ""yeah, me and my boyfriend are doing this new thing where, basically, my mental age is low and I have to obey him and be punished if I dont""

HR: *visibly disgusted* ""...um, that sounds a lot like age play.""

F: ""oh, yeah! It IS!"" 

That's when I gag. I tried to hold it in, but it slipped. F looked visibly hurt, and retaliated, trying to say things like ""but OTHER girls like calling their bfs daddy!"" And stuff like that. I felt guilty for gagging, but she knows about my situation. I even tried to explain to her ""dude, you know what my dad did. I'm sorry, but I dont like it when people roleplay as kids for sexual pleasure."" Me and her got into an argument about it and she refused to talk to me until gym was over. I kind of feel guilty about at it but at the same time I just cant fathom the idea of roleplaying as children, even if it's supposed to be a way to bond with your partner, after i saw how traumatized my cousin was. F seems ok with it now and we've dropped the argument but, again, I still kind of feel guilty. So AITA?",52,44,0.69

In the last 5 or so years however, they've made it progressively harder to find reason to respect them other than the whole ""you're my moms parents"" thing. They've always been conservative, but they've fallen HARD into all the shit that's going on today. We have a family rule not to talk about politics at family gatherings because it always ends in an argument, but my grandfather always finds a way to inject some racist remark into the conversation. It's gotten to the point where no one even enjoys getting together anymore because everyone's tiptoeing around each other trying not to set someone off. My entire family is being held emotionally hostage because no one wants to say something that would trigger grandpa and get him ranting about some racist , xenophobic shit.

My fiance and I have been together for four years, and we've lived together for almost three of those. Everyone in my family knows except my grandparents who would throw a fit if they found out. It's to the point where if we're spending the night at my parents on a holiday we put our things in separate bedrooms to keep up a facade that we're not going to sleep together. And in conversations I often find myself having to lie to pretend we're still living apart. I put up with it because it's just not worth the shit it would start, but I'm fucking tired of it.

My brother and his wife just announced they're pregnant. Super exciting, until I find out that when they told my grandparents, my grandfather decided to lecture her about how a child needs their mother and it would be irresponsible of her to keep working after having the child. She just started working her first job in the field she went through six years of intense schooling for last year.

Now fast forward to a couple weeks ago. We were in the process of calling everyone in our family to announce our engagement. As expected everyone was very excited and congratulatory, then we get to my grandparents. The first words out of my grandfather's mouth were ""well you better hurry up!"" as in, ""you better do it soon or we won't be around to see it"".

My fiance and I laughed it off, but on the inside I actually thought to myself for the first time ""good"". There's a lot of other shit going on in our lives right now, so we were planning on a long engagement anyway. We're not planning on having the kind of traditional wedding they'd be happy with, so I'm sure they'd have something to say about that, and I really just don't want what's supposed to be a fun celebration sullied by their bullshit.

I honestly have no problem feeding him, or any other guests in my house. I'd be more than happy to whip up a meal, but my boyfriend is a grazer and eats all of my snacks. A thing of Oreos lasts me a month and he will eat all of them in one sitting. Same with cereal, Pop Tarts, cheese, chips, a jar of PB, etc. I don't eat junk food very often so these things last me awhile.

It's now apparent that the younger is catching up and although he has some issues, he's becoming pretty typical for his age. 

It was brought to my attention by my wife that I totally favor the older child. I was doing so without realizing it and the more I thought about it it's true. I regard my eldest as my precious first born that I would do anything for. I dote on him and help him through any tantrums he may have over his inflexibilities. I play with him and smile and laugh and truly enjoy my time with him. 

As for my younger child I love him as my child but oftentimes I treat him the way I would treat someone else's kid.  He's around, he's ok, but whatever.  I sometimes feel like playing with him is a chore and I definitely don't enjoy it as much as when I play with my older one.  I don't feel as close to him and when he tantrums over something dumb that a typical 3 yr old tantrums over I just let him tantrum and cry it out.  Sometimes I can't stand him and try to avoid him.

We make talk about our day and later his gf comes home (they live together) and grabs him by the shirt and basically caveman drags him back to the bedroom. Since then they've fucked 3-4 times a week I don't really keep track, but I feel so fucking awkward. it's weird when you know what your brother is into..

anyway I asked after a couple weeks of this if they could do it when I'm not around and he apologized but told me he's not gonna change how he does stuff in his own house. Fair enough, I guess. I know your girl makes you shine her boots (??is that actually a kink) and tells you to slap her so hard she needs a neck brace and I'm not judging but it's really LOUD. it doesn't even sound like sex, she says something ridiculous like that and all I hear is giggles from her it's so weird

He's been with his girlfriend for a year, she's a real sweet girl but she has the mouth of a sailor, it can really give a guy whiplash tbh but I don't really have an issue with it, I think she didn't mean to be so harsh because it's just the way she is but she came up to me the next day and called me an asshole. Said I don't have the right to dictate what she does ""in her own fucking house"", said I'm not her fucking dad, told me to gtfo if I don't like it

I told my brother his gf was out of line and she basically had a meltdown and told me she has plenty of dildos if I need to replace the stick in my ass with ""something better"" and said I need to get laid and not ""fucking worry what she's doing with (brother)""

I don't fucking care what they do!!! the problem is I can hear everything!! how can i stay out of their business if they make it my business??

My brother stepped in and told me he'd get me some headphones, but then his girlfriend went off again about how this is her house too and she didn't want ""your asshole brother"" here (it isn't even her house, my brother bought it) Now they're arguing over this and I feel bad but I don't think I was being  an asshole

tldr brother's girlfriend is really mad that I asked them not to have loud sex while I'm in the house

edit: okay, the comments really didn't go the way I thought they would... I really didn't think I was the asshole here but clearly I am. I'm going to apologize to his girlfriend when she wakes up and take my brother up on his headphone offer if she doesn't still want me gone. Thanks, reddit!",52,79,0.89

952,Not the A-hole,"This situation I got myself in has me laughing and a little annoyed. 

So I’ve been seeing a new girl from tinder for a couple weeks but we’ve been hanging out a lot more than I usually hang out with tinder girls. We first met up 2 weeks ago at my house and hung out 5 times already and I weirdly already met her mom who thinks highly of me. 

Anyways, we planned to hangout Saturday after she went shopping with her mom. I text her earlier in the day to ask what time she was thinking of coming. I see her call me like 10 mins later but don’t answer because I didn’t feel like talking and I was about to take a nap (Why do people gotta call when you text them... like just text back smh). 

So I call her like an hour later. She says she can come around 6 and I say, “I can’t wait until my tongue is in your pooper again” . I don’t hear anything for a few seconds and I say “hello?” and then she hangs up. She texts me 20 mins later and calls me an asshole because I was on speaker and her mom heard and her mom doesn’t know we had sex yet. So she cancelled the plans and idk if we’ll hang again. 

First I’m thinking wtf was the point of putting me on speaker phone? Why can’t you just talk like normal person and not have everyone around you hear your convo? But then I kinda feel bad because her mom had respect for me now idk if I’d be able to look her in the eyes after that lol. So Am I the asshole?? ",23,62,0.95
953,Everyone Sucks,"My boyfriend and I met online and we've been together for almost four years and have yet to meet in person. We're both in our late 20's(Both of us are 27). We both have jobs and live by ourselves. I love this man and I'm sure he loves me as well and the only issue I have is when it comes to our future.

I've brought up visiting several times. Usually it gets brushed aside. Other times he tells me it's just a bad time but doesn't really give a reason. It just sort of blows my mind because he always makes comments that hint towards visiting/living together like ""I can't wait to take you to this place"" or ""It's gonna be nice having you here to help"", ""It's gonna be fun doing this when you're here"", etc etc.

I know the thought of him cheating will come up. Is it possible? I guess, but I have no proof and no reason to believe it. We've exchanged pictures and video chat so it's not a catfishing type situation. 

I love him and want to continue to be with him. It hurts to even consider breaking up. I also want to visit him and be with him though. I can take the long distance but I need to feel like I'm working towards something.

I want to give him an ultimatum and tell him that we need to sit down and discuss this- when a visit can happen otherwise we need to break up.

Would I be an asshole for doing so?

**EDIT:**

I'm sorry if I didn't reply to a lot of comments but I read every single one and most of them made me feel bittersweet. They made me realize that it wasn't normal and what I was asking wasn't too much, however they also made me start to question things.

Barely an hour/hour and a half after I posted my boyfriend and I were talking and I decided to finally have the discussion. Several of you suggested not doing an ultimatum but definitely discussing it more seriously so I decided to do that.

I just asked him outright if we could talk about something important and I brought up needing to visit him and discuss our future. I made sure he knew how important and was to me and that even if it's something we can't do until later I just need to have something planned out.

He finally tells me that he's had trouble having anyone at his house(which from my knowledge is true. The whole time I've known him he's never mentioned even having friends over and I've never heard it) ever since he broke up with his ex. He told me that on the night they broke up she snuck into his room and raped him while he was in and out of sleep and quite drunk. It happened about 6 years ago and he says that it still bothers him. He apologized to me for pushing back the visit and said that it was something he kept putting off because it made him nervous and made him think back to that night.

I told him that I understood and that he had gone through something traumatic. We talked about it for awhile and afterwards I told him that I love him and that if he ever needs/wants to talk about it- that I'm here for him. I probably won't bring it up unless he does and wants to talk about it and otherwise I plan on just treating him how I have been. I don't want him to feel like what happened to him back then changes how I see him/love him.

We talked more and we both came to the conclusion that a visit should happen. I told him even if I need to sleep at a hotel- I want to be able to visit. I'm putting in time off for work and I've booked my ticket to see him on his birthday in May. I'm going to stay two weeks and we'll see how it goes.

Honestly, this was...a roller coaster. I'm glad that I'll finally be able to see him- beyond excited really. I'm also just livid and sad. In the beginning of the relationship he had told me that someone he trusted hurt him but I had no idea in what way and to what extent. I'm heartbroken for him and it makes me upset that his ex did that to him.

Thank you everyone for the suggestions/input/thoughts. I really do appreciate everything.

**TL;DR- My boyfriend's ex raped him in his sleep while he was drunk 6 years ago so he was nervous about having someone over at his house. I'm going to see him for 2 weeks in May.**",70,46,0.84
954,Not the A-hole,"We have been married for a long time, married really young, and our relationship is getting colder by the day because finally I made a stance on something that has been bothering me since the beginning. 

Say, I'm cleaning the bathroom and at the end of 3 hours work (we have 4 of them), she would say, ""you didn't even change the drawer liners"" (or something that is equally random to me). She didn't mention it before  . She could tell ""change the drawer liner"" and I would have been still fine with it, no ""please"" needed. But that's all she will say, nothing more or less. and when I complain she basically says it means the same thing, you still have to do it, so deal with it. 

Another example would be, ""why didn't you put my phone on charge "" you never  charge mine, I would if you tell me to, but, how you tell me matters a lot to me.

I rage with anger at this, but don't show it. What I'm trying to find out is, this is normal way of talking among couples? Am I being too sensitive for no reason? I never talk to her or anyone this way and believe I deserve the same, specifically since I don't see her talking to anyone else this way.

955,Asshole,"As long as my Fiancé (who we will call Jon) and I have been planning our wedding, he has expressed that all he wants is a simple elopement on a beach. Just the two of us exchanging vows and committing to spend our lives together. 


Due to our family that is not an option. Everyone wants to be there. As such, we have planned a big wedding that neither of us really wants. 


Jon’s sister (who we will call Emma) is getting married 9 months before us in Mexico. She is getting married on the second day of our trip. 


The rest of the family will be arriving/leaving earlier than us, and we are all doing our own thing outside of the wedding. Jon and I will be staying at a different resort than the rest of the family to save money.


I came up with the idea yesterday that maybe Jon and I should have our own private symbolic ceremony during our trip to Mexico for Emma’s wedding. 


In my mind, I don’t see why the two of us can’t head down to the beach one morning, and exchange vows in the way that both of us have always wanted. I figure as long as it is a private ceremony between the two of us, it won’t be a big deal. 


We wouldn’t tell anyone, and we would go still go through with our wedding in the winter. There would be no witnesses, so it wouldn’t even be a legal ceremony.


When I suggested this to Jon, he laughed at me. 


He said there was no point in doing a symbolic ceremony since we are spending so much money on our “real” wedding. He also told me that it was a really shitty thing to do to Emma, and that it would take away from her big day. 


I told him that this is what we’ve always wanted, and would be free since we are already paying to be there for Emma’s wedding. Also since we wouldn’t tell anyone, it wouldn’t matter. In my world, this is the perfect way to have the intimate ceremony we have always wanted, with the big ceremony/reception for our families sake.


So, AITA for wanting to get “married” during future sister-in-law’s wedding?

Clarification: Ceremony would take place at a different place/day after the rest of the family had returned home. Jon and I have planned our real wedding on the anniversary of the day we met. This would still be the day we celebrate as our anniversary, as it would be the day we actually got married, ",57,39,0.84
956,Everyone Sucks,"I was in Goodwill today and there were these two teen girls, they looked to be 15-17 and probably sisters. So there I was, minding my own business, when these two little girls start LOUDLY talking shit about my appearance. They actually said I looked homeless and questioned why anyone would choose to dress like me. I do kind of embrace the grungy, bohemianesque aesthetic, so valid on the first part, but still, RUDE. 

At first I ignored them and moved to another part of the store. The way the store is designed is that the women's clothing section is near the books and they were in the women's section when I wandered back over to peruse the books. Again, they start talking all of that shit and by this point I had had enough. So I approached them.

Me: Excuse me, did y'all have something you wanted to say to me?

They looked like deer in the headlights and claimed they didn't know what I was talking about.

Me: So I must have been hallucinating when I heard yall laughing about me being homeless???

The younger one muttered that I'm a crackhead and I went off. I started roasting them, saying they dressed like my mom in the 90's and it wasn't cool even back then, with their Steve Urkel looking selves. They got big mad and the mouthy younger one was like wE'Re fIfTeEn. It was becoming this whole thing and attracting attention, so I left. 

I think this was a great lesson for them.

957,Asshole,"This morning, I found out that my co-worker and I have the same salary. My co-worker has a physical disability that affects her productivity, to a degree that is obvious to everyone in the office. This morning, I discovered that her salary is the same as mine. 

I was a bit upset because I’m way more productive and have only had outstanding evaluations. I started researching wage parity laws and discovered that up in Washington state their legislature just passed a wage parity law for workers with mental and physical disabilities. I think this is a bad idea for so many reasons, but the important thing is my state isn’t bound by this bad policy (yet). At least none that I could find.

So I met with my boss this afternoon and requested a higher salary. He said he understands my frustration and he’ll discuss the issue with HR. I told him my main issue is that I want my compensation to be reflective of my work and if it means either I get a raise or she (the disabled worker) gets a pay reduction, I’m ok with it. Obviously I don’t wish my co-worker ill will and prefer it to be a raise for me. I talked to my sister about this and she told me I was being an ass. She’s kind of PC. I really don’t feel that’s the case. I want my salary to reflect my value to the company and that is not too much to ask. Am I right? 

Edit/Info: salary for us = base salary + benefits + bonus. For the same position, the base pay will be fairly similar but it does differ depending on the hire's years of experience and negotiating skills at the time of contracts. Where there can be a rather sizeable difference is in the annual bonus.

Update: Sorry for the brief update. The mods asked me to write here since it hasn’t been a day yet. In the end, I didn’t get the raise I asked for because there isn’t anything HR can do about compensation until the next contract cycle. What I got was a lot more meaningful and lasting, however.

1. My boss was so impressed with my professionalism and courage in discussing a thorny personnel issue that he offered me additional opportunities that go beyond the scope of my current responsibilities. He had been deciding between me and another worker in the group for these professional development opportunities, but he was impressed by my discussion with him yesterday, helping him make the final decision. These opportunities will take me on work travel with him in the next few months to company-wide work groups and meetings where I will present. These opportunities are meant to increase my exposure to other parts of the corporation and facilitate interaction with folks at the executive level. He was quite frank: I’m being groomed for the next level and he has recommended me as a candidate for a position that will come up within the next year. 

2. My boss already noticed I had been editing, refining, and polishing my disabled colleague’s work product without being asked. My colleague has real productivity issues and since I already mastered my responsibilities and am more efficient, I had been covering problems created by her performance. He realized he did not document this in his last annual review and already added a letter in my file to document additional merit. This will mean more bonus supposedly. However, he now wants me to focus my extra time on professional development with him, which means my disabled colleague’s deficits will be even more apparent. Unfortunate.

3. Perhaps most important, I learned to trust my instinct. Speak up even when people might (gasp) think you’re an asshole. 

Thank you so much everyone! Lots of good news today and so glad I approached my boss yesterday!",318,247,0.77
958,Not the A-hole,"Currently having an arguement with a friend and I thought what better way to solve this than posting it on here. 

I am a teacher at a school for students with social/emotional disabilities. We have 20 yo students who will just barely make it out of high school. I told my friend that last year I suggested to a few students they could pursue being a garbage man.  My friend asked ""why would you do that. Tell them to get into STEM.""

""Why wouldn't I tell kids making potentially $80k/year, retiring with benefits without going to college is an option?"" 
My thinking is this, at least in my school, I know which kids are already destined for STEM, They like science technology and math, they aren't at my school because they aren't academically studious. I'm not telling those kids not to go after their dreams. I'm talking about the kid that absolutely won't make it through 4 years of college.as sad as that may sound, it's a fact. They can't concentrate, they don't do homework, they have a plethora of social and emotional disabilities that inhibit their potential. I like to think I try to give that student hope by helping them understand there are careers out there that don't require you to go to college. My friend sees it differently.

""Anyone can get into STEM at any age"". 
""Maybe students should have been told to get into STEM when they were in high school."" 
His reasoning is for higher pay ceilings, because of aspiration. ""How can you tell kids not to have aspirations"". He says you can get into any entry level IT position without college. And the point is to build a skill set to leverage and build upon. Which I get and understand. But to me, not everyone has that drive to be something or be a millionaire. A lot of my kids literally live everyday with a survival mentality. 

""As a teacher, isn't your job to get these children to want to learn?"" He says my job isn't to enable that mentality to be complacent.  And by me telling my students to become garbage men, that's exactly what I am doing. 

I have a hard enough time as it is trying to get them to listen to me. They're high school students, they know way more than me (sarcasm), but that's how they really think. 

My friend says an IT helpdesk person makes $30k but they have a clear path to potentially make hundreds of thousands in their lifetime. And a garbage man doesn't have that path. 

So, am I the asshole for not helping these kids see what they can potentially be? According to my friend, my telling even 1 student that it's ok to be a garbage man is too many.

959,Not the A-hole,"I’m a white gay male in the United States. I was in class at college, and we were discussing the power of words in cultures, particularly in minority cultures.

While we were all discussing the word ‘bitch’, a black female classmate voiced her frustration with “gay guys calling girls ‘bitch’, and because the guy is gay, that makes it okay?” She went on to say that if a gay guy casually calls her bitch (context of something like, “bitch, please...”), that she would then see it as okay to say similar things to him, except with the word “faggot”. 

I personally do not believe in the concept of “taking the power away from words” by limiting its acceptable use to the group of people who were oppressed by its use against them in the past. I personally detest hearing other gay men calling one another ‘homo’ or ‘queer’ in a casual way like that (I have maybe once or twice EVER heard the words ‘fag’ or ‘faggot’ used that way). I believe a group of people trying to take the power away from a word by publicly using it amongst themselves, while demanding no one else use it (and further condemning anyone who does), only further segregates the group in a collective society. 

I knew this would be a controversial issue, but I felt the classroom was an appropriate place to have a real dialogue about it (especially since it was on-topic with the lecture that day). So, I voiced that I disagreed with her view. I explained my stance very much like I have here. I went on to say that I feel calling a gay person ‘faggot’, is akin to calling someone ‘n-word’ (I said the word itself). 

I felt that in an academic environment where the power and impact of words is at the core of the discussion, that it was necessary to convey the argument by relating the powerful reactions we can have to these words. However, my classmate did not seem to see it that way. She said she couldn’t believe I actually said that to her. I explained as I just did here, about the environment we were in and the discussion at hand, and that I felt it was not out of line, reiterating I felt it was important for comparing the impact of the two words. She simply said, “fuck you, asshole”, and walked out of the classroom. 

No one raised their voices or anything; she and I were both calm throughout the exchange, even through to her leaving the classroom. After class, I asked the professor if it was inappropriate what I said. She said she agreed with my point about being in an academic environment while discussing the power of such words, and that she felt the impact indeed had value for equal context. 

I never heard anything else about this incident. However, my classmate never came back to the class, and I hate to think I caused her to drop a class over this. Was I an asshole to use the n-word like that?",627,296,0.85

962,No A-holes here,"Throwaway, because my wife knows my reddit account.

&#x200B;

Let me start off by saying I love my wife. She's the best thing that ever happened to me. She also loves surprises. The problem is that she has the patience of a small child on a sugar high. She will go through any lengths necessary to find her gift. If there is a holiday or her birthday coming up she will start insistently asking me what her gift is, if I can give her any hints, etc: This is fine to me. I simply respond, ""You'll see..."" and that's that. The issue is that she will ceaselessly attempt to find her gift, and I am no match for her detective skills. I have tried every hiding spot in the house, but she finds them all. Even the garden shed is no match for her. So next I tried leaving her gifts under the seat in my car. It took her less than 2 days to find it. No joke, I once buried a gift out of frustration (but the dog dug it up, so not really her fault). Not even digital gifts are safe. I bought tickets, and she found the email receipt on my phone. She gets so giddy whenever she finds my new hiding spot. It's like she is on a scavenger hunt, but I am tired of playing this game. I am out of places to hide stuff. I wish I could just bring home a gift a week before her birthday and remain confident that she will not see it until her actual birthday.

&#x200B;

Recently, we had an argument about it that got fairly heated. I told her that I am simply going to give her the gift and not try to hide it anymore. She countered that I was taking away the best part of the gift giving process simply because I was really bad at hiding stuff. She seemed really upset, but at the same time I am mentally exhausted from trying to outsmart my overly curious wife. So, AITA?

EDIT: Thank you to all who posted. I have decided that I was *probably* being a bit a-hollish. Clearly, the hunt is more enjoyable to my wife than the gift itself.

963,Not the A-hole,"So while I was married to my ex, his sister lived with us for a while. She and her 2 young daughters lived with us in our outbuilding, which is converted to a bar, for about 3 years.
The place had plumbing and a small stove, so she could be pretty much self sufficient and not bother us too much.

Once her financial position changed, she was able to move on. When I say her financial position changed,  she won a settlement of approx  $250 000 (not my currency, but approx to USD value) from a medical malpractice  lawsuit that she won.

To sum it up, my boyfriend left his laptop open with an anime gif up on it. I went over to look and he was logged into an anime subreddit, so I clicked his profile history and he's very active in that community. This was weird because he never mentioned an interest in anime before. I didn't say anything but I started paying more attention and the next time he left his laptop open I seen he had an account on an anime viewing website and has watched *alot* of series.

He works in a lumber yard and is the exact opposite guy you would think would like anime. I asked him about it and he admitted he was a big fan and that he never told me because people look down on the community so we left it at that

But in all honesty it does somewhat lessen my attraction to him. I find it really childish, we're both in our twenties and I'd like my partner to be a bit more grown up and masculine. I used to watch some when I was a teenager but I feel like we should be past that now. I have trouble seeing him as the rugged guy I used to see him as even though I wish it wasn't like that.

965,No A-holes here,"This is probably a weird one lol but I actually got some really helpful feedback last time I posted here, so I wanted to try it again. 

I just had a baby on Feb 8th. She came via a scheduled c section and was a little over 3 weeks early. I always planned to breastfeed for at least a month because of the medicine I'm on. It would help keep her from having any withdrawal symptoms, which it did. 

The reason we had to take her early is because I had an umbilical cord aneurysm, which is an extremely rare and dangerous condition, and she was smaller than she should be. She was measuring about 2-3 weeks behind what her gestational age was. So, I had her and she was tiny, 5 pounds 4 ounces, but otherwise healthy. I have tried breastfeeding 3 out of 4 of my kids and I always end up supplementing because I don't make enough milk. With my girl being so small, the Drs recommended supplementing with formula anyways, to help her gain weight. She's a little over a month now and weighs 7 pounds. 

Now here's the thing, I hate breastfeeding. It's time consuming, its uncomfortable, it's sweet and a great bonding experience sometimes when she actually latches on, but she's not great at that likely because of her being premature, so I have to pump. I don't make a lot of milk at all. I make maybe 5 ounces a day. And that's if I pump consistently every couple of hours. Pumping takes about 20 minutes each time. 

So, even though I know breastmilk is better as far as nutrition and all that, I want to quit. I feel like it takes up so much of my day and for very little payoff. I'd rather spend that time with my kids or snuggling my girl. So, would I be an asshole? ",36,42,0.94

I said that I am, but I just like to have something to do with my hands while I'm watching something. He said he would prefer I pay full attention and to please put down the knitting. I said no, I'd really prefer to be able to knit, that I'm not distracted, I am fully capable of doing both at once, and that I do it all the time.   


He got very annoyed and told me I was being rude and disrespectful, and if I didn't put it away, we would stop watching. I had a feeling this would ruin the whole weekend so I just put down my knitting, he said thank you, and we continued. Halfway into the movie, he picked up his phone and started doing something. I paused the movie and asked him why it was okay for him to do that but I couldn't knit? He got annoyed and slammed down his phone. We finished the movie and he stomped off to play video games. I turned on the tv show I've been going through (Awkward.) and continued knitting.   


The next day, he told me that he thinks it's rude to knit through a movie and through TV shows, and that it makes me come across like I have ADHD and am a toddler who can't sit still. I explained that I've always done things like this. When I was a kid, my parents would draw or color with us while we watched TV. When I learned to sew, I'd watch Arthur and sew. When I picked up knitting, I would watch TV, or read, or even take walks with my mom if it was portable. I always feel better if I'm making something instead of just sitting there. 

But I also listen to music and run. Or listen to audiobooks while I'm at work. I love multitasking. I love media and I love to be productive and I love being creative. Perfect, right?

He told me it was rude and that when we do something, to please put 100% of my focus into it instead of paying attention to my knitting. I told him that if that's really an expectation he has, I didn't think this relationship would have a long future, because I am not going to just sit there and watch TV and do nothing else.  I explained that I find it very boring and lazy to just sit there and watch TV, and while I get how other people find joy in just doing nothing, I don't. 

For the record, I asked if he felt like I was ignoring him, or not paying enough attention to him, etc, but he said that isn't the issue, just that I should be more respectful when I am watching TV or Movies because the creators work very hard and it's insulting that I won't pay full attention.

968,Not the A-hole,"Hey,
Thanks for reading, I'm using a throwaway account because this isn't a great thing to be wondering and in all honesty I'm hoping to be the asshole in this scenario.

Anyway brief backstory, my girlfriend and I have been together a while now and have a child together, I'm early thirties and she's mid twenties.
She has quite a heartbreaking backstory involving a few horrific things that she has trusted me enough to tell me. Although she has a tendency to defend the people who have caused her the greatest pain. 

Anyway back the original reason I'm here. My girlfriends relationship with her father is almost childlike in its nature. Anything he says is treated as gospel, we can have a conversation about anything and I can make a suggestion and I'm told I'm wrong only for him to make the same suggestion and it's the best suggestion since sliced bread. She's horrendously jealous about anyone who comes near him romantically, full on family feuds with his wife, girlfriend on the side etc. The wife by the way isn't her mum. For instance the other day we were at her mothers and she made a comment about him moving back to where originally came from would be good so that way no one hes currently romantically linked to could see him and he wouldn't be having relations with anyone. Everyone at the table kind of felt weird, you could tell.
She has never dated anyone who is of the same ethnicity as her dad, she's mixed race, for the exact reason that is would remind her of him. She still on a near daily basis with siblings on her side ensures that everyone knows she's the favourite and daddy's little princess. It's almost gets to me how it's obvious she holds him in higher regard than our own daughter. Not obviously, just little things like being obviously more excited for his birthday when I've had to make sure the moneys there for our daughters birthday as she hasn't planned ahead, marking the calendar with only his birthday etc. 
Last year we had to make the annual trip to where he lives to be with him on his birthday, which coincides with a major holiday, only for him to be out with whoever and when I said let's go home and celebrate said holiday with our family, we couldn't, we had to wait for him to come back? Why? I'm not saying hes out of order he may well have had plans and she didn't ring ahead but it's her attitude to all this I'm interested in this scenario.

Is this normal? Am I reading into this too much? I genuinely don't know, its certainly not normal within my family but then different doesn't mean wrong.",22,32,0.92

Hey again everyone. I finally have answers.

I never gave fake names to anyone so my date is now Alice and her sister is Gabby.

On Saturday I got a Facebook message from Gabby. It boiled down to ""This is stupid, will you meet Alice so she can properly explain?"" I try to get an explanation straight from her, but she refused and so on Sunday I go to a coffee shop to figure out wtf is going on. 

She was cute, my crush was strong, but I managed to sit down with a decent poker face. She pretty much burst into tears the moment I arrived. Lots of sorrys until she pulled herself together and I really nearly bolted bc I felt so awkward. 

Gabby was the one to suggest Alice use her pictures. Alice showed me her phone and... it was a picture of her from a few months ago and she swiped through and there were more pictures, ones she said she was gonna put on Tinder. All of herself... and she was bigger. 

I feel really fucking dumb. Still. Alice has been losing weight over this last year (down over 100 pounds!!!) and didn't have any flattering pictures bc she's continuing her diet and shredding weight off and her and her sister didn't know how to portray that on Tinder without scaring everyone off. So that's why Gabby suggested she use her pics bc they believe Alice will look like her soon (tho she has probably several months to go before she's close if I'm being honest, not that I care. Never did just thought I was being lied to).

When I sent the screenshot, she panicked and blocked me out of embarrassment/shame and it took a talking from her sis to meet me and come clean. I'm the first guy she's gone on a date with that wanted a second date so... fuck. Sucks to be all those other guys I guess because I'm taking her out this weekend again. 

I'm gonna be cautious moving forward bc that was a shit ton of drama for a first date, but I don't know. Maybe I'm being dumb? She's real sweet and we share the same hobbies and she's even pretty when she cries and my pa always told me that's how you know you're in it for the long haul and holy fuck I need to calm my crush down. This feels like high school again.

And that's that. Just wanted to clear up the catfish fiasco since I got a good many comments and PMs. Thanks again for helping me set my head on straight.",891,21677,0.92
971,No A-holes here,"Before we met, my fiancé Brad went to college; his parents did not contribute financially. So in addition to government loans, Brad took out an informal, low-interest loan from his grandfather to help pay for school. After graduation, Brad's uncle, who was in charge of Brad's grandfather's money, suggested that he address the government loans before repaying the private loan.

After paying off the government loans, Brad started paying off the loan from his grandfather, at which point his grandfather died. Brad's uncle divided the estate between his siblings and shorted Brad's parents the outstanding loan. Now Brad's parents are calling in to collect.

The balance is somewhat less than my non-retirement savings since I left undergrad, a few years before Brad did. I anticipate repaying the loan in full after the wedding, but it'll set us back on getting a house at least five years.

I've expressed my feelings to Brad, a few close friends and my family; everyone but Brad seems to be pretty unimpressed by his parents. There's some growing resentment on my part, for a handful of reasons:

* they intend to use the money to supplement the retirement they ignored for the last 20+ years
* the collected sum will have almost no effect on their retirement's overall trajectory, but *would* have a significant effect on ours
* Brad's parents were unwilling to contribute to his education, but have no issues with collecting money they never really earned in the first place because of it

35m with my wife 30f with two kids. Been together ten years. 

Up until 18 months ago our sex life had ups and downs but was over all pretty good. Then one day it stopped, all intimacy stopped. We saw counselors, marriage and sex, and since then everything but sexuality has gotten better than ever, like really really awesome. Intimacy is a slow roll over the last 18 months, but still hardly at the cuddle for more than 10 minutes a week. Basically no sexuality, 3 quickies over the 18 months.

She says she's trying. She has anxiety issues and is incapable of the lead up, it's all end goal for her, but that means unless the world's align there is no start, I can't kiss her neck randomly, or graze my hand otherwise I'm pushed away and called annoying.

Over the last 6 weeks she has three times said we are going to do something more intimate, bath or more, but it wouldn't happen, it would be oh tomorrow, oh the next day, and then nothing.

974,Not the A-hole,"Okay. Throwaway account. 

I am a 23 year old female. I have been in a relationship with 25m for over 5 years, living together for 2. A week ago, I found out that I was pregnant. Trust me when I say, we were being as safe as possible and it was a HUGE shock to us. We both talked and agreed that abortion is the best answer. 

So, we made an appointment with the doctor. We have a mandatory reflection period after the first appointment and before the procedure. My next appointment is 3 days from today. 

So, last friday, I started feeling overwhelmed at work and was kinda losing it in the bathroom when a coworker walked in. She is really sweet and one of the senior managers who helped me out a lot in the beginning. I spilled my beans and she was very comforting and calming me. But later that day, she asks me if I was willing to have the baby, so that she and her husband can adopt. Turns out both her and her husband have fertility issues and there was no way to get pregnant and they have been adopt for a long time now. She said she will help me with the pregnancy, help with the cost, put in a good word with boss at work so my career won't be affected etc etc. 

I was really shocked and said I will think about it. After thinking about it over the weekend, I decided that I didn't wanna do this. I was already feeling too overwhelmed and I didn't want to carry a baby only to give him/her up. I don't think I can handle that. 

So, on Monday, I went to her office and told her about my decision. As soon as I said no, she started crying and I just felt so guilty. Because she is a sweet person and would be a lovely mother. I kept trying to explain to her and she wasn't willing to listen and she kept telling me to get out. I thought she needed a moment and left. But after that, she refused to hear my apology or even listen to my reasoning. She was  avoiding me all day. Some of my colleagues came to know about this and everyone was coming over to my desk to change my mind. I was almost breaking down and I kept saying no. Everyone thinks I am the asshole for preferring abortion when there is a good family willing to adopt. 

Needless to say I was quite upset when I got home. When I told my bf about this, he didn't think I was the asshole but he did say this was a good idea and he would prefer this over abortion and he asked me to think about this for some more time and to postpone my appointment to Monday. But I said no, and that i am going to this appointment and that its final. 

Then he got mad and said that I wasn't even willing to think about it and that was the least I could do. He was also mad that I wasn't even willing to take his advice and that the baby is also his. I just went to the study room and locked the door and didn't talk to him after that. And also, I took WFH today because I didn't want to face anyone right now. I haven't spoken to anyone since last night.

This whole week has been an emotional rollercoaster.

So, AITA?? 

Edits:

First of all, thank you for all support. Esp people who DMed me with personal stories and words of comfort. 

2. To the people who are DM'ing me with horrendous links and abuses.. please stop. It is already hard enough for me. 

3. For all the pro-life people here. Your main argument is that the baby is another life and my bodily anatomy doesn't matter because there is a person's life at stake. You do realise that if a person doesn't consent to organ donation before death, his organs will not be harvested despite the several lives which can be saved. Why? Bodily autonamy. A corpse's bodily autonamy is respected despite the several lives which are at stake while a woman's bodily autonamy is not being respected over a bunch of cells (one life, if a person is very far along the pregnancy). Just something for you to think about. 

Lastly, I am sorry I couldn't respond personally to everyone. But I have read most, if not all comments here. And know that I am deeply thankful for everyone taking time to help me.

So I go to the gym regularly. I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. 

My gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.


So now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing pamphlets with ""Jesus will save you"" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a pamphlet, I  shake my head and say ""no thank you"" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, ""yes?"" She then says ""you should take this hun, you look like you need saving"" . I was pretty shocked but responded with "" I dont need anything thing from you maam"" and put my headphone back in. 


Now i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.

I explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. 

They actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA

976,Asshole,"Longtime lurker here. Anyway, I've been married a year and a half, and when I'm with friends I like to make wife jokes, like you'd see on Married with Children, the ball and chained, no sex kinds of jokes, you know what i mean.  It's been no issue between me and my friends, they make the same jokes about their GFs, its just banter and venting mild annoyances about our partners.

Anyway, I tend to keep my time with her and that with my buddies separate, just like it that way. Cause of that she isn't up to speed with our inside jokes and when we started making wife jokes she sort of sunk into her chair. I made one about her, looked over at her and she was sort of crying. 

I took her outside and asked her what the problem was and she went on about how ""it's not cool for me to shittalk her, and that I seem to hate her or something"" when I make ""slightly offensive"" jokes about her to my buds. I told her it's all jokes but she said ""it's disrespectful to make fun of her like that"" and that we were sexist for all joining in joking about our GFs. 

I sort of got annoyed and told her this is why I don't bring her out with my friends, she got pissed, called a cab and went home. I went back to my friends, but when I got home she wouldn't let me touch her. This was yesterday, since me and my friends had a few days off at the same time, and she's been kind of off ever since.

979,Not the A-hole,"This happened at our staff Christmas party but is still bothering me. 

For clarity, I've been happily married for 14 years and have 3 beautiful daughters who I love very much. My wife loves to dance and I hate dancing (important). 

Also the party is for staff only, no spouses/partners permitted.

The staff party went well, I'd been hanging out with a few colleagues who know not to ask me to dance. I've had a few drinks, but am still comparitively sober and am thinking it'll soon be time to head home. I head to the drinks bar nearest the exit for one last glass before leaving. 

While I'm there, an intern (roughly half my 44 years of age) approaches me with someone quite high up in the HR team and asks me to dance. I politely decline. She asks again, taking, I guess, my refusal for shyness (I am quite shy, but not especially introverted). I again refuse, stating that I don't even dance with my own wife, I'm not going to dance with her. She asks yet again. I very abruptly tell her to stop bothering me as it's just not going to happen. She leaves, her and the HR lady staring daggers at me.

Fast forward to January. I have to spend a lot of time on the intern's floor and each day I'm there she's giving me death eyes. I speak to her alone and apologise for upsetting or offending her as it wasn't my intention. She says it's fine.

February and March, still coldness and death eyes. I ask if we're okay. She doesn't want to talk to me because I was rude and hurt her feelings. So I've not made any more attempts to smooth things over and just put up with constant looks of contempt.

I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he’s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.


Over the last few years I’ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it’s happens I’ve always immediately corrected them and they’d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? 

Last weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son’s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it’s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was ‘stolen valor’ for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents.

982,No A-holes here,"I’ve been with my girlfriend now for a little bit over a year and about 2 months ago she moved in with me. Before I met her I was in my best shape, going to the gym about 6 times a week and eating healthy. Since meeting her my gym time began to dwindle and my eating habits got worse. A part of it was spending more time with her and less at the gym, and she doesn’t have the best eating habits so I felt it was ok to loosen up my own eating habits. 

When we first began dating I explained to her that my next goal in my profession was to obtain a license. The licensing process for my profession is incredibly difficult and can often take up to 3 years to complete with study time and all. I took 2 of the exams before meeting her, but failed, and it discouraged me which is why I began getting really into fitness. Throughout our relationship she always encouraged me to study and begin taking the exams again. It was hard to find the motivation to study because I already work 45 hours a week and studying for another 2 hours every day for the exams was the last thing I wanted to do. Once she moved in and I realized our relationship is progressing, I felt now is the time to study again as I want to pass these exams before we start a family. 

For the last month I’ve been studying every day for about 1-2 hours a day. At the same time my responsibilities at my job grew and they have requested I put in a little extra time. On any given weekday I’m spending about 10-12 hours within my profession, this includes my actual job and studying for the exams (which she’s encouraged me to do). I am also trying to find a schedule that will let me get back into the gym because I am not happy with my body. 

My gf has been unemployed since moving in 2 months ago and has just now began the process of job searching. So most of the day she stays inside cooking or cleaning. Last night I came home after a 12 hour day of work and studying and I mentioned how studying after work is better for me so I am going to try to incorporate the gym into my schedule before work. She got upset and said that I don’t spend time with her anymore and that all this studying, work, and now possibly gym is taking up my time and I’m not scheduling time for her.

I had a feeling this would happen eventually once she realized how incredibly time consuming it is to study for these exams. I explained that to block out time for her we should dedicate a day in the week for a date night. We also spend the last couple hours of the day watching her tv shows together. I have no interest in her tv shows so I sit with her in the living room so that we are at least together. 

I told her this is how it’s going to be for a little while as I want to pass these exams and find time to get back into my hobbies, such as fitness, because it helps keep me happy. Am I the asshole for wanting to spend all this time to work on myself?  ",48,258,0.94

He had no reason to suspect she would be abusive to the son, but I know that’s not how abusers work, and have strong reason to suspect she his abusive to the son now as well.

I love my bf and his son, but I’m at my wits end. His ex tells their son lies about me constantly, saying I’m trying to replace her as his mother, that I’m trying to stop his dad from seeing him, that it’s my fault if his dad doesn’t answer the phone because I don’t like him. I used to have a really positive relationship with the son but he’s started to believe her lies and now he doesn’t speak to me. He’s polite to me but he doesn’t want to actively spend time with me and often retreats to his bedroom if I’m in the same room.

He’s also extremely depressed. This has gotten significantly worse in recent months. He has horrible panic attacks because he doesn’t want to go back to his mums. A few years ago I contacted child services about concerns I had about his mums treatment of him and it honestly made the entire situation worse, I did it anonymously but she found out it was me and threatened legal action against me saying she could stop me seeing their son. It caused a lot of trouble and I think made it worse for the son at home, too especially as I noticed a huge difference in his behaviour towards me after that.

988,Not the A-hole,"Little bit of context about me, and my job. I've worked at a movie theater for 4 years, and love it. I always come in, and try to go above, and beyond. My managers have taking notice, and have been giving me a lot more responsibilities. Now it's not a promotion, and it doesn't increase my pay, but I know how this works. You start from the bottom, and you work your way up. I get it plus it doesn't hurt that I know this job like the back of my hand, so it's not really extra work. I also put in a lot of work with a bunch of my coworkers over a month long period to perfect a system that would help everyone out, and would make everything nice and organized. We put it all together in a document, and went to my GM with it. He took it to corporate, and they gave us the all clear. Now my GM had to take an extended period of time off for a family emergency. In comes a manager (John) from out of state to step in as a temp GM. First day literally changes everything back. Takes down everything we put up. All the info sheets for new hires when they get stuck and can't call for help, New usher sheets that make life so much easier, New concession ticket that make it more organized, and so much more all gone. Why? cause that's not how they did it at his theater. Workers are confused, and start to slip up by doing things the new way then having to do it the old much longer way it was a nightmare. I've never been handed so many guest complaints in my life. All about how they liked how things were ran before, and that it was better the other way cause they didn't have to wait nearly as long. Then I find out that a new hire was in tears in the back wanting to quit because of how John was treating her. At that point I was so confused/frustrated by how he could come in, and in a matter of 2.5 months just completely ruin what we had going. The new hire ends up leaving, and John comes to me and says ""You need to get on register now."" This is what I said word for word. ""Alright John I'm heading there now."" He tilts his head, and says ""Uh I think you forgot a Yes Sir there buddy."" I look at the line of people then him, and repeat myself, and walk away to do my job. Now my GM is back in town, so yesterday John calls him to pretty much demand that I be fired for disrespecting him, and refusing to work. What he doesn't know is that me, and the employees from that day including the new hire will be going up there in about 30 mins to discuss in detail (Power Point presentation) everything that's been going on since he's been gone. Before I go AITA? I know I could have just said ""Yes Sir"", but not to someone who works, and treats his employees like that I'm sorry I just can't.        ",53,97,0.93

990,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR at the bottom

\*\*\*

So my full-time roommate is working abroad for the next 4 months, and he was nice enough to provide me with a new roommate in the interim via Craigslist. 

We're about two months in now, and while she was pretty easy to live with at first (ti's just the two of us), she's recently met a strapping young man we'll call Steve that's slept over every night for the past three weeks. EVERY. SINGLE. NIGHT.

&#x200B;

Anyway, last week my roommate informed me that she would be leaving town for the weekend to go visit her parents. Hooray, I think to myself, no roommate + Steve for an entire 48 hours! 

Fast forward to late Friday night -- I've just come home from the bar and am relaxing on the couch, eating cereal and watching Top Chef, when I hear the unmistakable sound of shuffling feet coming from my roommate's bedroom. Now, seeing as its 2am and I was under the impression that I was home alone, I immediately go into irrational panic mode and grab a hockey stick before yelling ""Is anybody in here?""  No answer. 

I ask again, almost yelling now, ""Is anybody in here?"" No answer. Not quite satisfied, I open the door to my roommate's room to find Steve! He was tucked into her bed, pretending to be asleep.

&#x200B;

Livid, I ""wake"" him up and demand that he leave. He argues that my roommate said he could stay there, and it's none of my business if she lets him sleep in HER room. I counter that no one asked me if this was okay in advance (I would have said fuck no), I don't feel comfortable with him here, and he needs to gtfo. He then starts begging me to stay, giving me a sob story of how he has nowhere else to go.

&#x200B;

That's when I threaten to call the police, and he leaves. 

&#x200B;

The aftermath has been pretty ridiculous. My roommate is very upset, and says that me kicking her bf out onto the street at 2am is an act of ""pure evil."" I think that her sneaking her bf into the apartment while she's out of town is grounds for terminating her sublease. My real roommate, who's currently in Europe, is being weird about taking sides, and I think it's because he doesn't want to lose a subletter and be on the hook to find another while he's abroad. 

&#x200B;

So, humans of Reddit, AITA?

991,Not the A-hole,"For context, I'm 6'4"" and the movie theater I was at is pretty old, so it has slightly smaller seats than what you find at a newer chain like AMC. The movie was also almost four hours long. Sitting in a comfortable position (slightly slouched with my butt on the front half of my seat), my knees were maybe 2 or 3 inches from the seat in front of me. 

A few times, the guy sitting in front of me (hereafter Gumby, since he needed to stretch so often) would stretch and lean back really far in his seat, causing it to bump against the front of my knees. This doesn't really bother me, since it only happened two or three times in the first hour of the film. But, it evidently bothered Gumby a lot, because he then started to lean back repeatedly in fairly quick succession, hitting my knees each time. Then, he started to continuously push back, so that his seat was pushing back against my knees for a few minutes. 

At this point, the message was clear to me – Gumby wanted me to move my legs. For me, the issue was twofold: my thighs are fucking long so I didn't really have a lot of space to move them without encroaching on the leg space of my neighbors or sitting up uncomfortably straight, and I didn't particularly *want* to move them since I was comfortable and enjoying the movie (or at least, I was).

Around the two hour mark, Gumby began complaining, in a hushed but not inaudible tone, about me to his two seatmates (his mom and his boyfriend, I think?), who both subsequently glared at me. Around the 2.5 hour mark, he put his feet on the (unoccupied) seat in front of him and started to push backwards, this time hitting my knees pretty hard. He did this three or four times. At the three hour mark, Gumby seemed to be asleep for about a half hour, and then the last half hour or so of the film was more of the same feet-on-the-chair pushback.

I got some pretty dirty looks from Gumby's group after the film ended, and clearly they thought that I am the asshole. I feel like I didn't really do anything wrong – sure, I could have moved my legs somewhat, but it would have been uncomfortable for me to do so.

So am I the asshole?",34,53,0.89
992,No A-holes here,"First post, sorry if it isnt up to standards but I need clarification & advice as to if I am over reacting.

A little bit of background:

His culture is very social, they are very family oriented and like to go out to each others houses and celebrate and party. They hug and kiss every single person when they arrive and hug and kiss when they leave the event. His family is always together and thoroughly enjoy socializing until the sun comes up (literally).

&#x200B;

My family is the opposite.  I guess we don't really have cultural social traditions like my boyfriend does. We rarely go to parties because my parents just prefer not to. Both of their jobs are extremely social (Mom is an ER Nurse and my dad is a police officer) so they just want to come home and relax. I never had to socialize with other people besides school and work.

&#x200B;

So, him and I have been together for a year and his family absolutely loves me and I love them too. I am always invited to any social gathering they go to. I went to thanksgiving with them at their uncles house and I felt so left out I  never wanted to go to another gathering with them again. When we walked through the door, I was greeted with tons of hugs and kisses from people I don't know, which makes me extremely uncomfortable. I do NOT like being touched by strangers, and I hate being forced to do so. I sucked it up and started the night off with some wine to calm some my nerves and some anxiety. It only got worse from there. His friends and family don't prefer to speak English and that is the only language I speak. So my boyfriend had to translate for me or summarize the conversation while I just sit there and nod with a smile. I wanted to go home. They kept asking him things about me in their native language when they could have said it in English to me. His family knew I was uncomfortable the moment I had to hug and kiss everyone, and his sister pulled me aside and said ""Its our tradition, you need to get used to it."" I got mad and said ""Well that is not MY tradition."" Which now that i look back on it, i feel really disrespectful about. My boyfriend did not leave me side and tried to comfort me as much as he could, but I am not a very social person-- i cant even be social if they aren't speaking to me in English. I've even tried to pick up on some phrases to try to talk to them. They even expected me to stay out until 3/4 in the morning. I said no and I wanted to leave. I had enough. 

&#x200B;

The entire night made me feel uncomfortable and my boyfriend knew that. I don't want to go to other social gatherings with them again. I have told them I get some pretty bad social anxiety in situations like those and all they said was ""get well!"". I don't think they understand very well, as they don't have that issue.

993,Not the A-hole,"I live in the US but am from a country in Europe. My cousin is getting married there in late summer. The whole extended family is going. I'm going to take both my kids there for a few weeks, but will unfortunately miss the wedding. One of them has school that starts a couple days before the ceremony.

When my wife realized I was taking both kids she decided that she'd maybe take a trip to Europe at the same time with her parents, who have always wanted to go (though not to my country, if it matters). 

They're super flexible on the dates for their trip, so I asked her if she wouldn't mind taking one kid back home with her to start school, allowing me to see the wedding with the other child and fly home the day after.

My wife said no. Her reasoning is that if she knows the kids are gone for a few weeks she wants to be free to make her own plans or possibly choose not to go at all. I didn't push her, because it's her prerogative, but I'm secretly annoyed. I'd like to think I'd have done the reverse for her. 


edit: 
My wife isn't going to the wedding because she doesn’t want to take time off work to spend time with my family. She’s from the US and doesn’t speak the language. For her a couple weeks having to listen to me translate isn’t a lot of fun. On top of that she doesn’t have much extended family herself, so on the balance she spends more time with my family than I spend with hers (mine come to the US to visit every 3-5 years or so). Her parents never really ask us to hang out with them, so the familial obligation seems one-sided.

994,No A-holes here,"**UPDATE (original post deleted, see it in the comments)**

I wanted to update because things have blown up. This is going to be long.

***TL;DR: Everyone was right about everything and I'm the asshole***

I found out about not being in the wedding a little over a week ago so I had been stewing for awhile when I made my last post. I was a little dishonest in the first post because I was already in the process of ""confronting"" her when I wrote it. I texted her early the morning I posted and told her that I was disappointed by her lack of involvement in my wedding. She replied that she was sorry I felt hurt, but that she had warned me about this when I first asked her. She also mentioned that she wasn't sure what else I wanted from her. She has done everything I asked, and that it seemed like Jim has everything handled for the bachelorette and hasn't reached out to her.

Then I texted her about bridesmaids. She didn't text me back all day, so I called her that evening. The conversation really didn't go well. She said she didn't reply because she was busy at work and honestly didn't know what to say. She said that she chose the people closest to her. She has known the two friends I had a falling out with since childhood, and her other two are her college roommate and her other friend from work she lived with in the past. She said that even when wedding details were murky she knew she'd ask them.

I told her that I had always envisioned all of us planning our weddings together and being left out of it all was very painful. Her reply hurt.

She said she was sorry that I was no longer friends with the two bridesmaids in her party. She truly wishes me no ill-will from the past, but that they have their own valid reasons for ending our friendship. Then she said she was honestly surprised that I asked her to be a part of my wedding, and that she wouldn't have even been surprised if she didn't get an invite.

I spoke to my therapist the next day about it. She pretty much echoed what people said here, and I was putting way too much pressure on Jane and was inappropriately using her wedding as friend reunion.

Oh, and my fiance and I got into a HUGE fight about the wedding. I texted Jane after and she was nice and listened to me rant, but it felt awkward. On top of it all, I got to see her post a *lovely* Instagram story about shopping for her wedding dress with all of her bridesmaids and getting drinks after.

I'm so over weddings. I wish I was eloping. I'm a little jealous that Jane seems to be having an awesome time planning hers. Making friends in your 30s is tough, but I thought I had a few close ones I could rely on. But I guess I was wrong.

So thanks Reddit. You tried to warn me but I was already set on being the asshole when I posted. My advice to people upset about bridesmaids/groomsmen: don't question their choices and accept whatever role they want you to play in their wedding.",120,131,0.92

997,Not the A-hole,"So a little background. I'm a 17 year old living in Finland with my parents. I have always been close to my grandpa because my dad took me and my brothers to see him often especially after my grandma passed. My granddad was very friendly and generous to us and wanted to help us and the only way he could help us was often giving money when we were struggling because he was old and blind(and had more money than he needed). My dad had a brother and he was doing much better than us and didn't visit granddad as often as us and neither did our cousins. 
My dad and his brother started arguing when my grandmother died and haven't after 7 years come to an agreement over her belongings even tho' the value of the belongings isn't much and granddad got most of them, it's more about just arguing with each other because my uncle feels like my father was the favorite and he needs to pay back to him everything my dad got from my granddad. 
Now after my granddad passed my father and his brother need decide how they are going to split a house, a lot of money and lots of expensive collectibles. And because my uncle doesn't exactly need the money he will make this a very hard, long and expensive process. All this would't be too expensive because we could just use our granddads money to fund the process but in Finland we have to pay inheritance tax and the tax office want's a cut of the whole value of the inheritance even tho' there might be something other than money. That means you will have to sell or get the money elsewhere if you want keep expensive items like medals or cold coins which might have more emotional value.
All this means my father will have to get 80k$ dollars from somewhere just to pay the taxes and maybe someday if these things get solved get something back.
This is where i come to play. Because my granddad wanted to give something to his grandchildren, he invested to a life insurance fund so that we get something to help us to get a head start in life when he passes. I didn't know about this until when he passed and i got a letter that informed me that he gave all his 5 grandchildren around 40k$. 
So one day my father decides to just tell me and my brother his plan on getting himself out of the tax hell he's bout get into. ''You two will loan me 80 000 dollars and i will pay it back to you someday'' I didn't know what to think about this and even though my father is a great person and all i don't want to give him my money and get it maybe paid back during a space of time i don't know. I have decided to tell him i wont give him this loan so does this make me an asshole.",20,39,0.89

1001,No A-holes here,"Okay so I (M21) have been with my girlfriend (20) for a year now. When we first started having sex it was pretty good, better than any sexual experiences I've had before. That lasted a few months, tops.

Eventually I started noticing that I am the only one who ever initiates sex (except for one time, which I feel kind of petty for counting). I asked her about it and she told me she essentially has no sex drive.

I was kind of hurt. That went against everything she had told me about herself. She told me before we started having sex that it was her favorite thing, that she had a really high sex drive and that it was a problem for her when she was in high school.

She reassures me that it isn't my fault, every time I bring it up, but idk. I've started getting in my head about it and now I can't last for more than 3 seconds when I'm inside her (making our sex even worse and putting me further into my head). When I think of sex now I just get frustrated instead of excited.

Through talking with her I now know that her last bfs dick ""fit her better"" with it's upward curve and made her cum everytime. I never make her cum through penetration and rarely can through fingering. She used to get so wet there would be a puddle under her on the bed. With me she's so dry we almost always need lube. We can go months without having sex, if I never initiated we'd never have it again. I also know that her first few sexual experiences (no penetration) she was more or less forced into, and she's mentioned that that was when she was most turned on even though she didn't want to be. (This was not all one convo)

I know she isn't cheating. And she will suck my dick or have sex with me whenever I ask or initiate, but I know she doesn't like it and can't get out of my head.

A few weeks ago I was trying to finger her to orgasm before we had sex and it wasn't doing anything for her. She started going down on me and I couldn't get it up. She asked me if something was wrong and I told her that sex with her makes me want to bang my head against the wall. I keep trying and trying but it doesn't get any better. She started crying immediately. I love her so much and making her cry broke my heart. I know I should have handled it better, but does that make me the asshole? And what can we do??",59,56,0.84

1009,Not the A-hole,"About two weeks ago I was at the gym and was training back. I arrived and went to do lat pull downs, low rows, and straight leg dead lifts (all 4 x 10 sets), so I’ve been here for a solid 20 minutes already.

I knew I needed the cable machine for my next exercise (straight arm pull downs) and needed a straight bar to do the exercise. I knew I needed to do these when I walked in but wanted to do the others first, and for the entire time I was doing the preceding 3 exercises there has been a cable free but with a water bottle and towel next to it. The reason why I didn’t the cable earlier was because I was going to do another 2 exercises on them on top of the one I was planning on doing, and didn’t want to lose the cable just in case. If I did them one after the other then I could stay on it as long as I needed.

So I head over to the cable that has the towel and bottle (again, haven’t seen anyone use the cable for 20 or so minutes), and look around to catch anyone’s eyes to let me know it’s theirs. I wait for about 30secs to a minute and take off the rope attachment and attach the straight bar. A couple of guys ask me for the rope attachment and I give it to them, then I start doing my first set.

As soon as I finish the owner of the towel and bottle taps me on the shoulder and says “You do realise you just took my machine mate”, and I immediately apologised and tried to get the rope he was using but couldn’t find any left. I apologised again and explained I didn’t see anyone here and he was visibly mad. 

I explained to him that I haven’t seen anyone here using the cable for 20 mins, to which he explained he was on some other machine doing another set. He said “You should have asked around” and “A little gym etiquette goes a long way”. He walked off pissed and did something else on another machine, didn’t even want his machine back when I offered.

Don’t get me wrong here guys, I understand that I’ve outright taken someones machine at the gym - not cool. But WIBTA if I asked around and 3 (for example) people said they haven’t see anyone use the machine I want? WIBTA if I took his secondary machine that didn’t have his towel and bottle? Would I have to ask around for THAT machine?

Am I 100% in the wrong here? Where and how far does gym etiquette go for someone not occupying a machine for a noticeable amount of time? Also not sure if worth mentioning but this is my first gym etiquette/workout related incident, I try to be as civil as possible.

Much appreciated guys!

So I got home from my friend’s house, and I was looking through Pinterest for centerpiece ideas for her wedding as I am helping out quite a bit. My sister (who was over doing some laundry) saw me and jokingly asked if I was already planning my wedding (knowing that I was helping my friend plan hers). I told her I was trying to find centerpieces for my friend, and then I had to go pick up the bridesmaids dresses from the shop. 

Out of nowhere my sister starts talking about how when I get married then she wants to pick out her own dress because “if I’m going to be the maid of honor I want to stand out” and kept going on about it. I politely told her that when/if I get married I already have my bridesmaids picked out, and she isn’t one of them. I only want three bridesmaids, and I already know who they are. 

My sister started screaming at me and saying that she has every right to be a part of my wedding, and it isn’t fair that I won’t even have her as a bridesmaid even though she feels she should be the maid of honor. I reminded her that I’m not even engaged, nor will I be in the near future, and that I have the right to choose who I want in my wedding, and she lost it and started to call our parents and complain. 

This evening my mother called me and said that I was being insensitive and should include her in my hypothetical wedding, and apparently my father agrees. I pointed out that I’m not even engaged and that it would be my wedding and therefore my choice, and now my whole family is apparently mad at me.

1019,Everyone Sucks,"So rewind back to December. It's the morning of December 24th, and I wake up in a pool of my own blood (thanks mother nature), and go straight to the bathroom from my room down the hall, and let my dog out of my room as I go, that way I can let her outside to potty once I'm all cleaned up. Now, before we go into any more detail on that, I have to backtrack and say that my friend, his wife (former roommates now) and I all knew for sure that my dog was in heat, and they have an unfixed male, hence why she slept in my room. Friend's responsibility is to make sure his dog is put in his crate if he leaves the house for any amount of time if SOMEONE isn't awake and around to watch him cuz their dog literally humps anything that moves (owners included). Back to the story, I come out of the bathroom (literally in there less than 3 mins), and his dog has already tied himself to my female and his owners are nowhere to be found. Turns out friend had gone a few houses down to his dad's and his wife was at work. He'd left his dog out and his logic was ""you were asleep and I was only gone 20 mins"". He showed back up 15 mins after I walked out to the dogs tied together. His wife and I have gotten into several arguements about this since then with her insisting that sole blame and responsibilities for the incident and resulting puppies (5 of them) is on me, the most recent being tonight. Note: I was working on getting her spayed at the time but didn't have the extra cash even with a county voucher due to bills and unexpected things coming up. So tell me reddit, AITA? Cuz I sure the hell don't think I am.

Edit: I feel i should say I fully accept that this is also equally my fault for this. I could have left my dog in the room while i went to the bathroom. I could have walked out into the living room in my bloody pj pants just to make sure the other dog was put up. But i didn't.

my GM now tells me she loves me, she’s proud of me, invites me to her home to eat, etc. but i don’t believe any of it, i think she’s just lonely and wants people around her before she dies. she never did any of this as i was growing up. she never hugged me, told me she loved me, took pictures of or with me, so why start now? am i wrong for thinking like this or is she just really an asshole?

1022,Asshole,"Maybe this should be in r/relationshipadvice sorry in advanced 

Anyways, I’ve been with my SO for a while, we’ve had ups and downs, nothing any normal couples wouldn’t experience. We’re both in our late 20s and have been living together for a couple of months. 

I’ve always imaged having a dog once I’ve had my own place, that’s always been my plan. I had a dog as a child/ teen and loved it to death. I haven’t been able to have a dog because of space/ time/ financial reasons. But in the near future I really want to adopt. My point is, this is very important to me.

My SO however does not want a dog. Ever. They have been wish-y wash-y about the idea since we started dating. But I figured “who could hate dogs? I’ll convince them”. Nope. We pet sat a mutual friends dog this weekend and my SO was not having it. Definitely confirmed they never want a dog. And I was honestly really turned off at how my SO even didn’t want to even pet it.

I know this seems petty, and I probably shouldn’t have assumed that I could change my SO’s mind about dogs. But I just can’t imagine my future without a dog. Is this dramatic?

TL;DR I love dogs and want one in the future. SO hates dogs and refused to ever have one. AITA for potentially breaking up with them because of this?

Edit: everything else in this relationship is going well currently and we both agree that we don’t ever want kids lol",86,86,0.9
1023,Not the A-hole,"I am a social neanderthal. I have absolutely no people skills whatsoever, zero charm and normal situations in which regular people interact daily are completely foreign to me. I have anxiety disorder and I'm not fully convinced someone didn't slam my soft spot as a baby.

I've been dating my girlfriend, who we'll call Amy, for a little over a year. Amy is probably more of an introvert than an extrovert, but still much more social than I am and has a good group of friends and doesn't dread going out in public and likes attention when it's given. Over the course of our relationship she's been trying to help me become less anxious and more outgoing, which has been hit and miss. Somehow she manages to tolerate my shut-in nature and we've had a great relationship despite it. 

This past friday Amy wanted to go hang out with a large group of her friends at a bar, and wanted me to come. Most of whom I've only met briefly in passing, the rest who I've never met and have only heard about me through Amy. Basically my worst nightmare, but I figured I owed it to her to try it rather than refusing yet again.

On the way there, Amy was giving me a pep talk and telling me to just be myself, do what comes naturally and ""let loose."" We arrive, I survive introductions and sit quietly while everyone talks until the boyfriend of Amy's best friend brings up urban exploration, which I love. No one else at the table is interested, so I mention I am. This leads to me and him having a great talk about it with everyone else chiming in, and I started to feel more comfortable and kept the conversation flowing and engaged others at the table for a few minutes.

I noticed Amy had gotten quiet, so I quietly asked if she was ok got a very reassuring ""mhm"" which I took in the moment as her just letting me keep up my momentum since others tried to include her too with no luck. I tried numerous times to bring her in on the talk but she was pretty quiet. When we all left, people were asking for my number, joking with Amy about having to bring me again next time and how I'm a good guy, it felt pretty great.

She was silent until we got home. When I finally pried out of her what was wrong, she accused me of ""one-upping her"" and ""completely overshadowing her."" Apparently I had taken over the conversation. I told her I was only doing what she asked of me, and since people kept talking to me I kept answering them, and that they talked to me that much because they wanted to get to know me but already knew her. She told me she wasn't expecting me to ""be that social and take the spotlight"" and that it ruined the evening for her, and now I'm even more reluctant to go back for another meet-up.

I don't know what I did wrong, but I also don't know social etiquette enough to trust my own judgement. I tried to bring her in on the talk or shift the focus to her multiple times but she wasn't having it, and I thought I was only doing what she asked of me for months. Did I fuck up here?

1024,Not the A-hole,"Just happened thirty minutes ago. I was putting dishes away from dinner and my son was pestering my cat. She gets mad and nips him. 

We've been trying to teach my son to be nicer to her but he constantly antagonizes her. And she always walks back to him to give him more chances. 

Anyways, my son pushed it to far and she nipped him. I grabbed my cat by the cuff and held her there for a second while telling her no. Before anything else, my husband's hand is on mine and my cat and he's pushing down, hard.
He stayed there for five seconds without saying anything for like five seconds before I forced him off. 

Later I told him if he ever does anything like that again and doesn't control his temper, then I would leave him.

I don't know if I'm overreacting here, but as an animal lover, I hate seeing animals in distress and pain. I understand she but my son, but since I was about to handle it, I personally think it was out of bounds for him to do that. ",699,912,0.9
1025,Not the A-hole,"She’s in the mindset that the guy should pay for everything, and against my better judgment I went with it. Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take

Fast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she’s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it’s not even. 

Fast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we’re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won’t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I’m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn’t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I’m wary but I say ok but you’ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can’t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?

This was the final straw. I’m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you’re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I’m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. 

We talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I’m wrong and I overreacted ",138,315,0.96
1026,Not the A-hole,"So I am a college student, so is this girl. We met on Tinder and have been talking for a month or so. She said she didn't have an Instagram but did use Snap.

Anyway, fast forward to just a few hours ago, we met for the first time (we were both looking for a relationship and not a hook up). She is beautiful, smart, and charismatic. She had a very nice body too, although in some of her photos she had a 'weird line' down her abdomen that I figured was inappropriate ask about as I only knew her for a month.

So, we had plans for dinner tonight at a local diner. I got there before her, and went to a table. About five minutes later she comes. I was confused as I could almost 100% guarantee it was her but was like ""it can't be because this woman has a child"". Then, she comes up and says ""Jack?! Hey! It's Melissa"" I kinda nervously said ""hey.."" in a confused way. At first, I figured maybe she was babysitting or this was her unmentioned brother and thought wow she really is into me for still keeping our date (I don't mind kids as I am an elementary education major). Nope.

She said ""This is Mike, he's my son!"" I was shocked. I just looked at her and she said ""Yea, hes my bundle of joy. Had him at 18"" I said ""Are you serious?"" and she was like ""Yea!! But it's no big deal, if I put him on his iPad he wont make a fuss, and, by the way, sorry for never mentioning him! Sometimes things get hectic in my life""

I just stood up, looked at her and said ""I'm sorry, I don't think this will work out."" She was like ""..oh, but I really like you"" and I just said ""Im sorry"" and left.

Now, part of me feels dickish because I have never done that to a girl and try to hold respect for them, but I felt 

1) totally lied to 

2) betrayed (in a weird sense). I wanted to start my own family some day with a woman who hasn't had kids. Obviously if I was in my late 30s or 40s I would expect it, but I am just a college junior.... plus, I don't want to take on a 'father' responsibility should our relationship get serious over the next 2, 3 years

1027,Not the A-hole,"My SIL is having a hard time getting pregnant. It's been a year since she started trying and she has become angry and bitter that she isn't pregnant. 

She openly admits to hating pregnant women now bc she isnt pregnant. 

SIL never liked my sister very much, but liked her even less when sister got pregnant. Now when my sister comes to visit my parents (SIL and my brother live with my parents) SIL avoids seeing her and goes to the basement in her room and cries. 

Things SIL has done to make baby talk uncomfortable:
* tells my mom to not leave baby stuff where she can see it.
* tells my mom she cant make baby blankets in the living room,  since seeing them upsets her.
* closes the door to the spare bedroom bc she doesnt want to see the baby stuff in it. 
* is mean when she gets a baby shower invite or someone she knows gets pregnant. 

Etc.

I get along with my SIL, even tho she is admittedly kind of a b*tch.  So when I found out I was pregnant, I was hesitant to tell her and my brother. 

A month ago I was visiting my parents and they (sil/bro)  asked me if I was pregnant. I panicked and said no. In truth I was 2 months. 

(Mom tells me later that after I tell them I'm not pregnant, bro and SIL talk about it and feel bad that I'm having a hard time getting pregnant too. They sympathize with me.)

I felt bad lying but I didn't know how to tell them. I was sure if I told her she would cry and make a scene and not want anything to do with me anymore. 

The next day I talked to my brother and told him I was pregnant and I was sorry for lying. I explained that I was worried about SIL and if she would hate me knowing I was pregnant. He said not to worry and he would talk to her. 

After talking to his wife, they decide they are mad at me for lying? 

So today, a month after, I have another doc appt and come visit my parents. SIL walks into the house and I say hello, as usual. She walks right by me as if I were invisible and ignores me completely. She goes to the basement and I never see her again for the rest of the day.

I realize I shouldn't have lied,  and I apologized and explained why I did so. But doesnt this prove my point? 

Or am I the asshole?

Edit: since so many have mentioned, they are building a house and are living there while it's being built. They have the money to live on their own. So that's not really the issue. The problem is they hold the house hostage on baby stuff.

1028,Not the A-hole,"Ten years ago my stepmom accused me of stealing money from my stepbrother. I was 19 at that time, my stepbrother is a month younger. The whole thing was a set up, my stepmom told me it was. She and I had a fight the day before and she told me to just watch what she can do. The next day I got back from work and was met with the accusation that I've stolen thousands of dollars from my stepbrother. My parents kept our money in a lock box in their room with the key hidden. I also had a bank account so I had my own debit card for gas and a little spending money but 90% of my money went into the box. Stepmom claimed thousands of dollars were missing from my stepbrothers money in the lock box. After days of fighting it was determined that there was no proof I stole it but I would be punished anyway. My dad sat me down at the kitchen table to tell me my punishment as my stepmom stood behind him with the biggest smile,dancing and flipping me off. First was that they were cutting off paying for my college. They had already paid for my first and second semester at a community college but they took that money back out of my money. They also took away my debit card and gave me a strict allowance of only gas money to get to work, this included keeping track of my odometer calculating it down to the mile. This was to go on until I moved out which I did about a year later. 
  News was spread around that I was a thief and friends and family distanced themselves, plus I could not go out with no money and being tracked. I was doing well in college but I was not allowed to go back until I moved out and could have control of my own money. There are many reasons I rarely have communicated with my parents the past 10 years but this is one of the bigger ones. My dad has been trying to get me to meet with him and talk things out, mostly because he wants to see his grandaghter. My brothers car broke down so Ive been giving him rides to my parents house. This time I got stuck there talking to my dad. He asked me whats going on with me ignoring him and everything so I tried to talk. First thing I brought up was the situation explained above and my dad and brother laughed out loud at me. Dad said he cant believe I still think about that and that its a long time to hold something agaist him. I told him if we cant even get passed that there's no point talking and left. My brother texted me throughout the night and today trying to get me to come back and talk more, he says 10 years is a long time to hold that against my dad and I should leave it in the past. They say even with what happened its my own fault for not finishing college and moving out. Just thinking about it, 10 years does sound like a long time to hold on to somthing and plenty of people do put themselves through college under worse circumstances. So now im wondering if I am wrong to hold this particular grudge from ten years ago against him.

I recently dyed my hair black.  My natural hair is a very dark brown.  Nothing major, right?

Today I received a call from my sister saying she does not want me to redye my hair before the wedding so the black can fade out.  Mind you it's only been black for about 2 weeks now. She does not want me to have black hair on her wedding day.  I explained how black is not that simple, it will not just fade and if I left it, the roots would grow out.  I dyed my hair so it would look its best, not it's worst (how it would with roots showing!)  

She blamed it on my mum saying I would look too ""gothic"" and pale in pictures as their chosen colour is dark red.  I then messaged my mum stating I will not be deciding my hair colour for the next 5 months because of 1 day.  She asked if I could just dye it red or something other than black.  I refused and said I would be keeping it black.  I have now upset both my sister and my mum over my hair choices. 

I personally love having my hair black and it does not seem like a major colour change to me.  Mum already expressed her distaste of it when I saw her last.  I am a 25 year old woman, I should be able to make my own hair decisions.

It got to the point that certain doctors refused to see her.

However, my wife’s insistence that something was wrong with our son in spite of the fact that every doctor was telling her it was nothing absolutely tanked our marriage and I left her.

CPS closed the case, so I thought it was done with.

I was there for all of this, so I know my ex didn’t do anything to influence the diagnosis. In fact, she refused to go into the hospital room or to any of the testing at all and made me do it instead.

1038,Not the A-hole,"My Wife and I had our first baby, a boy, four months ago. It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.

I work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is ""I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day."" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.

So here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.

When I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.

I told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to ""just get on with it"". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me ""I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset."" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.

TLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.

Everyone gave me a lot to think about on my original post and helped me realize a couple of things about myself.

I still have a long way to go in terms of how much I victimize myself. Taking responsibility for not only my own actions but the long-term consequences of my actions has been one of the hardest parts of recovery. 

A lot of these decisions are out of my hands and the only thing I can control is my own reaction. 

That said, after my post, I called my sponsor (who has never had any trouble calling me out on my bs, which I suppose is what makes him a good sponsor) and he helped me out through a potentially life-altering decision I was about to make and also helped me see that I need to stop feeling so sorry for myself and that not being able to go to my sister's wedding is not the end of the line for our relationship. 

That same day I called my sister and we met up. I first apologized for treating her the way I did before. She said she accepted my apology but it really damaged the goodwill I had been building up. I told her I understood but if she agreed, I could potentially just come to the ceremony and skip the reception. She said that if I stayed clean and kept my life on track until the wedding, she would consider it but that it also depends on what her fiancé says. We hugged and that was the end of that conversation for the most part.

We have disagreements and fights but nothing we couldn’t talk through over Chinese food until yesterday. We both have hobbies we share as well as hobbies we don’t share, one of which for me is video games. 

I’m 25 and I’ve been playing video games since the original Pokémon games back in the 90s.  Yesterday I went to GameStop with a friend and my younger brother to pre-order the new Pokémon games (Call me a man child if you wish I’ll always love Pokémon lol) She gets home from work about the time I got home too and sees the receipt on my desk because I didn’t get a chance to file it in my cabinet yet. 

All of a sudden she’s giving me an ultimatum: video games or her. I asked her what was wrong and she told me she thinks I care more about video games than her (this has never been a topic of discussion before this). 

I told her if it came to it I would choose the video games over her not because they are more important but because she resorted to an ultimatum for something is consider silly and if she is going to do that what is she capable of demanding in a marriage setting? Our shifts overlap so 90% of my playing is while she’s at work and always gets shut off when she gets home so we can talk, cook, and do something together unless she has solo plans. I don’t think I’m being unreasonable but I’m starting to question our compatibility.

QUICK EDIT BEFORE WORK: She hasn’t had strong feelings for some time ( she used the phrase fizzled out) and she wanted to wait until near the end of our lease to do anything unless they came back. I asked her what I could do to fix it and she said it wasn’t anything I did because we had a good thing she just fell out of love. I asked why she would issue an ultimatum about the video games and she said maybe if I stopped playing them at all something would change ( she admitted last night she never wanted me playing them in the first place but it probably wouldn’t have changed anything) but with our work schedules being opposites and her schedule will get worse after graduation this year we didn’t have enough time together to keep it interesting.

Let me premise this by saying that I do not think IATA, but from time to time I still think about if I may be the asshole here.

My family never grew up religious, I can count on one hand the amount of times I have been to church/synagogue etc. My parents never really talked on the topic growing up so we were left to our own devices. I became agnostic as I believed there was no sure way to tell if a god existed or not, but I didn't put a lot of thought into it. Fast forward to my older brother leaving for 1st year college -- he was late on his residence application so he had to find an apartment to rent instead. He lived alone, and being a pretty big introvert himself, it's safe to say he did not make many friends if any. Depression set in due to this isolation, although he was very good at hiding it from our family.

Somewhere in his first year at college, he met this girl and they clicked. Both philosophy majors and smart in their own ways they started to see each other often. I feel that my older brother got attached romantically although this was never her intention. Her intention was to recruit my older brother for their Catholic Organization at the church. At first, she just invited him to come to church on Sundays, see what it was about and make a decision for himself. He got accustomed to this ritual and started going regularly. Before our family knew it, he was canvassing door to door, babysitting for free at the church for Sunday school, and had joined and bought into this cult-like organization.

My family did not find out about this, or the organization, until the next year. My older brother was in way too deep by this point and there was no sense in trying to talk him out of it. He felt as though there was a void in his life and that finding Jesus helped him. My parents did some more research into the church and the specific organization and found some disturbing information. They have their recruiters, such as this girl , target people at risk such as my brother; people who are lost. The other thing is that they support conversion therapy for homosexuals.

My parents tried and tried to get him to realize what he is involved in. He did a good job of just staying under the radar and finishing his degree. Well that all changed when my younger brother came out as gay, and not long after my older brother announced (regrettably at the birthday dinner of my Mother) that he was going to start the process into being a priest through this church and organization. My mother cried, father extremely upset, and me and my younger brother just felt confused.

My family has barred him from coming to the house and holiday get togethers. I tried to stay in contact occasionally with him, birthday meetups, texts at Thanksgiving etc. Then I started to see the situation from my younger brother and my parents POV. I haven't spoken to him in a little over two years. AITA for not trying harder to keep this relationship going?",28,31,0.85

At the last day of the summer vacation the staff threw a surprise goodbye party for me with the kids, and all the staff told me that they were amazed by the fact I was volunteering there while all the other teenagers were busy drinking. (I was the only minor there).
At that moment I didn't had the guts to tell them my mom was paying me, and all I did was saying thanks over and over again.
They even bought me a small souvenir.
I would have told them if the subject of payment was brought up before.

My mom paid me more than I would have got a normal job for that age.

1048,Not the A-hole,"I (25F) have a family friend Mike (49M). He was friends with my mom in high school and I've known him since birth. I only saw him rarely but used to chat with him on the phone every now and then. 

My mom has narcissistic tendencies and once I became a teen I used to talk to Mike for advice whenever he called. I noticed that Mike is a bit of a pathological liar and that he slowly took more and more liberties with the truth as time went on. Eventually he started to claim that I was his daughter. He tells people that he has a daughter and shows them my picture. He asked my mom if he could adopt me. He told me that he added me to his USAA insurance as his daughter. I don't really feel comfortable with this but he has always been there to give advice and at this point it would seem pretty ungrateful if I were to set him completely straight, he seems to have lost grip with the reality of our friendship. I've also always felt that he has unrequited feelings for my mom, which could be why he clings onto me so much. 

Last month, Mike mentioned that he'd be in town and we made arrangements to get dinner. This involved me pushing for details as he claimed he could meet me ""whenever"", but later revealed that we would be meeting on the evening he flew in and he would be coming straight to the restaurant from the airport. Once I knew that I planned accordingly to give him enough time. 

The dinner was terrible. He was more than an hour late, insisting the whole time he would be there soon. He brought a friend with him who bogarted the conversation by bragging about his life. My mom attended dinner and Mike kept making gross jokes - for example, my mom said there was a line for the bathroom and Mike cupped his hands in front of him and said ""here."" Since Mike and his friend were so late, we went ahead and ordered our entrees - but when they arrived, they ate our food instead of ordering their own. 

I couldn't believe how Mike could claim to see me as a daughter and then act that way. Since we only speak a couple times a month, I decided to just not respond. Since then he has tried to contact me four times and I have ignored his attempts. I know if I told him why I was upset he'd just give me excuses for why everything was justified. I'm not really interested in that, but I'm starting to feel guilty since he probably doesn't see that he did anything wrong. AITA?

TL'DR: My family friend is a pathological liar and claims to see me as his daughter. After reaching out to meet up for dinner, he ended up being over an hour late, brought a friend I didn't really know, ate my food instead of ordering his own, and made gross jokes to flirt with my mom.

1049,Asshole," A little backstory: My brother and I were always extremely close up until 3 years ago. When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma’s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn’t want to see me anymore. 

I was upset but I gave him space thinking I’d talk to him and explain he doesn’t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it’s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.

I get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don’t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.

I apologize if there isn’t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn’t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. ",65,98,0.88

A few days later I noticed that he followed her on Instagram and she was popping up on his phone quite frequently.

I learned from our mutual friend that my boyfriend, this friend, and this girl were planning a trip to Las Vegas that I was not invited to.

This morning things came to a head and I asked him to unfollow her. He responded by unfollowing her and then deleting his Instagram account because he ""might as well"" since it ""obviously creates problems.""

1053,UPDATE,"I'm back like I said I would be,. My [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/awyi8k/aita_for_despising_my_mentally_handicap_sister/) got a lot of attention and seeing as you guys seem interested, here's my update.

Well, since that day I made the post i've been staying with my grandfather. The week's been honestly a huge change for me for better and for worse but i'll try to run it down.

I started by telling my grandpa the story of why I broke down the way I did and to be honest, he seemed horrified. No one in my family knew my parents were using me as essentially a free care service for my sister. My grandpa told me some things that I don't feel comfortable repeating here but in essence my sister is ""supposed"" to be getting care from a professional and that my parents were ignoring that, along with this I was not supposed to be caring for her at all with her mental state as apparently she is a danger to herself and others. With everything else I told him, along with stuff like the movie indecent he was really mad and told me to not contact my parents without him there. He pretty much told me that he would be meeting with my parents beforehand and that he was going to be there when I sat down with them. It didn't end here either, the rest of the week consisted of other family checking in on me and telling me things my parents hid from me. This included the fact that my parents have been taking money from family to fund a ""caretaker"" that doesn't exist.

Suffice to say, this week has been rough. But, the upside is that even through all this, my extended family has been giving me more love than i've felt in a while. My grandfather spent this last week ""making up for the time i've lost."" Encouraging me to spend time with friends and do things I want to do. My aunts and uncles have also been helping me through the week.

Well, Saturday night I sat down with parents to talk. It went badly to say the least. They came clean to me about everything. They told me things I will not repeat here. But they did not apologize. My parents still claim that I some how owed my sister my time. My father even saying ""You were put here to be her caretaker"". I won't lie and say I was composed. After everything i learned I confronted them. On the fact that my sister needed a caretaker. The money my dad was taking from his sister, and a few other things. They denied it or made excuses. And in the end, we ended off in a worse place than before.

Today will be my last time talking to them for a while. After talking with my grandfather and uncle last night, I'm not going back. Later today i'm going there and picking up my stuff and moving in with my grandfather. When I graduate high school i'm planning on leaving the state to go to school. My aunt has told me that the money she was sending my dad will be instead be coming to me from now on. My parents have called me twice since Saturday, neither of them were to apologize and only ask when I was coming home.

I won't be going back to them. Right now I still feel pretty uneasy about everything but I feel like that will pass. The rest of my family is showing their support to me and honestly, it feel great. But in the end I lost my parents. Over all of this, i've learned something that I wished I saw earlier. I don't hat my sister. In fact I love her with all my heart. I should never have never projected my hate onto her. That was wrong, and someday I hope to make up for it. But for now I need to leave.

So, there's my update. Thanks again for the support my original post got. I really appreciate everyone who took the time to comment or show me support. Thanks you.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you all so much! I wish I could respond to every single one of you but my lunch only lasts so long. I'll update tonight how the move out went but until then, thank you all. I want to say that your support has been amazing and your kindness means more to me than anyone could ever imagine.

&#x200B;

Late edit: Wow, I never imagined my story would reach the popularity it did. I know it's kinda cliche and i've said it a thousand times but thank you all. 

&#x200B;

We just got back from moving my things out of my parents house. Every thing I wanted to take my grandpa and uncle helped move and it's at my grandpa's house now. I have my birth certificate, social security card, and every other document and record I could think of. My parents were quiet the whole time I was there. Shorty after I arrived my dad left with my sister and my mom only hovered over us silently as me moved. It took a while but as we left she broke down and told me she loved me and would miss me. I hugged her and said goodbye, and that was it. Even now I sit here and think if she really meant it. After this whole week of her not saying anything she waited till the end. I hope she meant it. Right now though, I think I just need to look ahead. Maybe one day me and my parents can reconnect. I hope so.

&#x200B;

Thank you all for the advice and love. It's been amazing and i'm glad that through this experience I at least got some positive out of this mess. Will I come back? I don't know. If something happens and you guys still want an update i'll maybe come around again. But for now I'm going to move on. For all those out there who shared their stories with me, thank you, and I hope to see you on the other side. See you space cowboy's :)",2012,72783,0.96
1054,Asshole,"Okay so this all happened in December but her and I broke up 2 weeks ago (not because of this) and I have always wanted to know if I was in the wrong or right here. The new smash bros came out on Friday December 7th, which happened to be the day directly after my last final for my fall term. I saw this about 2 months prior to it coming out and was ecstatic. I told my gf(lets just say H) and pretty much everyone else that I am not doing anything for that weekend besides playing and that people are welcome to play with me. H just called me a nerd and laughed it off.

&#x200B;

So about a week and a half before the game came out, she told me about a work Christmas party on the 7th. I reminded her about the game coming out then and the plans I made to play all weekend, which now included some friends I made plans with. Well she didn't like my answer and basically told me that wanting to play a video game was not a valid reason to not intend her work Christmas party, which I honestly understand and normally I would've attended without issue. But this is something that I had been talking to her for the past 2 months with excitement and it was all I was looking forward too after my finals were done. Playing video games is a hobby that I haven't been able to really partake in while I'm trying to finish school, so I wasn't ready to cancel my plans for that party. I ended up following through with my plans and playing all weekend. We fought about me not going for about a week after the party but eventually got past it. 

&#x200B;

I understand that it's important to be there for your SO in situations like this, but I also feel like I communicated what I was doing well before the Christmas party and I feel like my hobby/plans should have been more respected. So, AITA for not going to her work Christmas party and playing smash bros? ",72,30,0.83
1055,Not the A-hole,"**edit contact not contract**

My ex boyfriend from when I was in my early twenties was a raging alcoholic. He was jealous, awful, short tempered and a serial cheater. He was my first boyfriend after I had come out and I dealt with it because I was young and in uni and didn't know better. After we broke up it got so bad that I had almost got a restraining order because he wouldn't leave me alone. 

Now a decade later I'm finally in a good place. I'm months away from marrying my partner of nearly 10 years and my life is going well. Except for my mother putting my ex in the picture. He has sobered up and found Jesus. Despite my mother then never accepting our relationship she's now all over him. 

They're both adults. He's 32 and although I understand that she can have whatever friends she want I do think she's being very insensitive to what he has put me through. All those years ago she has constantly put her faith over me and when we are finally reaching a point where I want to have her in my life and involved in my new life with my husband she decides to do this. 

She is constantly inviting him over when I'm visiting despite us being in the middle of planning my wedding. She's bringing him up in conversations and pushing his religious rebirth on me despite knowing that I'm not interested in taking on her faith. The worst was when she invited him to Christmas dinner without any notice while my fiance was there.

So, AITA for cutting her off until she realises that she is being insensitive. I'd rather have her cut off contact with him. ",58,84,0.96
1056,No A-holes here,"A bit of background; I have a large group of tightly knit friends of mostly men, and I’m sorta “the leader” of the group. We’re all involved in a subculture that’s very open about mental health so we all speak very openly about our issues and support eachother. They dub me “the agony aunt” as I’m very well trusted and respected, so I’m usually the person people go to with their deepest, darkest problems. 

A couple of years ago I made friends with a guy and kinda took him under my wing. His only group of friends were other men who’d never dare to talk about feelings, and they’d even pick on him for being “weak”.

I introduced the new guy to my group and everyone seems to like him, although he acts a bit distant with people and always says that he doesn’t think that they like him, which isn’t true. He’s just incredibly insecure.

I feel that I made a massive mistake by telling him that if he needs to talk I’ll always be there. I say the same thing to all my other friends, and they do take me up on that offer occasionally, which I don’t mind.

But the new guy began messaging me every single day with a new “problem”. It’s usually something ridiculous like he met a girl he liked but she probably doesn’t like him back, or that he “feels sad and doesn’t know why”.

I’ve began to realise that he’s taken to needing me to validate his every thought and feeling. He calls me, messages me, comes to my house all the time just to complain about whatever is bothering him that day. He’d never ask how I am doing either, he treats me more as an emotional crutch than a friend.

When he speaks to me his messages are extreme vague. He doesn’t usually tell me directly what’s wrong, he just acts super sad and I don’t know what to say to him anymore. I’ve told him that he needs to see a doctor but he just acted like I was being dramatic.

It had become such a daily stress for me that I’ve stopped reading his messages and hanging out with him. My inbox is full of read messages and missed calls from him, and he knows that I worry about friends so he’s sending vague messages that push me like “I feel like doing something stupid...” but I’m trying to not take the bait.

I know that he has pretty severe depression and has harmed himself before, but I feel like I’ve done everything I can to help him and that he’s just using me at this point. I stopped speaking to him for the sake of my own mental health but I still feel bad about it. Am I the asshole?

When we first started dating she was clean shaven down there. After a little while it started getting hairier but she kept it trimmed. She asked me if I'm ok with a little hair down there and I said ""for sure! You do whatever you want with your body/look and I will love you and still think you're sexy."" I assumed it would grow a bit, get trimmed a bit and life would be all good! 

Fast forward some months down the road and her bush has filled right out and there is no sign of it slowing down. I've noticed myself less inclined to want to go down on her and overall just being less attracted to her naked body.

That being said I am at the wit's end with one of my roommate's behavior. I won't go into full detail because we would literally be here all day but what I'm dealing with right now is she has moved two men into her room with her which is probably 8'x9' at best.

I've come to the conclusion they have to be on and/or selling drugs as they have visitors in and out and only leave for periods of a few minutes at a time.

This morning I came back to my table with a hot plate of food to discover a different waiter seating two older people (maybe mid-50s) at my table. I approached and said ""I think you're sitting at my table"" and motioned to the silverware and glass of OJ that my waitress had left there.

1062,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I made the decision to put our Beagle down. We had her eyes removed last year under recommendation from the vet. They were bulging out of her head and were in danger of exploding. This is somewhat common I guess and was due to pressure build up. So she's been blind for the past year but she's managed to adapt. She's been refusing to use her right hind leg for a while but it suddenly got really bad where she would go down the stairs on her belly. We took her to the vet and it was determined that perhaps her nail was digging into her pad and after her nails were trimmed she may begin to use it again. Well, we didn't buy that and took her to a different vet where it was determined that she had a spinal injury. She had severe muscle loss in her back legs and she also had a hematoma in her ear, which is basically blood vessels leaking and causing her ear to puff up. The cost would be well over a thousand dollars, and we just paid about a thousand dollars to have the surgery for her eye removal. She's about 11 years old and we can't really afford to pay that sort of money. We also feel like she's had a great life and she just isn't having such a great life anymore. She sleeps all day and is in great discomfort and pain most of the time. The original vet, who missed the spinal injury and tried to have us schedule the hematoma surgery called and told us to reconsider. They even threatened to sue us if we had her put down and initially refused to send the dogs records to the new vet. That's a whole other story, but the new vet completely agrees with the euthanasia. Even with the surgery, it may not give the ability to use her back legs very well and we would have to carry her outside to go the the bathroom and she would most likely start peeing in the house because of the increased water intake, because of the medication, and the lack of mobility. So, she's blind, most likely disabled for life, and would probably require follow-up surgeries for her ear. We're feeling very guilty about it, but we think it's the right decision from a cost and Quality of life perspective. Are we assholes?

Edit: Thank you everyone. We’ve decided to file a complaint to the state licensing board. We have a really good paper trail including written statements from the new vet and her technician stating the threats were made and more importantly, the refusal to send over medical records. We’re also not going to go the social media route and call them out. It’s simply not worth it. Again, thank you everyone.

Me(17M) and my group of friends(17M) hang out a lot, and whenever we hang out it usually happens at my house (It might be important to note that whenever we hang out we're usually high). My mom works two jobs so she isn't around often which is why my house is where we all meet.

Recently he's been going over the top, breaking things, making messes, and then not cleaning it up. For example, within the past week, he's broken my shower curtain bar, stained my carpet, broke a laundry drying rack, and left various dirty dishes around the house for me to clean up.

I've mentioned to him multiple times that he can't keep making these messes and breaking things but he never listens. My mom is getting fed up to coming home with the house being a mess, and I don't know what to do.

1066,No A-holes here,"My kids (6 & 9) grandfather on their father’s side passed away March 1st. Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.

His funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.

My children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he’s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.

Today he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex’s family members will be there. It’s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had “already said goodbye to Pappy”. 

I sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery.

As I'm sure you can tell by the title, a lifelong friend of mine (we'll call him Jack), isn't being invited to my wedding. Jack has always been extremely nice to me, almost to a fault, but has made some really poor decisions over the last 3-5 years or so. This has in turn has lead up to an increasingly distant friendship between us.

One of the first reasons I was hesitant to invite him was due to his ongoing issues with another close friend of mine that will be at our wedding. We'll call him Steve. Without going into too much detail, Jack cannot stand Steve over some pretty juvenile and petty shit from years ago. Not that Steve was 100% in the right to begin with, but Jack has taken his ""hatred"" for Steve way too far. Threatening him, assaulting him, showing up at his house in the middle of the night, some REALLY crazy shit. On top of that, they have been in and out of legal proceedings because of it. Steve has tried to just let it go since he doesn't want to ruin Jack's life/future, but Jack continues to test his patience. The final straw was last time we had friends over to our house, Jack followed Steve outside and threatened to kill him, which caused a scene and ultimately tarnished what little rapport he had with my soon-to-be wife. This alone was enough to decide that inviting him to a wedding that they would both be attending was probably a bad idea, but unfortunately it does not stop there.

I still talk to quite a few mutual friends that Jack and I have, and from what I have heard, he has recently became re-involved with cocaine. This includes selling it to friends and trying to talk his friends (and their spouses) into sneaking off to do it with him. Let me be clear, my fiancee and I do not do drugs in any capacity, so that is 100% off limits for us. I am definitely not trying to be DARE Officer Dan here, but there is a pretty obvious line between casually smoking weed and slamming rails of coke.

All of that being said, I still can't shake this feeling that I am being an asshole by not inviting him. I've known him my whole life and he has always gone out of his way to be a good friend to me. And I know that if I ever needed a place to stay or a shirt on my back, he'd be the first person to give me both. But on the biggest day of my life, surrounded by family and friends, I can't risk him getting drunk and emotional and hauling off on Steve, or taking bumps in the bathroom while a family member is trying to take a piss in the urinal next to him. Even if he was on best behavior, I feel like both me and my fiancee would have to have our heads on a swivel and be alert to what he was doing and where he was all night. And that doesn't seem like a very fair compromise for us on our wedding day.

AITA here? I guess I'd be lying if I said I wasn't somewhat afraid of the fallout with him too, considering the drug abuse and his continually deteriorating mental state.",14,44,0.93
1068,Not the A-hole,"My brother just called me to ask if he could contact my employment agency and tell them that I recommended him for work. I told him he could contact who he wants but not to give my name as a reference because, amongst other negative traits, he has had about 15 jobs in the past year. (He calls in sick frequently and gets fired.) I have a great long term (10+ years) relationship with the agency and am known as being reliable and dependable and I don't want to be seen recommending someone as unreliable as my brother.

I called the agency immediately after and they said, ""Oh, your brother just called"". They were already considering putting him forward for a position at my current workplace. I don't want him anywhere near where I work. So I explained to them that he's unreliable. They seemed shocked that I would say that about my brother but were appreciative of the warning. AITA?

EDIT: Upon calling the agency they immediately mentioned my brother before I had the chance to, hence the assumption that he mentioned my name to them. However, benefit of the doubt, we do have an unusual surname.

EDIT: Upon calling the agency they asked if I thought he'd be suitable for the position at my place. I said no, as he's not reliable. I could have told them many more things, most importantly that he's a thief as we handle some expensive items. I kept it simple to save a lot of headaches.

EDIT: Brother is 40+ living almost rent free in my ill/elderly parents house. Spends all his money on weed and borrows from them to feed his habit.

He was living out of state and got surgery, and so had to move home because he couldn't work anymore at his former occupation. Things are always fine, but he has very different political views than my other siblings and I. That's fine, everyone is entitled to their opinion. However, he constantly tries to start a political conversation, and rather than have a debate, he just starts yelling his opinion. Again, fine, if that's how you want to act as an adult that's your choice. Last time I was there it started with a discussion on medical marijuana, and how employers shouldn't be able to hold it against you. Which I agree with. it then spiraled out of control with statements like ""the green new deal the stupid Dems are pushing will outlaw planes"". Now, I don't really follow politics that much, but I have my opinions. My response was that I don't think that's what it says, I don't think  anyone wants to outlaws planes, because that simply doesn't even sound like a rational position. But I admitted that I wasn't really informed of the situation, but made the argument that it sounded far fetched. Now he starts yelling, got up and pushed me. I apologized to my parents and told them I won't be coming back until he either gets help or moves out. I know politics are particularly nasty right now, but it's absurd to think that I can't go see my own parents without worrying about being physically assulted.

1072,Everyone Sucks,"So a little backstory:
My GF was on her period (very easily offend able) and was craving *insert expensive burger place* and i thought maybe she’ll be feeling better when she eats. So I was going to order the food and wait in line to pick it up. She was finding an Table to enjoy our food.

Food was ready and we ate our Food.

At the *insert expensive burger place* refills are free (living in Germany thats rare) so my GF was going to fill her cup up so she’ll have smt to drink while we’re chilling in the Subway on our way home.

She stands up and her butt moves the table next to us. Nothing wild. I apologised to the lady on the neighbour Table (for my GF). She nodded and left it. 

GF came back sat down and the lady on the neighbour Table listet to my GF that she’ll needs to apologise to her bcs she didn’t do it in the first place. My GF does as the lady says. The lady wants a better apology. GF declined.

Now the lady goes ham and calls my GF a fat whale (btw my gf is not fat in any way. She’s not thin and petite but not fat. More the thicc kind)
The lady continues the insults as “dont eat burgers you fat whale” ect.

So my GF (with freshly poured FANTA in her hand) goes to tilt the cup and spills the whole cup on the lady. I didnt mentioned beforehand that she was an mid 20 blond girl wearing Alexander McQueens and an Louis V bag as well as an Fur coat. 

The Lady goes ham AF and attacks my GF. Spits in her Face ect. I was gathering the things that fell down the table and then proceeded to go in between them and lift my GF on my shoulders and went outside (behind us raging lady and *burger places* security). 

The Lady calls the Police. Police comes and proceeds to talk to them independent. The lady finished first. She comes to me and apologises to me for whatever reason.

At the end nothing happened. But im never going to go inside that burger place again. 

For the Final Question AITA for telling my GF that she should’ve taken the Insults, not spill the drink on the lady, go out the place to go home to avoid the fight.",70,53,0.75
1073,Not the A-hole,"Bit of context. 
Everyone mentioned is either 20-21 male
This is an alt because the guy that's getting the birthday party knows my main. 


Ok so me and 3 of my friends decided to surprise our best friend with a birthday surprise party. It's not much of a party we're just inviting him for dinner , getting him cake and just celebrating a friend's birthday in a less-crazy way.


Our families are all middle-class. but 2 are a bit high up there. 

M (Me) , BF (Birthday friend) F1 ( Friend one) F2 (Friend 2) , F3 (Friend 3) 

We tried asking BF where'd like to eat just like always but he asked us to agree on something and tell him. 

I asked F1 , F2 & F3 and they said the same thing. 

I started naming random restaurants for everyone privately , like I would send them private DMS and gather responses. Everyone would agree on except for F3 because it's a bit expensive for him. 

(Keep in mind F1,F2 & I) knew that he'd have a little trouble with money so we told him that he doesn't have to pay 1/4 out of BF meal nor buy him a gift or anything. He'd just have to spend money on UBER & food he'll eat at the restaurant. 

We named like 10-20 restaurants and he'd always say no either because they're too far or expensive. 

We named the cheapest good restaurants (even burger places that are a bit more expensive than fast food restaurants) just for him to come with us and celebrate. He said that none will work.

The next day I told him to name restaurants that he'd go to and he literally said ""I don't care,you guys pick and tell me"". I told him that we agreed on like 15 restaurants and he rejected all of them. He shouted at me ""I already told you I don't know and I don't fucking care dude"" then he said ""Let's just cancel this and make it next Friday"". 

I was really pissed. We gave him the option to choose and he rejected then he'd ask us to cancel our friend's BIRTHDAY celebration. I told him ""hey If you don't want to hang out it's fine just tell us from the beginning instead of wasting our time We have a lot of planning in a short amount of time"" I then stopped asking him where'd he like to go and just excluded him from the plans.


I feel bad that hey he doesn't have a lot of money ATM and I should respect that but he should also respect that it's a friend's birthday and it's only ONCE a year. Not something that we can cancel or delay. We tried cutting as much as possible for him without us extra paying. We only have a certain amount of money to spend on ourselves+ the fact that everyone of us is paying 1/3 for our friend's meal, 1/3 friends cake & 1/3 of friend's gift. 

so AITA?

1074,Everyone Sucks,"So to start off my girlfriend and I share a dog. I work at a police department and saved him from the pound as a puppy despite living in a no-pets property. I pay for his food, vet bills, and half of his toys and equipment like leashes.

My girlfriend is in college and works part time. I pay for her meals when we are together, pay for gas, tutor her, and even do some of her schoolwork for her and teach her the concepts afterwards because she procrastinates a lot. In return, she takes care of our dog when she’s not in school, cleans my place up on occasion, and promises that she’ll get a good job when she’s out of school so I can work on my business and look into becoming an EMT (lower pay than my current job). We live separately.

This morning, following a 12 hour shift of bullshit and spring breakers,I stayed up for her to stop by and drop off Fido on her way to school. I called her on the way over and at some point she said something about she wanted to sell our dog yesterday. I asked why and she said to give it a better home than what I provide, and said she only refused to sell him because she (correctly) thought I’d be pissed. She then said she thought I was a bad dog owner. I exploded.

Every day Fido gets at least 20 minutes of play time no matter how tired or busy I am. He often gets more. Up until today, he had the whole yard to run in freely and was visited daily by my niece while I sleep in addition to our daily 20 minutes of play/walkies. He is going to have to spend some time in his 5x10 kennel the next few days as a pool is being put in and he cannot roam freely in the dig site without being supervised, and she cited this and the fact that I don’t take him to the dog park as reasons why I’m a bad owner. Apparently the dog park is leagues better for a dog’s mental health than walking, even if you’re nocturnal and can only go at times no other dogs are there. She also doesn’t accept the fact that I walk him or play with him daily despite the fact she’s never here to see it.

I was triggered to say the least. I brought up the tutoring, the money I give her, called her an ungrateful smartass, everything in the book. I said something along the lines of “How can you even say that to me right now without realizing what a huge piece of shit it makes you”. She at some point said she didn’t care what I thought and now we’re not talking to each other.

We’re generally happy together but this is a recurring argument (she does not think I ever spend time with him for some reason) that I’m looking to put to rest. 

Am I the Asshole for going off on her so harshly?

Am I the Asshole for giving insufficient care to Fido or is what I can give enough?

1075,Not the A-hole,"First time ever posting on reddit but I really need some outside perspective on this!

Ok so here is the background, my girlfriend’s family has a family camp out every year. Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren’t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.

Personally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don’t know.

I’m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.

At this point I’m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don’t share a tent next year I don’t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.

Fast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.

At this point I tell my girlfriend I’m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.

I’m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?

TLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I’m pissed and don’t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don’t want to go

Edit: Thanks for the comments even the ones saying I am the asshole lol! To clarify if all the young couples were separate, I’d just suck it up and deal. It’s the fact that we are the only couple that this standard is being applied to that really gets my goat. 

Gonna ask my girlfriend a bunch of questions about the camp out history. Maybe she did something when she was younger that they are still holding against her?

Edit 2: so after talking with her nothing sticks out so that didn’t amount to much. To address some common themes I am seeing in the comments. 

1. That I am overreacting: your right it’s not really a big deal and I am overreacting. On the other hand we are being singled out which makes me feel untrusted and not want to be there at all. 

2. That this is stressing my girlfriend out: again you guys are right I am probably stressing her out a lot. It’s not really fair to her. I’m just going to make my choice and not complain anymore. 

3. Some background info: My girlfriend and I have known each other for 11 plus years and had been best friends for most of it. It took us a long time realize how much we loved one another and we are very much in it for the long haul. That’s why I’m here cause I want some outside perspective so I don’t screw things up haha. I am a white male and she is a white female so I am confident it’s not an issue of race or homophobia.

Yes she currently lives at home she recently moved back due to a very very serious family tragedy that I won’t talk about online. Prior to that we were going to move in together.

Edit 3: There were 8 couples that are close to our age and would be considered “younger” at the camp out 2 are married 1 was engaged, now married. So in total 5 non married/engaged couples ranging from ages 20-28

Edit 4: Here is some additional background info that I think will help you guys get a feel for the dynamic between my girlfriend and I, in regards to family.

My girlfriend is from a family that places a heavy, emphasis on community and togetherness. They get together regularly. Camp outs, movie nights, etc. they do these yearly and everyone goes and has a great time. The “elders” my girlfriend’s parents generation  run the show and quite a few of them are prudish by my standards. Additionally she grew up in a small town where everyone knew everyone. 

My family on the other hand is basically limited to the 6 or so relatives that live in my state and Iv never met any other part of my family. Just wasn’t ever a thing. Parents got divorced when I was 10. I moved out when I was 16 and didn’t speak to either of my parents till I was 20 for various reasons. My parents were hardcore hippies and took me to rainbow gatherings and music festivals as I grew up. As a result, I have a very very lax sense of propriety and have always been inundated with the importance of freedom of choice, expression, etc. for me seeing people having sex or doing drugs wasn’t exactly rare or a big deal as a kid.

Needless to say we have very different views when it comes to family values and how we interact with our families. I think this is a large reason that this has become an issue for us. 

Also thank you to everyone who has commented so far! Your comments and insights have inspired me to really dig deep and get to the root of this and why it has been such a big deal to me and the possible reasons why my GF has been resistant to going against the grain with her family.

Edit 5: After a serious discussion with my girlfriend, she finally admitted the real reasoning behind not sharing tents.

Her parents don’t like me. Apparently I made a bad impression on them when we were younger. Admittedly at 16 ( when we first met) I was a bit of a tool and not exactly the most likeable to parents. Additionally, while they do have a no tent sharing rule it hasn’t been strictly enforced for people over 18 in a while. My GF thinks that if we share a tent it will damage her relationship with her parents, which seems extreme to me. 

Anyways, for the foreseeable future I will not be attending the family camp outs. Feeling pretty stupid considering that my first thought was they don’t like me and I let her convince me for over a year that wasn’t the case......

Girlfriend is extremely upset with me and I hate that but I can’t bring myself to go knowing I was singled out and everyone knew except me. Makes me feel like a damn fool. It also explains the chilly reception I have received from other members of her family that are close to her parents. I’m not spending my paid time off and money to go somewhere I’m not welcome. Hopefully we can move past this!

Thanks to everyone for weighing in! Your comments helped me approach this in a tactful manner and helped me convince my GF to tell me what was up. Sorry if any of you were hoping for a happy ending lol.",493,1652,0.97
1076,Asshole,"This is more like a preemptive AITA. Some background: I am a member of a 24hour gym chain, and I have been a member of this branch for nearly 2 years since it opened. At this gym, it is always busiest at around 6-9pm weekdays and particularly on Mondays. The gym has 2 elliptical machines and 5 treadmills.

Today (Monday evening around 7:30pm), all the elliptical machines and treadmills were occupied. I notice that one of the staff (the head of the trainers) was on one of the only two ellipticals. A lot of people were just waiting around for an empty machine and this staff member was on this machine for more than an hour while looking at her phone and seeming like she was on a leisurely stroll a lot of the time. This is the first time I have noticed this happen. I know staff members can use the facilities because I see the trainers use them, but mostly during the late off-peak hours.

Would I be an entitled asshole if I said something/complain if it happens again? Looking for opinions whether I am correct in my thinking or I’m just plain wrong.

Edit: Corrected the machine the staff member was using.

More INFO: I am not sure if she was on shift or not. She is usually there every evening working on her laptop (logging/fixing schedules and such), but I’m unaware on that specific day if she was on shift. She was wearing a zipped up jacket over (what I assume to be but cannot be sure) her uniform.

Also, I just won’t say anything. It probably isn’t a big deal, and I’m just making an issue out of nothing in my head.",28,54,0.91

1078,Not the A-hole,"I recently broke up with my now ex girlfriend over text.

She would also lose her shit completely if I talked with other girls or if I didn’t text her enough ( despite texting her everyday) thus I started to feel unhappy

Now the main reason why I broke up over text is becuase i was afraid she might try to manipulate me, in a weak state, to stay with her, which she did try to do. I told her I never intended on hurting her and that I’m trying to do what’s best

I feel terrible about it and whenever I walk into her friends they give me looks as if Satan walked around the Earth.

1081,Asshole,"So the problem is like this. I live in a rented apartment, with a friend from work (lets call him A) for 3 years now. We know each other from college, but really got friends when we moved together in a new city. Now the apartment has 2 bedrooms, one for each of us ( he insisted he wants the bigger one, I didn't care that much and let him have it) and a somewhat spacious living room. We pay equally the rent, with me doing the actually pay and all the effort done to discuss any damages that happen, any roads to facilities or stuff like that, while my friend pays half and that's about it, 0 effort and expects for everything to be done for him like he is entitled.
Some friends of mine decided they would like to visit me in the weekend (one of my best friends from high school together with his gf and 2 of her friends ). A leaves almsot every Friday to visits his gf and returns late Sunday.  I discussed with him if my hometown friends can visit and stay in our apartment, he was OK with it and said he is thinking if anyone can sleep in his room (that was last week). Wednesday comes and i ask him again about it and he vehemently says no, that his room is not ""prepared"" to have guests and that he is om with people coming in the house, but they are not to sleep in his bed/room. Meanwhile another of my best friends from highschool decided to join totaling 5 people to be accommodated in my bed and a lousy couch in the living room, that can barely accommodate one person and with little time for my friends to rent something cheap to sleep through the weekend while visiting me. 
He refuses to have guests in the house, if the house is dirty or not cleaned, while he is lazy (we both are) to clean most of the time. He hates people getting in his apartment while its not clean with such a passion, he declines instantly any visit no matter how far the person has traveled to see him or how rare that ever happens. That's his quirk, its either clean or no visit. I know about this quirk, we had another similar fight some time ago, thats why I asked him before hand to clean up or to at least tell me with some time ahead if will do that or not, so that my friends can find something to rent. Thursday he didn't have the time or the mood to clean and thats why he declined my requests to have the 2 girls sleep in his room.

I ""was forced"" to let the couple sleep in my room, me and my other high-school bestie slept on the couch and the other 2 girls slept in my friends(A) room. He now accuses me that I broke boundaries, his trust and that I was an asshole for not even asking him in the last moment. I believe its his own fault for taking to long to decide.  We are in a pretty big fight about this whole incident. AITA for letting the girls sleep in his bed? 

TLDR from above: My flat mate of 3 years is pissed at me that i let 2 girls sleep in his room even tho i asked him ahead of time to let the girls know if they should rent a room or stay in our apartment.

I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider ""dates,"" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.

So just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes, if I wasn't ""big"" I'd be his ""ideal girl.""

1084,No A-holes here,"Great start to my Spring Break. I’m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.

At college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I’m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.

So I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. 

She started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn’t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.

Yesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything’s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I’m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I’ve been doing it for years). At this point I’m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.

Everything’s going well again and I’m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out “FUCK OFF” loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn’t even happen.

I feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I’ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she’s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.

So AITA?

EDIT: I only said it because of when the bullet hit my ear it was just directed at my sister because she shot the bullet

Just from the responses I’ve seen so far I can tell I’m in the wrong she just woke up for school and I asked her if she wanted to get ice cream when she gets out and she seems to have completely forgotten about yesterday and is excited, thanks for the responses.

UPDATE: I took her to Dairy Queen and talked to her about respecting other peoples personal space and also explained that I made a huge mistake as well by saying bad words to her.

She is very manipulative and my friend is heavily influenced by her philosophies. He has become a completely different person over time, and has expressed notions and opinions that are definitely not coming from him. 

If he wants to hang out with the guys, it’s her say and 90% of the time she says no. We are his closest friends and rarely see each other. Time spent is usually just catching up over dinner and is a very wholesome time together. 

The rare dinner happened where she showed up. She mentions that he is “way more talkative than usual”. A few weeks after, in an attempt to try to make our group closer with her, we attend her birthday and played board games.  Our friend is like a completely different person. He is clearly putting on a facade and wouldn’t make the jokes he would usually make or say things he usually says. He never laughs either.

Whenever I call, you can tell he’s with her when his voice is very quiet and inhibited and it’s always “I’ll call you back”. I even hear her raising her voice at him in the back sometimes. 

She got a job 1.5 hours away from the city and forced him to switch jobs close to her as well. After getting married she wants to buy a house in that area- very quiet small town. 

My friend works in trades and is having a change of heart. He wants to become an entrepeneur and stay in the big city. He doesnt want to live so far from friends and family and wants to pursue it. She completely hates the idea and does not support him. My opinion is that I know she is a very methodical person who goes according to plan. She probably thinks that it is risky and would want him to be safe and keep providing for her at a job he hates. 

The wedding is coming up and I really feel for him.  He’s one of the nicest guys in the world and he deserves so much better. I plan on taking him out for a beer and I’m just going to straight up tell him that he’s makjng the biggest mistake of his life by marrying her. AITA? 

TL;DR:
I want to tell one of my best friends that he shouldn’t marry his manipulative girlfriend

Edit: Throwaway cause my friends are redditors. 

He doesn’t have any idea that I feel this way and I feel like I should have let him know a long time ago. I think it’s better he realizes it on his own.",195,674,0.97
1087,Not the A-hole,"My friends are definitely free to post whatever they want and I have never left a comment on their posts saying otherwise. But as the years go on, more and more people (from high school and old jobs) are starting families and every post they put up is about their children. 
In my mind, I dont gaf if their baby had a 'poopspolsion' or went to the park or had a nap. I friended these people to follow their life, I didnt sign up for their dirty nappy pics or seeing nude photos of their bub in the sink. I really want to tell them that posts like that can attract creeps, but because everyone is super defensive about their baby posts, I just unfriend them to avoid an argument. 

I told one of my mates and she said it was quite petty to unfriend them over something so silly and that I could've just unfollowed their posts to avoid drama. 

But the thing is, I haven't talked to these people in years, so what is the point in keeping them around? Some of their lives just don't interest me anymore, so why should I have to 'unfollow' them to pretend like it does? AITA?",47,86,0.86
1088,Not the A-hole," I didn't feel bad about it when it happened, but my sister told me it was rude. We were in a restaurant's bathroom and after we did our thing, a little girl came out of the stall and her mom went in. Then it was just me, my sister and this little (about 8 or 9 year old) girl in the sink area. She started teasing her mom saying ""I'm going to go back to the table to Aunty without you!"" while laughing and her mom replied things like ""really, all by yourself?"" teasing her back. She was playing and I didn't mind, but I did notice she hadn't washed her hands at that point. I figured when her mom came out she would tell her daughter to do it. Then, however, the girl started rubbing her hands on the door handle to simulate leaving the bathroom (even though her mom clearly couldn't see that) and it grossed me out so much I just said ""Maybe you can go to your Aunty *after* washing your hands?"" The girl blushed and stopped touching the door. I walked out very grossed out because kid germs are not any less dangerous than adult germs, specially when waste matter is involved.

Anyway, when we left, my sister said that was very rude because I have no right to say that to a little kid and that she was probably just playing. Am I the asshole?",30,75,0.94

1091,No A-holes here,"My friend, whom I've known for many years, has progressively gotten larger over the past few years. I have made a comment previously about his weight gain due to general worry, but I would say that it's been over a year since I've said anything else to him about it. My friend is around 6 foot 5 inches, and he's probably close to 500 pounds at this point. My partner and I live in a smaller town near the large city that he lives in. My friend doesn't know how to drive, doesn't own a car, and would rather take public transportation, which is reasonable as he lives in a great city for that. The issue lies with him riding in either of our vehicles. This wasn't always an issue, but as his weight increases, the more we are both noticing the sounds that the seat makes as he's shoving himself in the car, as well as the general lowering of the passenger side when he's inside either of our cars. It's much easier for him and us if we drive when we want to hangout as public transportation is quite slow and limiting, but we're getting to the point where we are not only worried about his health, but also worried about our vehicles. 

Neither my partner nor I are sure of how to address this with him, and we've even gotten to the point where we've considered renting a large SUV that can handle a person of his size, and although this wouldn't be practical, it may send a message. If we all of the sudden stop giving him rides or picking him up he'll obviously know something is wrong, but again, we would have no idea how to address this without sounding like horrible people and losing our dear friend. After the last time that we hung out my partner has now established that she would rather not have him ride in her vehicle, and I am getting to that point as well.

So I started working in a warehouse with over 100 employees about a month ago. I pretty much talk and chitchat with everyone. This one girl was seemed more shy and reserved compared to other people. When I tried to smile at her or nod, I could never get any eye contact. I didn’t think much of it, until my co worker told me she was transgender. I thought it was a bit weird that she randomly just said that to me, but I thought it explained maybe why she was shy or quite. So next time I saw her, I wanted to try and talk to her, so I told her that I liked her pink hair (which a do). She was SO happy and her face lite up so much and she just started talking to me non stop about her hair. I was happy that I was able to “break the ice”. 
Last week my husband came and got me at work, and in the parking lot I was talking to her with my husband. When she left, my husband looked at me and asked: what the heck was that? 
I was confused and asked him what I did....? And he told me that he NEVER saw me talk like that to another girl. The “omg I looovvveeeeeeee your outfit ! Where in the world did you get it ?! You look so cute and adorable!!!” 
I felt really bad when he told me that, cause in that moment I realized that never do I talk to other people like that. Or talk about purses and makeup and super girly stuff and that I kinda change my voice when I talk to her. I didnt even realize I did that around her or why I do it. I don’t want to seem like an a hypocrite or something. Aita?

1094,Shitpost,"So here it goes. I am a only child in my family. My parents have the Save-Up-To-Get policy. So, I wanted a phone. My parents got me a Nokia 3210. They said if I wanted a SMART one, then I would just have to save up. I saved up for about 2 years and 3 months, just having enough money for the IPhone 10s. My dad tells me to give him the money, and he will get it. He comes back, and is already logged in with his Apple ID. I’m a little bit confused as this is my phone. He gives me a dumb lecture on some blablabla, and how he fed me, I live in his house, use his money for groceries, and how the phone is ACTUALLY HIS. I get pissed as hell, nearly shattering the vase, and tell him why is he so full on bull shit. Both of my parents are calling me a A-hole, so I decided to go to reddit. AITA?

Update: So, I considered breaking the phone, but left that as a last resort. I am thinking the diplomatic route. I think, If I can control myself, I may be able to get somewhere. And no, this isn’t the first time. The last time something like this happened was when my dad took my collection of post stamps (I had some cool ones) and sold them on eBay. I will keep you guys updated with the outcome.

Update 2: So, I tried the diplomatic route it went something like this. *dad walks in* “ woah this phone has such a nice camera! And screen too, it looks very nice! Thanks Matt, this phone is truly amazing! *i start talking* Dad, about that, you know I saved up for it for like nearly 2.5 years? *dad talks* we had this conversation yesterday son, it’s mine. You can have that old 4s I gave you, it still works a charm! * I talk* But, I saved up for it not you. *dad talks* you saved up for it under my roof, eating my food, using my electricity and my water. As far as I’m concerned that makes it mine.

*End of conversation*


Update 3: I thought the best plan of action was to ask my grandparents. So I call up and tell them. They are *HORRIFIED* . My grandmother immediately calls my dad. I can hear her talking to him and asking why he would do such a horrible thing. She threatens to tell everyone in the family, everyone, if he doesn’t hand it back and she gets a confirmation from me. Funny, I just received a 10s rewrapped with it reset. I just called my grandma to tell her I got it, but I think she might tell everyone anyway.
Thanks for the suggestions reddit!

Note: I’m not sure if he bought the phone with the cash, or he used his card. I’m not sure if this is important or not tho


Thanks guys, for the upvotes, the fact that people who don’t even know me give a crap really makes my day!

So my (28F) brother (24M) has a friend (call him Jack(24M)) with a drinking problem that we (my family) have known about for a long time and have tried to give him help to stop it. My brother and Jack are close, and naturally I’m friends with him too due to us all being in the same high school & him always being over.

This weekend Jack got drunk, as he always does. And I slept on one of the couches in the basement, and he slept on the other. I got to bed at around 3? Maybe 4? And from what I understand they went to sleep at around 6. 

At roughly 8AM I woke up to Jack urinating on me.

I’m not a light sleeper. But thank god I’m up at around 8 regardless of when I go to bed. According to my family the blood curdling scream I released was enough to wake the dead with fear. If it wasn’t for the fact that the dogs we own were sleeping in my parents bed they wouldn’t have believed me while I was freaking out.

I had a massive panic/anxiety attack due and spent roughly an hour sobbing in the bathroom (I have PTSD due to being attacked 10 years ago and it was a major trigger)

I’ve cut the friend out of my life, essentially. He’s no longer allowed over/to spend the nights. None of my brothers friends are allowed to drink when they’re here. And Jack has to pay my mother back for the couch being professionally cleaned.

In all of this I feel really bad for Jack, but he remembered everything when he woke up (he went right back to sleep after the whole thing), so I also don’t feel bad at all. My mother thinks I’m overreacting and being an asshole by not wanting anything to do with him, but even seeing him when he left caused me to freak out & since it happened I’ve been very.... not well, mentally. 

Am I the asshole because I don’t want to have anything to do with Jack? Or am I being too hard on him?

1097,Asshole,"I made an ALT account to ask this, since a bunch of my family follow my primary one.
I’m also.. not completely sure of the rules here, so I’ll try to keep it as PG as I can.

So, me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost 3 years. We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)
I will say that she’s the first thin person I’ve ever been with. She’s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I’ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I’ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.
This all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She’s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she’s not attractive if she doesn’t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.
I told her I had to be honest, and said that I’m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b-bs. It’s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I’m being honest, that’s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.
She was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we’ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn’t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).

Am I being the asshole here?

1098,Not the A-hole,"I was at a restaurant where the bathrooms are single stalls. The doors are wooden with textured glass, like the door to a principals office. I was using the restroom (bottoms exposed!) when someone rattled the handle, pulled and pushed it and then pressed their face against the glass to look inside. It was a kid, and I could make out his face clearly so I’m guessing he could likely see me? 

When I got out, the kid was waiting outside. Before he went in, I said “If the restroom is occupied, please don’t try to peek in.” And he stuttered out a “Sorry I didn’t know” before his mom (who was sitting at the table right outside the stall) turned around and started yelling at me. She said “How do you know it was him? It’s frosted glass he can’t see anything, and he’s 10 by the way so I don’t know what you - an adult - are implying.”

She got all in my face and was extremely defensive that I, a stranger, was telling her kid to not peep on women in the restroom. I don’t know if he was being a little creep, or if he’s being a kid and doesn’t know what’s okay and what’s not okay yet. She then said he walked away to check another bathroom, and that maybe some adult man did it and maybe I should go find him to yell at him.

I left the situation because I wasn’t trying to engage with her or cause a scene. Later my fiancé told me he saw the kid do the same thing to another bathroom door as he passed by. 

Anyway, given that she was sitting right there, I’m guessing she saw his behavior. I don’t know if she said anything to him or not but her reaction felt completely out of line to me.

1102,Not the A-hole,"Hi guys! So me (23f) and my fiancé (33m) have been together for two years. He’s honestly amazing and I’d do anything for him, hence what I did a couple months ago:

So he’s terrible with his money. He had a lot of debt and had no idea how to manage his finances. So he let me take over and become his accountant. 

I have a bank account I set up in both of our names that all his bills gets paid from. This includes our rent and utilities (that we split) and his bills like his car, car insurance, and what not. 

He had a lot of credit card debt, but because his credit score was so terrible, he couldn’t get approved for a no interest balance transfer. So I put it in my name. (I KNOW I KNOW but hey I’m gonna marry him so does it matter anyway??)

So whatever money is left from his paycheck after all the bills gets direct deposited into his own bank account. This ranges from 100-200 depending on how many hours he worked that week. 

So here’s my problem.. he smokes weed a lot. No big deal, it’s legal here and I don’t mind. Except it’s his number one priority when it comes to his money. He overdrafted his account last week to buy some and due to the overdraft fees and not the greatest paycheck this week, he didn’t have much this week and overdrafted again. (It’s only Sunday and he has to make it until Thursday)

Now the reason I’m really upset is because I added him to my AMEX and told him he can use it whenever he’s in a bind. He uses it all the time. And it adds up, so now I got myself in some debt. He also kept his own personal credit card during this time for emergencies and racked up a balance on that, which he can’t pay for because he keeps overreacting his account to buy weed. 

So all my hard work in getting his credit score up is for nothing because of all his missed payments on the other credit card. 

I’m just defeated and as much as I love him, I don’t know how I can go further with someone like this.

I’ve been very patient with her because I really enjoy my roommates company regardless.

An example of this behaviour is one day  a few of us were talking in the kitchen (keep in mind it’s around lunchtime) then she comes in from the living room

Fiancée: maybe I should just do yoga in my room since it’s quiet but could you guys keep it down?

Me: yeah for sure, but I agree if you want complete silence the bedroom is always the best option.

F: (while walking away, in a sad ‘whoa is me’ voice) well I guess I just won’t do yoga in the living room ever again

She began to say how I wasn’t letting her do the yoga she needs and that I need to respect her use of the common area (keep in mind the kitchen is widely considered a common area as well) I backed off this time and let it slide.

We were getting in the car and low and behold she comes out the door and gets in the car to join us, to my surprise. We drive to the movie theatre and we all get out and start walking together to the movie. After a minute I look behind me to see that the fiancée has vanished. I ask my roommate what the deal is.

Roommate: oh she thinks we’re walking to fast so she’s walking extra slow to make us feel bad

I was shocked he said this so calmly, as if it happens all the time.

F: Well you guys ditched me and left me behind and I feel sad now

"" "" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive "" or "" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z"" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   

Today a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . 

So I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ?

Its a childrens petting zoo ffs its not like im going to see a movie wothout him.

1113,Not the A-hole,"This just happened. We got new neighbors above us this past week and we all have patios/balconies. I’m watching tv, the blinds to my patio are open and I see two girls walk right up to my balcony, looking up. I’m thinking maybe someone is gonna throw them keys or something and move along. Fine. Until one of the girls starts filming and now I’m curious. Someone from the balcony above starts pouring beer down into one of the girls’ mouths while the other films it. They miss completely and the girl starts taking off her shirt in front of my window and patio. So, I’m annoyed at how loud they have already been and ask them to not do that outside my patio. They snicker and walk away. Said nothing to me. 

So AITA? 

Should I have just ignored them? I probably would have until she took off her clothes. That’s what irks me. I’m 25F and this is not a college town or party place. Families live here. 

If anything it’s trashy and I don’t think it’s funny. Beer stinks and attracts bugs and now it’s covered on my patio.

1115,Not enough info,"hi! Some background info is that I have an issue with sensory processing. My main issue with my senses is that certain textures make me gag and feel sick. I don’t like it either, I want to be able to eat everything and I have been broadening my horizons, but its difficult in a public environment while I have food in the first place.


I am not one of those people that eats only chicken tenders with fries, but it is my go-to if nothing appeals to me. But this happens every single time I am at a restaurant, even when I am trying something new and I like it.


While I am eating, my mom will push something in my face and tell me to try it. Sometimes I will try it, even though I know it’ll make me gag. Other times I am eating my food and am just not interested in what my mom wants me to eat. I usually give a polite no, but she never really takes no for an answer.


It will often devolve into an argument, with me firmly saying that I’m not very interested, and her repeatedly telling me that I just have to try it. She will frequently say that I am impossible to deal with, and this is all my fault. She gets very upset when I just don’t really want to eat something when I already have something in front of me to eat. Sometimes she will tell me that I don’t love her, and that she’s an awful mother when I won’t try something. I tell her that her doing this bothers me, and I have explained that I don’t want to start violently gagging in public, and that I just want to eat the food in front of me. But usually she’ll do it again and the cycle continues. She sometimes will make me try a food I already tried and don’t like.


I just want to eat in peace and not have every outing devolve into a massive argument.

1116,Not the A-hole,"So for my partners birthday, we had everyone round ours for celebration, including a few friends that are known to be a bit...sensitive and quick to jump to conclusions. They also get ill very regularly and are constantly tired, so it was lovely seeing them both, even if it was just for a few hours.

They were planning on heading home just as I was starting on the main meal for the night: I at this point was in host-mode so just assumed I was cooking for everyone. One of the people in question is gluten intolerant, so I made a separate meal for them. They objected to this, I assumed out of politeness. But I was all-go, and I could see they were exhausted, and would not wanna go home and cook, or wait for a takeaway.

So, I finished cooking as they were leaving and packed them up to little tubs of food to go, the GF one labelled as such. They smiled and left.

Few days later, we have a disagreement. They call me childish (I'm 8 years younger but I like to think I'm mature) and ignorant. They bring up my partners birthday, and how I ignored their 'pleas' at not wanting food, saying how they felt like they had said no and that should have been enough. They kept bringing it up over and over, saying how ignorant and an asshole I had been for giving them food. 


I didn't feel like I was in the wrong...as I said, they were exhausted. And if they didn't want the food, they could have thrown it out the moment they left my house. But instead, they took it and made me out to be bad. Now I wanna know if what I did really was bad of me....",38,88,0.97

I knew this was going to happen, but my grandma always mentioned that me and my sibling would have something and not to worry, but she didn't want to decide how to split her inheritance between us all and thought it would be easiest if my dad decided. I was never worried about it cause my dad was never selfish and I assumed I would get a fair share.

 As much as I loved my grandma and didn't want her to pass it was always a relief to think about inheriting a little money to help maybe put a down payment on a house, pay off student loans or just have something for retirement( I have nothing cause I've been paycheck to paycheck my whole life). Finances have always been stressful for me having lived in the poverty line my whole adulthood.

I was surprised to find out my dad wasn't going to share anything with me or my brother. He basically said we'd have to wait our turn(for him to die). I don't know if My grandma ever communicated to My dad that she intended for her grandkids to have a share, but she told us we'd have something. My dad now has a million in assets and I struggle to get by. I believe my dad has more than he needs to be comfortable, but he doesn't seem to think so.

She gave it away and the people killed it in a week they say they didnt do anything wrong but I dont believe it. Then my favorite rabbit died from skin rot, which just happens theres nothing I could have done to prevent it and we put it down because there was no other thing to do she was older as well. 

Now present day I'm down to 1 rabbit to my name but we have 3 others. My mom has promised a lady MY rabbit for a photo shoot only for a day but still. We are out of town so no one would be there to keep an eye on my rabbit and this photo is with babies and toddlers who havent a clue how to handle rabbits.

These kids feed our rabbits random shit too so I at least want to be there to monitor the situation. I told my mom this she said I was being dramatic and that she trusted this lady, who I dont know. I told her to use one of her rabbits or my sisters and she claimed they're all my rabbits so why would it matter which one she chooses.

1122,Asshole,"My wife was diagnosed with BPD about a year and a half after we got married. I had no idea she struggled with her mental health while we were dating or the beginning of our marriage. The signs started to show after we signed on our house.

Fast forward to 2 years later. I’m pissed. She started getting worse mentally, no amount of therapy/treatment was helping. Her needs were impossible to meet. She was having temper tantrums constantly, going between telling me she hates me and I’m the worst thing ever to telling me how good I am to her and how lucky she is. Finally after one night of being woken up at 3 am to her erratic shit, I told her I couldn’t do this anymore and I wanted to move out. She left the room, came back, threw back a bottle of pills and swallowed. I called 911. She never showed any symptoms of overdose. Later, she told me and her doctor that there were only 3 pills in the bottle, she didn’t actually want to die, she knew three pills wouldn’t hurt her, she was just acting out for attention. It was an act of manipulation. 

That was two months ago. She he’s been in residential treatment center for about a month now, she has two months left. I’m so angry that she couldn’t pull it the fuck together. I’m at home with our two young kids alone, drowning between taking care of them and keeping my job, while she’s “learning to cope” with life.

She has it made. I make good money. She doesn’t work. The kids are in daycare full time. We have a housekeeper. I treated her like gold, she had my constant attention, affection, and got anything she wanted. What the fuck does she need help coping with?

The coordinator of her care sends me messages about what her days consist of. Therapy, yoga sessions, meditation, activities like arts and crafts, evening group outings to the movies. She’s on an insanely expensive vacation because she’s too weak minded to handle life as an adult and I’m fucking angry about it. 

I’m not being nice to her right now. I’m not being mean either, I’m mostly ignoring her. It’s not great for her treatment but I don’t give a fuck about that right now. I spent years coddling, spoiling, and placating her I’m done. I can’t handle speaking to her. I’m disgusted by her at this point.

I want to move out, but I can’t because of the kids. Since my wife is too crazy to deal with her own self that makes me the sole caretaker for our kids, so I need to stay in the house. I want for her to go somewhere else when she gets out of her treatment, I don’t want her to come back here. The coordinators of her care/her doctor don’t like that idea. They told me that she’s not ready to know I’m mad at her, they will need to pull in a family therapist to mediate that. They told me I need to have compassion when talking to her, so I stopped talking to her. My wife is so off that I can’t tell her that I’m angry with her for her terrible, adolescent behavior without a third party present to make her “feel okay about it.” She’s pathetic.

1124,Not the A-hole,"TLDR: Am I'm the asshole for turning off the stove while my friend is making a soup but nobody is at home

&#x200B;

So following situation. I live in a shard flat with a friend. Usually, I am the one who wakes up last in the morning while my friend goes already to work. One morning I wake up, go to the kitchen and see that he left a pot with soup on the stove - which is still on (on low). I was not completely sure how dangerous it is to leave the stove unattended, so I googled and called even a friend to get a second opinion. Short google search & my friend both told me it is not very smart. Most cases nothing happens, but if something happens it is quite dangerous. So I write a message to my friend that I don't want to mess up his soup but I can not leave the house without turning off the stove. He was a bit mad, but did not really say anything. I thought that the case is closed and he will not do it again.

One week later. I just came back from a weekend at friends and see - big surprise - the stove is back on and nobody is home.

1126,No A-holes here,"I have a really big cottonwood tree in my yard that is right over my neighbor's garage and recently had a branch fall through my fence. This thing is dangerous and needs to go.

I had several estimates and they ranged from $4500 to $6000 for the one tree. I also have some other smaller trees that were dead and I wanted removed but planned to do it myself.

I thought I lucked out and found a company that would cut down the big cottonwood and my 'non priority trees' for $3600. I was pumped and immediately told them I was interested. In the conversation I had mentioned that the job would need a crane.

They arrive a few days later with a lift truck and a crew of guys. This is the first time the owner had seen the tree and informs me he'll need another $500. Bringing the total to $4100. I was annoyed, but still $400 cheaper than the next offer and I wasn't going to have to cut the other trees down myself.

They started by cutting down the smaller trees.  Then I got a text message from the owner asking me to come outside.

He Informed me that the big tree has a split in it that he hadn't seen and it would be dangerous to cut and that it would be a gamble trying to not destroy my neighbor's garage in the process. He explained that if he touches that tree and it goes through the garage his insurance would cover it but he'd lose his business. He tells me he can't cut the tree and it would require someone with a crane.

I told him that I had told his estimator that it would need a crane and he tells me that his company never uses them. 

""Why did you take the job then?"" I say.

He says that it was his mistake and he's sorry but he can't do it. At this point my yard is a total mess of tree debris and they've been working for a couple hours cutting trees I could have done myself.

I realized that I'd now have to pay $4500 to someone else to get this dangerous tree gone and told the owner that if they couldn't remove it that I wouldn't be paying them anything. He's the expert and it's not my fault he botched his bid. They had already upped me $500 and now I was going to have to go up another $400 with someone else.

He was upset but we both calmly discussed it and he agreed it was his fault and he knew the other trees weren't a priority. I wouldn't have called them if it weren't for the big one they were walking away from.

He understood but also told me he rented the lift for 3 days for this job specifically for $1100 and would also still need to pay his guys. 

He explained that they had 100% 5 star reviews on Google and he said he'd rather take non payment than have me trash them online. They stayed another 5 hours cleaning everything up meticulously and when they were done came to the door to apologize a second time.

I felt terrible because they busted their ass in cold weather doing dangerous work. I told him the least I could do was give him 5 stars which my wife and I both did.

1128,Asshole,"This happened over the weekend and I feel pretty bad about how it went down, but my intentions were honorable here. I was the Best Man at my pal's wedding. 

I got the idea to start up a bet and collect a pool from other people attending the wedding. The basic idea is that participants guess a year in which the couple will divorce and put in a certain amount of money (minimum bet $50), and IF they end up divorcing during that year whoever guessed that year wins the whole pot. 

So for example, if 2 people guesses the year 2025, if the couple actually divorces in 2025, those 2 people would split the whole pot. (We raised a little over 3 grand total, so like $1500 each in this example.) 

BUT, if the couple is still married after the latest bet in the pool (somebody put 2040) then the couple gets the entire pot. 

So that was kind of the twist that I meant to convey to them, that yeah sure it was a real bet, but that if they stayed together they could expect 3 grand in 2041. 

When I was explaining the bet during my best man speech that was how I was going to end, kind of with a charming/corny line that ""But we all know none of us are going to be winning the bet, because you two will be together forever, so you can look forward to cashing in in 2041!"" 

Yes, if they actually divorced and if somebody in the betting pool nailed the right year we would follow up and that person would get the winnings. But I don't think these two will get divorced, they're perfect for each other. 

That was supposed to be my intended message, it was supposed to be a kind of fun silly thing. 

Before I could even get to that part the bride started crying and the parents and bridesmaids and all that were almost yelling at me, and the groom (my best friend of decades) was furious. 

Even later that night when I explained to him my intent he wouldn't even listen to me. The bride especially apparently ""feels betrayed by everyone"" who participated in the bet. Even though I explained that I had misled all of them by saying the bride and groom knew about it in advance that wouldn't make them less angry. 

So needless to say I feel extremely bad. But I meant it all as a nice gesture and I feel if they could just see they have a near certainty of getting a free 3 grand in 2041 they could see this intention. I think by then it will be a fond memory and a ""look back on it laugh"" kind of thing when we get to the 2040's, plus a nice little bonus of a 3 grand prize. 

I keep trying to explain this but my friend isn't hearing it, especially when I told him that I still had to follow up with whoever ""wins"" on the off-chance they do get divorced. But I really doubt they'd ever get divorced. 

I know I went about it the wrong way but I don't feel I was the A here, but I want to see what reddit thinks. 

tl;dr - Collected bets to see what year my friends would divorce at their wedding, but if they don't get divorced they win, I meant it to be nice/sweet but they are both furious at me. ",542,1845,0.92
1129,Not the A-hole,"I matched a woman on dating app, and all went well as we have similar interest on movie, TV etc. We even met up once beforehand and feel that we match.

However all seems changed on the second date. (This may be long) In the beginning of the date, she brought me a present for my birthday, and I was pleasantly surprised. We made some banter and joked that since my birthday already passed, she should save up on the next occassion, like Christmas. (Not yet relevant, but will be later)

On my chatting, she also let loose that she is passive aggressive and she likes to be. Things start to turn south when I think she starts to flaunting passive aggressiveness, such as ""she may break up with me for bringing her to a bad restaunrant"" or joking ""she may be a man and I should break up with her"" and quite a bit of taunting that I should, which I think is a bit over.

We were also getting a bit touchy, but suddenly saying that I'm no longer allowed because I brought her to a bad restaurant. I'm only allowed to touch her again if I bring her to a nice restaurant in our next date. She also said ""I need to pay because I brought her to a bad restaurant"", which I was planning to anyway because it is true that she was not enjoying it.

Finally when we said goodbye, she told me she's keeping the present for Christmas, as we joked before. I was very miffed by it.

So overall I thought that 1) she is passive aggressive and likes it, 2) she brings jokes way too far for me to be comfortable and 3) she leverages reward/punishment towards me.

We got in a big argument yesterday where she feels that her heritage is being attacked and that I don't respect where she comes from, but I am really not interested in going. All of my friends are attending college next year, I don't really care too much about my relationship with my birth country, and I'm really excited to go to college but don't want to wait a year. Her points are that having an EU citizenship is amazing and that it opens up the doors for so many opportunities, and she calls it an insurance policy in case anything goes wrong in the US. Yesterday in our talk though, she basically put a gun to my head and said ""you are going to Europe for a year or I am not paying for your college"" which I would have needed to alert colleges to earlier to get a bunch of financial aid. AITA for pushing back so hard on this, and feeling like I'm being forced into a year of something I really don't want to do, or is she right with this really being a great opportunity I'm not seeing and that I'm offending her heritage?

1133,Asshole,"Update **

My son sat down with me and said that he'll go to Europe without any hassle as he wants us all to enjoy but to reconsider the NZ trip. He told me that he was looking forward to a trip like this for years and he would prefer it to Disney or anything else. He says he watches the expansion edition once a year with his friend and it would be a dream to go there. 

I never knew how much it meant to him as he never speaks or asks for anything. I dismissed it as Twilight type thing that young girls go through and forget it later. He's had difficulty with social interactions and has dropped out of all sports, music, and other extra curricular activities that we enrolled him in. I was worried that being in fantasy worlds will become a maladaptive daydreaming type situation and would force him to shut down even more. I freaked out at the cost, and that it would be tours of essentially a movie production and felt that maybe an open Euro trip would broaden his experiences a bit. After looking at the tours and watching videos last night it looked absolutely breathtaking and seemed to have been built with a lot of care.

Someone from here sent me a PM with pages of info of where to visit and what to do. We decided that we would land in Auckland and drive down to the tip of the island (originally it was to stay in the city and check out shopping and some city structures but my son and daughter suggested that a scenic road trip would be better) 

My husband said it's ultimately my call and I don't want to take this away from them. I was miffed that we're forking over close to 3k for his friend's trip cost (especially after my husband has a pattern of giving money away) so I thought I would ask his dad to pitch in. I went about it absolutely the wrong way and it was embarrassing for him to admit to another person that he couldn't come up with any money. He told me today he can pay a bit now and full amount later, and my husband was tempted but ultimately said that he gave him his word and that Tom (son's friend) is like family anyway. I'm still ambivalent about this but I hate the way I approached it. When it comes to money I panic a lot. Growing up we went from fairly comfortable to dirt poor because my father either gave it away or lent a lot to family that we never saw. I told myself I have to be harsh to protect my husband's money. But it was just wrong. 

Son recommended that we sit down this weekend and watch the expansion editions of the movies together to better immerse. I'm going to try and watch the prequel Hobbit movies to better get context and catch up to the main story line. 

Anyway this post isn't about my guilt or validation. This is temporary account and you don't know me. But I didn't realize that my words have brought up a lot of scars for posters here that have experienced horrible parenting and that's the last thing I want to do.

1134,Asshole,"Posted this on [r/confession](https://www.reddit.com/r/confession) yesterday and someone said to post it here.

I used to troll and shitpost a lot back in 2009/10, then moved onto this as it felt like a step up. Years back on Facebook these strange ""most beautiful teen competition"" pages were popping up and gained a lot of popularity among young people posting pictures of themselves on there, and as you can imagine it also brought a lot of creeps (, worth adding that I was around 16 then so I would see posts saying my friends had posted on them which is how I found out about them).

I originally intended just to find out how quickly and how many friend requests and dms I would get after posting a pic in these pages, which turned out to be an absolute fuck ton within seconds. So I'd make a very real looking profile with pictures that wouldnt show results on reverse search, all normal looking pics in a few albums, to make it seem legit (fake profiles are usually obvious so I made a good effort of it).

Once the dms and requests started flooding in I started checking out the guys profiles just being nosey then I stated noticing a lot of them were engaged, married or in a relationship so I would always talk to them and see where they took it. (I would only start if they started with me).

So after having conversations long enough to get some good evidence of them being creepy and unfaithful, the more depraved the better, and it got really depraved sometimes and it wouldn't take long (usually about 10 mins), I would message their partner a ""sorry to tell you but I think you should know..."" message along with the screenshot, then I would send a screenshot of that conversation to the guy. Reactions varied, from threats, panic, hysteria or just being instantly blocked.

I've never told anyone about this but I always found it enjoyable, I only did it for a few months or so but I'm not sure how many relationships I must have caused to end. I still can't work out if I'm a piece of shit for it or not.

Worth adding I wasn't whiteknighting / looking to save any fair maidens, I didn't care about the women, I wasn't doing, just wanted the reaction from the guys, I think cheaters are pieces of shit anyway so I had no problem doing it to them for fun

1136,Not the A-hole,"Right then: first the setting. My condo has all the activities area stacked together. So there’s the pool, behind which is the gym next to which is huge open area for barbecue and hosting parties and finally the kids playground. The gym has glass windows, so everything outside inside can be seen. 
I like to workout in the evenings because it’s cool and less people around. 
Cut to today evening: Me and another neighbor/friend decide to workout together. We enter the gym and there’s an older gentleman working out on the arms machine. I start my cardio on the treadmill and I see this kid (7-8 years old? I dunno how to guess their ages) comes up running and knocking on the gym door asking me to open the door. The door can be opened only with the condo key card which I guess was with his mother. 

Now I know this kid. Every now and then he comes in the gym after his playground time and starts knocking off stuff, playing with dumbbells, putting stuff under the belt of the treadmill, switching the machines on and off, etc. 
the first time I let him in he had a screaming match with his brother who was outside the gym so they were just screaming at each other separated by a soundproof gym glass but it was annoying me and others who were inside the gym. He then proceeded to kick, lick and punch the gym glass wall. His mother meanwhile was just chatting with another neighbor as if this whole noise was her usual decibel.

The second time I let this kid in he put a dumbbell (smaller ones) on the treadmill when a girl was on it causing her to lose her balance but she had good reflexes and was cooling down so impact wasn’t much. She just scolded the kid and asked to talk to the mother but the mother wasn’t interested and took the kid home.

Cut to today, he bangs and bangs on the door screaming to be let in. But I do not. Neither the uncle.  My friend was between sets so he couldn’t and by the time he was done the kid started a full blown tantrum and ran off crying/screaming towards the playground.  My friend is saying I was a prick not letting this kid in but my friend has never seen this kid’s behaviour. 
My friend is like making a kid cry like that on purpose is assholey. 

So was I really the asshole? I’m reeling towards no but my friend says kids are kids, therefore I was/am. ",61,192,0.95

1138,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR at the bottom.

I'm a female and in my early 20s. I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. 

Yesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. 

At this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him ""can I help you with something?"" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him ""there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits"" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. 

After about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)

I feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.

TL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?",108,378,0.94
1139,No A-holes here,"Ok first of all the kid is quite young like around 6 ish and I’m 17 I have my a levels I need to revise for and the only environment I feel comfortable in revising in is my bedroom however they recently moved both of their two girls to the room beside mine and they are not quiet at all. I usually ignore it but I can’t take the constant screaming arguing and crying anymore so I have started to play ACDC and other music of that sort of type at max volume to try and block out the noise. Recently the younger one started crying and I can hear the parent shouting at them, kid probably did something wrong and stuff you know normal stuff. So as usual turned up my music am I the asshole for doing this? Just feel like I’m making their life worse but I just want to get my work done

Edit: thanks for all the advice guys just to let people know before they comment the usual “you know there are things called headphones” yes I do know they exist and I have ordered some new headphones I don’t usually use them cause they are uncomfortable for me since I wear glasses",109,147,0.94
1140,Not the A-hole,"To start this out my girlfriend and her two kids live with me. I don't have a problem with paying for things here and there. I do make a lot more money than her. But im not rich and i have plans for the money like bills and retirement funds.  she doesn't make a lot through out the year so taxes are a huge windfall for her. 

4 months ago her car breaks down and it has been nothing but a problem since she got it. leaking oil, randomly not starting, requires premium (somehow they didn't know this when they bought it) etc etc. and more the car was going to cost more to fix(full engine replacement) than it was worth. so we sat down and discussed it and opted to look at a new car. i would feel comfortable with her in a new car with the kids since i didn't want them stranded on the road in the middle of winter. 

anyway we looked around and found a car she wanted but she didn't have money to put down so i moved some things around and was able to put $1750 down for her on the agreement she would pay me back with her tax returns. 

tax returns come (8k) and she doesn't say anything so i give it a couple days then ask her about it. she gets mad because if we were married she says she wouldn't have to pay me back. she also says she has plans to spend it most of it and is putting 1k in savings and doesn't want to give it to me because she doesn't want to feel broke all the time.

I was walking down the street and my phone got a notification. There was a woman in front of me who turned around and said that's disgusting.

I initially tried being polite and explaining that it wasn't me and it was my phone, but she wasn't listening and started attracting some attention by swearing at me loudly. So I said ""you're not attractive enough to be whistled at"" quite loudly and walked away.

1142,Not the A-hole,"My roommate and I are currently stuck together on a lease. She hasn't had a valid ID for 2 years. When her ID expired, I kept reminding her to get a new one. She kept putting it off. Neither of us drive, but I found 7 different people who all offered to drive her. However, she was too busy playing on her 3DS to accept any of the rides. She always just said ""I don't want to go right now. Some other time."" Some of the people offered more than once, but she always refused to put down her 3DS long enough to go.

&#x200B;

I swear, she is addicted to it. This went on for 2 years. Every day, whenever she wasn't at work, she would just sit in the living room and play on her 3DS from the minute she got home until the minute she went to bed. She wouldn't do anything else. No house chores, no errands, nothing. I kept nagging her about getting a new ID, telling her how much she needs one, explaining why it's important, but she wouldn't even listen to me.

&#x200B;

2 months ago, her debit card expired, and a new one wasn't mailed. She has no checks because she just never wanted to get any. She can't go to the bank for her new debit card because she needs an ID to do that. So now she has no access to her money. Still, she wouldn't do anything about it. She expected me to just start paying the full rent and utilities by myself, as well as buy her groceries. I can't afford all that easily on my individual income.

&#x200B;

Since she still refused to put down her 3DS and do something to fix this, I hid the charger while she was sleeping and told her that she can't have it back until she gets a new ID and new debit card to be able to access her money and pay her half of everything.

&#x200B;

After only 1 day of her 3DS being dead, she started flipping out. I mean, she went nuts. She was like a drug addict having a crazy withdrawal. Still, I didn't return her charger. This seems to be working though because she finally went to the BMV to get a new ID. She still needs to wait for it to come in the mail before she can get a new debit card though.

&#x200B;

Think I should add that, in my state, I have the right to sell her stuff to get money for her half of the bills if she refuses to make an effort to get the money herself. I believe I am being too nice by only hiding her charger and not selling any of her stuff.",82,85,0.9
1143,Not the A-hole,"My parents have been fighting constantly as long as I can remember. When I was a child, they would threaten divorce every three months or so. Many fights were mutual, but my father has been more abusive overall. I've heard him lock my mother out in the snow. I also know he knocked her teeth out once. This has been gradually getting better as I grew up, especially after I told my father I was scared of him after hearing him scream at my mother while I was sobbing in my room.

He has never been physically violent with me, but he would randomly get super angry at some things I would do or say, screaming loudly and getting red. Because of this, my mother never left him, saying things like ""he has been an excellent father, I can't deny it"" every time I would criticize him. I recognize that my mother has been by far and large the victim of this abuse but I resent her for making me grow up in this environment that made us both suffer.

Another thing is that they would both use me as their marriage counselor when I was a teen/young adult, telling me things I never wanted to know (from the details of their fights to their sex lives), which really took a toll on me seeing them as parental figures.

Nowadays, their temper has improved, and it's mostly petty bickering. But it is *constant*. I live on my own now; we spent Saturday together and they could not spend 10 fucking minutes without criticizing one another. I've told them many times that I hate it but they keep going. It's like that every single time I see them. I honestly loathe to visit just because it's so damn exhausting, I just blank out whenever they're not directly talking to me, and always find excuses to cut the day short. The freedom of not living with them has seriously improved my mental health and I feel much better when I don't see them for at least a month.

1145,Not the A-hole,"Sorry, I've found myself in a pretty odd situation.

For background context, I've been dating my girlfriend for around two years. For the first year or so, all was normal and our relationship was totally great, and then she went on a hormonal birth control pill. Her sex drive plummeted, and around sixth months ago we had a talk where she confided that she was really uncomfortable doing sexual things any more, and that she was only doing them at all because she felt like she had to for my sake. I apologized, since I obviously didn't want her to feel that way, and we've been pretty much celibate since then (I told her we should only be doing sexual things if she was interested in doing them). She started seeing a counselor for that two months ago, and I'm hopeful that in time things will return to normal there.

In addition to the above, I have felt like our relationship has been lacking in emotional intimacy for the last while. Two nights ago, I decided to try to bring up how I was feeling to her, and told her that at times it has felt more like she has been my roommate than my girlfriend, and that I'd really appreciate if we could try to spend more time together. She was receptive and the talk felt pretty productive, we set a date for the two of us this Thursday. 

Afterwards, though, she told me that a friend of hers asked her on Monday if she would be interested in the two of them being ""queer platonic partners"", and she asked me for my permission to say yes. I asked her what that meant, since I had never heard of the term before, and she described it as ""a platonic relationship with a lot more of an emotional commitment"". I told her honestly that from how it sounded I wasn't comfortable with it.

She told me that she might be explaining it badly, and that she'd appreciate if I could google the term and read up about it and then talk to her again about it. I did, and google described it pretty much the same way that she described it. We talked last night, and I tried to explain that I didn't mind if she had close, emotionally involved friendships, since that's none of my business, but that choosing to label it with a ""relationship"" word felt like it was crossing a line for me (especially since my girlfriend is bisexual). I also said that I was feeling kind of insecure in our relationship at the moment, especially because of the intimacy issues I raised the other night, and hearing from her right after I talked to her about that that she wanted to enter into a deep emotional commitment with someone who wasn't me felt kind of disheartening. The conversation ended with her agreeing not to say yes to her friend.

Am I being the asshole here? I know there's some aspect to this that's founded in my being insecure, but I'm not sure if I'm being an asshole about it or if it's reasonable to be uncomfortable with labeling a friendship that way.",123,352,0.97
1146,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years, and things were great until our daughter was born 6 months ago.

Since then, our relationship has gone down the tubes because he refuses to care for her. He’ll sit on the couch and play video games and he’ll only tend to her while she’s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I’m in the middle of doing something right then, he’ll ask me why I can’t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he’s watching tv and she’s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won’t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We’ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I’ve told him I can’t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.

I’m honestly considering filing for custody but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was going out. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn’t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what’s going on.

She called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he’s upset with me for involving his mother and for “taking a video out of context.” I’m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?

1150,No A-holes here,"I work at a special needs school for children with autism and developmental delays, Im a TA and have worked here for years. Let me say I LOVE my job and LOVE the kids at our school.

Theres this one kid, pretty high functioning, and he's 17. (Hes also like 6'3"" 230 and is pretty built) This kid arbitrarily sorts people into good and evil the first time he sees a new person. There is no rhyme or reason to this. He is super friendly and nice to the good people. He likes to scream at and attack evil people because as he says ""Its fun!"".

This applies to staff and other students. He's kicked a 7 year old before, because the 7 year old said ""hi"" to him and he didn't like him.

On friday, this kid attacked one of his TAs in the morning, he was restrained, and seemed to settle down as the day went one. Later that day, at lunch, he began hitting another staff with his plastic lunch tray. As staff went to restrain him again, in the process he bit off a decent part of a staff member's finger. Which he thought was ""super funny""

After, when we had a staff debriefing about it, I said something like ""I know he's autistic, but he attacks people just because he doesnt like them, that makes him an asshole""

1151,Not the A-hole,"I was cleaning the hallway the other day and among the junk was a nondescript notebook. I flipped through it quickly to see who's it was to see what pile it should go into. Two things became evident. 1) It looked like diary notes from infidelity 2) it was my wife's. I was so shocked that I read the whole thing and everything in it was matching our life. Right down to her interactions with our kids. I was shaking and having an immediate crisis. Chose to confront her about it. She says it's fictional, that I'm a bad person for limiting her creative writing and reading her private notes.

I choose to believe her about it being fictional. And we have a stressful life so I get fantasizing about something else. What really hurts is the active choice to write it specifically about being infidelity and in the setting of our family. One portion was about how the affair was not infidelity towards ""the husband"" (me) but kissing the husband would be infidelity towards the lover. 

Am I the asshole here? I'm quite frankly disgusted. I've found empty condom wrappers in her pants before (for personal use she says) and gotten home to towels in the bathroom smelling of unknown mens perfume when after having been travelling with the kids when she was home alone. So I read it in  that context. She swears that she wouldn't be unfaithful (and that she doesn't have the time or energy).

Edit: thank you for the input everybody. It warms my heart to know that my feeling and reactions are justified. We've had it rough for a long time so I've been thinking that at least we both get to see the kids every day, but I don't think I can live like that anymore. She is prepared to, but since we make each other unhappy even as only being parents and not lovers I'm thinking something has to change now.

I move out of the bedroom a few weeks ago. We've found a new balance of being parents but not partners. It's given me some time of relative rest. I know it's temporary so I'll gather up the energy for what has to come next - an actual divorce. 

She's been trying to be friendlier but it's obviously a conscious effort. She even suddenly remembered that she likes me and why she married me. I'm not feeling the nostalgia however. It feels liberating to not want to go back again. As long as she's a friend and not a partner I feel that I can drop the resentment. Not so much if we are partners.",140,68,0.94
1152,Not the A-hole,"I live in a flat, and recently we had some new upstairs neighbours move in. I haven’t met or seen them at all yet, but I’m about to lose my mind.

They clearly have a number of small children, which is fine. You expect some noise in a block of flats anyway, it can’t be helped, and I get that kids can be noisy but this is actual insanity.

From early morning to at least 10:30pm, every single day, they are tearing about the flat and screaming. Stomping SO loud non stop it’s all we can hear, and screaming and shouting and jumping, dragging or throwing things across the floor etc. 

As I say, this happening occasionally is to be expected, I don’t expect a silent home when I live in a block of flats. But in my opinion this is happening beyond what would be considered reasonable.

It’s not normal walking footsteps, it’s loud, constant thudding and stamping. The screaming and shouting and crying is relentless and very piercing. And as I say, this goes on ALL day EVERY day and until way past 10pm every single night.

At a weekend I’m completely fine with noise (we have other neighbours that at a weekend regularly have loud parties until 5am and I never complain - it’s a weekend so crack on in my books); but during the week I think this is just rude and inconsiderate. There’s no longer a moment of peace in our flat.

I totally get that kids are a different ball game to parties, you can’t tell people to keep their kids silent. But I really feel like more could be done to at least minimise some of this noise, at the moment it sounds like these kids are allowed to constantly run absolute riot.

Would I be an asshole if I said something? Maybe a (very politely worded) note through the door? I know notes are a bit passive aggressive but I feel knocking on the door could be a bit confrontational...

My flatmate also finds this infuriating, but her view is “kids will be kids, we can’t tell them to shut their kids up, it’s asshole behaviour”. Whilst I would usually agree with this, for example I’d never complain about a crying newborn or something like that that can’t be helped, I think this is just unreasonable from the neighbours. If not the level of noise, at least the time of night it goes on to (and duration).

So, would I be a massive asshole for telling these new neighbours to rein their kids in before I actually lose my mind??!


Edit - more info:

I should have probably explained originally, but the parents are also very loud too, I certainly don’t get the impression that they’re concerned about the noise anyway. For example, today they’ve been blaring music along with the usual kid noise, and having really loud conversations and adult shouting/chatting. The main problem is definitely the kids, but basically my point is the adults are contributing too so I don’t think they care.

We don’t live in a paper thin walled apartment either, it’s really solid wall/ceiling, we’ve never experienced this level of noise before from any of our neighbours so they really are going some to be so loud!

I’m at a loss of what to do, I really don’t want to be confrontational or put their backs up and I appreciate kids are hard to control, but it’s making life miserable. 

The problem is my flatmate thinks I’m being a total asshole for even considering saying anything, so I’m at a bit of a blocker! I’m glad most people seem to think I’m not though, so I’ll show her this post...

1159,Asshole,"My gf recently had a huge blowout with her boss which led to her getting fired on the spot. They argued on and off for probably 6+ hours and from the sounds of it it was a very uncomfortable conversation where her boss did a lot of ranting and she felt that she couldn't get her point across. The argument was over a pretty minor communication issue at first, but it sounds like her boss brought up old issues and that overall it was a very unpleasant argument.

She had another job lined up before this fight took place so this wasn't going to mess up life plans or anything major. 

After she told me about this blowout, she kept saying that she was traumatized by this argument. Something about that wording really bothered me and I made a face when she said that and told her that a single uncomfortable argument is not traumatizing. She said that she really was traumatized and didn't know why I was downplaying her trauma. I moved passed it because she was still upset in general and I love her and didn't want to make her day worse, but it really bothered me that she said that this traumatized her. It just really rubbed me the wrong way, it's as if any unpleasant experience counts as trauma to her. I hesitate to say that my sister's death traumatized me, and she says that one fight is traumatizing? Came across as privileged.

1160,Not the A-hole,"So there's this guy in our friend group who asked me out on a date. Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.

It stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said ""excuse me?"". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said ""you weigh more than me"".

I didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, ""What was the point of that question?"" and he said ""I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything."" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.

In the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was ""just a question"" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about ""a damn question"". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this ""double standard""?

So I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective.

I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.

They said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that.

1165,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because all of my friends know my real account. Sorry for the formatting, I'm on mobile. If you see any mistakes feel free to correct me, English isn't my first language.

So some background, my little brother and me are actually half brothers, but neither of our fathers were ever in the picture. My mom was super young when she had us and she never actually wanted kids, so she dumped us with our grandfather and only occasionally visited.

 Now, my grandpa is an amazing man but he worked full time and never really had much time for us, so me and my brother were always super close. We always felt like it was us two against the world. 

My bro is best friends with this kid, we'll call him Ben, they've know each other for a couple of years and instantly connected. 

Now, Ben has a huge family, and I've never been able to keep track of all of them, I'd seen him around before but 5 months ago was the first time I actually had a conversation with Ben's eldest brother. We hit I off right away, he's funny, charming and we share a lot of hobbies. We started hanging out, and I'm not sure when hanging out turned into dating but we just kinda fell into it. 

A week ago he asked me to be his bf officially, I was over the moon. However, Ben found out yesterday when I came to their house and he went ballistic. He told I had turned his brother into a faggot and stuff like that (the bf is bi, but hadn't come out to his family).

My bf and I basically ran out of the house to escape him, but after twenty minutes into lunch I told him I was too uncomfortable, that he had to go back and figure things out with Ben. He agreed, we paid the check and we went our separate ways.

When I got home my bro was furious, he told me Ben had texted him about the situation and accused me of ruining their friendship. He told me I had to break up with Ben's or he'd never speak to me again. He then went into his room, slammed the door and won't speak to me no matter how much I plead, it's been about two hours.

I'm thinking about breaking up with my bf because I feel like if I don't I'll lose my little brother forever, but it also feels like a betrayal to him.

1166,Not the A-hole,"I have been with my boyfriend (30M) almost for 2 years. He has 2 children  (9 &11) from his previous marriage. He recently moved out of his apartment and lives in a camper (to save up enough money for a house) which causes him to see his kids less often, at least twice a week. I love his kids, even though I have no desire to have any of my own. I have taken them out and do crafts and interact with them when I see them. My birthday is in a few days and I turn 21. They are all coming to by birthday party this weekend and I plan on not drinking because of it. I had scheduled a dinner for me and my boyfriend  at Benihaha during the week. He and his kids have never been there. I told him about it and said he will have his kids that day and to add them so I did. I didn't see the harm in asking my boyfriend once again today if it could just be me and him because thats what I want to do for my birthday. There was no ill intent on my behalf in asking the question. He then proceeded to tell me that he feels that I don't care about his children, that I'm being inconsiderate, he feels like I'm trying to get him to abandon the kids and it's making him rethink us. He called me and asked for an apology. I honestly don't know what I'm apologizing for. I called and asked if he wanted me to apologize for asking a question or for hurting his feelings, which I know is immature on my end but I'm genuinely at a loss. Everyone I have asked so far has told me not to apologize. Am I the asshole?

Edit: I see a lot of comments saying me not wanting children makes me not care or love them as much, which isn’t true. I just wouldn’t ruin my body to have children. I love his kids and I would want to be a good stepmother like how mine was. The children love me and I see them when I see my boyfriend. He always has them when it’s his days off. I’ve been with them on every one of their birthdays and almost all of the holidays since I’ve been with their father. They do love seeing their father and I understand that they hardly have time to see each other. I’m having an all inclusive birthday this weekend so I see them for the whole day. My boyfriend works Tuesdays to Saturdays from 3:00pm-11:30pm and he saves his requested days off for the kids. I was planning to go on a Monday, which is a school night. He drops them off to their moms anyways that night and I was hoping to get 2 hours with him at most, not the whole day or even my birthday. On my birthday, I go to school and plan to work and study on my midterms. I see a lot about of comments about the age gap and frankly, I’m a consenting adult. I knew what I was getting into. I’ve heard it all before. Age gaps are common. My grandparents were in the same position as us. My grandma was 33 and had 2 kids from a previous marriage and her oldest was 7 years younger than my grandpa who was 22. They’ve been happily married for over 40 years so I don’t see a problem with my boyfriend’s age. I refuse to date guys my age because I don’t find them attractive or interesting.

1168,Asshole,"So I've had the flu the past few days, and my girlfriend has taken amazing care of me. She has put up with my whining, brought everything Ive needed to me as I have been bedridden, and overall been amazing. I told her she didnt need to, and that she would certainly get sick, but she selflessly took care of me anyway. 

So now my flu is tapering off, and she is beginning to show symptoms. She knows this, and even brought up how shes coughing like I was leading up to the main part of the illness. 

Side note: my girlfriend has sort of an issue with alcohol. Its litterally the only negative aspect about her, and I am not fully in control of my alcohol use either. But i certainly wouldnt get drunk if I knew I was coming down with the flu.

Well, last night my girlfriend texts me she went our with coworkers and its ""turning into a thing."" Code for shes getting drunk. I bluntly tell her I think its incredibly foolish to do so when your coming down with a flu. She says I'm a bummer, and the text message responses twindle as she continues partying.

Flash forward to today. She is incredibly sick. Smacked with a flu and a massive hangover, shes having an incredibly bad time. I helped her at first, but over the day Ive grown resentful. How hard is it to not drink? Shes had a hangover, shes had the flu, why in gods name would she want to combine them?

So I claimed I was called in for a shift. I'm really at the library, working on school assignments and making this post.

My girlfriend is an amazing girl, and we get a long super well. We rarely fight and have been together for ages. However, she has this one really strange habit that disturbs me. Every single time she goes to take a shit she feels the need to inform me. I'll randomly get texts like, ""holy babe I just took the biggest dump"". Great for her, but this is not information that I need or wanted to know. I'll get texts like this a couple times a week.

I told her it was moderately disturbing to hear about her bowel movements and asked her to stop. She agreed, but went right back to doing it. I asked her to stop again, and once again she said she would but never did. I think she legitimately forgets and isn't trying to disturb me. I have no idea where this weird habit comes from but I wanted it to stop.

I took things into my own hands. Whenever she started telling me about her bathroom activities, I would respond back with gross stuff along the lines of, ""that's so hot, send me a video of you doing it"". Now I don't actually want a video or find that remotely attractive, but I figured if I started disturbing her right back she would stop.

Last week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. 

I diplomatically said that ""well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you"" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. 

The father replied ""not really"" and looked away. 

I said ""well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry."" and ushered them to the door.

Since then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep.

1171,Not the A-hole,"Obviously, by the phrasing and lack of background the answer seems clear so let me clarify. My mother ever since I was a young child has constantly moved my items into hidden locations in the house, forgets she puts them there, and then gets mad when I accuse her of losing my items and/or when I get angry for her moving them. She says she likes to keep a tidy house and everything should have a location. I understand this in theory, but seriously how irritating was my laptop on the kitchen island that you had to put it in the nightstand of my brother’s (he hasn’t lived at home in years) bedroom. 

So after so many years of this, especially my big ticket items being moved right before I return to university I decided to do the same thing to her so she can understand how annoying it is. So I took her iPad and I put it in the electronics cubby under our basement tv, essentially no one ever looks there. At first, I intentionally didn’t tell anyone where it was, but after a few days I genuinely forgot. She comes looking for it about a week later (her work vacation) and can’t find it on her designated place of on the coffee table. She immediately is upset thinking someone stole it. She searches frantically around the house. When she finds it and asks who put this there I of course say me. She immediately starts crying asking why I would want to intentionally do this to her in revenge  for something she feels every mother does. She says that I just don’t understand parenthood or that this is her house and my items are in her way. 

So now I feel kinda bad, but I genuinely think she’s in the wrong for always moving my stuff and NEVER telling me where she put them. I understand it’s her house, but it shouldn’t be that hard to not touch someone else’s personal items if they are not directly in your way. My dad refuses to weigh in. My mom says she’s thoroughly disappointed in how I can ‘demonize’ “loving motherhood”.

1) Water polo is really fun 

2) I need to practice swimming in the off-season, and a water polo is a novel, more fun way of doing it than just swimming laps.

1175,Not the A-hole,"For context, I work at a fast food place that closes at 10 pm. We typically have 4 closers. 

We have one manager who is specifically known for being a hardass and kind of an asshole. There’s also a very reasonable suspicion of homophobia considering how he treats some of our gay employees. The other night, we were already understaffed. A couple people agreed to stay later so we had the bare minimum amount of closers. I was scheduled until 9, an hour before we close. At about 8:45, One of our gay employees, with whom this manager has found unreasonable excuses to get mad at him before, was taking an order, and the customer’s card got declined. The employee says he’s fine and just lets the customer get his food, and said he’d pay for it later. The manager gets wind of this 5 minutes later and sends him home because in the managers eyes he basically let the customer get away with theft, despite the employee offering to pay for it once he went and got his wallet from the back. 

So, we’re down to three closers with 10 minutes before I leave, and this manager says “so you’re staying and closing.” (Edit: He said this with an asking tone. He wasn’t actually demanding I stay.) I had homework to do, and I was genuinely pissed at him. I told him “no, I’m not closing. I’m scheduled until 9.” One of the other employees got upset with me for not staying.  My rational was 1: I was scheduled until 9, and I’d have to stay an hour and a half later. There were a few people scheduled until 10 but not close who would only have to stay for half an hour later, 2: I had shit to do that night. I’m still in high school and have a lot of homework and 3: It’s not my fault there weren’t enough closers. It’s not as if people called in sick. The manager willingly understaffed us. It was his fault. Would it have been nice for me to stay, yes, but I was under absolutely no obligation.

I took my kids on the plane and got them settled.

1188,Not the A-hole,"This happened yesterday. I went skiing with a couple friends and eventually split up for about a half hour so they could grab something to eat. As I was getting on a lift, the guy in the seat in front of me lit a cigarette. He kept puffing on it over and over again until he looked like a fucking chimney and wouldn’t stop. All his second-hand smoke was going straight back into my face and I was starting to get annoyed. I tried pulling my mask over my nose and mouth but that didn’t help at all. Eventually, about halfway up, I asked him “hey man could you put that out until we get to the top? It’s blowing right back into my face.” He turned around, told me to “deal with it” and kept smoking away. The lift is about 10 minutes and even though that’s not much, it was enough to push me to the brink. Once we got to the top, I asked him again to be more courteous to those around him when he’s smoking. He replied “man shut the fuck up” and gave me the finger. I said “if you’re that hooked on cigs that you can’t cut it out for ten damn minutes, maybe you should seek help” and slid away. He swore at me a couple more times as I was heading down towards one of the hills and said I’m a cunt for “giving someone shit for an addiction”

1189,Not the A-hole,"Shortly after boarding for a 2 1/2 hour flight home, I was approached by a steward who asked me if would mind swapping seats with another passenger.

I asked where his seat was, and he told me that it was about 8 rows back and a middle seat.

I told him that I'd prefer not to, since I was in an aisle seat and had paid extra (not much, about $20) for the ""economy plus"" section that gave me additional leg room.

The steward said that is why he wanted to swap seats, the other passenger was taller than I.

I mentioned that regardless, I had paid for the extra leg room and booked early to get the aisle seat.

He responded that he'd give me some free drinks to make up for it to which I replied, no thank you, buy I don't drink.  

He continues to push me on it saying how uncomfortable the other passenger would be.  Finally the pressure, and frankly the slight embarrassment of this continued conversation / confrontation got the best of me and I gave in.

I was pretty steamed the whole ride, and when I got home I called the airline and complained about the situation and about the steward, by name.

In retrospect I feel a bit bad.  What I should have done was just said stood my ground and stuck with the ""no"" or just been gracious and swapped with the other guy.  (He was about 6'6"" and I'm a bit under 6'.)

My girlfriend and I had been together for 2 years. We both recently graduated from universities and were going to move in together. Neither of us were ready for a child quite yet. However, despite using many forms of contraception, my ex got pregnant.

Though I did not want a child yet, I was in a place where I could financially support a child and give them a good life. I told my girlfriend that I wanted her to keep the baby. She told me she didn't. I told her that aborting a child goes against everything I stand for, and that if she went through with this I  wouldn't be able to stay with her. I understand that in the end, I can't stop her or force her to have the child, so I didn't try. I told her how I felt about it, and she told me she was going to abort it anyways.

So she did. I broke up with her, and she was devastated. She said she didn't think I was serious and that she should mean more to me than an unborn child.

1194,No A-holes here,"The family drama is long and complicated so I'll try to summarize. I'm the youngest of 4 girls in my family, we're all in our late 20s/early 30s now. My two middle sisters, K and S, have always been very toxic and downright mean which came to a spearhead at Christmas 2017. We all used to go to our parents house and that year it ended with a screaming match between me and K. I left Christmas morning on the 10 hours drive home and haven't  spoken to K or S since (fwiw I made separate plans to spend time my my parents without siblings).

I'm certain of my choice to cut K & S out of my life because they're honestly terrible and manipulative people. They even make our mom cry from bullying her too. My question is about how I reacted with my oldest sister, B.

B and I are 6 years apart and were not very close until I was an adult, so still in the last 5-6 years really. Prior to Christmas 2017 I had tried to talk with B about my issues with K & S, and how they make me feel like utter shit, but every time I tried to bring it up B shut it down. She'd outright tell me ""I'm not having this conversation."" I respect that she has a different relationship with our sisters and I understand why she doesn't want my issues with K & S to taint her relationship with them. I'm okay with that, but it means that B has never heard my side of why I can't be around K & S and presumably she's given them the same stonewall on the issue. I respect that she doesn't want to choose sides so I don't push the issue.

After the Christmas 2017 fiasco, B was upset with me and while I was packing up my stuff she accused ""So you're not even going to try?"". I literally said nothing back to her, I knew I was too upset to say anything I wouldn't regret.

I was angered and hurt by her accusation, particularly because every time I tried to confide in her about my problems with our sisters she would shut that down and not hear a word. So it never occurred to me to explain to her my decision to leave and I was more thrown aback that she'd be upset with me for it. I own up that I was acting selfish by leaving but I stand by my decision for the sake of my mental health (which is another point of contention with K & S).

All that said, when I cut out K & S, I also cut out B. At the time, I was not in a good place to deal with any family. But I haven't reached out the B in the year & change since. And honestly, I've never been happier than in the time since I've cut ALL my sisters out of my life.

So WIBTA if I continued to cut B out of my life? I definitely think it's selfish but would it make me an asshole to continue cutting B out of my life since she never did anything directly wrong? ",27,34,0.97

1201,Not the A-hole,"Before I begin, I shall use an **example name** as follows: **Brian Alex Sherman Felix Smith.**

DISCLAIMER: ONCE AGAIN, THIS **ISN'T** MY REAL NAME.

Simply put, I simply hated my name for four reasons.

(1) My parents had always called me Felix, which as you noticed would be the fourth word of my name. So is my *given* name Felix (as they call me) or Brian (as per the order)? Which parent names their child only to not use their actual first name? IMO my parents are complete assholes for doing this. No other kid from school or the block has parents like this, except for most of my Muslim friends, whose name starts with Mohammed/Muhammad/Mohamed and their first name would be whatever is after that word e.g. Mohamed Salah would be addressed to as Salah.

(2) My full name does not split evenly. I have five words in my name (as per the example). It's a headache filling out official forms. What do I put when forms ask me for my first/given and middle names? How do I even split it? Brian Alex // Sherman Felix? Brian // Alex Sherman Felix? Or Felix (as per 1) then Brian Alex Sherman? See? If I dropped two words from my four-word clusterfuck of a name I would be able to have a lesser headache filling out forms.

(3) It's \[My actual name is\] too damn long. Too many letters. I have had so many comments from then till now. It's not bullying, don't worry, but it's just that I prefer short and sweet names.

(4) Having to correct people *every single time* my name is read out. Every *Brian* I heard was corrected to *Felix.* I hated doing that. I want things to be smooth.

I had a family friend whose daughter went ahead with the name change to drop her old identity and the (estranged) reluctant mom disapproved of this action. Daughter initially aimed to drop her entire old name but eventually and reluctantly gave in to her mother's demand to retain the first word of her old name.

I was always told, especially by parents and elders, that every person's name has a special/religious meaning, and in a sense every name given is a religious blessing. All five words in my real name (and the daughter's old name) carry religious meanings. Therefore, a name change in their eyes is a stab in the family's back and ""losing one's spirituality/religiosity"", which are no-nos in my community.

It would be nice to drop my entire identity in favor of a new one. The middle ground (which is most feasible as it is a possible compromise but I doubt family would be okay with) is dropping two words from my real name to create a nice first-middle-last. But those two words to be dropped carry religious meanings. It's a real headache - on the surface it can be done by informing government and educational authorities and paying a fee, but deep down it's like killing a man.

1202,Not the A-hole,"Six months ago I moved 11 hours away from my hometown. My best friend who still lives there has been planning to visit me for a few months, but always rescheduled the dates. I eventually offered to help pay for a ticket for whenever she could come, and she said okay. We kept trying to plan but something always came up with her so I gave it a rest.

Finally she settled on dates in Feb to visit with her s/o. They were going to drive. We'd gotten further with this plan than ever before so I also took off work, planned the itinerary, and spent about $200 on groceries the day before their arrival. Everything was in order for weeks... **until the day before**.

Her s/o plows snow in the winter for his job but didn't request the days off work. He just gambled it wouldn't snow while he was away. So the day before they were supposed to arrive, she told me that his weather app said it **may** snow during their stay here, meaning that her s/o would have to work, and they couldn't come.

My weather app said no snow, so I remained optimistic. I suggested they get up early as planned, check the weather, and let me know if they’re coming. She agreed.

The day of, I woke up with no messages. I texted and asked what was going on. She answered 1 hour later saying that they just woke up. She said she woke up early as planned, but her s/o did not. I asked why she didn't text me or wake up her s/o. I **did not** get a response to these questions. Another hour later, she told me that his weather app said it would snow. They officially canceled. At this point, I was upset that:

1. Her s/o did not request off work
2. She waited late into the day they were supposed to arrive to tell me they weren't coming
3. I've been trying to help her plan a trip here for months

I told her this was not planned well. She defended her s/o entirely. I asked why she didn't text me that morning as planned. She did not answer. We went back and forth for a little while, just upset, and then she stopped responding for 3 weeks.

3 weeks later--a few days ago--she texted me for the first time:

>""I love you but you got too upset over a canceled trip. (Her s/o) doesn't plan his work schedule around when we feel like going on trips. You were inconsiderate about my side and I was upset too. But I just want to get over this and be friends again.""

>""Firstly, you haven't talked to me in 3 weeks. Secondly, he offered to drive you guys down here. I did not ask him to work around 'our trips.'

I feel like you knew you weren't coming but entertained me into the next day. I can't believe you don't get why I'm upset. I don't know how I feel about being friends right now.""

1203,Not the A-hole,"When my wife and I started dating, she had a rescue dog, to which she was quite attached.  She got the dog during a traumatic period in her life, and the dog was also abused, so they formed a strong trauma-based attachment. The dog was abused by males and reacted aggressively towards all males. I'm a dog lover, and empathized, so I set about trying to form a healthy attachment with the dog.

My presence in the relationship had a lot of positive impact on the dog's behavior, as we spent way more time outside, got more exercise, and generally lived a lifestyle that made the dog happier and improved a lot of behavioral problems. He eventually came to trust many males, became far less aggressive, etc.

His outlook towards me, however, has never improved. Based on my limited knowledge, because I compete with him for my wife's attention, and he sees her as a resource to be guarded, I've remained Enemy #1 in his eyes. He barks at me constantly, growls any time I go near my wife, and acts as though I'm going to slaughter him any time he and I are alone together. We have tried implementing strategies we could find online, like my wife reducing her attention and affection towards him while I took on the main caregiver role. This helped temporarily but any sign of attention from her would put us right back at square 1.

We've discussed finding a new home for the dog, and I've never pushed for it. I empathize with the bond they formed, and I see the value he's had to her. I didn't want to, well, be the asshole, and just couldn't feel right about demanding that she get rid of him. He's also getting quite old, and the thought of ""I can wait this out until he passes on"" gave me some hope.

At this point I'm not sure how much longer I can take it, and it's starting to impact my relationship with my wife. For example, we have a shock collar that we try to use during times when the dog will definitely bark at me. Of course I don't want him to have to wear the collar all the time as it's uncomfortable and I don't feel great about shocking a dog to begin with, but I've become more angry at my wife for not putting the collar on, because the dog barks at me in so many different situations and it's inevitable that she'll take the collar off, only to have him go nuts when I walk back inside from checking the mail.

I'm at my wits end, I'm angry at the dog for being a little shit, at my wife for keeping him around for so long, and at myself for not putting my foot down and protecting my sanity and relationship with my wife sooner.

Even if my imagination’s worst case scenario were to play out, it’s nothing I’d be able to control anyway... but I’m sure it will be fine. Something I do want to mention is that people are pretty quick to jump to labeling me a misogynist or homophobe. I’m not either of these things, but I’m sorry if I come across as such.

Background:

We have been dating for 2 years now (I’m 23, she’s 20). One of her best friends is a gay guy and he invited my gf to go to his fraternity formal which is 2 nights in a hotel room in a big city. Their room situation would be her and him in one bed and two other gay guys in the other bed. I asked that she either get her own hotel room or if that’s too much trouble to at least stay with her friend in a room with 2 beds so she can sleep in her own bed. 

I feel like that’s not a lot to ask considering she’s basically going on a weekend date with another guy. However she acts like it’s too much trouble and she may not go because I’m asking too much. I don’t want to be the bad guy, but I also don’t feel comfortable with my girlfriend getting drunk and sleeping in the same bed with another guy. I know alcohol can lead to mistakes. I don’t know why he wouldn’t have taken a guy to his formal. Maybe he is bi, idk. Gay or not, I think it’s disrespectful. 

I’ve been cheated on before and she knows it so I wish she would be more understanding.

We got to my house at about 12:30 fooled around for a little bit and then I went to bed  sometime around 1:15. I was drunk and tired and I had also worked that day I wanted to go to sleep and he wanted to play Apex with his friend on my PS4, fine by me! I let him play my PS4 whenever he wants to. Since Apex came out, he plays a lot. Every time he is at my house which is  very often  he plays at least 4 to 6 hours worth of Apex. Almost every night that he stays at my house he's up till at least 2am but usually three or four. I can't stay up that late. So anyway I'm asleep and he's in the room right next to me maybe 7 feet away talking in a normal conversation tone with his buddy online. the room next to me doesn't have a full wall dividing it so I can hear him as if he's in the same room next to me.

I'm half drunk and half hungover, I have a headache and in general I don't feel that great. He's having a great time laughing and being very animated with his friend. I asked him if he knows that it's 5 a.m.( he later tells me that he did know) and I tell him that he should come to bed. He can't answer me because his friend is on the other side of the mic so I go back into my bed. He tells his friend to hang on and he comes over to me and I reiterate what I said once again. He agrees and then goes and turns off the PS4 without even saying goodbye to his friend. This is when I felt like I had done something wrong. I wanted him to come to bed but I wasn't requesting he get off the PS4 immediately. I usually snuggle him in bed but I just felt in general shitty and we both just fell asleep after that. I got the feeling that he was disappointed and I hated the feeling of being like his mom. He's still sleeping and he probably will be until about one or two p.m.

I fell asleep early in the flight and about halfway through, I groggily reclined my seat a bit in attempt to get more comfortable and the person behind me proceeded to push my chair over and over while the lady next to him encouraged him to keep doing so because apparently his legs are too long. At the end of the flight, I confronted them about it and said they could have asked me nicely to put my chair up. The guy tried to excuse himself by saying he was just trying to get comfortable. After I already turned around and sat back down, his travel companion tapped my shoulder to tell me that I was the rude one for not asking before reclining my seat because the guy is six feet tall. (How would I have known that?) I tried to say that it was still rude of them to push my chair like that, and after some back and forth, she finally settled on her judgement that ""we were both in the wrong."" I still feel wrongly accused since I have never heard of asking for permission to recline a seat. However, I guess that would be a polite thing to do, so does it make me an asshole for not asking?

Edit: forgot to mention that he pushed my chair so much it righted itself within a few minutes. I didn't bother reclining the seat again after that.

Edit 2: I am quite surprised at all the responses this post is getting. I had no clue that people could feel so strongly about the simple reclining of a chair. 

I would like to say that one particular reason I was so bothered by what transpired was because my original thoughts while pushing my chair back was to try not to disturb the person behind me too much, which is why I only reclined the seat a tad and not to it's fullest extent. I didn't do it forcefully either, and of course I would not have tried pushing hard if there was any tension coming from the man's knees right behind my back. If he had just told me that my reclining restricted him too much, I would have gladly moved my chair back.

I guess I just usually assume that if someone would be so inconvenienced by losing a centimeter or so of leg room, they would be sitting somewhere else that granted them that extra space. However, I can see now that it's an incorrect assumption, as people may not always have access to roomier seats or they were not aware the seats would be so cramped. So whether or not the internet decides to rule me as an asshole, I guess my takeaway from this is that it wouldn't hurt for me to ask or even just glance behind to see if I would potentially be hurting someone by moving my chair back. I believe it was an innocent mistake on my part, since I have never encountered any issues with this before and personally never considered it to be a problem, but now I see both sides.

That being said, airlines are the real assholes.",153,111,0.91

1216,Not the A-hole,"Long time lurker, first time poster.

This post has been in preparation for a long time. I started to read this subreddit as a getaway since probably last october. 

&#x200B;

I (22) was together with this girl, 23, for roughly 7 months, when our birth control failed. Well, I call it birth control, but she really is alternative and didnt want to take hormones in any way and since she was my first girlfriend and I was a complete doofus, I didnt use condoms. We used a diaphragm with a spermkilling gel. Anyway.

It failed and she got pregnant, which she did not notice until roughly the fourth month. There were a lot of unhappy circumstances coming together for this, I can explain if you need to know. When we found out I just started an internship away from my hometown, which would have been for 5 months. We were shocked, but decided that adoption was out of question, since both our families supported us 100%.

During the next months we prepared and had some rough patches, but in August last year something big happened. She always had, very irregularily, seizures. This time however, i think we are at the 7,5 month threshold, she had 5 in less than 3 hours. And I could not stand it any longer, calling the ambulance, even though she explecitly told me that i should never do that, but I was scared not only for her, but also for our child.

After she got to the hospital and needed more than one day to even form a normal sentence, she asked if I would do it again. I said yes, and would not even wait that long again, but would do it directly after the second one. Mind you, she did not have any emergency medication or anything, so I could not do shit on my own. She then said that SHE then has to look for another solution for the future, implying that I should never do that, when I was only ever scared for her and our baby.

Fast forward and I am miserable. I wake up and just let the days blend into each other, apatheticly. We then ended it near the end of August, when I told her, that I cannot just always give and give her, but never receive anything back. But I will be there for our child, I will care for here and pay child support as well as try to be a good father. For this it is important that we still have some contact that is not completely toxic. She took all this and decided not to talk with me any further and leave. I called my dad and he drove her to the train, where she told me, that she does not want any contact until we meet one week later, we had an appointment for our child. Then she left and blocked me on all social media.

&#x200B;

Also important, during the date of birth, I would be away for two weeks. She first was supportive for me, this changed to ""its your decision"" and then to ""I dont want you to go"". I still decided to do it, even my dad supported me in that. To this day I dont regret this decision.

Now here comes the tricky part. Was I the asshole when I broke up?

&#x200B;

Give me your judgement. I'm ready.

Edit:
The birth is in the past, in autumn last year. Just to clarify.",192,213,0.91
1217,Not the A-hole,"I'm an 18 year old guy still in high school, just started working at a deli up the block from my house part-time a little over two years ago. My family is poorish/lower middle class so it was nice to have spending money, being finally able to buy and save for things like a car, game consoles, PC, etc. Anyway, around February of last year, I come home to find my Dad in my room, cutting the wall between it and my parents room. When I ask what was going on, he explained that he was redoing the house and was turning my room into a closet and small bedroom for my parents room. He explained that he was going to start turning half of the basement downstairs into a new room for me, which would be bigger and afford me more privacy since I'm going to college and not dorming. Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but he completely disregarded and disrespected my belongings. He laid all his tools down on top of my game consoles that I saved and bought with my own money, and are now scuffed with paint marks and scratches. My posters were thrown out, and my other belongings were covered in saw dust. When I get mad at him over this, his snaps and goes ""They still work, that's all that matters!""  For the record, my Dad is a very outdoorsy guy, and a self employed carpenter. He doesn't really own many possessions; he has a stereo in the garage that he'll listen to when working on his truck, but he doesn't really take care of it (""As long as it works!"").

I got over it because I assumed I would be getting a newer room out of this, but it's been over a year and he hasn't started work on it at all. I'm being forced to sleep on the living room couch and keep my clothing  in a laundry bag.  The other day I get home from a friend's house, of whom happens to be much wealthier than I am. His room is filled with collectibles, PC hardware, games, a TV, etc. I was super jealous, and I get fed up and ask my Dad when he's going to start actually doing work on my room. He gets annoyed and states ""When we have the money, I promise you that we'll start working on your room!"" , to which I respond that it's been over a year and literally NOTHING has been done. He then snaps and says that I'm being entitled, and how he moved out at 15, lived with friends until he was 18, and lived in a van until he met my mom at 20.

I'm mad primarily because: a) He didn't tell me he was doing this to the house and completely trashed my belongings    b) Doesn't have the money to actually finish the renovations.

Am I being the asshole for being agitated over this?",71,128,0.97

1219,Asshole,"For some context to start with, we have been together about 2 years and I very much love her. We built a very solid friendship but I pushed for something more and eventually we made the jump. We are quite different people, but we get on brilliantly and I could see me having a life with her.

So recently I was chatting to a close friend of mine over some beers. Not enough to be drunk, but we were both speaking quite candidly. He says he has been struggling to find a relationship because none of the girls he gets along with are ""his type"" physically. I responded basically saying maybe he should try dating someone like that anyway because if he did gel really well he could get past that. I could see he wasn't really taking me seriously so I said ""Seriously, I don't think /redactedGFname/ is massively attractive and certainly isn't my type"". Now he was listening I explaind that I though from an objective stance she looks a bit above average as women go, but nothing ground breaking, and that my type would be thiccer with decent breasts whereas she is pencil thin and flat as paper. But, crucially, I care massively for her and there is nobody I would rather be looking at. There are all these little things about her that make me love her. He seemed to take it onboard so we moved on and continued with the night.

Fast forward to 2 nights ago and he was at a party with my GF I couldn't go to because of workload. I didn't get to see her till late the following day. She said the party was fun, but was quite cold with me all evening so I asked of something happened at the party, and it turns out while drunk my mate had told her about our conversation and made it sound like I though she was unattractive. Now, I strongly believe in being honest in all instances, and I also didn't think there was anything wrong with voicing these opinions, and so I tried explaining to her the actual full opinion, but clearly she didn't agree with me there, saying things like ""how can you truly love someone if you don't find them attractive"" which is not what I had said at all. She also said this wasn't something that should be said, especially not to other people and that it'd a show of disrespect to her, which I would concede if it wasn't a close friend I was trying to give advice to. She left after arguing with me for a while and has been barely talking to me since. I apologies for offending her, but won't apologise for the sentiment. Love is complicated. AITA?",889,1827,0.9
1220,No A-holes here,"AITA: My husband and I recently decided to move to Texas as it seems to be a good decision for our family, we have two kids. The problem is my mom, who is in her mid sixties, keeps trying to convince us its a bad idea but mostly because she just doesn't want us to move. 

Pros of moving: sell our house for a decent profit, cost of living is cheaper in Texas, we can buy land in Texas and build a home, no income tax (yes I know property taxes are higher but land/house value will be about $100k less then the home we have now), my husband is from Texas so there is family and friends, I can keep my job and it would be a good career move, we will be able to save for retirement and rainy days

Cons of moving to Texas: we have to leave Colorado and my mom says we are leaving her alone and she is very upset

Other thoughts: it is so expensive to live in Colorado and getting more expensive, even though I recently got a raise I'm not sure we could ever move out of our starter home to another home in Colorado as prices are rising quickly, I asked my mom to move to Texas when she retires (which will be soon) and she refuses

I feel bad but I think this is the best decision for our family as we will be able to save for rainy days but also retirement, right now we are really not able to do that. I'm trying to do the right thing for our family and she thinks I'm being selfish. 

Love to hear y'all's thoughts. Thank you!

1221,Not the A-hole,"This happened a few weeks ago.

I'd just made a withdrawal at a shopping centre ATM and was about to walk away when a man standing nearby asked if I could spare any money as he had not eaten since the previous day. He did seem to be rather down on his luck, but seeing as how I only withdrew $20 and had no coins in my wallet I told him I didn't have any spare change. As I was walking away he calls out to me ""buy me something?""

I didn't think much of it at first, but then it struck me that a guy who asks a stranger to buy him a meal is likely genuinely hungry. Glancing back I could see he wasn't at the ATM any longer, but I figured he was probably going to be somewhere in the general vicinity.

As it was almost closing time for the food court, several of the eateries were beginning to box up the day's leftovers and offering them for a discount. I happened by a kebab shop and grabbed a couple of chicken skewers and a slice of pizza in a takeaway container - it came to just under $10 for the lot. It didn't take long before I found the guy walking around, so I approached him and offered him the food. The conversation went like this:

Me: Here you go.
Him: What's this?
Me: Chicken skewers and some pizza.
Him: Oh.

*He glances at the container*

Him: I don't eat chicken.
Me: Well I do.

With that I abruptly about turned and started walking away. I heard him call out ""Nah, wait"" as I was walking away, but I didn't acknowledge him and kept walking.

Some points to take into consideration:

*The $20 I withdrew was supposed to cover my meals for the next two and a half days. Money that was supposed to get me enough baked beans, bread, eggs, and vegetables for at least four meals was instead used on greasy takeaway food that would only get me through that night. Hence my abrupt response when he told me he didn't eat chicken.

*In retrospect I suppose I could have sought out the man first and asked if he had any food preferences/dietary restrictions. While I hate choosing beggars as much as the next person, I acknowledge the fact that just because you're hard up doesn't mean you should get absolutely no say in what you eat.

*After some thought, it is also likely he wasn't in full control of his faculties when he said what he did. Maybe I should have given him the benefit of the doubt.",30,33,0.88
1222,Not the A-hole,"This girl and I have been in a serious relationship for a couple of months now. We’ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. 

When we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn’t feel an investment from Guy B’s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn’t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren’t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. 

A few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn’t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn’t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that’s what she said to me). 

I can’t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She’s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she’s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she’s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. 

Now I told her that I’d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I’m a guy big on fidelity, I’ve said to her in the past that I’d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I’m thinking of ending things with her. 

AITA here when I wasn’t the one she cheated on?",232,404,0.96
1223,Everyone Sucks,"For about a year and a half, I had feelings for my friend from uni. We hung out a lot and did a lot of “couple things”, such as cuddle and hold hands and stuff, but never anything more. Anytime I would ask her out, she would decline and say she wasn’t looking for a relationship right now. Totally understandable.

A month and a half ago, I met another girl and immediately fell for her. We started a relationship. During this time, me and my friend stopped talking as much. We would still run into each other at school and say hey and occasionally text but nothing like before. 

About a week ago she waited for me at my car and confronted me, asking me why I was avoiding her and not treating her how I used to. I told her the truth, that I was in a relationship now. She said something like “I thought you liked me?” And I told her that I did, but she never seemed interested so I backed off and moved on. She seemed to accept it and that was that, but then she texted me later in the day that she liked me a lot and that she didn’t expect me to just give up on her, etc. She said I should at least give us a chance before being with someone else.

The other day, she texted me and invited me to go out with her and some friends, and when she told me who was going, it sounded like it was like a triple date kind of thing, with us being the third couple. Not wanting to be paired off with the girl who rejected me for a year and a half and only suddenly showed interest in me when I’m no longer available, I asked my girlfriend if she wanted to go out with me and some friends, she said sure, so I texted back my friend that I’d be there. 

Last night was the outing and I showed up with my girlfriend. My friend was left being the odd man out and spent the entire night being clearly upset. She spent the night being pissy while looking at her phone. She texted me in the middle of dinner “I didn’t think you’d bring her. I invited you, not her”, but I didn’t care. It was shitty of her to try to force us into a date-like situation when she knows I’m taken now. 

When we were in the car to leave, my girlfriend called the situation before I could even say anything, and said I was an asshole for dragging her into it. She said I should’ve just declined the invite and that she felt bad for my friend because I embarrassed her in front of her friends. I didn’t think she’d side with a girl who was actively trying to make me leave her but she did. 

I really liked my friend. For a year and a half and she never seemed interested in me the way I was in her, which is fine. But now that I have someone else, she suddenly has feelings and wants me. It’s super shitty on her part. But now she’s mad, and my girlfriend’s mad, and yeah, it would’ve been more mature just to not go, but I don’t think what I did was that bad. What my friend is/was doing is much worse.

1224,Not the A-hole,"For my and my twin sister’s 30th birthday, I made plans with her boyfriend to fly in and surprise her, since I live in a different country and we haven’t spent our birthday together in years. She will be THRILLED, knowing her. I told my parents when I booked the ticket, and they asked if they could come along too, and we could all spend our 30th together - great! I love my family, I don’t get to see them enough, and I was super happy we’d all get to be together. 

I did say I thought they should tell her they were coming, because I thought it would be more special for me to show up as a surprise, but they also wanted to be a part of the reveal. I said okay, and we could make that decision later.

It’s getting closer to the date, so my sister’s boyfriend and I have been making more specific plans. I called my parents to fill them in, and they dropped on me that my aunt wanted to come too...and that she’s already bought her plane ticket. At this point, it was starting to feel like it wasn’t my trip or my surprise anymore, like my parents have co-opted it, so I asked them to tell my sister that they and my aunt were coming, and my arrival would still be a surprise.

My mother is pushing back in the group planning message thread, saying she “has some concerns” about doing that, since sister’s boyfriend has already told her to take the Friday and Monday off work for something he’s planning, and that my sister is going to get suspicious. 

I sent them a message this morning to say that I was disappointed with how it was panning out. Firstly because my big gift was flying in as a surprise, and it feels less special if everyone is doing it, and secondly because it now feels like it’s her special surprise birthday weekend and everyone is making a big deal about surprising her for it ...but it’s also my birthday too! 

Also (my parents don’t know this), my sister’s boyfriend asked me a long time ago, when I first started arranging my travel plans and it was meant to be just me there, if I minded him proposing to my sister that weekend. He’s wonderful, and I couldn’t be happier for them, so I said yes, of course! But now it feels like everything else is going to overshadow my weekend with my sister. Also, I’m now a little worried that she’ll think her boyfriend arranged for everyone to be there for the proposal and not that it was my surprise that I arranged for her.

1225,Not the A-hole,"My friends and I have a bar we always go to. Since the beginning I’ve always told which ever bartender who was there to charge my bill separately from my group. The reason I said that is because I’m the only one in the group that tips. Now, the reason I do that is because no one else wants to tip…they leave all the tip up to me. 

It’s a spot that my friends and I always frequent. My bill usually comes out to $10 and I always give $35 (so they can get a $25 tip) the people I’m with, as I said, depend on me to leave the tip which I always do even though they don’t contribute to the tip. They get upset because my bill comes out lower but I’ve always said “chip in on tip for them” or “leave them something on your behalf”. 

My friends never listened, so when we go to the bar no matter how many drinks I get they charge me a certain amount (usually $10.00) . For my friends they charge them everything fully. 

My friends asked me to speak to the bartender about it and the bartender said to me “I look out for people that look out for me”. 

I said ‘cool, no problem brother’.  That to me indicates that I gave him enough tip for him to not worry about me. But my people did not tip him. And then when they got their bill in full and they started bitching at me for it. 

So reddit am I the asshole for anything that went down? The most I asked from the group was a dollar a piece so we can tip him as a group and I’ll tip the rest. 

One of my friends even said to me one time “ this is my money. You’re not going to tell me to tip someone if I don’t want to because it’s my money”

1229,Asshole,"So this woman is my boyfriend’s brothers wife. We’ve hung out somewhat, I don’t really know if I’d call her a friend but I had her added on Facebook. 

My boyfriend messaged me the other day telling me that her hamster died and that she was an absolute wreck. I saw several posts on her Facebook mourning the loss of her hamster. I was out of town visiting some friends and family at the time. 

She messages me on Facebook asking me to share a gofundme for her vet bills. It was so fucking cringy and emoji filled I could barely stand to read it. It was the biggest sob story and all over some hamster she had for like a few months, and attached to the post was some poem about dead pets she found on google titled ‘the rainbow bridge.’

I just thought it was really cringy to beg for money over the loss of a hamster and act that distraught on social media. At this point, since the hamster was dead, it was solely to benefit her. I probably would have shared it if the hamster was sick or something but it just really rubbed me the wrong way.

It was fairly late at night and I was walking back to my room. It gets pretty deserted around here real fast after dark, so there was barely anyone around. I had headphones on and was pretty much just daydreaming about my bed, so I don't notice her at all until she started waving her hand, not quite in my face but a short distance away.

I'm a bit confused, so I take off my headphones and ask, ""Hey, can I help you?""

Lady: ""I'm sorry, I don't feel comfortable walking alone with you around. Could you please cross the road and walk on the other side?""

I totally understand her being concerned about her safety, but I was tired, hungry and  had a frustrating day, and I guess it just rubbed me the wrong way.

I'd be delighted to walk far, far in front of you, though, so you can keep me in your sight. In fact, let me get started on that.""

I started storming off, and from behind me she calls out to me to wait. I flipped her off and put my headphones back on so I couldn't hear her anymore.

1233,Not the A-hole,"So I was recently having lunch with a friend and we had decided to try a restaurant that neither of us had been to.  We had reserved a table but when we arrived, the waitress took us to a 4 person table. I told her that we only had made a reservation for 2 people, she said that this was the only table that they had available for us. 

The table was a small rectangular table, with 2 chairs on each of the longer sides, with one of the shorter sides against a wall. We sat facing one another, leaving an empty chair next to us on either side. 

Anyway, about half way into our meal, the waitress comes up to us with 2 other people behind her and asks us if we wouldn’t mind sharing our table with these 2 other people. 

At first I was a bit taken aback, and really felt obliged to say ‘yes’ because she was standing there with these 2 other customers. But my thinking was that we had made a reservation, we hadn’t been told that this table would require us to share, we were already into our meals and no effort was made to discreetly inform us of this request or explain the situation. So I said (as politely as possible) that we were in the middle of our meal and would prefer not to share the table. I know this was taking a stand, but my view was that she had made no effort to be fair to us in this situation so why should I bend over backwards and ruin our meal by sharing a small 4 person table with 2 other strangers.

The waitress looked at me as if I had been incredibly rude and then proceeded to apologise to the other 2 people right in front of me saying something like: ‘I’m so sorry but unfortunately they are unwilling to share their table we will have to find another place for you. I’m so sorry for the inconvenience’  (this was despite the fact that they had clearly heard me and were a little uncomfortable with the situation themselves). 

After this whole debacle, we were treated quite poorly by the waitress (she didn’t top up the water, took a long time getting the cheque etc).

Afterwards my friend told me that I should have just agreed to share the table and shouldn’t have been so un-accommodating. But the way I see it, we should not have been put in this position by the waitress. If they had a policy of sharing tables (regardless of whether or not someone has made a reservation), then we should have been warned before we sat down.

Am I the asshole for pushing back on the waitress’ request and refusing to share our table?

TLDR
We had a reservation for 2 people at a restaurant, but were sat at a small 4 person table when we arrived. Half way through our meal, a waitress interrupted our meal (with 2 other customers)  and asked us if we could share our table - without any explanation as to why we were being asked. I politely said that we were half way through our meal and would prefer not to share. This was not taken well by the waitress and we were treated rather coldly after this encounter.

1235,Not the A-hole,"So I called an Uber pool to take me to a bar this evening and it said “you are sharing a ride with Andrew”. When I entered the car, I saw that the co-rider was a very young girl (about 5, probably not named Andrew). I went through the ride in silence wondering what the hell to do (if anything) until the driver dropped her off (I noted the address of her drop-off for later). I asked the driver to wait while she went inside, and she opened the screen door of the house and knocked on the door and someone let her in. I asked the driver if it was normal to pick up children and he said no this was his second time picking up a kid. I got dropped off at the bar, called Uber’s emergency and safety line and told someone what happened, then I called the city’s non-911 line and told them what happened. I got an email from Uber a short while later and they said it was against their policy for a driver to pick up a child without an adult and this could lead to the driver’s termination. I am afraid I overreacted but think this was ultimately the right thing to do because I do not believe a very young child should be in an Uber alone. I never received follow up from the police, and everything was probably fine it was just a situation which felt uncomfortable. I probably should have asked the child something to see if this was an issue but I did not say a single word to the kid. AITA for calling this in and potentially making the driver lose his job?",69,159,0.95

1237,Not the A-hole," 

This is a very long story so I will try my best to make this as concise as possible.

1. My wife (21F), her sister (18F), and I (23M) had plans to go see a movie tonight.
2. My wife and I slept in and got up last minute to get dressed for the movie.
3. My wife went to use the bathroom to take care of the monthly hygiene (she got her period today) while I made the bed and picked out some clothes.
4. I went to the bathroom to take care of my hygiene and found my wife on the toilet attempting to clean her newly blood-stained pajama pants; as I walked in she told me to get out while she finished cleaning.
5. I continued into the bathroom and thought nothing of her being in there taking care of what she had to (my wife insisted in the beginning of our marriage that we should be comfortable with both of us being in there at any time).
6. As I got ready she continued to tell me to get out so I told her that she should use the guest restroom to clean her clothes; shortly after that she stormed out, soiled pants in-hand.
7. I undressed and thought nothing of her storming out, hoping she would cool down by the time we had to leave.
8. My wife finished cleaning up and getting dressed fairly quickly and walked past the wide-open bathroom door (which is right beside the front door of the house) muttering that I should close the door or ""they"" would see me naked. I thought nothing of this and did not close the door as we live near a high-traffic area and figured she meant cars passing by may see me naked as she opened and closed the door to get out.
9. My wife came back inside, shut the door behind her, and walked past the bathroom.
10. I hear her walking around but pay no mind as I am focusing on getting ready ASAP.
11. I hear the door open and figure my wife has walked outside once again, but I am caught completely by surprise when I hear my SIL's voice (I did not know she was getting dropped off instead of us picking her up) then see her through the bathroom mirror which can easily be seen once you walk into the house.
12. I realize my SIL has a direct view to my butt-naked backside and my front through the large mirror.
13. I immediately become as embarrassed as I ever have and hear my wife cracking up while my SIL embarrassingly states that she did not see anything.

I became very upset as my wife stated that she intentionally left the door open and was hoping my SIL would see me naked so I could see how it felt (her words). My wife was laughing and found the whole thing hilarious until I cancelled the movie reservations. Soon after I made the cancellation she became very emotional and began to cry and call me a some very cruel things. I've become accustomed to her calling me names when she is angry but I became more upset when she began to recite her latest trend of saying she wishes she had listened to other people, had never met me, fell in love, or married me. 

She said she wanted an apology or would leave to her mom's.

She left.

1238,Not the A-hole,"I left home to go to college in another state. I ended up marrying someone I met there, and we made our home in that state. We now have children. We visit my family twice a year for holidays. It is hard to go more often because traveling with children is hard and expensive.

My uncle passed away recently. After he passed away, his entire family (wife and kids) are angry at me. They removed me on Facebook, did not answer any of my texts or calls, and told my other Aunt to tell me we were not invited to the funeral. I've been told they are angry because I didn't move my family home to support them when he was sick.

I didn't realize they expected me to move my children and leave our jobs to move back to their state. Even if I had known they wanted me to, realistically I wouldn't have done it.

I did visit him three months ago and regularly texted. I sent gift packages. I have not offered financial support, but now that they are angry I am afraid that they would see an offer as an attempt to buy my way back into the family.

Is their expectation that I should have moved home a normal expectation? If so I guess I'm a jerk. I am doing some soul searching.",23,30,0.87
1239,Not the A-hole,"Some context. I'm 23 years old and a college student. Most of the time, I live on campus but as next week is Spring Break, I came home to my parents' tonight. My brother (21) is home and his girlfriend is staying the night, as tomorrow they plan to leave early and go to Boston. I assumed that the girlfriend would get my room, my brother would sleep in his and that I would sleep on the couch. 

Turns out, I was wrong. My brother somehow convinced my mom that they should share a room. (My parents are very conservative Christians so I didn't think they'd go for it). Now, my brother's bed isn't big enough for them to sleep in together but my bed is. So, my mom told them it'd be okay to sleep in my bed. Without asking me first. I only found out when my dad came to collect me from school, as he thought I knew. He understood why I wasn't comfortable with it. I talked to my mom and was told that she would wash the sheets in the morning. Fine. Whatever. I accept I'm not going to have a say in this and don't want to fight.

My brother and his girlfriend come home. I pull my brother aside and tell him that I don't want them doing anything in my bed tonight. My brother got really mad and ignored me for the rest of the night. He made a snarky comment when he went upstairs and my mom asked me what was wrong with us. I told her and she got mad that I said that. I told her I'm not going to apologize for saying it. I also said it was messed up for her okaying this when it was my bed, without asking me first. She said there was no other option and I said that's not true, there definitely was and brought up me sleeping on the couch.

After they went to bed, my brother came back down to grab his charger and was still in a mood, mumbling about how everything is a problem. My mom said it wasn't and that I shouldn't have said it. I said I don't regret saying it. Brother said I was mad at him, I said that wasn't true, I simply asked him to not do something. He said ""Whatever, she'll never stay the night again."" Which isn't at all what I said or even wanted. I love his girlfriend, she's really sweet and I would have no issue with \*her\* being in my bed. I just don't want them doing anything in it.

Now my mom is upset with me because he's upset and I don't feel bad. I didn't say I was mad about her being in the room, I know she's slept in there before when I'm not home and my brother has been in his. (Though I'm not naive and think he probably snuck up there, which is why I said something.)

It's not their bed. It's mine and I didn't say it loud enough for his girlfriend to hear or do anything to make her feel uncomfortable. I said it to him and him alone, because I know him. He's the type that totally would and I think that's why he got mad.

Am I the asshole here? Should I just be okay with them doing whatever they want in my bed?

Edit to add because my mom and I just fought over it: I know they have done stuff in there before, because he admitted to it. After I asked him the first time not to. I told him I wasn’t cool with it and he laughed it off. 
Btw, telling my mom these seemed to shut her up. She got quiet and then said “you still shouldn’t have said it”

She also asked “How would you feel if he said that to you?” and I said “I wouldn’t put him in that situation in the first place, because  it’s unfair. And tonight when I sleep in his bed, I’m not going to do anything to be disrespectful.” Again, meant with silence. ",41,115,0.94

1241,Asshole,"My sister has been dating this guy for over a year. they're really serious, talking marriage, etc. I made a comment to my parents that it was good of him to be with her, knowing her history, which is that her old boyfriend abused her and was basically her pimp for a few months before she came back to live with my parents. I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.

I thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her.

1245,Not the A-hole,"So i meet with a church group a few times a month and each meeting there is a different public speaker that talks and answers questions before we break up into small groups for prayer and discussion about the points the Speaker makes.  


This week cops came in and talked about public saftey and whatnot, but their discussion was completely derailed because all of these ladies wouldn't shut the fuck up about the homeless population and mentioning how they fear for their safety and their childrens saftey if they are just anywhere near a homeless person in a public setting. And they kept asking the cops if it was legal to call 911 on a homeless person asleep at a park because ""It scares me that they are spending so much time at a park where children play and I fear that they might attempt to kidnap my children or follow me home"" 




Anyway, we broke up into small groups and talked about the homeless most of the time. I was biting my tongue the whole time because I am sort of an ""imposter"" in the group. Like I am not a religious person/never been baptized or anything, and I'm not even sure where I stand on God and all, but I like to keep an open mind, and i have met some awesome friends though this meeting so i keep attending. But ot got to the point where I just couldn't keep it in any longer. Some woman said something along the lines of ""You always need to be so careful anywhere you go. There are so many terrible and sick disgusting men in this world. The rec center is the worst, but certainly never let your kids go to any trailer parks even if you are having a mommy and me play date. Like if you find out your friend lives in a trailer it would be best to never go to her house. Trailer parks are just disgusting. And the rec center is even worse because theres creepy old men there and the homeless go there to shower and shave since its cheap, and they spend all of their time in the hot tubs and just wait for the perfect time to abduct a child!"" 



And I shit you not. There was numerous stories about how the homeless were so scary and its just best if you never make eye contact and just bassically pretend they don't even exist.... 



This is where I lost my shit. I interjected and let them know that I have spent so much time with the homeless population, and that I,myself, have actually panhandled/begged for money as well as lived out of my car when i was a young teen. I told them some personal stories and tired to show them that not ALL homeless people are looking for an easy way to support a drinking/drug habit, and I even encouraged them that it is totally possible to talk to a homeless person and not magically get abducted. But i certainly let them know that the gross judgement they were making was not only sickning, but also extremely non-christian. 



They immediately changed the topic but i could still sense the tension, so AITA for sharing my opinion/experience when I was so pissed off that a group of women could be so judgemental? ",18,29,0.81

1251,Asshole,"I work at a media company. Because of frequent client meetings etc, there is often free food leftover for employees in the break room.

Side notes:

1. I'm a vegetarian.
2. The office doesn't have a cafeteria per se, but it has a food truck show up every day for lunch.
3. On any given week, 2, at most 3 of the food trucks will have a vegetarian entree as an option.
4. The other day we had a mandatory 2 hour meeting during lunch. Lunch was provided for the staff. You guessed it -- nothing but meat sandwiches (from a restaurant that makes a pretty great veggie sandwich, I might add).

Back to the story and requested judgment. Today, wonder of wonders! There was food leftover from a client meeting that I could eat: a rather delightful charcuterie board with several cheeses, blueberries, and honey. Given that I've literally never gotten to partake of the free food perk of this job and have indeed been shafted food-wise on a weekly basis, I felt righteous as I literally took the entire charcuterie board to my desk and devoured it.

AITA for doing so?

Edit: I fully intend to accept my judgment, but just to provide a little more color on my reasoning:  as I commented below, this food is left over. It has served its purpose as a marketing tool, and now it's available for the office. If you take the leftover food in aggregate, I've now eaten <1% of all of that leftover food, which is way less than my ""share."" It just happened to be all at once because this was my only opportunity to do so. 

Edit 2: I am a vegetarian by choice. I have not told my employer about my dietary restriction, and I don’t hold the lack of vegetarian leftovers against them. I do find the lack of vegetarian food truck options irksome, but am well used to lack of accommodation in this area. it comes with the territory. i haven’t told my employer because i don’t want to be perceived as complaining or high maintenance, and i could see my choice having a negative impact on my advancement opportunity given that i live in a conservative city in a region well known for ranching and meat-heavy cuisine.

1252,Not the A-hole,"i have been seeing someone for almost a year now. we are not ""official"" and have a few conversations about why we aren't. he is afraid of commitment and how it would change his life and wants to be very sure the next time he commits to someone. besides this issue, we talk constantly, hang out frequently, and are best friends.

not too long before i met him (let's call him D), i met a man (who i will call A) on tinder. we have sex every now and then (maybe once every two months). he texts me if he wants to meet up, we hook up, we go on with our lives. A is not interested in a relationship with anyone and i am not interested in him beyond the sex we have.

my friends hear about D all the time. they have never heard about A because it's not a big deal to me. about a week ago, i went to pick up something i had left at my friend's house. i casually mentioned i was stopping by but not trying to hang out because i had somewhere to be after. this friend always needs to know 110% of everything so i ended up having to explain the existence of A. she was floored because not only did she not know i was hooking up with someone for a year, but also because she'd heard so much about D.

this friend texted our group chat about A and i had to explain to our other friends who A was. no one was surprised but one of them made the observation that i want D to commit to me yet i was sleeping with A.

D is very important to me. he is my best friend. however, i feel like since D doesn't want to be committed that i am free to date or have sex with whoever i want. A doesn't mean anything to me. if D wanted a relationship right now, i wouldn't talk to or do anything with A ever again. i had never had a problem with this line of thinking until a friend pointed it out and now i kinda feel like an asshole.

I asked him what those stains were, if he nosebleed at night, he nodded. I didn't take an issue with it.

This week however, while lying on the bed with the sheets, I made a comment on how he should probably get new sheets because those are really large blood stains (1ft x 1ft). He then told me that it was his ex's period blood. I immediately became super grossed out by it and refused to sleep on another woman's, let alone his ex's, period blood stain.

He changed the sheets, but wanted to keep the sheets because they're perfectly good sheets but have stains. I demanded him to throw them away. We got into an argument.

We were having sex and she asked me to tell her she was beautiful. Some of her features are very pretty and many people would find her pretty. To me, “beautiful” is a whole different category. When I think of beautiful women, I think of women like old movie stars, perfect and unattainable. Kind of icy and distant. I told her this and she has been upset ever since. She's withdrawn sometimes and sex hasn't been the same. Sometimes she brings it up and cries. I have told her I am sorry that her feelings were hurt.

She doubts I love her, which is far from the truth. I love her very much. But I am pedantic, which is something she knows about me. I was being truthful and honesty is important in a relationship.

She is a wonderful woman, she is very warm and cares about me a lot. But she has a history of low self esteem and her few long term relationships have been with men who were jerks.

Anyway, my ""meal-prepped"" weekday lunches (not necessarily healthy but enough to last a full week) are spicy, as you can guess, but a very decent/moderate level (at least to me). My workplace has a main communal kitchen and a smaller one that's closer to my cube, so I use the microwave in there to heat up my lunch. I often take it back to my cube to eat for a very quick lunch break, which a lot of people at my company do. At least several days a week, a particular coworker will repeatedly cough and comment, ""Wow, I can smell the spice from my office."" His office is maybe 20-30 feet away from my cube. I don't know if my lunch truly bothers them or if it's just them making a harmless comment, but I wonder if it's the former. That being said... I haven't asked them directly because 1) it's my lunch, not sure what I'm supposed to do about it, and 2) I eat for maybe 10 minutes, immediately wash the bowl in the kitchen, and the smell does not linger.

I work from 9 to 5 every day of the week and sometimes I get a little extra time at lunch (usually like an hour or so).

From what she has told me after today (she mentioned it last time but I brushed it off as her just having a bad day) she doesnt like it because it interrupts her schedule...

1257,Not the A-hole,"My sister-in-law gave birth to her third child, and my wife was ready to hop a five hour flight with the rest of her family to visit the baby.

She lives in California, an hour drive from Disney Land. My wife has been visiting her half sister all her life: 4 or 5 trips a year.

After 5 years of dating and 2 years of marriage I began to see a pattern where my wife visits the sister while she rarely visits us. My wife occasionally expresses frustrations at this. She'll drop everything to visit her sister: wedding stuff, baby showers, baby sprinkles, first week of school, birthdays, but my sister-in-law rarely reciprocates (when we were getting married and she wouldn't fly up here for wedding related events). My wife has never brought up this to her sister because her family never had a problem with flying to California, and she doesn't want to start shit.

We've had arguments in the past where she spent $600 on a flight for an unplanned weekend. We're a young couple, trying to save for a house to start a family of our own. When say I this, she reminds me that she works too and is allowed to spend money she makes on what she wants. She misses her sister and wants to visit her all she wants. When we have children we won't be able to afford to visit as often as we do now, or participate in the fucking thousands of dollars Disney Land birthday parties.

The past 6 months have been financially hard. I've been going to the doctors and bills are piling up. They don't know what's wrong. Constant fatigue, back pain, and bathroom trouble. It's stressful. We have a dog, and he is a handful when I'm feeling good, let alone when I'm feeling like crap. I'm still working, but my wife got laid off and had to accept a position that's minimum wage. We're not starving or anything, but I've cut back on my spending. I thought she would do the same with less California trips.

Last night my wife was looking at flight prices, and I asked if she considered the strain a trip to California puts on the dog and I. We can only have a dog because of our work schedules: she works nights; I works days. If she leaves, I'll have to board him (more money) because he's not a dog you can leave alone for more than a few hours without problems, let alone 8+. She said I should take some days off from work to watch him, but that would be even a greater financial burden of having to use unpaid sick days.

The argument ended not being about this trip, but her lifestyle and how we can't afford these trips for the rest of our lives. I said when we have a kid, if she thinks we're flying down to California a few weeks after she gives birth so her sister can meet the baby then I'm going to verbally start shit with the family because its not fair.

1259,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because at least some of the involved parties know my main account.

So, I’ve been involved in a few D&D games over Skype/Discord in the past few years, and one of the people in my current group is someone I’ve played with before (we’ll call her Beth). In a campaign I played with her a year or two back, there was some drama with another player (we’ll call him Ross) who got creepy/possessive/vaguely stalkerish toward Beth. She told the rest of the group, showed us screenshots, and he was kicked. Note that I had played with Ross in other games before this. 

Recently, I joined a newly started game with mostly new people (plus Beth, obviously). We were doing some out of character chat about D&D and our previous experiences, and one of the players said some stuff that sounded familiar. I PMed him about it, and confirmed (with minimal prompting) that not only was it someone I’d played with before, but that it was Ross. He knew that Beth was in the group and wasn’t comfortable around him/playing with him, but felt that she was “being unfair” and that he’d “learned his lesson and deserved another chance to be her friend,” and thus used a new alias to join the game and had asked the person who’d invited him to introduce him as a different name. For what it’s worth, the person who invited Ross was told what happened by Ross, so I’m assuming he got a very different version of events than what actually happened. Ross’s “plan,” by his own admission, is to play with her for a while, then reveal that it’s him so that she can see he’s changed and give him another shot. Beth, for her part, has expressed in the past that she doesn’t want him in her life after how he treated her, and I know that she’d be uncomfortable/feel unsafe if she knew it was him. 

WIBTA if I told him his choices were to either tell her/the group who he is or have me do it? I’m not looking to dox the guy, but I think Beth has the right to know who she’s playing with and to feel safe while playing, and that the group has the right to know what kind of person they’re playing with. 

Edit for clarification: there’s no situation in which Ross stays in the group. I’m going to bring this up to the group later, I’m just asking if I’m an asshole for doing this.

1260,No A-holes here,"Background: I take improv classes at a smaller-sized improv theater in a west coast city. Much like the surrounding community, the theater is pretty progressive, taking pride in inclusivity and remaining us that we are welcome with those little all are welcome signs. So it’s pretty cool to have a lot of different backgrounds. My class itself has about 35 participants and is pretty awesomely diverse.

Fast forward to last Saturday. We were finishing up a class when the instructor announced that an hour after the class, the POC team showcase would begin. A few times a month the theater has open showcases where students and visitors can participate in improv. There’s one for POC, women/femme, LGBT, and then the all open showcase that anyone can participate in.

Some of us were interested in attending (since participating was limited to just POC and everyone respected that) and a girl (who happened to be white) inquired about ticket prices. Our instructor seemed a bit surprised and said that the show was *only* for POC. She could visit the women’s showcase, all open showcase, or LGBTQ showcase if she fell in that category.

That struck me a bit because I couldn’t attend any of them besides the open showcase (which I’ve seen often). I get that being a straight white dude doesn’t carry leverage in the topic of discrimination, I really do. It just sucks because I wanted to support some of my classmates who were going to take part in the showcase and hear some insight from different backgrounds (and some comedy!). 

The theater’s director of diversity was there, and reiterated those points, so I assumed that the theater’s director likely also upholds those rules. What confused me even more is that they sell tickets to these showcases to the public in-house.

I guess it would be almost intrusive to view the POC showcase, but I’m also afraid to voice my grievences to my instructor; I have no idea how to approach it without being ostracized or kicked out of the classes (which I paid for).

WIBTA to write a complaint to the theater regarding their practices? The difficult thing is everything said was verbal, so there’s no record of them saying that and writing an open letter would really not do much good. I really love the shows that come through there, but I’m pretty saddened and still in some disbelief they can blatantly discriminate like that. 

I should also add I’m afraid that if I voice my complaint and it gains traction, the theater could remove those programs altogether. ",65,44,0.88
1261,No A-holes here,"So I have a trip to Disney coming up soon, we leave on Sunday. My girlfriend and I have been planning this trip for a long time, she has never been to Disney before, and we have never been on a vacation on our own before. Of course we are very excited. Well my mom also happened to be planning to go to Disney few days after we will have arrived. 

They are flying down, wheras we will driving about 12 hours there. We agreed months ago to take my sister who is also in college with us because her spring break aligns with ours. As it happens, my mom's boyfriend is terrified of flying, so he had planned to get a ride down with some friends of his instead of getting on the plane with my mom and the kids. It turns out for whatever reason he can no longer ride down with those friends so my mom asked my girlfriend and I if he can ride with us and my sister. I said that I would really rather not take him with us, I don't know him that well and my girlfriend really doesn't know him very well, and we were all pretty excited to have our first road trip as adults without any older people with us. We are fully paying for the trip ourselves, and planned it all out on our own. 

Now my mom seems to be mad at me because I said I don't want to take her boyfriend with us. Am I an asshole for not wanting to take my mom's boyfriend on a road trip with us with 2 days notice?

1263,,"This happened years ago but I still think about it. I always went to this gas station in my town, and it was usually pretty busy. Whenever I would go to any gas station, I would go inside, prepay with a twenty dollar bill, and then pump my gas. At every gas station I've been to, the pump shuts off when it hits the prepaid amount, and this gas station was no exception.

But one day when I was pumping my twenty dollars worth of gas, I noticed that the pump didn't shut off. I had prepaid with a twenty dollar bill just like all the times before, but this time it filled up my tank and I got maybe about 8 dollars worth of extra gas. I thought the pump malfunctioned, or the cashier didn't input my prepaid balance properly.

Either way it wasn't my fault and I thought it was my lucky day, like getting an extra soda from a vending machine. I was about to drive off, but then the cashier came running out saying I had to pay. I explained to him that I prepaid with a twenty dollar bill, and it wasn't my fault that the pump didn't shut off like it was supposed to. I didn't want to pay any more than twenty dollars, which I feel is the whole point of prepaying.

It definitely wasn't worth arguing over, and I did get the extra gas, so I just paid him and that was that. I didn't go back to that gas station though. But I'm still wondering, was I obligated to pay? Am I ignorant on gas station etiquette?",163,102,0.93

So I’m in my junior year of college and I’m a “traditional student” (I’m 20). My classmate is a non-traditional student and she’s 40 with four children all under 12. We’re both majoring in public health. 

I find the material pretty easy to grasp because it’s something I genuinely love. My personal favorite class is epidemiology. However, my classmate has a harder time and is always asking me for help with upcoming exams and homework. As soon as an assignment is due, she texts me asking if she can see mine “as a reference”. I had to show her to make an excel spreadsheet and how to interpret a table and graph. 

The thing is she constantly talks in class about how she worked 25 years at a prestigious hospital where she was an administrative manager. I’m fairly busy trying to balance work and school so I can’t handle it when she wants tutoring every single day for the most easiest of problems. I feel like she doesn’t even try to do them on her own because she knows I’ll be there to help.  I get that I have a much easier time in the class but that doesn’t mean I have the time or energy to explain everything all the time.

Anyways the poor thing ended up contracting measles due to my sisters obvious negligence...Anyways his hospital bills are like 8 thousand dollars and now she’s requesting help from the family to help cover the cost of his 3 week hospitalization. I am pro vaccination as you can tell and make enough money . I could honestly reasonably give 2 thousand..But the crux of it is I don’t want to ? 

Why should I have to donate money to some one who could have just gotten the vaccine and saved herself the trouble..The thing is if he had the vaccine and ended  up contracting it. I would have no problem giving her the money. She decided not to vaccinate knowing that she could never reasonable afford the bill. Why should our family have to pay when she made a bad choice?  

Also I’ve done a lot for her in the sense of prepping meals and cleaning her house and caring for her dogs. It seems spiteful but I think she should have to suffer the consequences of her actions. So am I the asshole for refusing to give her money because I feel she was negligent by not vaccinating her son of the first place?  


EDIT:How dare people say I don’t love my nephew because I refuse to reinforce my sisters shitty behaviour. He is treated and recovering at home I have paid for a tutor as well as groceries and gas. I simply refuse to help her pay the medical bills as she will not vaccinate even though my nephew almost died...If she were to vaccinate and I watched the doctor do it I would pay the entire bill honestly. He’s also in soccer and hockey and I pay for that as well! Sorry if I wasn’t clear in that post also I have tried social services but regardless of the vaccination issue they can’t really make a case.  


Edit: I’m going to give social services a call with all my evidence and screen shots of our conversations where’s she’s being negligent I’m going to make a solid case and try for custody. I recognize that this is a whole other issue in its self but I messaged my sisters best friend (she’s read this post) and her best friend sent me some screen shots of her talking about having a “pox party” never even knew it was a thing until today.  I’m so grateful for all the help this post has provided me. Hopefully I can build enough of a case against her I’ve tried making calls before but her best friend is willing to help me so hopefully I can take him on and get him the help he needs. Im scared for him after the pox party thing and I feel it’s gotten out of hand. I’m not sure what the best route was but this post brought to my attention just how fucked up and dangerous this situation can be so I’m extremely grateful and I’m hoping and praying I can build enough of a case with CPS. Feeling like a bit of a dick because she genuinely thinks she’s doing what’s best but I love him and I fear for his safety! 
It’s not just this either my sister in not a fit parent in a TON of other ways. She has a mild drug problem and has ongoing multiple affairs with strange men...That are creepy and not meant to be around small children. 

Also to clarify he’s out of the hospital and at home finishing his recovery he’s already been treated. She’s just having a hard time paying the rest of the bill. ",599,2700,0.95

She was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it’s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  

Things got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.

1268,Not the A-hole,"BACKGROUND: 

I am 18m and my girlfriend is 17f. We have been dating for a little over a year. 

My friends are 18f (T) and 19m (C), and I've known both of them for longer that I've known gf. We have also gone up north before, even before I knew gf, mostly just to play video games and do stupid teenager stuff. Once before I met gf, once at the very start of my relationship with gf. 

I met C in seventh grade, and three years ago C introduced me to T, and we have all been friends since. Nothing romantic or otherwise has happened between any of us, this is important later

Now, over time my gf has become a big part in my life, resulting in me seeing my friends less and less. When they came to me about going up north again, I was excited, but there is one other issue. 

Gf doesn't trust T. Gf thinks she flirts with me, and wants to sleep with me. Gf has asked me to do things like let her know when I'm seeing T (which I did anyways), and not to hang out with T one on one (which we didn't do much anyways, it was mostly all three of us, C, T, and I). I have assured gf over and over that I have no interest in T, and that in the instance where something did start, I would end it immediately. Despite this, she gets very mad at me whenever I see T and it makes me want to see her less and less in fear of fighting again. 

So when I told my gf that we planned to go up north again later this year, she was not happy to say the least. She has said she doesn't feel comfortable with me going, and has asked me to ask them if she could come along. I love her, but I want to go with my friends and just my friends. AITA?

1269,Not the A-hole,"Yesterday me and my friend decided to try out Little Caesar's Pretzel Crust Pizza. I bought the pizza, we went to my house, and we tried it out. Me personally, I didn't like it. It just had a average pizza taste and the pretzel crust didn't really add anything other than a slightly saltier flavor. I didn't care for it and I made my thoughts known to my friend. Believe it or not, he was actually mad at me. 

He starts saying stuff like ""You always act like you're so smart."" and he told me off for using ""big words"" and ""trying to sound like a food critic"". I was confused by where he was coming from. He then starts telling me that it's the best pizza he's ever had. I said to him ""You must not have had many pizzas if you think that THIS is the best pizza."" That was enough for him to just snatch the whole pizza box from me and say that he's having it to himself since I don't like it. And guess what? He eats the entire box and not only that, but he was also using a piece of crust to wipe up an any excess grease from the inside of the box and he was eating that as well. 

It was disgusting what he was doing and I had to step in and call him out when he just lazily tosses the empty box on my floor. I told him to pick it up and toss it, but he says ""Not until you get better taste in food."" Was he seriously this upset about me not liking this pizza? I then snapped at him and said ""I'm not gonna get lectured about good taste from someone who comes from a white trash family who eats nothing but fast food every day."" He just left my place and that was that.

Am I at fault over this? I admit that I may have crossed a line with my white trash comment, but he started it with overreacting to my reaction to the pizza. What do you think?",66,29,0.72

1272,META,"I’ve become frustrated with how quick a lot of AITA commenters are to encourage OP’s to leave their partners when a challenging experience is posted. While leaving a partner is a necessary action in some cases, just flippantly ending a relationship because conflicts arise is not only a dangerous thing to recommend to others, but it deprives people of the challenges necessary to grow and evolve as emotionally intelligent adults. 

When we muster the courage to face our relationship problems, and not run away, we develop deeper capacities for Love, Empathy, Understanding, and Communication. These capacities are absolutely critical for us as a generation to grow into mature, capable, and sensitive adults. 

Encouraging people to exit relationships at the first sign of trouble is dangerous and immature, and a byproduct of our “throw-away” consumer society. I often get a feeling that many commenters don’t have enough relationship experience to be giving such advise in the first place. 

Please think twice before encouraging people to make drastic changes to their relationships; we should be encouraging greater communication and empathy as the first response to most conflicts. ",1641,53300,0.91

1274,Not the A-hole,"Hi everyone. So, I(24M) have been going through some drama with my girlfriend(23F) this week. It all started on Tuesday, but let me back up a little more for necessary background information.

So without going into too much detail to protect identities, I am in graduate school and recently one of the professors in my department at my school was accused of posting a sexist statement on social media. There was some social media backlash and outrage. I think at the moment, we do not know yet what the departments response will be. But I believe the professor is getting investigated or something. 

My girlfriend and I have discussed this a lot and we are definitely on the same side. We both agree that what this professor shared was not OK at all. I told my girlfriend how I have discussed this with many of my colleagues and students, especially the female ones. I made sure to talk to my female students and make sure that they felt comfortable studying with me and that the professors statements do not reflect my beliefs or the departments. 

So back to my story, on Monday evening my girlfriend shared an article about this situation. Since I am finishing my first graduate degree, and want to leave doors open with the faculty here in case I come back for the next degree, I hid article from my social media because I didn't want to burn any bridges with my professors. 

In the morning she discovered I had deleted the article and she completely freaked out. She thinks I am being ""not a true ally"" because I didn't want to share the article. She thinks that I should be willing to throw my career under the bus to fight for what's right. I tried to tell her that I discuss this with all of my colleagues and students and I feel that that does more good than social media does. I tried to tell her I am on her side 100%. She was having none of it and blocked me everywhere. 

She later sent me an email saying I have to post the article and send her a screenshot or she will never unblock me. I did do this, and she unblocked me. 

But after about half an hour I felt weird that if my faculty saw the post, they may not let me come back for my terminal degree, and so I deleted it again. I felt like, after this professor had already been chewed apart on social media, me sharing it wasn't doing much good, especially when I was trying to do real good in person.  When she saw this she freaked out again and has had me blocked for the last four days. Apparently she's breaking up with me now because she doesn't believe that I'm truly on her side. 

So, AITA for refusing to share this article? My gf is very passionate about this and is choosing to die on this hill. But I really don't want to burn any bridges unnecessarily especially when this professor could already be getting fired. But I am confused and truly don't know if AITA. ",102,188,0.96

1276,Not the A-hole,"This happened when I was 18. I was part of a very tight knit group of friends. It was me, one guy (K) who I considered my best friend, and a couple (A + J). We did pretty much everything together and usually hung out at A+J's place since they lived together while K and me were still living at home. I saw all of them at least 3-4 times a week. 

One day, I met A for coffee at our college cafeteria because he said he wanted to talk about something. When I got there he was crying. He told me that he and J had gotten into a horrible fight (if I remember correctly she had gotten physically violent towards him) and he was thinking about breaking up with her. He highlighted that he didn't feel safe around her sometimes and that her extreme anger scared him. 

Now, I loved J to death. She was the oldest in our group by far and felt like an older sister to me. However, she *could* get scary. She was a very, very strong personality and I often found myself kind of walking on eggshells around her. So when A told me he was scared, crying in front of me, I told him I understood, and that I also sometimes felt scared around J. I calmed him down and a few hours later we both went home. 

The next day I received a long hateful text from J, who told me that A had told her what I had said about her 'anger issues'. She told me that she didn't want anything to do with me ever again. I texted K, panicking, and he confirmed that he also didn't want to see me again. I met once with A, who apologized, but said he didn't dare say anything to J and that I just had to leave them all alone. He also confirmed that him and J were back together. I haven't seen any of them since. 

This incident fucked me up for a good year, since I lost all my best friends. A few months ago I heard from a distant friend that J went into therapy after what happened and still tells people that I traumatized her.

Well a couple days ago we were at a Walgreens when police were seen arresting a guy. It was someone my wife knew. They used to work together before the man was let go for drug and alcohol abuse. As he was arrested and handcuffed for shoplifting and physically assaulting an employee. My wife talked to him and I knew she was dissapointed in him. On our way home I ask if she wants to talk about it and she says no.

So this all went down last night, I'll try to include most details.

I've been together with my girlfriend for 3 months right now (We're both 22 btw). I can honestly say I've never met someone who I have so much chemistry with, and we are extremely happy together. She's very intelligent and attractive, and we share a lot of interests. I met her at a bar and she actually came onto me, something that surprised me very positively. 

Last night we were talking and the topic of sex came up. We see each other 3 or 4 times a week and when we do we usually sleep with each other. She asked me how many people I slept with before her, and I told her I only hooked up with my previous girlfriend. Now I wasn't really thinking but naturally I asked her the same thing. She was a bit hesitant, so I told her she didn't need to tell me but that I wouldn't really care anyways. Well, this is where it starts to go downhill.

She told me that when she was 20 she worked as an escort for 2 months before quitting. She was with some high-end agency and slept with 2 or 3 guys a week and made quite some money. She stopped because she didn't like the work and made enough money to pay off some debt she had at the time. I was kind of stunned, I didn't really know how to react. When she was telling all this she seemed pretty cool, but when she saw my reaction she became pretty emotional. I told her I didn't expect it at all, and that I needed some time to think. I did hold her for a few minutes and she cried a little bit, but I left after some time.

Apparently I am much less open-minded as I thought I was. I really don't know how to feel about her past and it makes me feel kinda shitty. Later that night I got a long text from her and she told me that she loves me for the first time and that she hopes we can move past this. I replied that I loved her too but that I needed some time. After her message I also received a message from her friend saying she had never seen her as happy as with me and never as devastated as right now. She told me that I'm an asshole for leaving her like this and that I should man up. 

I get where she's coming from, but I don't agree with her. This is quite the revelation for me and I feel very conflicted.  Am I the asshole?

Edit: Thanks for all the insights. I'm going to go over to her house in an hour or so, I will update later.


Update: We're going on a break. I went over to her place to talk and she was still very emotional. I asked her if there was anything else I should know that she hasn't told me. She confessed that she worked as an escort for almost 5 months instead of 2, and that she had kinda expected my response so she tried to downplay it. 

I'm not cool with lying, and I got pretty upset. It ended with an argument and her begging me to stay, but I left. Didn't get the chance to have a conversation. Haven't responded to any of her calls or messages. I don't know why she wouldn't just tell me the truth, makes me wonder what else she's hiding from me. I think that it's over. I'll sit down with her this weekend one more time and see where that goes. Cheers.",823,1052,0.94

1289,No A-holes here,"Im not sure how to talk about this so imma just jump in. So my GF (21) and I (23) have been dating for 2+ years now. Im am her first long term relationship. After about 6 months of being abstinent, we attempted to have sex for the first time. Long story short she couldn't get comfortable and we just went to bed. She went to her doctor a couple weeks later and they established something was going on down there for her. Not sure if a uti, or a yeast infection, or what as shes gone through multiple attempts to fix it but its yet to go away. 
Since then, we've tried a few more times but the same thing. She can never get comfortable with me inside her, and after about 10 seconds shell just tighten up to where it fucking hurts. So we just call it quits. Recently (~6 months) we haven't really tried again, mostly because I feel kind of defeated and tbh knowing your gf cant get sexually comfortable with you being in her sucks ass. Plus I'm always the one who initiates any sexual acts, she very rarely is the initiator. And it's not because I'm too big, trust I watch a lot of porn and I know I'm on the bottom of that call list for good camera looking dicks. So really for the past 2 years we've been getting by with blowjobs and fingering. Which I am cool with, and told her I'm cool with as long as we're actively working towards bettering our sex life/finding out what's wrong. 
But about 4 months ago she was diagnosed with depression/anxiety so we've been dealing with that and recently shes been getting much better. But even since she was diagnosed, the blowjobs I get have practically zeroed out. The only time we do anything is after I ask her a couple times, not one after another but once on Sunday, again on Wednesday, then again on Saturday (i ALAWAYS have to ask and shes NEVER offers to do it but that's another conversation) and then if she does do it, its preceded by complaining about all I care about is getting off and dont care for her, which half the time makes me change my mind and just decided to go to the bathroom and get myself off.
And yeah thats about it. Recently I've been debating about breaking up with her as I've yet to have sex with anyone for about 6 years and am tired of waiting and feeling bad about asking for sexual favors. Tbh when I think about sex with her, it just makes me sad now because of all the failures that we've had, that it makes the prospect of a future with sex still seem lowkey not as great as I first thought when we started dating. What happens when shit is fixed? Am I going to spend the rest of my life asking to have sex or a blowjob or anything? And I'm not saying asking for consent sucks, because I always do and shit i want to try out later on requires trust and consent, but rather having to go and ask my gf if we can do sexual stuff together every single time and never being asked/initiated on sucks ass.",64,96,0.93

1294,Not the A-hole,"I’m going to try to condense this as much as possible. My roommate is a friend I’ve had for a couple of years. We are both married and we both have daughters that are the same age. 

Background: She decided to buy a house in the NE United States and move her family there *just in case* she decided to pursue a career there after her current contract expires in a few years. She moved her family into that house and moved to the south by herself where her current job is and now lives in my home for a small rent.

Here’s the problem: she’s cheating on her husband with a guy who is also cheating on his long-term girlfriend. I really wish I didn’t know this information, but she came clean to me a couple weeks ago. Now, my real issue is not so much that she’s cheating on her husband (EDIT: because he already knows and I can’t help them repair their marriage since I’ve already given my roommate plenty of advice *that she asked for* and didn’t take any of it), but that she has no problem sleeping with a man who has been dating a girl for three years. I asked her if she would tell his girlfriend, but she doesn’t want to lose her side-ho. Now, I know my husband wouldn’t touch her with a 10ft pole, but I just can’t trust her alone with my husband after finding out not only about her cheating, but also her deep insecurities that she has literally told me can only be staved off with male attention.

1295,Not enough info,"I’ll try to keep this as brief as possible while giving all the facts.  

Let’s call coworker C.  C has always had a bad habit of passing off her work to others.  Also she constantly needs people to cover her shifts.  I’ve covered for her several times in the past.  

C has had kind of a flirty relationship with another coworker.  I’ve seen her first hand be over the top with sexual innuendo with him.  He would all the time take on her stocking duties.  I kinda figured C was using him, but that’s their business so I never said anything. 

Last week C went to our manager about other coworker saying that he had been sexually harassing her.  Coworker had to have a sit down with the manager and actually ended up quitting during the sit down.  

It’s really none of my business, but I do think it’s shitty of C to claim sexual harassment after she was as dirty spoken as anyone I’ve ever meant.  I don’t want anything to do with her going forward just because I don’t want to risk my job if she decides it’s time to report me.  C asked me to cover her shift today yesterday and I told her no.  I’ve also been actively avoiding contact with her.   We work kinda separated so it’s been easy for the most part.  ",22,33,0.9

1300,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because I'm just a lurker with no intention of becoming a regular poster; just wanted some third-party opinions on this particular issue. 

A little backstory to set context:

About two years ago I started dating the woman I'm currently with. After casually dating for a couple months she ended up getting pregnant. We moved in together shortly after to save money in preparation for the baby. I already owned my home so we decided to move her and her dog into my house with my two dogs. 

Here's where the problem begins. She is a nurse working the night-shift. She felt guilty about crating her dog at night to train him properly and basically let him use the restroom wherever/whenever he wanted in her apartment. When she moved in I told her that I would be happy to train her dog as I did with my boys but that we had to start immediately as I did not want him ruining the house and I was acutely aware that we would have zero time/energy to devote to dog training once the baby was born. She agreed but immediately undermined any efforts I made to train him - she would let him out of the crate during his crate time, get upset at me for reprimanding him (spray bottle squirt, a stern NO, and/or a light tap on the nose), and eventually told me that she would just take care of training him. 

Fast forward to present day. Her dog is not trained at all. He growls at me, has bitten me on two occasions, consistently pees/poops under our bed, peed on our son's playpen a month ago and finally tonight shat in his room at the foot of his crib, waking him up and driving me to post this at 2 AM. I am genuinely worried about our son's health and safety at this point. Her dog is only 10 pounds so his bites didn't do much damage to me but he could absolutely hurt a 7 month old child. On top of that, he's peeing/pooping in areas that our son plays and sleeps. 

I have told her for the last 6 months or so, on a fairly regular basis, that we need to find a new home for him as I'm now completely unable to train him even if she would let me and I still wanted to - between taking care of the baby, my two dogs, the chaos of her night-shift schedule, and me hunting for a new job/getting my Master's & CPA I literally just don't have the ability to. When he woke the baby up tonight it was my final straw. I texted her that I would be bringing him to a no-kill shelter this weekend as she had not put any effort into finding him a new home on her own. She wrote back a few angry things and has now stopped talking to me. 

I absolutely love dogs and animals in general but I'm down to 5 hours of sleep on a good night. I didn't want it to come to this and attempted to get in front of the issue with her by training before the baby came but, as I said, she interceded. At this stage I'm worried that it's driving a wedge between she and I during a time that's already pretty stressful. 

AITA?

&nbsp;

So yesterday, my girlfriend, who is bi but not out to many people, sent me a post about a gay weekend at a ski mountain she’s gone to a few times and was jokingly offended she didn’t get an invitation. I called her “hella gay” and she agreed. In order to continue the joke, I then said that she was dating a man (me) which is pretty fuckin’ straight of her. She said “are you kidding” and then said she didn’t want to talk to me, before actually being unable to talk due to work. 

When she comes back I call her a pet name, and she tells me not to call her that. I apologize, use another, only to be told not to call her anything, to which I apologize again, not only for using pet names when she’s not in the mood but also for previously upsetting her. I do, however, say that I was just trying to make a joke, and she goes into how she thought she could trust me in talking about her sexuality with me and how I have never called her straight as a joke before, and it hurts because while she’s fine with hella gay being that gay is a blanket term, being called straight reminds her of people who say bi people in straight relationships are just straight. I repeat that I was just mocking that behavior, and say that I had previously made the exact joke, and recently. She says she doesn’t remember, so I find a screenshot from the weekend where she said she felt gay and I said “and you find me hot? That’s pretty fuckin’ straight” to no ill effects. She then said “fuck you” and “you always have to be right” before telling me not to talk to her. 

I oblige for a bit, then text her a paragraph of apology which she responds by saying she can’t forgive me until I apologize in person.

1306,Not the A-hole,"Ugh, throw away because I honestly feel ridiculous just for having to ask this, and pretty much everyone I know knows my real username.

Backstory:

Bf's bestie's (I'll call him Bjorn) birthday was last weekend, and we were supposed to go visit (we live about 3.5 hours away). I asked Bf if Bjorn wanted to do an activity I had access to discounted tickets to, and Bjorn was stoked. I bought 4 tickets, one for each of Bjorn, his gf, my bf, and me. 

Last minute-ish, Bjorn and gf let us know that they were sick and asked us to come another weekend. No big deal, people get sick all the time, so we told them so, tentatively planning for the following (this) weekend.

About halfway through the week, bf told me that Bjorn's gf is working and that if I go I may ""feel like the third wheel while the dudes are bro-ing out"". I mean, I get it, its Bjorn's birthday, you don't get to see him much. So I told him (honestly) that I had no problem staying home so he could go hang out with Bjorn and not have to worry about me. We briefly discussed the tickets, and discussed saving them for another trip so the four of us could go together.
 
Edited for clarity: we discussed him going on the 3.5 hour trip without me, which I was absolutely fine with. Afterward we discussed saving the tickets for another visit and they would ""bro-out"" instead.

Today, bf asked me where the tickets were, so he could bring them to use this weekend. I was kind of taken aback and reiterated what I thought our previous agreement was (all using them another time) and he kind of flippantly said we hadn't AGREED to that, and if he can't take the discounted (well... for him, free because I paid for them) tickets, he will pay full price. I told him it wasn't a huge deal and where to find them. 

Later I noticed he took all four tickets and mentioned it. He replied that ""well yeah, in case Bjorn's gf is coming"".

He very distinctly told me there was no way Bjorns gf was going to be around, which was why I had decided not to go. At that point, i excused myself to think because I was frustrated, and wanted to collect my thoughts on whether or not it was justified.

So, AITA for being frustrated that my bf is using these tickets without me? On one hand, they were meant as a gift for Bjorns birthday, but on the other, they were explicitly meant for the four of us to spend together. I'm just feeling kind of... used.

Edit 2: talked to bf. He said when he told me about ""third-wheeling"" he wasn't disinviting me, just ""managing expectations"". Regardless I can't go because we cancelled the dog-sitter, who now has other plans.
I told him he can take two tickets. One for Bjorn, and one for himself. If Bjorns gf ends up going (still not guaranteed, and it sounds like a possibility bf just made up himself?) they can purchase a full-price ticket for her. I will use the other two tickets in the summer when my bestie visits.",44,31,0.93
1307,Not the A-hole,"I am a 25/F. My parents have been divorced since I was two years old. I grew up with two families but never fit into either side of my family. I was always different. No one else was born from both my parents like I was. I’ve known both my step parents for 20 years. 

My dads family is very wealthy and they constantly go on vacation and invite me last minute. I’m never involved in the planning. So therefore I can’t ask off work in time to go. I live three hours away and went to college three hours away from them and they hardly visited me. They always visited my stepmoms son in college who lived ten hours from them. My brothers on that side get BMWs, vacations, concert tickets constantly, nice dinners, etc. 

My mom and my stepdad took my sister and her boyfriend at the time to Cabo last year. I wasn’t even informed they were there until I called them and they told me they were at the time share. I asked my mom what the fuck? And she said sorry I thought you and your sister would fight. I said no. We get along just fine.... I would have paid for the trip if I would have known about it. My mom is a penny pincher when she can be. 

I got so upset at my mom today when she told me that her my stepdad my sister and her new bf are all going on a cruise together. She said she looked for another room but it didn’t work that way in that you couldn’t get a room with just one person instead of a couple. I told her that’s bull. She then told me that it would be weird cause I would be a fifth wheel. I told her again, if it’s about money I will pay. I just want to hangout with my family and feel included since I never felt included my entire life with my family. Fuck. They visit my sister every other weekend for her volleyball tournaments ten hours away and they hardly would drive thirty minutes into town to see me where I live. I planned a dinner date with them earlier last week and my mom tried changing the date of the dinner the day of for some bullshit reason. I told her I wouldn’t cause of work. 

I cried and told her no one ever includes me in anything hardly or seems to see me as anything more than a financial burden so that’s why I tried to separate from my family and be financially independent at a young age cause I didn’t want to bother them any more than I had to. 

I’m a child of divorce and my parents used me as a messenger to discuss issues they had between. I could see at a young age I was an emotional and burden. I didn’t ever speak up about anything ever because I didn’t want to make anyone more uncomfortable or upset because I just knew my existence caused discomfort to my family. 

EDIT: my mom now wants me to go on a trip to cozumel with her but I really just feel like it’s a pity thing 

EDIT: I would talk to my dad about this but he is constantly busy working two jobs so he can make enough money for my stepmom to give to her friends and family. She buys her mom cars. Her nieces dresses and shopping sprees. She is redecorating her friends house for free (it’ll cost HER 3000). My dad makes a decent amount of money but I hardly see it. I resent my stepmom for putting the pressure on my dad to make money to keep up with the joneses because I can’t even talk to my dad for more than five months a week without him having to take a business call. I just want to go on vacation with him alone. He’s the only person who I am like but he’s not present mentally cause he’s so stressed. Plus my stepmom always makes fun of him and it makes me sad because he sacrifices his time and happiness and time with his kids to work so she can get what she wants. When I see him all I want to do are his favorite things because it makes me so happy to see him smile. I also don’t try to ask my dad for money knowing he is already so stressed trying to find her lifestyle and he is too nonconfrontational to say or do anything about it. ",118,395,0.97

1309,Not the A-hole,"I am a librarian at a prek-12 school. I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.

For any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say ""watch your hands!"" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.

One day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, ""LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL."" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.

I told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a ""joke."" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.

I tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?

1310,Not the A-hole,"Hello reddit, I take a lot of pride in making my house look nice. I’m a veteran, so I enjoy using my free time to do gardening, repairs, and general cleaning, especially power-washing.

My house is located right next to a popular hang out spot for teenagers, which I completely understand, they need a place to get away from it all and relax for a bit. The only issue I have is that they cut through my side yard instead of walking around my property which leads to a lot of dead grass from the constant walking.

I understood that it was because it was a lot faster to do so, so over the course of two weeks I transformed the dead area with a nice rock design that allows everyone to walk on top of it instead of destroying the grass.

Just two days after I did that it was vandalized, spray painted with designs and faces. I was upset as I had put in a lot of effort to create a solution for both sides.

But because of this I installed fences all around my property, the results aren’t great as a lot of people badmouth me when they see me outside. Claiming I’m a grouchy old man who doesn’t like teens.

1311,Everyone Sucks,"Alright, this story is kinda old but I still think about the morality of the situation to this day. 


 So, when I was 16 I got kicked out of my house in a little mountain town in Colorado with no phone, no car, and really nowhere to go. Weird situation at home. First thing I did was walk about 5 miles to my brother’s work (a little restaurant) to plead for a job. Started washing dishes 5 minutes later. 

There was one guy that I worked with, super smart but thought he was above “bitch work” (his words not mine). Let’s call him Alex. Of course, he was the one who trained me. I don’t see myself above anything to this day, so I just went with the unreasonable tasks that had obviously never been done before me. As time moved on, this stopped happening and we became friends. I saved up enough money to buy a car which I was living in as that was basically my only option, going to high school, and working full time. I had a girlfriend that I’d stay with maybe twice a week for a warm place to stay/do laundry. 

Now, Alex was super into doing acid (not really my thing but I don’t judge) so his dad kicked him out. He was 19 or 20 at the time, but asked me (still 16) for a place to stay. I arranged a place for us with another friend’s family. 

Just a week before this, I woke up on the morning after Valentine’s Day to see my girlfriend had been cheating on me with multiple guys over Facebook on MY FUCKING PHONE. Tip to the wise: if you do this, make sure to sign out of your account. If I open my phone and see 12 messages over Facebook, I open them without thinking about who’s account I’m using. When guys are telling me about how great “the other night” was, I can put 2 and 2 together pretty quick. 

Anyway, after leaving her ass, I’m now living with Alex basically in a garage. One day while taking a break he showed me a video or something when a message pops up from my ex on the screen. His screen. He claims he was trying to help me blah blah blah so I went with it. I wanted to know for sure if he was sleeping with her and lying to me about it. I wanted a plan to cut ties if that were the case. I waited for my time to strike. And it came HARD. 

To spare the details, I found out through a friend that my fears were true. I felt violated, not only from my cheating gf but from one of my best friends. 

The day of reckoning fell upon me by accident. 

Alex came into the kitchen (at the restaurant) telling me the lockbox, where about 1000 dollars was kept, was easy to get into. He said you can turn the lock without a key and showed me. When my boss came back I told him he needed to replace the lockbox as you didn’t need the key to open it. Of course, he asked me how I knew that and motioned to Alex. Obviously Alex had no explanation so he got fired on the spot along with another friend that was with him. Exactly what I wanted. He knew he was done living with me at that point. 

AITA for getting him fired and making him “homeless” at the same time?

Today, a family friend (who is a CNA, and works 7a-7p+hour drive to and from work) posted on Facebook about needing a babysitter for her almost 3 month old son. The father works 3rd shift in a factory, so he sleeps all day before going back to work at night. 

My mother commented and said that I would do it without even asking me, and only told me afterwards to warn me that the FF would be messaging me about it. At first I was a little annoyed, but then my grandmother (who is much closer with this family) called me to inform me about the hours she works, and also that they’re really struggling for money so they’re probably going to pay me nickels and dimes—if they even pay me at all. 

I was slightly more annoyed. 

Then FF messaged me and we talked about it. I’d be watching her son from 6am-8pm 4 days in a row out of every week. The most she could offer to pay me was $10 a day, and even that would really tighten their budget. That’s roughly 71 cents an hour. 14 hours of babysitting a day, 4 days in a row out of every week—for $40 a week? Yeah... no. 

I feel bad telling her no, but the idea of juggling a newborn, a less-than-one-yo, and a 5 year old autistic child terrifies me. Plus, how am I ever going to fit 3 car seats in my vehicle? I drive a truck. Two infant seats and a booster seat in one  back bench is not feasible, or safe.

I confronted my mom about her offering up my services without my consent. We got into a fight. She says I’m cruel for not helping out a struggling family, and I should’ve been willing to do it for free. FF is upset, so is her husband. 

AITA for confronting my mom for offering me up for jobs without even asking me, and refusing to do the work she offered me up for?

TL;DR: I babysit for my parents, just a 5yo at the moment—soon to be a newborn as well. Mom offered me up to babysit a friend’s 2/3mo without asking. They want to pay me $40 for 56 hours of babysitting per week. ",41,126,0.99
1313,Not the A-hole,"""Cindy"" and I have known each other for over a year and been dating for about two months.  we are not quite bf/gf but we've slept together. We are not fwb because I think we're more intimate than that.  She works at an entry level job in finance that doesn't pay much. I, on the other hand, am relatively well off compared to her. She is estranged from her parents and refused any help from them and her relatives are barely getting by so she is on her own financially. Every month after rent, car payment, and other expenses she has barely any savings left.
She is very motivated to take the CFA exam but doesn't have enough money to pay for the registration. The last thing I want to see is someone I cared about not fulfill her career potential due simply to not having an extra $1,000 laying around, so I paid for the exam for her. I noticed that she's been really stressed out lately and it turns out studying for the exam plus lack of savings is really getting to her. I found out she only eat one meal a day, she said it's to keep her figure but I think it's also because she simply can't afford to eat more. I also found out she is studying for the exam by only reading the text books and watching lectures on youtude - serious test takers would supplement their study with notes, exam videos, practice exams, and access to questions bank from say, Schweser. So I pay $2,000 to buy her the materials plus sign her up for the exam prep classes. On top of that, I also pay for her rent ($1,000) for one month hoping to de-stress her from her financial situation and help her focus on her study. Which, to her credit, she has been studying very hard for, from what I can gather.
Now, I'm not the only one who noticed her stress. To help her, her bff is flying with her to a beach town for a long weekend getaway (Cindy said she will be bringing her books). Now, here is the thing: her bff comes from a very rich family and is paying for her plane ticket but they are going to split the airbnb. Bff also likes to live it up, she booked a tri-level townhouse by the beach just for the two of them. The cost for three nights comes out to just over $2,000. 
Cindy texted me about how expensive it is and how she can't afford to pay for it but she really wants to go. I get the feeling that she wants me to cover the tab. I texted her back that it doesn't make me feel good when after I covered her rent and exam expenses that she turnaround and splash $1,000 on three nights in a luxury Airbnb.
She replied that she won't go. But then after one day, she said she will go and if I won't pay for it then she will find someone else or another means to do so. She said she is accustomed to certain luxury because 1) she is a germaphobe (this is true) and the townhouse is clean to her standard (not sure how she'd know that). 2) her ex is rich (also true) and spend money on luxury and on her so she is used to having nice things.
I refuse to do it.  AITA for not paying for her hot vacation pad?",37,24,0.85
1314,Asshole,"My parents have announced to my sister and I they are selling the family house to go into early retirement. It's something I'm a bit upset about, my sister kind of is but won't directly say it as she's worried she'll appear ungrateful. I haven't said anything to my parents about being upset and probably won't as I doubt I'll be able to change their mind and don't want to ruin our relationship.

For ages, I'm 30, my sister is 26 and my parents are 60.

Some background as to why I'm upset. My parents are reasonably well off, solid middle class, not upper or lower. They bought their house when they were a couple of years younger than me and got significant support from my grandparents on my mom's side to do it. They didn't really need that support and used the money they saved to do a bunch of traveling around the world. My Grandparent's told me if I went through university (which I did) they would do the same for me and help my buy a house, my mom knew about this and mentioned it as an incentive to do uni. My cousins were also told the same thing. 

Unfortunately my grandparents passed away while I was studying and my mom and her sister got all the inheritence, my grandparents didn't leave a will. My Aunt used that to support my cousins in buying their houses, my parents used it to renovate their house. When I asked whether I would get the same support as my cousins my mom shut it down and said it was her inheritance and she could choose what she wants to do with it.

My parents didn't support myself or my sister in purchasing a house at all, and unfortunately house prices in my country have exploded so my current house is significantly worse than what my parents bought 35 years ago at 20x the price, same for my sister. 

Our family home was in a town that become a resort town so property prices boomed, both my sister and I had to move away. We were hoping one day we would inherit the house like my parents inherited their grandparents and use it as a family holiday house that my sister and I could take our children to.

Instead my parents are selling so they can move into one of those pricey retirement resorts, they'll likely burn through their money and leave nothing to my sister and I. Having researched the place it's even likely that once they run out of money they'll be evicted and my sister and I will have to pay for an actual retirement home in their old age.

I guess I'm upset because they aren't giving my sister and I the same advantages they got from their parents, it feels like they are taking for granted what they got and think we don't need it.

TLDR; Parents are selling their house to retire early to a fancy retirement resort, got a load of money from their parents/my grandparents that got them to this in the first place and aren't passing anything along to my sister and I.

EDIT: Since people aren't reading it: Grandparents said they would help my sister and I buy houses, passed away before they could, parents used their inheritance on renovations and travel and didn't help us, my Aunt used hers to help her children (cousins) buy houses. Aunt has expressed disappointment to me about what my parents did.",546,645,0.93
1315,No A-holes here,"So this definitely needs context. I’m not one to get upset with my fiancé for not texting back quickly or returning a call immediately, because we’ve been together for 7 years, we have a kid, and things are normally pretty great with us. We’re 22 and he’s always let me know what he’s doing, where he’s going, if he’s going to be late, etc. even when we were in high school. I can’t recall a time before this where he didn’t answer me or let me know what was going on. We both go out on our own and do this for each other, and it’s always been an unspoken rule between us to let the other know. And if our phones are dead, we call from a friend’s or even the store’s/bar’s/whatever else’s phone. We’ve both experienced a lot of loss, so it’s understandable to both of us that it’s important to know where the other is at and if they’re okay. 

Today, he had a friend over to look at his friend’s broken down truck (towed it to our house). He then had to take said friend home, which should have been about a 20 minute trip. 

Anyway, after about 30 minutes I called him to pick up milk and toilet paper on his way back. No answer. I texted him to let him know. 

After an hour, he still hadn’t answered me or read the text. He usually calls back if he misses my call, and he usually lets me know if he’s staying later at someone’s house than he first intended to. That’s never been a big deal to me because he *always lets me know*. 

After about 1 1/2 hours, he still wasn’t answering me. I started to get genuinely concerned. I was nervous he got in an accident because it isn’t at all like him to not answer or at least let me know what is going on. We live in northern Michigan and the likelihood of an accident is pretty high in March. So I called him about 3 more times. Now would also be a good time to mention that we recently had a very close friend die, due to road conditions and no seatbelt (and my guy ALWAYS forgets his seatbelt). 

I started worrying something bad had actually happened, so I called his friend who he was taking home. His friend also didn’t answer (which is also weird). I called my guy again a couple of times, with no answer. I left voicemails and texted him to call me.. and eventually I told him to just answer his fucking phone because I was worried. 

It turns out, nothing bad happened. They both just didn’t pay attention to their phones and lost track of time. But when he got back home, he told me I was freaking out over nothing and for no reason (which, technically, it *was nothing* and I had no reason to freak out). But I explained to him I panicked, because of our friend recently losing his life, and that it was unlike him to not answer me. He’s insisting that I’m overreacting, and that I should just trust him. I told him it isn’t that I didn’t trust him to be where he said- because that honestly didn’t even cross my mind. I was just worried because a 20 minute trip turned into over 2 hours and I had no idea what was happening. 

AITA for this? 

EDIT: I don’t *actually* think he is a legitimate asshole for this isolated incident. I just didn’t know what other sub to use. Asshole is a term I use quite loosely, and I realize he’s still a good guy and this isn’t an argument to make me question my relationship or anything. Really it should be “am I justified for being upset” ",54,63,0.9
1316,Not the A-hole,"I apologize in advance for any spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.

Ok, I hired a new maid a month ago and since then she fucked up countless times: she forgot my windows open when I wasn't around (I live in an area with a lot of insects, spiders and scorpions), she insists in making food in ways different than what I ask (and when confronted she says ''but it's better for you''), she protests when I don't want to eat making huffing sounds and saying ''oh God...'', she burned my pants while ironing them, she insists that she doesn't eat anything in my house and doesn't even drink water (despite me saying she should have lunch and yada yada) but I noticed she has been taking food behind my back, like my expensive bread or dried apricot (it wouldn't be a problem if she asked), she keeps putting dishes that are still dirty in the cabinets and when I ask her to be more careful she says ''I need glasses'' and laughs, she talks to me like I'm a baby and asks me things that are way too personal (such as ''was your boyfriend the one who took your virginity?'' or ''How old were you when you lost it?''), besides giving her opinion on EVERYTHING, the other day she literally said ''your boyfriend is cheating on you, no one in a LDR isn't being cheated on''.

So, WIBTA for firing her without notice? Her husband has a stable job after all.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I thought some info was blurry, so here we go... This maid was hired to take care of my grandma's house, she asked and she's paying for it (so no, I'm not some spoiled brat). I live somewhere else and my grandma can't be at home right now, between my job and my own home I don't have time to clean both places, do everyone's laundry and etc... I didn't tell my grandma about what has been happening because I know she will get in a fight with the maid and  be rude, I wanted to avoid that and politely let her go.

EDIT 2: The latest fuck up... Today I went grocery shopping, she called me at 12 am asking me if she could leave cause she was done with the house (her hours are from 9 am to 5 pm), I asked her to wait at least until I got there to help me with the groceries. She asked me if the groceries were going to my house, I said only part of them, so she should put them in the cabinets and I would decide later. SHE SIMPLY LEFT THE BAGS ON THE FREAKING TABLE and said: ''I left it there cause it's easier'', fired her on the stop, thanks you guys so much for the support.",32,46,0.91
1317,Not the A-hole,"Alright so a little bit of a backstory here. Coming from an Asian background, my father always was a strict individual. He is also known to have a short temper, having random outburst over the littlest things you can imagine.(One incident that I will never forget is he had a mental breakdown when I made a small mistake at a Supermarket self-checkout).

When I was 12, he decided to bring me to Australia to live with him. (I'm originally from Taiwan, and for the most part lived with my Mum's side of the family)

So growing up, I had to endure his mental outbursts and verbal abuses. This has affected me in many ways, most notability my self esteem. I've no longer trust my gut, I've become soft spoken (every time when I try to voice an opinion, he shuts it down and accuses me of talking back to him) I'm just like a different person than I was before.

&#x200B;

Fast forward 15 years, I'm finally getting married to the love of my life. A lot has happened since, but here's an overview.

\- I didn't have the best high school/college/university life. I was a shut in, suffering from depression etc etc

\- At one point after getting my degree, I was struggling to find a job that is relevant to what I was studying

\- I decided to work several jobs concurrently in the meantime.

\- I moved out of the house after having a heated argument with my father. I was 23 when this happened.

After moving out I changed my mobile number and cut out contact with my father. I've told myself that I no longer want anything to do with him. It was a struggle at first trying to make ends meet but I managed and was lucky enough to meet my lovely fiance who supports me like no one else.

Now back to the present, I'm finally getting married and I've sent invitations to my mum and friends. Mum told me that she will let Dad know but I was adamant not to invite him.

Today, I received a call from my dad for the first time in 5 years, congratulating me whilst asking me about the invitation of the wedding. The moment I hear his voice, a chain of emotions starts to overwhelm me. Tears rapidly dropped and I can feel a mixture of hate and resentment. I know the sacrifices hes done for me in the past, but I just can't get over the emotional abuse and depression that were caused by him.

I hung up the phone without replying to him, I also blocked his number. Mum called me after saying that Dad is tearing up and really wants to be part of the wedding. I straight up said no, saying that I've put up enough of his abusive nature, he will not be invited and is not welcomed. I also gave my mum an ultimatum, if she was to bring my dad to the wedding, she will be kicked out and that is will be the last of our relationship.

Obviously I'm filled with rage right now and I'm trying to think rationally.

So redditors, AITA here?

Traditionally, I jam a water bottle in the gap between my tray table and the seat so that the recline mechanism doesn't work to prevent the person in front of me from spending the flight in my lap. It's perfect because it gives them about half an inch of recline and then stops, so generally they just assume that's all the chair does and stop trying after a few pushes.

She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. 

She immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. 

I told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me.

She then asked me ""So why aren't you vegan?"" and I responded with ""Because I don't want my friends and family to see me as a self-righteous snob.""

1325,Not the A-hole,"I am in an lgbtq support group in my church. It’s very small, mostly my gay friends (females) and myself (a gay female). There is a transgender woman who joined our group, and obviously we were accepting to her and even though she is 20 years older than most of us. we are all in our early twenties and she is 41. She has only been out as transgender for a year, and she does not pass as female. She is 6 foot 4 and very strong. She wears clothes that are too small for her, to where she is quite literally bursting out of them. She is very straight forward and has an aggressive personality. Let’s call her RD. 
The next week at church, we were in our safety group. One of the leaders passed out prayer request cards for us to write something we are struggling with and give it to someone in the group. RD wrote hers down, and gave it to my friend who we can call A. I overheard an awkward conversation between the two of them but it wasn’t until after church A told me that RD had written her phone number and a note saying “You’re cute, text me” with a winky face. RD also told me that she overheard my parents saying that her and I should date so that “The man inside of her can be released and maybe it’ll scare the gay out of me” which I know is a lie. My parents would never say that. I reached out to our leaders because I felt that it was inappropriate. They told me to reach out to RD myself. I did. 
I told her she was making us feel comfortable with the lying and the forced conversations, as well as making A feel very targeted because she was expecting an innocent prayer request, yet it turned into a cornered awkward situation. She apologized and said she did not mean to make anyone feel uncomfortable. I suggested we strictly talk at the group and not outside of it for now.. 
The next week, A was discussing her love for poetry and writing slam poems. Days later, RD found her on Facebook and sent her a love poem. I decided that since RD wouldn’t listen to me, I would reach out to her mentor. Her mentor said she would discuss it with her.
3 days later, A’s twin sister G told me that RD has written on her Facebook wall about how trans women are always being targeted as predators and some more unwanted nonsense in the post. I messaged RD. 
Me- I’m not looking to get into a huge argument over text because that is childish. But there are a few things that I have fact checked and know you are lying about. My parents never said those things about us dating. And you posted on G’s page. We asked you not to. 
RD- You called me a liar!! Trans women are constantly being threatened for just existing. I’m fucking done! You and the twins can go to hell!

This brings us to last week, I was just getting off work and I stopped by the bar on my way home to grab a beer. At the bar I ran into Jane and her roommates, they were celebrating her roommate getting a promotion at work. Jane invited me to join them and I obliged.  After a while her roommates wanted to go to another bar and Jane said she wanted to go back home and invited me to go back to her place to smoke. I agreed and when we go back to her house. When we got to her place, she kissed me, and we end up sleeping together. 


I don’t know if Jane told John or how he found out so fast but the next evening I got a call from john and he was really angry at me calling me an asshole and telling me that I don’t respect him and that I did this to hurt him. Then he asked me what my intentions were with Jane. I told him that I didn’t mean for him to get hurt and that I didn’t know what if I was going to pursue anything more with Jane that we were drunk, and it just happened. He hasn’t talked to me since.

One on hand I can understand why john is so angry and hurt but on the other he has liked Jane for years and she does not feel the same way about him. If something was going to happen between them, it would have happened already. I kind of feel like Jane and I had a real connection and want to see where this goes but I also don’t want to lose a close friend over this. So, am I the asshole for sleeping with my friends crush?
 
Edit: 
I just talked to Jane. One of Jane's roommate took Snapchat of all of us that night and John saw it. He called Jane and asked why I was out with them. She told him we ran into each other. Apparently he's known she has liked me for a while now ( I had no idea) and he asked if anything happened between us and she told him yes.  He freaked out on her worse than me. He has been sending her melodramatic messages all week.

1334,No A-holes here,"It sounds bad, but hear me out. I love my husband sooo much, he is the highlight of my life and I totally understand why he thinks it’s important that I wear a ring. 
We have had REALLY bad luck with wedding rings. We’ve been married 2 years now, and have gone through two rings already. 

The first we found out it was fake and it started to rust. It was super scratchy and uncomfortable so we went out and bought a new one.

We bought the second one about 4 months ago from JC Penny. It was $2500 and he declined the warranty. 
The diamonds are now falling out like crazy. It my opinion it honestly looks horrible and they just keep falling out the more I wear it. I suggested we have it fixed, but really if they are going to just continue to fall out there’s really no point in replacing the ones that have already fallen out.

I tried calling JC penny and they literally told me “too bad, that really sucks but we can’t help you. You should have came in earlier”.  I told them they didn’t start falling out until just recently and once again I got the whole “too bad so sad” spiel from them. 

I talked with my husband about it and he said I should just wear it and we will buy a new one in a couple years. He got mad when I told him I don’t really want to wear it because I think it looks bad. He said it would make him feel better if I just wear it anyways.

Am I the asshole for not wanting to wear it? 

Thank you! 

Edit; thank you to everybody for your opinions! I think getting something like a plain band to wear in the meantime is a great idea!! We should have gotten the ring from an actual jeweler, and definitely gotten the warranty (lesson learned!).
I’ll have to talk to him when he gets home about picking up a cheap band. We are trying not to spend any money right now (currently waiting on a diagnosis that could end up being really spendy, so we’re trying to brace ourselves). I think this is going to be the best solution,
Thank you again everybody!! ",125,424,0.98
1335,Not the A-hole,"So my fiance and I are getting married in December. I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)

A family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says ""Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family."" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom.

I commented back, ""He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.""

I took it as ""So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.""

I am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said?

1336,Not the A-hole,"So, a little bit of background. My mother and my stepdad recently purchased a property in my city, where my mother plans on living in a tiny house. However, in addition to the tiny house, she would need a permanent address, as well as a place to do laundry, shower and store her things. Also, when it gets too cold in the winter she would live there. So, my parents have been looking for a suitable place (it ought to be ideally freshly renovated) for a really low price. So far they haven't had much luck.

Today my mother called me to make me an ""offer"". She wants to come to my place to shower and do laundry 3x a week and live here a maximum of 2 months per year. In exchange, she wants to give me her expensive new living room furniture and a new kitchen, (which are things she insits on having in my flat, even though I have a kitchen and furniture which I would have to throw out). Also, because my flat is not up to her standards, she wants to renovate it (put in new tiles, paint etc.). Now, we did not intend on renovating the flat and also don't need furniture, however in exchange for these things she would like to have my bf's current bedroom rent free for the first 9 months and then pay 50% at the beginning of next year.

Now, if my bf and I had intended to renovate the flat and needed new furniture this would be a great deal, but honestly living in a pile of rubble for months while they renovate my flat and then having my mother come live with us for two months in the winter just doesn't strike me as a good deal. My bf and I love living alone, since this is the first time we are able to live without additional roommates. Also our flat is quite small and my mother does not work, which means in the winter she might be here for two months constantly. She also wants to bring her cat, who is used to being outside 12 hours a day, and she can't go outside where we live.

I thought my parents would understand that the deal they were offering me just wasn't that good for me. Yes, the furniture is expensive but I don't need expensive furniture and I can live in this flat without fresh paint on the walls. However, when I told them no just now they said that they were ""extremely disappointed"", because they apparently thought I would jump at this offer. Now, I feel like I am being harsh telling them that I don't want to live with my mother, even if it is only two months a year tops. So AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT: So, a few people asked why she can't have a shower in her tiny house. The property she purchased is in a garden community. It is only meant to be a garden, which means there is no sewage there. She could probably figure out how to have a shower without gas, but without sewage, the water wouldn't have anywhere to go. ",110,286,0.98

1340,Not the A-hole," 

Sorry for the Jeremy Kyle style title but I really didn't know how else to put it. Also sorry if the format is bad I'm on mobile

Background info: my dad has never been around much. He was until I was 6 but then he got a new wife and a new kid (F) and I basically saw him once a month, then once every few months.

 I had a fairly unstable childhood, my mother is amazing but has had bad luck with men and jobs and as a result of this plus my dad's abandonment I had some major behavioural and mental health issues growing up. My mum was always there for me but my dad just used it as an excuse not to see me. The real kicker is he broke up with his second wife so my brother F is from a similar broken family situation, yet my dad has always been there for him, has him every weekend without fail, buys clothes and games and whatever he wants. He also had two more sons, T and H, from a new wife (A) whom he is a perfect father to.

He's been slightly better with calling me lately but it's still only once every two months or so. We have a slightly better relationship than when I was a kid, which is why the following events hurt me as I was beginning to think we could maybe repair our relationship.

So the current situation is this: a few weeks ago A posted a pic of F, T and H on fb and I commented 'I have the cutest lil bros!'. A pretty harmless comment. Anyway I saw the post a while later and she'd deleted the comment. I thought this was weird but oh well, maybe I didn't actually post it or she deleted it by accident or something.

Anyway last night I decided to do a little test, she posted a pic of T and H pulling faces and I commented 'crazy kids... you can tell they're my brothers!' Anyway an hour later and the comment was gone. I screenshotted it so I know it was definitely posted.

I've had a feeling for a while that a lot of people in my dad's life don't know about me. He's literally asked me to go upstairs and 'watch F play fortnite for a bit' when his friend popped by before. Anyway I saw this as proof, and so I confronted them about it.

Sure enough they confirm they deleted my comment because ""some people in A's extended family and some friends don't know about you and we don't want them finding out over fb"". I ask why it matters how they find out and why I'm something he's never mentioned. He claims I'm taking it out of context and that it shouldn't matter to me as I 'barely see him'.

He then begins having a go at me for posting the comment, saying I was 'starting drama' and being manipulative.

AITA? Should I not have posted the comment? Am I overreacting?

UPDATE: Thanks for all the positive comments guys, I really appreciate it. We had a long, serious conversation last night and I think I finally got through to him that he needs to sort something out, or he's gonna lose me. I've told him I need space to consider my options and I'm going to talk to friends/family/my therapist to figure out how to proceed from here.

1344,Everyone Sucks,"I fly frequently - three or more times per month - with an airline not always know for the friendliest customer service. I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I’m not upgraded.

Last night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).

So before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn’t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.

This announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. 

I needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.

When I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).

She proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I’d had a long and difficult work day and didn’t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say “thank you for telling me” and walked away.

She proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said “it’s extremely rude to walk away from people when they’re talking to you, don’t you think?”

At this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. 

AITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I’ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don’t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.

TL;DR: Used the “wrong bathroom,” got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,

EDIT: Thanks all - super interesting opinions in the comments, and fascinating how divided people seem to be. I think it’s safe to say that we both made some iffy decisions, and it’s always better to ask first.  

I’m headed to my third of six flights this week soon, so I’ll get lots of chances to practice using the bathroom without pissing anyone off.

EDIT #2: This doesn’t matter much, but I am a woman. Only mentioning because it’s getting confusing reading all of the comments mentioning “her” and realizing they’re about the FA, not myself. *Either way - interesting how philosophical this post has become. Thank you all for your opinions.*

EDIT #3: Wasn’t gonna update but some of y’all have skin in the game. I ended up reporting the situation. The airline apologized and issued some award miles (which for the record I didn’t ask for).",598,946,0.96

1346,Not the A-hole,"About 8 months ago I was living in my hometown 2.5 hours away from my girlfriend. She quite literally begged me to move in with her, but I didn't want to give up the job I had making and saving money while living at home for free. She persisted, and said I could live with her rent free, as well. Knowing this would lead to resentment, I pointed out how it might be troublesome. Nevertheless, she convinced me and I packed up my things and moved. I started working at a convenient store making minimum wage to try and save money toward the next lease we actually were signing together. After a few months, she demanded I pay some rent. We fought about it a little, but I ultimately decided to pay her 100 bucks a month out of her 550. 

2 months have gone by, and now I'm not paying enough rent - she wants more than 100 (her initial request). I also split groceries with her and dog food for our 2 dogs. Now, as I mentioned before, I'm working for minimum wage and part time while I look for a job. If I could get more hours at the store, I would, but there are others who work there full time and I can't take their hours as a newbie.

Anyway, today she wants to break up because of the resentment built from me not paying enough rent. She has asked me to give up all my vices in order to pay her more while she is about to go on her 3rd roundtrip flight trip in the last 365 days. I can't pay more, yet she says I'm taking advantage of her. I think I'm the one being taken advantage of, though. Apparently she has asked her friends and parents, and they all agree I'm an asshole.

1348,Not the A-hole,"I work as a cashier and cashiers always get the blame for company policy.  At the store I work at sends out text promotions occasionally to people who sign up with the text club.  The deal on this day was 2 lobster tails for $5 with a limit of two.  Lobster is super expensive so two for $5 is an amazing deal.

People often come in and try a variety of different thing to get around coupon limits, splitting their order into two, having their kids pay for it at a different line, coming in a second time that day.  In cashier training our managers tell us all these ways people try to get around the limits and tells us that if we catch someone doing it we should not let them do so.

The second order on my shift I run into a problem.  A mom and her kid come to my line and I notice that not only did they split their order into two, they actually split it into three.  I let the first two slide since ""Two lobster tails for $5 (Limit 2)"" could be interpreted as 2 orders of two lobster tails.  Once I got to the third order however, I told them that the coupon says limit of two.

Mom: ""Yes, but I split it into three orders""

Me: ""Ma'am, according to company policy I can not let you have the coupon for this order.  I can scan it through at the normal price for you however.""

Mom: ""Look, I'm shopping for my disabled mother who can not leave the house so the coupon is really for her.""

Me: ""Unfortunately, in order for the coupon to be redeemed I would need her to be present with her own code.""

Mom: ""What do you not understand about she can't leave the house? Just let me have the lobster tails.""

Me: ""Ma'am, I'm sorry but I can't go against company policy.""

Mom: ""Well, I'll just leave and come back in then.""Me: ""Feel free two ma'am, but if I recognize you I still wont give you the deal.""

Mom: ""Just give me the deal, because I can always just leave and come back.""

Me: ""Ma'm, if you leave and come back and I don't see you there is nothing I can do, but for now I can't scan it at the deal price.""

(At this point I turn on my flashing light, which notifies the managers in the area that I need help)

Mom: ""You scanned the first two orders, just scan the third one, my mother is disabled and she can't leave the house""

(My manager walks by and I get her attention)

Manager: Is there something wrong?

Me: ""Yes, this customer split their order into three to avoid the coupon limit""

Mom: ""Look, my mom is at home and we need to bring the lobster tails home for dinner tonight, it says limit of two, so two for my son, two for me, and two for my mom""

Manager: ""Ma'am, this time I'll scan the lobster tails, but I want to make it clear that this is a one time exception.""

It was just a few weeks prior where my wife told me: “ *Yes, I expect you to fix things around the house, mow the lawn, and take care of the ca*r”

&#x200B;

Fast-forward to last night:

&#x200B;

My wife says to me after I come home from work and have dinner:   “*How about you do the dishes tonight*?”I said to her: ""*No,   I want to relax for a little bit. I help sometimes on the weekend with  those things, too,  but you are expected to do these things -  at least  during the week*.""

Well, let's just say ALL HELL broke lose after that comment!

\*\*\***Yes,  I will admit that I recalled the conversation we had just had two weeks  prior, and I was saving it to make a point at a later time..  which  happened to be last night**\*\*\*

My wife said,: “ *How could  you ever speak to me that way!?* *You're JUST like your father!*  ( gee, never heard that one before)  *You're a male chauvinist pig that expects the women to do ALL of the house work!!*

I cut her off

“*Wait one cotton- picking -minute here*  ( I like to joke at inappropriate times, and I did not think it had to be an argument )  *WHY was it ok for YOU to  tell me that I'M expected to mow the lawn, fix things in the house, and take care of the car,  but the moment I tell YOU what YOU are expected to do,it becomes some problem where I'm a chauvinist pig*??  *I'm  the one working a full time income job, and when I'm working, I expect  you to take care of the things women have been doing for generations...    WHY is that such a problem for you and so many women these days??*

She then stops talking about that exact part of the conversation and starts telling me how  "" I *went off on her all of a sudden, just because I was having a bad day*”

At that point, yes I started to become annoyed.. so I  just walked away.

She then started crying about the argument.

So  I come back in -   but when I tried to talk to her about it ,   we  could not discuss the point I was trying to make, we could only discuss  how poorly I made her feel and how we are always arguing ( not really  true, I feel it is fairly normal .. maybe more than some,  but I'm sure a  lot less than plenty of others)

In any case... I gave in.  (I KNOW that when she avoids any points I make that she MUST know deep inside that I have a point)

But, AITA here?

EDIT:  I'm the only one currently working a paying job.  ( I do consider her working in the house a job.. I'm definitely not saying it is not work, because it is)

EDIT2:   Look, this is just my opinion,  but it sure feels like there is a serious double-standard going on.  A lot of people are focusing on what I said my expectations are,  but they simply glossed over that my wife has expectations for me. 

I have no problem that women think men should mow the lawn, fix things in the house, take care of car, etc.  NO PROBLEM!   So why do women have such a problem when men have expectations for things women have been doing for a Loooog time!

Look, maybe I just do not understand the younger generation.  But, well, this generation is failing at marriage at a higher rate, or not getting into a serious relationship at all,  so perhaps it is my problem speaking to a generation that is not very good at keeping a marriage together.

And, if you want to judge our relationship on one argument and believe that that is how are relationship must be , you're all sadly mistaken.  

I don't belittle my wife,  put myself before her.. etc. etc.  We BOTH put our kids #1 and each other before ourselves. PERIOD!    That does not mean arguments and disagreements do not occur, because they most certainly do.  We always work through them and we ALWAYS come out stronger. 

I think you guys are going to have HUGE problems if you think roles should be interchangeable. I really do!  Life and marriage is complicated enough,  and now you people want to confuse things even more??

Last year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc...

She is struggling with cancer now, which is obviously a really horrible thing. And I expressed my concern for her and how I was here if she needed a shoulder. Or anything. 

Yesterday  she messages me asking for £20 to get her prescription. This doesn't sound right with me. 
1) in the UK prescriptions cost less than £10 to collect. But I'm also fairly certain if you have cancer you don't have to pay for prescriptions. 
2) she borrowed a similar amount a few years back, I'm unsure exactly on if I got it back. So don't want to focus on that too much incase I'm mistaken. 
3) it starts me thinking how much she sounded like she might be on something last night on the phone. And I know she's had quite a coke habit in the past, and also spent a lot of time on large doses of tramadol. 

I replied explaining that I'd lent my sister rent money this month, and was struggling to support myself and my fiance until payday (as he is waiting to start a new position). 

I feel like an asshole though. I have £20. I could lend her it. What if I'm being way too presumptuous? AITA?

Edit: thanks for your replies guys, you've reassured me! I've also messaged said friend casually and asked why she doesn't get free prescriptions. Gently gonna probe about this (offer to get the free prescriptions sorted for her) and see what she responds with. I'm getting ever more suspicious of her unfortunately. Also, spoke to my Mom, she doesn't remember me being paid back last time (my memory is bad from medication, so I figured asking a second party was a good call with that).",70,196,0.95

1360,Not the A-hole,"Long story short. Last December my mother in-law had a breakdown over finances and tried  to take her own life.
The doctors said she couldn't live by herself anymore so my wife put her mothers apartment to rent and bring the stuff that was there to our home.
She got to leave the hospital in the end of January and has been living with us ever since.
(The uber ride home was awkward to say the least, she was heavily drugged and among other stuff she told the driver ""I haven't seen a dick in years. My daughter is into BBC, she's married to that nigger over there"" i don't have a problem with the word and she was obviously high. But the look of pity the driver gave me definitely stung )
I was not trilled to the prospect of her movin in
But given the circumstances i had no choice.
I do my best to be nice and make her feel wellcome.
But I'm not happy, not at all, i don't feel home anymore, i don't want to break my wifes heart by telling her all this. Leaving the house at this point would do more harm than good to all involved.
I do voice my problems with my brother in law coming in an out the house (hes a few years older than my wife, the reason for the financial problems is he constantly beggin his mother for money she don't have) i kick him out the house once and haven't seen him ever since.
He still calls everyday, that kinda irkes me, bui i'll keep my mouth shut as long as he doesn't shows up while i'm home.

1361,No A-holes here,"A few weeks ago my beloved dog was diagnosed with a condition which made her protein levels drop. She was being treated by the bet and medication. 

Last weekend I co-hosted a 60th birthday party for my Mom ( it was planned before dog got sick). She lives about 3 hours away from me. I was a little concerned about my dog but she seemed to be doing better so I packed up my kids and left for the weekend.

My husband did not want me to go (for many reasons) but mainly the dog as sick. He was home with her all weekend. Although he was kind of pissed at me for going “ against his wishes”. 

The kids and I were going to head home on Sunday morning but a big snow storm prevented that, so we stayed an extra day.

On Sunday night my husband calls me and informs me that our dog died, I was heartbroken but my husband was just angry that I wasn’t there. 

I drive home Monday morning feeling awful  and listening to two heartbroken kids cry about the loss.
We get home and my husband unloads on me- “
I told you not to go, you’re selfish for leaving me here to deal with this alone, the kids should have been here” (he really loved the dog too). We get into an argument and he’s still pissed at me.

So am I the asshole for going to the pre-planned party  while my dog was sick or is my husband the asshole
for getting angry?

1362,No A-holes here,"Every single time my mum has friends over she talks to them about how great a pianist I am and insists that I play her favourite song (interstellar theme) for her and her company. At first I thought it was sweet that she was proud of me so I happily played, however recently it feels like she has an ulterior motive. 

Instead of enjoying the music itself it feels like my mother just wants to flaunt me in front of her friends. I feel used in the sense that mum puts me up on a pedestal as if to say ‘look at what my son can do, what can your children do’. The main reason I feel this way is because she rarely asks me to play when nobody else is around and the parading manner in which she talks about me feels gross. 

So tonight, I got home late from university, was pretty tired and didn’t really feel like appeasing her by playing for her company. She playfully requested for me to play multiple times to which I politely declined, multiple times, until I just straight up ignored her request and continued to walk to my room. Feel kinda guilty, she was pretty upset. AITA?

Update: 

Slept on it and had a chat with my mum this morning. She understood where I was coming from and said she wouldn’t pressure me as hard to play in front of her friends and that she was sorry about last night as she could tell I was tired and put me in an awkward situation. Explained that I didn’t mind playing in front of people just wanted it to feel more organic (even just ask me how my day was first instead of hey op can you play piano for us) and that I want the opportunity to simply say no. I think things will be better now and that I’ll be less frustrated if she asks again because she understands how it makes me feel and I understand how happy it makes my mother.

1363,Not the A-hole,"My brother lost custody of his two children and his ex lost custody of the other two as well.  So my mom is raising four children, only two of which actually are biologically related to us. My mother lives in the projects, can barely pay her bills, and is mentally and physically abusive to these children on occasion.  I spoke with DCS and they said, “Hitting a child in the face doesn’t necessarily constitute abuse.” So there’s that.  However, my brother who has been six years sober is attempting to regain custody of his two.  He isn’t necessarily able to get the youngest two as they aren’t biologically his.  My youngest niece is seven. Again she’s not biologically mine but she’s been my niece since she was born.  She lived with me when she came home from the hospital along with her mother. Anyway, she told me recently multiple times that she wanted to live with me because her sister (11) beats her up all the time and tells her she’s unwanted.  My sweet seven year old niece told me that’s terrified that her biological dad (an abusive sex offender) will come steal her away because that’s what her sister tells her. And that her real mom and dad don’t love her and that’s why they don’t see her, all because my biological niece tells her this. 

I asked my mother if I could adopt her. I live in a different state. I’m in the military and I have two children on my own. My reasons were to get her away from her abusive sister and my abusive mother, to offer her a home with a mother and a father in it, and to give her something that she doesn’t think was given out of obligation, something that nobody can ever take away.  

My mother screamed and cussed me when we talked about this. “How dare you try to take her Way from me.” The evidence for how much better quality of life can b me for a child with a mother and a father is staggering, but my mother wouldn’t hear anything.   

tl;dr - I want to adopt my niece because my mother is a crazy person.  She said I’m an asshole for suggesting it.  ",30,31,0.85

1367,Not the A-hole,"You will have to excuse the formatting I am doing this on mobile and it's my first post. Now this 'story' is a bit old but sometimes I still get caught up in wondering if I was an asshole or not and I figured I should get some unbiased views from the am I the asshole community.

Now, my (f17) parents got divorced when I was 12 and custody of me and my two younger siblings (f15 and m13) was split 50 50 so we spend one week at one house and the next week at the other. 

My dad has been dating this woman, let's call her Y for about three and a half years. This took place last summer so they had been dating for around 3 years. Y and I originally got on when my dad introduced us but as soon as she moved in to our house we started to butt heads more and more. (Just small things, ask me if curious)

Sorry for all this excess information and the way my story is jumping around, it's just hard to compose my thoughts. Let's get on to the actual incident 

After a holiday we were driving back home from the airport around 3 in the morning. My brother and my sister were quite hyper so were speaking quite loudly, with my brother being the loudest. Y was trying to sleep so kept telling my brother to 'shut up' in a rather harsh tone of voice. 

Soon we were nearly home and she told him to shut up again.I am quite protective over my siblings so I sat up looked her dead in the eye and said, ""how about you shut up for once huh?"" Not my best move I admit. After this, she did and we arrived home where we went to sleep.

I was woken up maybe 4 hours later by a knock on the door and Y walked in. She then proceeded to say the following, I will try to write it as best as I remember. 

""You are a horrible child you know, a right nasty piece of work. Evil even. You know that no one in your family likes you right? Even your grandma, they all think you are a horrible spoilt child."" And so on.

She was basically screaming this at me and I was sitting crying. After, she left and my brother came in and gave me a hug before my dad came in to have a go at me for being rude to Y. (I would just like to say I love my dad and he is a wonderful dad but sometimes he can act without knowing the whole story).

After he left I messaged my mum to try and go home to hers but I wasn't allowed as it was my dad's week. 

Anyway I will skip a bunch of other stuff like going for a walk with my mum ect to the main point because this is getting a bit long. 

The next day I told my dad I never wanted to see Y again as she said some truly horrible stuff to me. He said okay and has kept his word (apart from a later incident which I may post later) but I know that it probably makes life difficult for him as she is his girlfriend and they haven't broken up. 

So, AITA for still refusing to see my dad's girlfriend even though I know it makes my dad's life harder. ",72,88,0.93
1368,Not the A-hole,"Before I begin with the reason as to why, here's some context: we live in a twin room. This means that our beds are in the same area in the same room, facing each other in an L shape. We are both female.

Yesterday, my roommate and her female friend were preparing to go for a party in our room. I had been feeling sick for a few days and opted to go to bed a bit early, immediately after they left. My roommate was aware that I had been running a fever.

Then, in the middle of the night (around 2am) I am abruptly awaken by the feeling of someone who had just taken a seat on my bed (and my feet). This obviously shocks me and when I open my eyes all I see is a large shadow on my bed due to the darkness, which freaks me out. I immediately ask who the hell he is and he says that he's with my roommate and didn't know I was there. I tell him that he gave me a huge scare and he offers to hug me, which I refuse. At this point I'm already angry. 

In the meanwhile, my roommate is in our bathroom clearing vomit from her clothes and her afformentioned friend is in her bed. Eventually, the male guest gets into bed with her friend, saying he wants to sleep, but starts kissing her. My roommate is just sitting at her desk staring at her phone. I get irritated by the lip smacking and go to the kitchen to grab a glass of water and cool off. At this point I am seriously considering yelling at all of them to get out.

When I get back to my room and contemplate telling them off by staring In their direction, my roommate seems to get the hint and convinces the male guest to leave. I'm somewhat relieved, but at this point can't sleep, so I use my phone for about half am hour. During this time her friend falls asleep and starts snoring loudly. Then, she and the male guest return and start searching for something. I am really pissed. It's the next morning now and there's still vomit in my bathroom.

I would not have minded her having guests if she had informed me beforehand, and if they would not invade my space in the room. Also, maybe I'm a bit traditional, but I'm really not interested in her or her friend's sexual activities, and don't think it's acceptable for her to bring over sexual partners since our beds are literally facing each other. She also managed to choose the worst possible day to do this, while I am still sick and in need of rest. I am thinking of confronting her and telling her not to bring anymore overnight guests, but I don't know if I'm overreacting.",44,68,0.91

I dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.


Ive ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)


Since then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)

1374,Not the A-hole,"I've been seeing a guy for a few weeks now, we've been on a few dates but haven't done anything sexual except from making out. I always like to take things slow because in the gay community there are a lot of purely sexual relationships, but I personally prefer monogamy and want to know someone is interested in me and not just my genitals.

After a few weeks, this guy and I got on really well together and we were clearly both attracted to each other, I felt comfortable enough with him that I thought we could take our relationship to ""the next level"" (which he wanted to do on our first date so I knew he would also want to… this is sort of relevant later on!). We were texting and I pretty much said that I was fine with moving the relationship forward and he then told me that he is HIV-positive, but is on medication which means it can't be passed onto sexual partners.

I know this is bad to say but all my sexual attraction to him disappeared in that very moment. I know that if I had sex with him, I would be worrying the whole time about HIV transmission. I also know it's illogical because it's not transmissable but I just wouldn't feel safe. I'm very very very careful with sexual activity because I know HIV is a bigger problem in the gay community than for straight people and it's something I really don't want in my life, even though I know people can live completely fulfilling lives and normal lifespans with it.

I didn't have the courage to tell him that I didn't want to have sex with him because of his HIV status so I sort of wrapped up the conversation and then deliberately brought up politics (which I know is a big issue for a lot of people) a few days later and pretended to end things with him over that saying that ""we just didn't see eye to eye"". In reality I couldn't care less about his political beliefs, I just can't see myself being intimate with someone who has HIV.

I told my sister about this and she said I was being judgemental and ruining what could be a great relationship. It's sad but I see her points in some ways. This guy was really respectful of my wishes to not have sex which can sometimes be rare to find in the gay community, he's really attractive and intelligent and very caring + kind. But I just can't seem to get past his HIV, and I wish I could but I can't. Also, on our first date he wanted to hook up and I'm 99% sure he wasn't even going to tell me he was HIV positive which makes me question if he's the person I thought he was.

I know no one is obligated to have sex with anyone else, consent is important and I think rejection for any reason is fine, but I can't help feel like I have a stigma in my mind and I feel really guilty about even thinking like this… am I the asshole?",31,28,0.97

Last year my girlfriend(22f) bought me(25m) a pair of sneakers for my birthday. The sneakers are pretty expensive and I had been eyeing them because they are pretty stylish. 

Fast forward to a couple months ago when I started going to the gym. I have a pair of sneakers that I regularly wear, but occasionally I wear the gift sneakers because 1) I like to flex from time to time and 2) they are very comfortable. I didn't mention that I was wearing them to the gym because I didn't think it was a big deal, but turns out I was wrong. 

Yesterday I sent her a picture of me mid-workout featuring the sneakers and she was livid. She said that I didn't appreciate the gift and held no value in the things she gave me. She also equated it to her wearing shoes to gave her to a construction site (she studies engineering). I was very surprised and told her that her comparison was totally off base. I explained that not only is the gym always being cleaned, but that I check and clean my sneakers once a week anyway. I also told her that while the shoes were stylishly designed, they were engineered for sports and that one day or so in the gym wouldn't really hurt. 

After a prolonged back and forth she calmed down after I  promised not to wear the sneakers back to the gym. I still think she is being a bit ridiculous, but she refused to hear me when I tell her that I don't assign value to things based on where I wear them. They're special because she gave them to me. Anyway, AITA?

EDIT: For those asking. They're Ultraboosts, expensive compared to the regular price of sneakers. They're not designer Yeezys or Offwhites etc.

1378,No A-holes here,"Here goes nothing. 

I’m a 25f working a retail job where there’s a LOT of people employed. SO many people that I feel I’m meeting new people everyday and also forgetting someone exists for months. I’m the kind of friendly that will chat and laugh with anyone, honestly. 

From stage right enters Paul. I’ve known Paul since day one at this job. But six months in, we finally get to talk more than a quick hello and goodbye. And Paul? Is a fucking nerd. Just. Like. Me. 

We are VIBING. We’re cackling and hollering. We like the same fandoms, the same genres, we like the same kind of TEA. So we become buddies, right? 

We go for food, chat about geek shit. We go see a geek movie. I meet his geek friends. We keyboard smash to each other, it’s great. And this is over the course of, let’s say, 3 months. I decided to get him a teeny gift cause I’d thought he’d like it. He decided to get ME a little gift cause he’d thought I’d like it. 

He legit looked me in the eyes and said “you’re cool people. I like you. I wanted you to know that.” And I said, “hey man. I like you too. It’s nice to know cool people like you exist.” 

Everything seemed kosher until I got an actual letter from him that said he wanted to spend his future with me. 

And I’m mortified. Because, remember I said I worked in a big store where I meet new people and forget about people? It’s hard to keep track of everybody right? Which I didn’t realize might be the case. 

Because, people of reddit, I am a 25f who is a LESBIAN. And I don’t know how to handle myself in the face of what may have been a long term heterosexual courting that I did not recognize because I naively thought men and women could be platonic friends??? 

AM I THE ASSHOLE? For not realizing what it meant? Did I lead Paul on? I haven’t even responded to their letter because I can’t handle myself? I honestly feel so embarrassed and there’s a little voice in my head that’s telling me I’m a whore and that it was my fault. 

I don’t think he’s a homophobe or that I’ll be in danger if I come out to him. But I’m MORTIFIED. I’m not someone who can easily hurt someone’s feelings, but I’m clearly doing that here by ignoring it. ",31,31,0.94
1379,Asshole,"Ohh boy this whole thing has been a rollercoaster. Where to begin...

I live with 4 people. One of my roommates and I do not get along. At all. Despite this, we have a lot of mutual friends, so we often end up hanging out together.

A couple nights ago, my friends and I all go out  She's there too. We go out to a local restaurant/bar and just generally have a good time. Recently, my ex and I broke up. While we were eating, me and the girl (let's just call her Sarah) got into a disagreement. I'll spare the details, but it essentially lead her to say: ""Wow, no wonder your ex broke up with you."" That got some looks from the group, but I decided to keep quiet about it. The night carried on. I was pissed.

We decide to head back home. The way our carpooling worked, it was just me and her in her car, with her as the driver. She had a couple drinks at the restaurant... this will be relevant soon.

While we were in the car, I did not say a damn thing to her. As we were driving home, I saw blue lights flashing behind us. I could not keep from laughing a bit. When we stopped, the police officer came up to us he and Sarah were talking. Then a great idea came to mind:

&#x200B;

Me: ""Excuse me officer... I feel obligated to tell you that my friend was drinking earlier. I do not feel safe."" In reality, she was probably going about 7 or 8 over the limit. Her driving was fine. But I just about had it with her.

Sarah gave me the dirtiest look, then the cop told her to step outside. Sobriety test was okay, but we live in a state where she needs to take a breathalyzer if asked... and she did. She blew barely over the legal limit. Cue the arrest and me calling an uber.

&#x200B;

So am I the asshole here? My friends don't know the full story yet- basically that I snitched on her. She is facing a world of trouble right now.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I have to wear correctives, but I did not have my glasses on me.

EDIT 2: I am a guy, and my gf and I broke up.

EDIT 3: Okay here's where I currently stand.  What I did was cold hearted. I'm not going to argue that. And yes, it was out of spite. BUT I do not think this is ""wrong"". She broke the law, and this will ensure she does not do it again. I really do not like her or care for her at all, so whatever happens to her life and future will not make me lose one second of sleep. I know this may sound heartless, but I still believe I am in the right.

EDIT 4: Some people are saying this is a bad move due to the roomie situation. The way I see it, she will have to move out because of the court fees, etc. Probably back to her parents' place. So I won't have to deal with that fallout. Again, coldhearted. I will admit that.

EDIT 5: I guess I should have also mentioned this: This was not revenge for this particular situation. She's done a number of bitchy things to me before. I've had it with her, and this was me saying so. I also stopped her from driving drunk in the future though and taught her a lesson, albeit an ice cold lesson.

EDIT 6: Okay, I need to clarify a bit more.

\- I did get in the car with her, yes. I didn't even think of her drinking when I got in. She had 2 drinks. 2. That is not enough to warrant suspicion. I just thought of it when we got pulled over.

\-I did not do this with the intent of getting her kicked out of the home. I did this so she could get a slap of reality.

\-I still think what I did was simply cold, but not unethical. She broke the law. I reported her. It would have been unethical not to, honestly. She needs to learn that driving drunk is not okay.

He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.

It was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests.

I asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.

Now this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say “Hi”. At this point, I’m starting to see what’s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they’re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he’s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn’t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn’t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?

1384,Not the A-hole,"I don't work/barely work since we have 2 little kids and nobody to watch them/daycare is more expensive than what I would make full time. It's a great set up. He doesn't mind being the only one working and I don't mind staying home. 




All of our bills are set up through my account; thus leaving me to physically pay all the bills and do all the grocery shopping and whatnot. 



My husband used to give me about 80% of his paychecks and I would pay all the bills/expenses with it, and what was leftover was split in 3 ways. 50% into savings, and 25% was given back to hubby and 25% was applied towards ""fun money"" for myself and the children. Going swimming, riding to the ice cream shop, maybe a coffee date with a mommy friend. 



This situation worked well and nobody complained, AND we actually had a savings because i controlled 80% of the money to go to bills before we split up the ""extra "" money. 





Fast forward to now. (This has been going on for maybe 3 months? But perhaps longer.) 
My husband now gives me about 45%-50% of his paychecks and keeps the other 50% which would be great, IF he paid any of the bills with his bank. But he doesn't. He still expects me to pay everything off and then gets upset/confused when I tell him that our water bill is past due, or my account was negative so I couldn't go grocery shopping. 




So, AITA for wanting more money from my husband to get shit done even though it is ""his"" money. 





ETA: I want to thank everyone for the feed back. I do want to clarify something that I see coming up a lot. Many people are saying I shouldn't have to ask for money because im his wife. And I agree with that in a sense and my husband agrees as well. I don't ask for money because I think he is better than me or anything, but my husband and I ask eachother things all the time because we were taught that asking was the respectful thing to do. I ask him if he minds that I go see my mom for coffee while he watches the kids. He asks if he can go to his  brother's house, and I ask for more money to pay the remaining balance of a bill or whatever. We ""ask"" eachother, fully understanding and pretty much expecting the other persons answer to be yes. (Which 99.9999% of the time it is.) Because, again, like I said. Our upbringing makes us believe that it is more respectful to say ""do you mind if I do x,y,z"" instead of saying ""I need you to do *this* so I can do *that* "" ",206,305,0.96
1385,Not the A-hole,"Okay, I really need an outside point of view on this because I’m too emotional to think straight. My boyfriend split up with his now-ex in May 2018. They both had agreed to an open relationship in the beginning of 2018 (i met him in March) and in May they decided to officially split and she moved across the country. 

After a few months of dating (around June/July), he began spending 100% of his time at my place. He still has his own place and lease, and his place costs about half of what mine does per month. I make more than he does, but not significantly more. He always said he had trouble paying bills (in fact I’ve leant him money for this, some of which he still hasn’t paid back), so I never asked him to chip in for any expenses. We take turns paying on the rare occasion we go out on a date.

Today I learned that he’s been sending his ex hundreds of dollars per month. Every month. Anywhere from $100-250 per week. I’m PISSED and demanded he stop - he literally **borrowed money from me to give to her.**

Now here’s where I may be the asshole. They were still doing the “open relationship” thing through April, and they found out she was pregnant just before she moved away. This was before we were exclusive, so while it sucks, it wasn’t a cheating issue. The child was born at the end of December, and they have not gone to court or filed anything about child support (which is now pretty evident why). 

I told him that he (1) needs to sort it out in court, and (2) until then, he can and should  pay for everything for that child that she sends him a receipt for. However, no more paying for her hair (she gets it done extravagantly in rainbow colors, definitely not a home-done thing), her clothes, and everything else in her lifestyle that she loves to brag about on Facebook. Supporting the kid is fine, but ZERO money to her. 

He thinks I’m being unreasonable and that he owes it to her and her (not his) 11 year old son from a previous relationship to keep funding whatever they want, although he’s at least admitted that he shouldn’t have borrowed money from me for “bills” to send to her. 

AITA for putting my foot down and forbidding him to send any more money that’s not baby-related?

Edit: I’m trying to put all the info in and I feel like it’s unfair that I left this part out. Her kid from a prior relationship calls my boyfriend dad - they were together for about 6 years so more than half of his life. Boyfriend is insisting it’s to help with rent and stuff the older child needs and that he can’t help what she decides to spend it on. 

2nd edit: since he knew splitting up put her in a financial bind (she’s never worked, no medical/disability reason, she says it’s to take care of her 1st kid who’s in grade school ) he’s been paying her $300/mo car payment and has kept her on his cell phone plan. She was supposed to put it in her name when she was financially able but hasn’t. This part I knew about if it matters. ",54,32,0.91

1393,Not the A-hole,"My mother and I never got along. I moved out of my parents house when I was young due to our toxic relationship. I'm now 29, and my husband and I are expecting our first child. This will be my mom's first grandchild. 

Long story short, we don't have a mother-daughter relationship. We don't respect each other, and we don't agree on things. Because of that, and to maintain the peace, I've put up boundaries that exclude her from the highly personal aspects of my private life. I dont confide in her, or look to her for any type of advice or emotional support.  When we do talk, it's just to get caught up. I tell her how work is going, and she updates me on the rest of the family.  Sometimes I borrow money from her. Sometimes she bums rides off of me.  We're just friends. 

But now she seems to think that this pregnancy changes things.  She doesnt respect these long established boundaries, nor does she respect my decisions, and has no confidence in me what so ever.  

I know she's just excited to be a grandmother, and wants to be involved. She's all sentimental, feeling like it's her job to be there to guide me with her wisdom. But I like the boundaries, and I would prefer to keep our relationship as it is, because it works. I'm just not ready or willing to assume the role as daughter in a mother-daughter dynamic. I don't feel comfortable showing her my vulnerability, let alone look to her for support. I also find it very disrespectful with how she talks down to me like I'm an idiot who hasn't bothered to learn about pregnancy, labour, delivery, or parenting.  It reminds me of why those boundaries are there in the first place. 

She assumed that she'd be in the delivery room when I gave birth.  I literally just said ""no you're not. It's just going to be me and (husband)"".  She doesn't respect that decision, and assumes I'm going to want her there.  She started questioning whether or not my husband will be able to handle it.  I've been with him for 10 years, she hardly knows him.  I just wanted to tell her to fuck off.  It's not up for discussion. 

So, am I an asshole because I dont want a close mother-daughter relationship with my mom, causing her to feel left out and deprived of part of what she thinks being a grandma is supposed to be? 


EDIT:  I really want to thank you all for your kind words of encouragement.  Although I don't mind keeping civil communication open with my mother, and want her to be apart of my son's life, this new journey and her experience (having 3 kids) does not earn her a place in the decision making process. I wont let her guilt me into letting her in.  The ""I'll be there to make sure they take care of you"" comment rubs me the wrong way. It tells me that she will try to intervene or influence my decisions, and the maternity ward is no place for arguments. She needs to simply trust that my husband and I can do this, even though this is our first kid. ",120,485,0.97

I’ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife’s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daughter shopping for a prom dress. My wife says “I still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.” She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment “oh, no, it has spots on it” and my wife says “oh, yeah, my date made a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.” The friend says “ew!” And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says “I loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo”. I said “hey, I don’t feel comfortable with another guy’s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned” she said “what! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don’t be jealous, I won’t have it cleaned.” I said “I’m not jealous. I don’t care that you had sex with other guys, I don’t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don’t want another guy’s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.” She said “no, you’re overreacting!” 
It’s been awkward ever since. It’s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet “are you going to get that dress cleaned?” She said “I don’t think so, don’t be jealous”. I have talked with her since.

He is on medication and going to therapy - its not really working.

He gets the worst depressive episodes when he is struggling with college assignments. 

His depression is genetic and he doesn’t really understand the root of it (if there is any apart from genetics).

When he is depressed he locks himself in and doesn’t let me talk to him much, I also feel really neglected during this time but feel it’s inappropriate to mention it to him as he’s clearly having a harder time.

I love him so much but honestly its quite draining to try to live my own life and look after someone in this state.

My parents are divorced, and my dad married my stepmom when I was in 5th grade. In the early years of their marriage, she was very emotionally abusive. She'd insult me and yell at me over little things, mostly about cleaning. She had a lot of issues and took them out on my sister and I until about my Freshman year of High school, but has slowly been getting better over the years. However, I always have this underlying fear that she'll revert back to the way she was before. On the other hand, my dad and stepmom currently have a great marriage, despite the hiccups. My dad, up until this point, had the impression that my stepmom and I were great pals. She'd taken me coming out very well, and she supported me in all my hobbies, etc. I don't hate her by any means, but she just makes me uncomfortable.

A week ago, my stepmom left for a few days to visit her son in Colorado, so my dad and I were by ourselves. We went to a nice restaurant, and my dad decides to start asking me some really personal questions. Eventually, he asks why I'm going to the community college in the city where my mom lives, rather than the one closer to his house. There's a lot of reasons, but the biggest one is my stepmom. At first, I lie and say that it's that I'm not as independent as i would like to be. But that makes me feel immensely guilty, (especially since my dad tried to fix the made up problem) so I told him the truth.

My dad then spent the next hour (I checked, it was a full hour and then some) telling me what I said was unfair, that I fought back against my stepmom, and also ""subtly"" insulting my mother. He also said he wished I had said something sooner (I had, but nothing got solved) but also that he ""could have gone the rest of [his] life without knowing that.""

Final edit. Please read.


I will come clean. This is a shitpost due to one key factor: I am not the father. I am the daughter. 


Many of you called this in the comments but it’s true. I tried to give his perspective in a honest way and embody the belief system he truly has.

There is only one lie in this story overall: I have not left and I have no plans to leave. I can’t afford it, not even for university. 

I suppose there is one other lie: my dad doesn’t want to change, he doesn’t want counselling for his PTSD and he doesn’t want me to be happy.

I am sorry for lying. I just wanted some perspective based on my dad telling the story; the way others see it. 

My friends have told me this is normal, my mum, my family. 

So I did. It is only when I found reddit that I thought different. 

I wasn’t ‘gullible’ or ‘sensitive’ for not liking his jokes. I was just a normal person.

Again, I am sorry for the shitpost. I am still in counselling but my dad doesn’t know about it and he doesn’t care to know. 

I will delete this now, since it is a shitpost. 

Well done for calling it in comments but still: I tried to make my dad as likeable and witty as I could. The way others see him in real life and I quoted him verbatim in response to some comments. 

‘My daughter isn’t fat, but she WAS’

‘I want to make her happy’

My mum won’t divorce him, she is too scared as was fore-mentioned because, well here is the third lie and the final one. I cut out the fact he has hit us on occasion beyond ‘smacking’ when I was a kid because that’s what my dad would say. He would deny it.

Thank you for reading and I apologise for the lies. 

Thank you for the advice. I wish my dad was different, I wish he wanted to change. I wish he would get counselling, 

But he won’t.

Original post-





Throwaway, for reasons.

I’m 56 years old and my daughter is 17

The daughter and I have had a few issues throughout the years which started in her teens, as most father-daughter problems do.

When she was little, she was a little chubby so I used to call her chubster, pudge, etc, as a joke and talk to her about the importance of losing weight. When I was growing up, my dad would often call me fat and to keep fat, which inspired me to lose weight and get fit. 

Anyway, when she got to her teens, she started being a bit funny about being eating, (making herself sick, etc). She wasn’t anorexic though as she wasn’t skinny enough. Anyway, we started having arguments and the revolving subject of those tiffs would be how I made her feel ‘unworthy’ and ‘fat’. She also keeps bringing up this occasion where I apparently called her fat in public at age eight, making her cry and telling her, ‘go eat a chocolate bar, that will make you feel better, fatty’. This is an event I cannot remember but my wife remembers clearly. 

This has caused a significant rift between my daughter and I and on many occasions she has used the silent treatment on me. I’m talking weeks of silence, only speaking to the wife. It makes it unbearable. 

We usually have a slightly jokey relationship when we are friendly, however the banter sometimes becomes a little bit personal. She will call me fat etc and I will in return. Sometimes, it’s ok and sometimes it’s not. I just don’t know where I stand. 

Anyway, in one event in question, she called me a ‘cock’ so I said she had a big nose. It was all friendly but immediately, after I said that, she went cold on me. Turns out, or so my wife tells me, she hates her nose which is sort of Roman-esque but nothing huge or anything. It’s one of her ‘big insecurities’. She didn’t speak to me for about a week and is still cool with me now. 

Anyway reddit, am I the asshole for taking banter too far? 



....

EDIT 

I spoke to my wife, she told me to leave it. She said my daughter has been talking about moving out because of my behaviour. She told me some other things about my daughter too. 

But I still think I should speak to her. I feel so fucking bad about what I have said to her in the past but I don’t want to come across as disingenuous.  


Edit 2

I spoke to her. It didn’t go well. At all. 


Update

She went to her grandparents last night and this morning she came back. We had a long talk about things. I told her about this post. She was pissed at me understandably for airing out our dirty laundry in public but she later told me she has made a few posts on r/raisedbynarcissists and r/amitheasshole about the situation between us. She said it was fine that I have this post up by the end and she said thank you for the advice (to all the responders). She told me a list of things I have said in the past that have made her feel like shit:

1. Weight comments
2.Nose comments
3. Jokingly called her stupid etc, made her feel insecure about her intellect
4. Lazy, made her feel as though she was going to fail school
5. Acne, etc

And many more. 

She has told me she can’t forgive me for what I have said but she wants to find a solution for the wife’s sake. She said she loves me but she doesn’t want to live in the same house. I understand this completely.

Also, as some other comments have suggested, I should reach out to my son. 

He owes me around thirty thousand dollars due to his drug use and had two children by a girl who was fifteen at the time of conception. I have said things to him in the past that I regret and, to buy his affection, I supplied his drug use. 

I need to make a change in my life.

1406,Asshole,"TLDR; My wife started a meal plan last week, I made brownies last night. She can't partake until Sunday although I saved her some. (It was Tuesday). AITA

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So my wife has been on a health kick recently after our Dr. visit, and has been working out every day and has a strict meal plan she has kept to. I am very proud of her for this, and she allows herself 1 free day of eating per week. Sunday, now I myself don't have a meal plan. I often take part in her meals, because they are a healthy alternative but are otherwise quite tasty. Now, that being said, I am not against my sweet tooth and last night I had a HUGE craving for brownies. I had a box in the pantry and just couldn't resist the idea of making some. Before I do my wife stops me and says that I should wait a couple days at least, so she could have a brownie or two on her free day.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now, I don't think it's fair that just because she's on a meal plan that I also have to limit my sweet tooth cravings. She says it's not fair to make the brownies and she won't be able to eat them for a week, when she claims they will be stale and hard, suggesting I at least wait for Friday so when she can have one they'll be still 'kinda fresh'. I told her that microwaving them works, and they'll be basically just the same and I would save her a bunch. She then went on to say that it was torture to have to smell the brownies baking and not be able to have any, I think she's being dramatic. She's lasted over a week on her meal plan without cheating, there should be no reason I can't bake a batch of brownies.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I decided to give into my sweet tooth (Obviously, or else this post wouldn't exist) and went on to make the brownies, I felt it wasn't that big of a deal. When my wife saw what I was doing, you'd think I just hit her dog with a car, she immediately starts yelling at me that I am selfish and unsupportive and ran off to go to bed. Later on, when I went to join her she immediately pulled away from me, to the point of getting out of bed herself just to tell me not to touch her. So here comes my question.

Am I the asshole here?",53,35,0.88
1407,Not the A-hole,"So, I (20F) have been friends with C (20F) since we were little kids. She’s always had a very demanding attitude. She’s the definition of “It’s my way or the highway!” and she honestly is crazy when she’s in relationships.

She used to date this guy, M, in high school. They broke up because she cheated on him with a guy she had been having a very long term affair with. 

Recently C and M started talking again, but M is in a bad place. He’s couch surfing at a friend’s house, he just got out of a relationship a few months ago in which he was cheated on and his girlfriend got pregnant. 

C wants a relationship, but M isn’t ready which is pretty understandable. They hung out every day/night over the last month up until this past weekend, when M was hanging out with his friends. 

Friday night she texted me freaking out because M would rather go to a party with his friends than hang out with her. I was sick with the flu, but she demanded that I come with her to show up at a party we aren’t invited to so that she could be petty and make him “know that she’s angry.” I refused, and she got pissed at me for it. She went alone.

Saturday, M was working on his truck. C blew up his and my phone all day, because he wasn’t texting her as much as she felt that he should be. Once again, she went out driving past all of the possible places he could be at until she happened to pass him on the road—at which time she whipped a u-turn and followed him. They ended up hanging out that night because she just got into his vehicle without asking and refused to leave.

Sunday, he had plans to hang out with his friends again—but C swore he made plans with her. He refused to leave to come hang out with her, so once again she went looking for him. She found his vehicle which he stupidly left the keys inside of and MOVED IT. 

Monday comes and she’s trying to get me to message him and “make him feel bad for treating her so horribly.” I refused. She got pissed again. She sent me screenshots of her demanding that he come to her house and talk to her, in which he responded he wasn’t sure he wanted to talk to her anymore after all of this. She called him a fucking dipshit and demanded that he go to her house to talk to her.

I’m sick of hearing her cry about the fact that she can never just find a good guy and have a happy relationship, and having to bite my tongue to keep from saying that she’s the reason it never works out. 

WIBTA if I finally told her that the reason her relationships never work out is because she’s horrible to all the guys who give her a chance? Obviously I wouldn’t just rip her ass and call her names, but try and put it constructively.

I’m actually a 15 y.o girl who’s really haven’t experienced this kind of stuff before and it’s an o o f

A friend of mine kept telling this guy who just so happens to also be a friend to confess to his crush and I didn’t know any better about who it was back then, so I encouraged him to do it and he seemed awkward with that. He was really secretive and wouldn’t tell me who it was.

That same friend who told the guy to confess told me it was really obvious who his crush was and was surprised I didn’t get it. 

Eventually though from all the teasing from me and the way everyone acted around me and him, I got the message. And I was nervous because I didn’t reciprocate those feelings.

But then time came and he wanted to talk to me by the school halls during lunch and he wanted to talk with me by the window. I become confused but do it anyways, only to find him confessing to me.

Panicking because I, again, didn’t like him that way, I go ahead and say “I’m flattered, thanks” and smiled. It was really awkward and I broke the silence and asked “So what do you want me to say” and he just says it’s fine and offers me an Oreo but I say I’m on a diet because he confessed a day before prom.

I got reprimanded by another friend for not giving him a chance and not liking him back. I argued that I can’t force feelings that aren’t there and that at least I didn’t lead him on or anything. We both agreed to disagree and ended it at that.

Days later of everyone forcing me to dance with him during half my prom night even if I was unhappy, people teasing me with him and flirting with me for him, I thought it was repulsive but I did nothing. 

Now I can’t even talk normally to him as a friend because he either tries to flirt with me or guilt trips me for what I said and repeats it in our conversations and it’s annoying. 

I no longer feel like wanting to hang around with him because of that but I can’t help but forget we had a good friendship before this and I feel bad wanting to ignore it over this.

Honestly, the guilt tripping is kind of working and I keep wondering lately if I should have just toughened up and pretended to like him back. And my actual crush told me that he overheard I rejected the guy who confessed to me. I didn’t think it’d spread like wildfire that way. 

So far only two people who I have talked about how I felt agreed with me and the rest have pretty much subtly or downright described me as an asshole for this. I’m really unsure at this point, but nearly everyone thinks I’m an asshole so :/

1412,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I were taking an early morning flight out for a mini vacation.  As we were about to sit at our assigned seats, we saw a service member in uniform sitting in my wife’s window seat (I had the middle).  Since it was the first flight out, we wanted to get a little sleep, but my wife really can’t sleep on a plan unless she’s at the window.  Plus, we paid around $600.

&#x200B;

As we approached our seats, he was already snuggled in the seat as if he was also going to get some sleep as well.  When I asked if he was in the correct seat (even though I knew he wasn’t), he said, “Do you mind if I just sit here?” with a very smug look on his face.  It was as if he assumed I would say yes.  I kindly said no.  He then replied, “Are you sure? You can have the aisle.”  I turned to my wife to see what she thought, and she shook her head to say no.  So again, I said no thanks.  After that I heard a couple of other passengers say to just let him sit there.  He just stared at me after that and still didn’t move.  Maybe he was expecting that I would give in after hearing those comments.  I then sternly asked him to please sit in his assigned seat.  He finally complied but was obviously annoyed.  I overhead those other passengers saying I should’ve let him sit there.

&#x200B;

I feel as if he was using the fact that he was in the military to his advantage by the way he responded.  I can only assumed he has done this before since he was so smug.  However, maybe he was finally coming home after some time away from home and was tired.  I felt a little guilty, but also couldn’t forget how smug he was.  Also, I fly quite a bit for work and have never had anyone defend someone else who was sitting in the wrong seat.  I assume it was because he was in the military.  Anyway, AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: I'm pretty sure he was Army since we were flying out of SeaTac and JBLM is close.  There were several other uniformed service members on the flight.  He didn't look young enough to be fresh out of boot camp.  I think maybe he was 20.  I don't know what rank he was.  I'm not familiar with how to identify that.  And for the people who think this story is fake, I forgot to mention that everyone on the plane, including the pilots, stood up from their seats and clapped once he moved seats.

1414,Not the A-hole,"I had a very close friend for 6 years, where we would see each other regularly, do activities, have dinners and get-togethers, and leaned on each other for support. Several months ago, he asked me if he could tell me something very personal, and that I would promise to not tell anyone else. I said yes. 

He told me that he is being accused of sexually molesting his nephew many years ago as a child. Now his nephew (who is an adult) is threatening to go public with it. But because he is very close to his sister (his nephew's mom), his nephew will wait until his mother dies to go public. He was very upset that he would lose everything and we didn't talk about this for a few months. 

My ex-friend has always been a very openly sexual person, but I never thought it would be possible for him to actually do this. But there was always this nagging voice in the back of my head that he may have. One day at dinner I asked him point blank to look me in the eye and tell me he did not do this and that I would stand by him if he was innocent. 

He looked me in the eye and said ""it's complicated"". I felt a burning sensation in the depth of my stomach. We didn't talk for a month or two. In that time, my wife gave birth to our first kid. He came over to say hi and wanted to take pictures with the baby. I told him not to. 

After a few more months, I told him that we can no longer hang out. I also told him that I needed to tell my wife. He tried to convince me not to, but I didn't want to lie to my wife anymore on why we are not seeing our friend. 

AITA? Should I have been more of a friend to him?

Edit: I did tell my wife. We still have mutual friends (which is awkward) but we have not seen this specific person for several months. 

Edit 2: even though we have not seen each other for some time, we did talk on the phone a couple of times afterwards. He tried to explain that he didn't do ""the thing"" and asked me how I was could be so judgmental of him. But after that he respected my wishes to not want to see or speak to him.

It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it.

She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar.

However the issue is that a couple of weeks ago we were talking about moving in together and she says ""well you'll obviously not be making meat in the house anyway"" which just took me by surprise and after talking about it a bit more (which turned into an argument) it turns out that when/if we moved in together that she expects me to not cook or eat meat in the house at all, even if we had separate pans, cooking utensils etc. Her reasoning is that ""I just find it disgusting, I'll never have it in my house, you can eat it at work but not in the house"" I understand relationships are about compromise and sacrifice but surely the compromise here is to have separate cooking utensils. 

I went from wanting to move in with her and progress our relationship to hitting this wall and thinking that one of us will just end up resenting the other if we are so opposed on this and one has to concede.

1435,Not the A-hole,"I'm 23, and live in an inner-town apartment paying $250 per week rent. I only earn $35,000 a year so this is a pretty significant expenditure for me, but for various reasons it's wholly worth it.

My parents live approximately 1 hour away via public transport (I don't own a car unfortunately).

During dinner at my parent's home a few nights ago they casually mentioned that they were going to be going on a six-week holiday soon (to visit relatives in another country). They have a small dog at home, so I asked them what they were going to do about it. This is when my dad says ""well you'll look after it of course"". I queried further how I was supposed to do that which is when I was met with a blank stare and the words ""you're obviously moving back home while we're gone"".

At this point I made the mistake of laughing and asking ""so who's going to pay my rent?"".

This started one of the biggest arguments i've ever had with my parents. In their view, they had expected me to move back to their home (whilst still paying rent for my empty apartment), with the added downside of now having to tack on at least an hour in commute every day, as a ""thank you"" to them for being my parents. This involved an argument of how they provided for me for x amount of years and ""gave me everything"" (untrue, I've been financially independent since I was old enough to work) and how me expecting them to ""pay me for helping them"" was disrespectful and sickening to them.

I tried explaining that i'd basically be throwing $1,500 at a wall for 6 weeks of doing them a 'favour' whilst they were on holiday, and how that seemed somewhat unreasonable unless they potentially agreed to at least contribute to my rent payments whilst I wasn't at my own home.

This argument was met with ""but we pay a mortgage too, and we won't be home so it's the same thing"".

I tried explaining how it was more about the fact that i'd be involuntarily exempting myself from a service I pay a  significant amount of money for, on the sole premise of ""helping them"".

This argument was met with ""we help you with everything and now you expect us to pay you when we ask for help"".

I told them I would be happy to help in a reasonable manner but at the end of the day this would be a significant burden on me monetarily and livelihood wise, to which I was reprimanded for ""trying to do business with your own flesh and blood"".

It boiled down to them making the argument that it makes no difference where I live, i'll be paying rent regardless.

I eventually gave up as they were getting more and more indignant and seemingly oblivious to my point of view. We now haven't spoken in several days following a few sarcastic quips from my dad asking me if I was going to pay him for drinking a glass of water because ""that's what (I) do"".

Are they right? Should I move to their home to housesit and look after the dog whilst still paying rent for my place?

There’s only one problem- he doesn’t go down on me. When I first started dating bf he told me he didn’t like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn’t want to push him into something he’s not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we’ve been together he’s gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn’t look normal and that’s why. He responded that he doesn’t even mind, he just doesn’t like doing it cause he “gets nothing out of it”. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he’s being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don’t get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I’ve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he’s traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn’t want to do it because he’s selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off. Oral should be reciprocated and I’m annoyed at myself for letting him put his pleasure above mine. Ever since I’ve stopped giving him head, cause I’m sick of choking on dick and getting “nothing out of it”.

I don’t know where our relationship will be if that’s the result. All I know is that I’m angry I’ve been lied to and treated like my pleasure is secondary.

Me and my gf have been dating for three years now. We are both about to graduate and we live quite far from eachother but still fairly close (30min bus drive).
After 3 years of our relationship I know each of ger friends pretty good, both in and out of school, I am on first name basis with her mom, sister and aunt and even their dog likes me.
However, althought I invite her very often, she never goes out with my movie group (4 other couples + 1 other single guy) and doesn't even know my gaming pals from school which I talk with all the time there, even when she visits me in my class.
Last thing you should know is that I almost regulary go to her place every second week at Friday, stay with her whole Saturday and leave Sunday morning to go home. 
Yesterday, we had a fight about me not coming over this week because I have too much work to do. When I asked her to come over if she wants to be with me that much she started yelling at me that she will just distract me from work and stuff and that she wanted me to hang out with her other friends more who will also be visiting and that they think I am rude to her for not coming.
Then I brought up my friends. I asked her about them, how they probably feel when I invite her multiple times for a screening and she never comes. She disregarded that with another guilt shot about how her mother was looking forward to seeing me to which I replied: ""Oh yeah? And what about my dad? Do you even know his first name?""
She had nothing to say, instead she started yelling again that she doesn't even know my friends names because I never invite her anywhere and that I don't care about them anyway because I always choose her in front of them (I missed 5 movies for the past three years, we usually screen on my home week) 
This left me stunned. And after a few hours of thinking I don't think I should go out with a girl who ignores my friend, but is it really something that big to end the relationship over?

John from day 1 was always very kind to me (they got together when I was really suffering from depression Jane was always dismissive not believing its a real illness but John had been through it heard me out and gave me advice) so needless to say I respect and have come to see John as the big brother I've always wanted.
My sister and I are close we shared a room until I was 14.

Two weeks ago Jane brings home a guy, I've never seen him before. I spot him in the hall, say Hi (I mean its my house of course I'm gunna say hi to someone if I bump into them in the hall) Jane calls him into her room rather abruptly.
Pops her head out the bedroom door shoots me looks.The guy then proceeds to stay the night and is gone by 9am the next morning.

I ask Jane the usual (who was that, why did he stay ect) she's very dismissive almost aggressive which is unlike her but she makes it clear this is not something John should know about. 

Me and John regularly text nothing big just chatting. So I shoot him a text telling everything.
He says he's not going to out and out confront her but will dig into it. But I know it will eventually come around that I told him

So AITA for telling my sisters boyfriend instead of keeping her secret? ",214,578,0.98
1440,Asshole,"So me and my partner have been together for over 4 years and he proposed to me a few months ago. We’ve had our ups and downs like any normal couple. The biggest point of friction has been his incel best friend but it's never been a dealbreaker for the relationship just friction. When he told me he wanted that guy to be his best man I told him I don’t feel comfortable with that and don’t want that guy as a best man end of story.

Now I didn’t do this without reason. I’m sure some of the unlucky ladies here will understand the situation of creepy friends of boyfriends. This is that scenario. The more I got to know this friend the less comfortable I felt around him. He’s over 35, complete virgin and never had a single relationship with a man, woman or whatever. Doesn’t own any pets and lives alone. I get the biggest incel vibe from him and that makes me uncomfortable. I’ve even looked at the incel subreddits and some of those people seem to have very unhealthy views which makes me even more uncomfortable. I’ve brought up that creepiness many times, but my fiance just doesn’t see it, but they’ve know each other since primary school plus most guys don’t pick up on that.

As a replacement I suggested one of his other close friends who he has known just as long but is happily married with a kid on the way. Or I’d even consider compromising and let him potentially choose my maid of honour from a list. I feel like this is more appropriate for a wedding to have people who know what it’s like to be in a loving relationship supporting the bride and groom.

My fiancé says it’s his choice and won’t budge on the choice but I believe both of us have to be completely comfortable with each other’s respective best man and maid of honour.

&#x200B;

UPDATE:

Seems you all can’t take my word that this guy is an incel and want more info. If you met him you’d see it and understand. I haven’t been able successfully limit his exposure to us, my fiance (he’s got such a big heart) likes him too damn much to see the flaws. I guess I could say he’s still allowed to be invited to the wedding or maybe be a groomsman but not the best man. I feel it’s fair that these are choices that both bride and groom have to agree on together.

For some more concrete examples of how this guy’s an incel:  
I once heard him telling my boyfriend something about a “safety net” saying his dad and him are proof of how spiteful “normal” women can get “she’ll die rich but we’re free”.  
I’ve also overheard him with “the guys” in the backyard saying women on Tinder are bitches for not looking past his quite prominent lip/palette cleft thing. I feel he’s taken no matches ever a bit too personally, I know ladies that have struggled to get matches on Tinder and aren’t bitter.

People who get to that age with a failure to launch have to have some issues in being properly socialised in things like general respect to women. I feel I’m entitled to not be forced to be around people I’m not comfortable being around with during our wedding day.",74,45,0.66

1442,Not the A-hole,"Hi Reddit !

&#x200B;

This is a throwaway account because I recently introduced her to reddit. 

My girlfiriend and I have been together for 7 months now and things are going really good between us. We recently talked about moving to a new place of our own.

&#x200B;

I really like her and I'm sure living together will work great. The only problem I might have with this is that she currently doesn't have a job. She receives about 700€/month and wants to live in a 1000€/month appartment (so 500€/month each). I can't see how this will work out. Either she will have to live off her savings (which are not illimited I guess) or I will end up paying for most of the stuff we need. Plus, if things don't work out for the two of us, I definitly can't afford a 1000€/month appartment on my own.

&#x200B;

I obviously don't have to tell her how to manage her finances but this situation makes me uncomfortable. Would it be reasonnable for me to ask her to wait until she finds a job before looking for a place for us ? Or WIBTA ?",17,26,0.93

Sometimes my(15f) cousins come over to visit , and they stay at our house. I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. 

One time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It’s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. 

Well I ended up catching him again (he doesn’t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it’s his body I have no say, and I’m being a bitch.

I really don’t care if he masturbates I just don’t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him.

1446,Not the A-hole,"So my friend invited me over for dinner the other day and made pasta. It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: ""7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.""

It's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.

Part of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?

1447,Asshole,"Me (28M) and my wife (26F) have been together for 3 years. When we first met, we were just hooking up and she told me the second night we hooked up that she sells naked photos of herself. I told her that’s fine. About 3 weeks into us hooking up, she told me she wanted to stop selling naked photos of herself because she wanted me to be the only person to see her naked. That was the starting off point for our relationship, it made me realize we actually really liked each other.

The fact that she sold naked pictures didn’t cross my mind for the first few months of us dating until I realized she’s still friends with some of the guys she sold pictures to. I told her I was uncomfortable with that, but she told me the ones she’s still friends with she was friends with before she sold naked pictures to them and she didn’t feel right ending a friendship with them just because they bought pictures from her and now she has a boyfriend. She also said that she doesn’t mind that I’m friends with girls I’ve hooked up with or wanted to hook up with, so what’s the difference. I think of it as different than someone she hooked up with, it’s like these guys were her customers. She’s not really close with any of them as friends, but they interact on various social media platforms here and there.

This is been an issue on and off in our relationship. I’ll forget about it for months and then I’ll think about it and it makes me uncomfortable. It always starts a fight between us because I’ll get really closed off/not affectionate when I think about it and she feels like I’m making her feel ashamed for the fact that she sold naked pictures of herself. I’ve tried to not think about it, but it still crosses my mind. 

We’ve been having fights about it these last few days because I told her I don’t want her to talk to anyone she’s sold pictures to. I didn’t say she has to, but in an ideal world I would want her to not interact with them. She said she barely even talks to them, they just occasionally respond to an Instagram story she’ll post or like a tweet of hers. She said it would be rude to cut out her friends and, again, that I’m free to talk to girls I’ve hooked up with. All of this came to a head today when I said what it comes down to is that I’m embarrassed that she sold these kind of pictures. This upset and angered her. She said why did I tell her I was fine with it when we started hooking up, and I told her that truthfully I wasn’t really fine with it then either, I just didn’t want to seem uncool or judgmental. She’s hurt now and says she’s going to have a hard time getting over this because she feels like I’m shaming her. 

TLDR: my wife sold naked pictures of herself while we were just hooking up. she stopped before we started dating but it bothers me that she still interacts with guys who were her friends who bought pictures. today I told her I’m embarrassed that that she sold naked pics and she’s upset ",35,50,0.93
1448,Asshole,"I thought we were in love with each other. We never fought or argued and just genuinely loved being around each other. At least that's what I thought. Until he sat me down and told me that he was dumping me. I was so shocked and the last thing I wanted to do, was let him know I was hurt. So I acted relieved. That confused him, so I told him that I was glad he was ending things. I didn't think I ever loved him, but now I won't hurt him and we can still be friends. No worries.

He got so fucking mad, and said that NOW there's no way, we could EVER be friends. He wanted to be friends, until I said I never loved him.

I didn't understand how he could be mad that I didn't love him, if he didn't love me? **Did he expect me to cry and beg for him to take me back?**

This was a couple weeks ago and we haven't talked since. I ran into his friend at a coffee shop and he paged the fuck out me. He said that what I told my ex ""seriously fucked him"". He doesn't sleep, or eat properly. He's behind in all his classes, and missed practices because of me. But I think it was probably more than just one comment I made. He called me an ""evil bitch"". I was in shock so I didn't say anything back.

What I said wasn't true, but I needed to seem so unbothered by being dumped. He broke my heart, but I didn't want to show it. I don't understand it (because he, dumped me), but it doesn't change the fact that I hate he's feeling this way. I did want to hurt him a little, at the time, I won't lie. But I would never want him to be seriously hurt, for this long. There are probably other things going on I don't know about. I don't think he'd get this upset for a comment, especially if he dumped ME

I don't even know why he broke up with me.

So AITA? Is it an asshole move even if he wasn't sad over it?

**Edit: We were together for 11 months...According to his friend, he wanted to break up so he could focus on hockey. Varsity and college was hard to balance for him. I was a ""distraction"". But he never told me that. He just stormed off when I said I never loved him. I'm not sure if I should reach out to him though.**

1449,Not the A-hole,"First time posting.

Getting right into it, about a year ago I met this girl at work. Let's call her Sam. Sam and I became friends pretty quickly as most people at our job are older. Sam deals with anxiety/ depression and doesn't have a lot of friends, so I made an effort to invite her to outtings with my friends outside of work, who are the most supportive humans I know. As we got closer and hungout more, it became pretty clear Sam liked me. Eventually, Sam told me this and I explained that I like being her friend, but was not interested in anything else, which Sam was cool with.

Fast forward a year later and I start to feel like Sam has become way too invested in me for being just a work friend. Examples include her leaving work early because I didn't grab lunch with her (we normally get food together) and Sam calling me out at work about how I haven't invited her places when I hangout with my friends.  

Recently, Sam has been telling me that she needed to talk to me about something important, but whenever i brought it up she would never say what it was. This happened about 6 times over the course of a month. Finally, this past weekend at about 4am her and two of my friends were at a bar and Sam told me that she loved me and has never felt this way before. I didn't say much bc my friends were right there. After several texts the next day Sam confirmed this was what she wanted to tell me. I told Sam that I need space and that we can't do lunch anymore but when It comes to being in the office together that I won't act any differently toward her. Sam has called out of work sick since this happened so I haven't seen her since. I feel Sam is way too emotiallly invested in me to the point where it is unhealthy which wad affecting me at work. I also realize Sam deals with a lot of health issues and has a very limited friend group. 

AITA for telling my work friend Sam I need space after she admitted she loved me?  ",32,35,0.9
1450,Asshole,"Throwaway for reasons.

8 months ago my husband passed away. He had an adult son from a previous marriage and the two of them weren't very close. I don't think they hated each other or anything like that. Honestly, I think the divorce had more to do with it. Because of reasons I won't go into here, his ex-wife basically had sole custody of their son and the two of them never had a chance to fix that relationship. 

Anyway, my husband held some animosity about the whole affair because he felt like his son sided against him in the divorce. Right before he passed he made me promise not to give his relatives any of his possessions (he had a bad relationship with his family and he owned some family heirlooms) and I asked him ""what about \[son's name\]"" and he paused and he said ""he doesn't get anything either"". Honestly, I was shocked, but I was pretty much grieving at this point so I didn't question it. 

Well, about a month ago his son reached out to me over email asking if he could have a couple of his father's items. He said he's been regretting that they never repaired their relationship and that he never got to say a proper goodbye. The items he asked about were small things like a gold lighter he remembers (I still have it) and a blue button up shirt (I don't know which one specifically, but I still have all of his old clothes). I responded and told him that unfortunately it would go against his father's wishes to give him anything and he replied very politely ""I'm sorry to hear that. Thanks for responding."" and that was it. 

About a week later his mother sends me an email calling me names and a bitch for not giving her son the things he asked for and that I'm basically preventing him from moving on. I didn't respond and I blocked her email and I haven't heard anything since. 

I've been feeling sick ever since this happened. I'm still trying to move on from his passing and I'm not trying to stop him from moving on, I'm just trying to honor my deceased husbands wishes, but I feel like I've done the wrong thing and I don't know how to handle this.

1454,Asshole,"Okay, so this is a long story. There will be a TLDR at the bottom.

I’m a teenager who really likes my room. Tonight, my mom straight up told me that I would have to give up my room for a whole week to my 64 year old grandmother. I would either have to sleep in my brother’s room on his second twin bed, or sleep on an inflatable mattress downstairs. I would also like to add that the door to it leads directly into the loud living room. I asked if she could sleep on the inflatable bed, as my room is pretty much sacred to me, giving me a place to do homework and play games in peace and quiet. She said that she couldn’t because her toe was hurt a bit, and wanted her to have a good bed. We also have a brand new camper that is so fancy it has couch seat warmers and massagers and even a working fireplace. The bed in it is even bigger and more comfortable than mine. I asked if we could plug the camper into our house to give it running water and electricity, but she flat out said no.

I said that I was didn’t want to give up my room, and there had to be a better benefiting compromise. I hate sleeping with my brother because he practically does gymnastics in his sleep, gets up way earlier than I do, watches YouTube in bed early in the morning, is very loud, and keeps me up because he won’t stop talking to me. If I slept downstairs, I wouldn’t be able to go to sleep because I would be able to hear the TV in the living room constantly. She says that I’ll still be able to use my room and computer because my grandmother won’t always be in there, but my grandmother will use the room a lot.

I would be okay with this if it were another relative, but I don't like my grandmother. First, she hates electronics. She lets us play for maybe thirty minutes a day, and constantly went back on her word, because our parents weren’t there. My brother had a breakdown, as he couldn’t do anything he wanted. When she will be staying, there will be three days where my parents won’t be there, as they will be leaving and letting my grandmother supervise. Also, she isn’t an accepting person. I expressed that I am an atheist, and she said, “No, you’re not an atheist. You don’t have enough experience to make that opinion.” This really angered me. She basically said that I didn’t have enough experience with religion to make my own opinions on the matter, even though I have in fact done research into the subject multiple times, in order to confirm my beliefs.

My mother said that I was being extremely selfish, never thought of others, and couldn’t see past myself. I tried compromise, but she wasn’t open to it. AITA for not giving up my room for a week for my grandmother?

tl;dr: Mom wants me to give up my room for a week to my mean grandmother. I oppose the idea, and she says I’m very selfish and can’t see past myself.

If YTA, what should I do differently?

If NTA, what can I do to help the situation?

1457,Not the A-hole,"About an hour ago I received the below text from my mom:

“I need a big favor. There is a chance that me and [sister’s name] could go down to [coworkers] house in orlando for 5 days. Could you stay at the house with Cookie?  It would be in late march or april. Not around Easter. I dont have anyone else to watch her. Otherwise we cant go now or on any small vacation.”

I was shocked and immediately hurt and upset because I haven’t been on a family vacation in two years, or any vacation. I had also just talked with my mom a couple weeks ago about how disappointed I was that my boyfriend has no PTO time to go on a vacation with me this year (no fault of his own, he doesn’t get a lot, and has to help his parents move this year). 

so, my mom already knew that I have an excess of PTO that I can use, and nobody to use it with. 

I have always felt like my mom favors my sister more than me, because she’s the youngest, she’s 21 and I’m 24. My sister also lives with her at the moment because she dropped out of college and doesn’t work. My sister claims she has an anxiety disorder that prevents her from going to school or working, but has still not been diagnosed after about 2 years of this, IMO she’s a hypochondriac, but that’s not the issue here. 

The dog, Cookie, is also my sisters dog.

My mom has taken vacations with my sister before and excluded me for other reasons, “it was your sisters birthday” , “she has school break, and you work full time “ etc..  my mom always says she wants to do a vacation with the three of us, but hasn’t since I was in high school. 

My sister has no income and my mother buys her new clothes, electronics, and gave her money for a new car after she crashed her old one ( also paid for by my mom) this year. 

I could go on, but the point is my sister gets a lot from my mom, whereas I have been financially independent from my mom since the age of 17 when I went off to college. I don’t get her health insurance, I pay for my own phone, rent, utilities, clothes.. you name it. 

I have a good relationship with my mom despite all of this, we see each other often, and talk in the phone every day. I guess that’s why I’m so hurt. I was really blindsided by being excluded from this.

Finally, it would be very inconvenient for me to stay at my mom’s house because it would add another half hour each way onto my commute to work, which is already a half hour. So a full hour of extra drive time, extra gas, every day. 

I also do not have a bed or bedroom at the house anymore, and she has not offered to pay me. 

I know this has been super long, so if you got here, thanks for reading!

**TL;DR : my mom & sister are taking vacation without me and expect me to dog sit at their home for 5 days without payment while they go**

**Update** I sent the below text to my mom in response.

“I’m very hurt that you wouldn’t even consider taking me on vacation and didn’t even ask. if you have literally no other option for cookie I will watch her but that is a big inconvenience for me and my commute, especially not having a place to sleep there. “

I forgot to ask if she will pay me, but I can tell her that is a must for me. thanks all! 

**2nd update** I never received a response to the text I sent last night, which is disappointing. I had hoped to hear back from her one way or another. I will call her after my shift at work today to talk things through, but see no point texting sooner as I don’t want to be more upset at work.

**Final update** 

This morning after no response from mom and reading all the comments here, I sent the below text to her:

“I will also need to be paid for the days I am watching Cookie.”

To which she responded:

“please leave me alone”

I have no idea what’s going on with my mom and sister that they are acting this way and I guess at this point I should realize that maybe it’s for the best I don’t go on vacation with them, because at this point I feel so excluded and hurt already. as I said before, I always considered my relationship with my mom to be good, even if I felt she favored my sister. 

I’m sure my time will come to go on vacation at some point and when I do it will be on my own terms.

Thank you so much for all your your kind replies and suggestions, it really helped me get through the hurt I felt and also provided great suggestions such as asking to be paid. I can’t say enough how much I find the reddit community to be full of wonderful people.

1458,Not the A-hole,"So let me start out by saying my neighbor is in continuous hardship. Me and my bf have given her food and pet food numerous times. Jumped her truck 6 times in one week. Twice we had to jump it every few blocks to get her home. We occasionally paid her to do yard. We had stopped because she asked us for an advance and then didn't do the work. A month later she gave back the money after being asked for it a few times. Dispite that she usually knocks on my door multiple times a week asking for favors and if I can I help. 

Well two days ago she comes over she's talking about how she's broke and doesn't have any food for her or animals. I tell her if she wants she rake the leaves and pick up poop and we will pay her $40. We have fake grass now so we don't need much done. She says ok that she will be over the next day. She then asked if we could give her the money ahead of time. I didn't have any cash and told her so. She then asked my bf if he had cash...I am not sure why but this really rubbed me the wrong way. He said no.

I told her I'd give her some food. I packed her some frozen meats, rice, beans, six eggs, canned fruit, granola bars, velveeta mac and cheese, a beer, a big container of spaghetti, dog food, and maybe a couple other things. Which was a lot for us. We are by NO means well off. We struggle and have to stick to a strict budget to ensure we don't run up too much debt. Since we had just filled the pantry thanks to tax season I was feeling generous. Plus in my mind if someone is asking for food they must really need it.

But the next day when she didn't come over to do the yard work I began to ponder if she was so broke why not do a half hours work and make a couple bucks. So I knocked on her door and heard her dogs in the house, which usually means she's home, but she didn't answer.

Fast forward to today and she knocked on my door a little before 4pm asking me to take her to court which closes at 5pm. Apparently it was the last day to file something that has to do with her landlord who is trying to evict her. I told her to give me five minuets. I was in my pjs cleaning. I go to get dressed and I thought to myself why am I dropping everything and rearranging my day for her. So when she came back five minutes later I told her I was supposed to have an phone interview at 4, but it was postponed until 4:30 so she should look somewhere else for a ride. Which was a lie.

I kinda feel like an asshole but part of me feels like she is taking advantage of my kindness. She probably knew about this deadline for weeks if not months. If she had asked me a few days earlier I could have scheduled it in. Lately she just seems manipulative.

1461,Not the A-hole,"This happened a couple years ago but it's something that keeps coming up & causing me anxiety/discomfort.

When my husband & I got engaged (it was like April), we had been dating for about 8 years & it was not a surprise to anyone that we were going to get married. We do the whole tell the parents thing & they are all excited, later that day I realize that we hadn't told my older brother so we call him up & share the good news. At first he's excited & then asks when we are thinking about getting married. Since we had only been engaged for about a week we hadn't really set a date & I mentioned a date that was about two years in the future but clearly stated that we didn't really know since we hadn't been engaged long & had to plan.

My brother then says ""oh well it looks like I may beat you guys down the aisle."" I laughed but when he didn't laugh as well I stopped & said ""wait, you're seeing someone?"" He apparently was, they had their first date on Valentine's day (February) I kinda brushed off his comment about getting married before me & told him that I'd love to meet & get to know her. Especially since she was the first girl he ever dated & ""brought home.""

Couple months (~July) Husband/I set a wedding date that's ~9 months in the future. We also meet the GF, I think a good fit for OB. In August, we get a call from OB saying that he & GF are engaged. Wow, congrats! Ask about the story & all that, but I never really thought to ask about a date (I was admittedly too wrapped up in planning to be considerate).

2 weeks later OB calls me & asks if I'd be ok with him getting married before me. I was (stupidly) shocked & said I'd have to talk to Husband about it since I was unable to process it at the time. That day I went over to visit my husband & asked him what he thought & shared how I thought it was crazy that OB&GF wanted to get married so quickly after beginning to date. Husband wasn't ok with them getting married before us & agreed w/me that it seemed fast. I also spoke to our mom/older sister they both agreed that I was within my rights to say no if I was uncomfortable about it since he asked.

2 days later I called OB up & told him that it did make me uncomfortable but if they really wanted to get married before us then I couldn't stop them.

They ended up setting a date for 2 weeks after my wedding.

Ever since OB/his wife have made comments often about how they ""really wanted to get married in February"" (I didn't realize that they wanted to get married on their 1 year anniversary, which I do feel bad about) & have heard them bemoan the fact that they couldn't have the flowers they wanted for something like that.

Am I an asshole for letting my feelings known or should I have swallowed them? If YTA, what (if anything) can I do to make it up to them? Thanks for your thoughts & harsh judgments.

EDIT: Husband and I started dating at 14 which is why it took us ""so long"" to get engaged.  We were engaged by 22, married by 23.",299,315,0.92

My sister is pretty hopeless.  I own a real estate company.  I hired her to clean one of my listings, paying her $350 on top of the $400 the client was paying her, to help pack as well as deep clean.  This is WAY over industry standard.

1465,Not the A-hole,"Hi there. I’m on mobile so sorry if the formatting is weird. 

I’ll start with some backstory. Five months ago, I was dealing with constant jaw pain and numbness in parts of my face. After seeing doctors and dentists, I finally landed at an oral surgeon’s office who took an X-ray and found my wisdom teeth were technically impacted but actively growing at the wrong angle. The reason I was experiencing numbness is because the my teeth are pressing down on a nerve, and surgery will be necessary to prevent possible permanent damage. I scheduled my surgery to land specifically on spring break for my school. Pretty much all of my professors this semester take off points for missing class, so missing an entire week was entirely out of the question for something I’m paying $21K for. This was in December.

I asked my boyfriend immediately afterwards if he would be able to watch me for my surgery. He’s ending trade school so we planned ahead to make sure he would be free during the time I went for my surgery. Everything fit perfectly and we confirmed this was the plan. 

This all changed about three weeks ago, when he got a call from a possible employer who was demanding that he start training on the same day of my surgery. My boyfriend asked if he could delay until the day after and explained the situation, but the employer basically brushed him off and said “she knows it’s a job right?” 

That annoyed me immensely, seeing as this surgery is necessary and I’m not allowed to be by myself, but whatever. We had a heated discussion about it and I told him that if he can’t do it to let me know NOW so I can arrange a “baby sitter” as soon as possible. He kinda went back and forth on it and then decided that he doesn’t want to work with this specific company and that he’ll bring me for my surgery. Okay, cool, I can relax. 

Today(less than a week before my surgery), he tells me he can’t take me to my surgery. We get into a huge argument and he says he wants to go to the interview so that it can be on his resume for future employers to look at it. I’m pissed because I can’t find anybody to take me, everyone I know is busy. The paperwork specifically says I’m not allowed to leave the center by myself because I’ll be under the influence; someone has to check me out, so I can’t even get an Uber. He says I should consider his employment, but I don’t think any future employer is going to care that he got a job interview and trained for one day then quit. In fact, I think this shows a lack of commitment. 

I feel super guilty because I don’t want to say he can’t go to his interview but now I have to ask a friend to take the day off last minute. AITA for being angry? 

EDIT: I should probably mention he has two other employers waiting to offer him a job. ",25,36,0.89
1466,Not the A-hole,"Throaway because my friends follow my main, and this topic is kind of heavy.


So last Sunday, I went to the beach with my family. My mom was there with us and everything seemed fine. After texting some friends, I decided to put my phone away and go near the shore. I put my phone in my backpack and leave for an hour or two. When I come back, I notice my mom looking glum, and a slight feeling that something's wrong. When I check my phone, I notice some chats I hadn't opened where now opened, which surprised me (My phone has a password, but if you swipe near the time it's locked down you don't have to put it).


I asked her if she grabbed my phone, and she replies she didn't. But I know something was off and decided to just let it go. Our relationship is pretty shaky, so she might just have been mad at something I did. Last night though, she entered my room and asked me a bunch of random questions, finishing it with ""Have you ever had sex? Was it with a girl?"" I replied yes to both, and being a guy I found them completely normal mother-teenage son questions.


Then, however, while we were talking about something else, she starts telling me how she browsed my computer and phone since she had heard a rumor about me doing drugs from a friend of hers. Not only was this not true at all, I just wanted to drop the subject and go to bed. That's when she said she had read my texts with a specific girl. Let's call her S. I immediately froze because she's my best friend, and one of the two people who knows I like guys. She kept bringing up how she did it for my own good and how all she wanted to help me. I was trying to keep it all together, but this was sort of like the cherry on top of everything. I told her it had just been one guy and we hadn't done anything together. He had just been friendly with me and there was a connection. And that I still preferred women (I don't).


Anyways, this went on for two hours. She kept telling me she did it for my own good and how she wanted to help me because I ""needed"" help. To clarify, she doesn't mean correcting me or anything, but she thinks that just because I like a guy, my life is going to be a depressing nightmare of shame. 


Thing is, I've known that I'm gay for almost 4 years. My 2 friends have been really supportive and I feel like I really am fine. In the end, she told me to either get help myself or she'd call the school for programs.
Personally, I feel like she snatched my thing from me. I wasn't planning on coming out to her anytime soon, but I still feel like this really wasn't the way things should have gone. But what really annoys me is that she justifies breaking into my phone and reading my private conversations just because she's my mother. I'm not speaking to her anymore.



TLDR; my mom checks my phone while I'm not looking, sees things she shouldn't have, now believes I need help for something I really don't.

I mentioned condoms to my boyfriend, he just said he doesn't like them and as it's not too long we should just wait. We can do other stuff, oral etc in the meantime.

I don't have a lot of spare money and so what I spend on food is usually all I have. Usually  what I buy, I have to make last until the next payday. Each meal is calculated and planned for my work lunches. 

After work I was at the gym and I receive a text from my girlfriend asking if she could cook some of my chicken breasts that I set aside for my lunches because her friends were hungry and specifically wanted the chicken. I replied with, ""I'd prefer if you didn't. Can you use the pork instead?"" She didn't like this response and proceeded to say ""No its fine, I told them you said no...thanks."" Knowing my girlfriend and how she can be sometimes, I tried to call her and work through the issue. She was still mad and I was at the gym so I gave up. She kept calling me back and I did eventually realize that I had some extra chicken (a decent amount) in the freezer which I told her I forgot about and I would be more than happy to let her use it. This particular chicken was what she had wanted to use in the first place but I confused it with the chicken I set out for my lunches. 

This still didn't make her happy and by the time I got home, our other roommate defrosted some of her own chicken so my girlfriend could use it. My girlfriends argument was that I should have not said no to begin with and should have just let her take it; she stated she would have given me money to buy more or gone out and bought more herself. This last statement was hard to believe as the next two proceeding days she works nights and wouldn't have time. She stated that if my friends came over she would give them whatever they wanted and tried to be a good host and person. 

Regardless I didn't feel as if I acted out of line asking if she could use the pork instead and once I realized my mistake I thought I corrected myself and gave her what she wanted. It all culminated with her saying I am inconsiderate, mean, and so forth.

She pushed me and I just said I didn't know why I don't like it, I just found it a bit, well, icky. She mentioned she gives me a bj to completion at least a couple of times a week and that doesn't bother me and it's essentially the same which is a fair point I guess. However even then she knows I don't like kissing after. 

Now she's all upset and I'm a bit cpnfused, we can't always like everything and I didn't say anything or try to make her feel bad. I don't know, I understand this is completely trivial, yet here we are.

Basically I saw my mate cheat on his girlfriend of 10 months with some random woman at one of his gigs. He’s in a band and performs away from home at least once a month. I happened to be at one of his away performances in January of this year and saw him cheat. He even confessed to me over text everything that went down. 

In February I then met his gf and I felt super bad for knowing what I did. I asked my friend 3 or 4 times to come clean but he refused. So I asked him a final time, he said no, so I told his gf myself. Of course he knew it was me and got pissed that I didn’t give him a heads up so he could prepare. 

I’ve told people in my life this story and have gotten both “well done” and “you’re a cunt”. Just thought I’d see what reddit has to say.

1474,Not the A-hole,"Backstory on the people and location - Long time friends of mine and my wife (known her 15+ years, him since they've been together) stay with us occasionally. They live several hours away. We know this couple well, have traveled with them, my wife was in their wedding, etc. Overall relationship is very good. Her parents are in the same area as us, but have a small house that is at capacity and not convenient for them to stay in so they usually stay at our place. We have a guest room with a nice bed, they have full use of a separate bathroom, a driveway where they can leave their car without blocking us in, etc. We go out of our way to make sure everyone has what they need. Last trip, they brought their baby and we had a portable crib set up and rocking chair in the room. The bed in question used to be mine but wasn't used much after my now wife and I moved in together as she had a larger bed. Many friends and family have slept on the guest one recently, including me occasionally - no complaints. It was quality when I bought it, not some cheap ""it's only for the guest room"" bed.

So, the wife in this couple comes out for the weekend to go to an event in our area. We repeatedly offer the guest room, but she declines each time and stays with her parents. I figure since it's just her and she had no car because she flew in, etc. it was just easier. My wife had dinner with her one of the nights she was in town. I wasn't there, so I'm hearing this third party, but it's from my wife and I believe the details to be true. This person informed my wife that the real reason she didn't stay with us is because this bed is ""so uncomfortable"" and her and her husband couldn't stand it the last time they stayed with us a few nights as mentioned earlier. I thought this was pretty audacious to bring up about free accommodations even if what she was saying was accurate. She then proceeded to show my wife texts FROM THE HUSBAND encouraging her to bring up how bad the bed is! My wife arrived home around 10:30 that night and told me about it. She felt bad (scratching my head over that reaction). I nearly hit the ceiling. I thought it was incredibly rude and ungrateful, not to mention completely false. If anything, they have a hardness/softness preference that this bed doesn't meet, but that doesn't make it a bad bed and sure as shit doesn't mean I should have to do dick to resolve it.

To further complicate matters, my wife informed this person that we have another mattress in the basement that is unused and maybe they could try that one. Sorry, but there is no way I'm moving a mattress up two flights of stairs in the off chance that it \*might\* be acceptable for people who stay with us maybe 6 nights total in a year. On top of that, I'm not inclined to do anything besides make a hotel recommendation after this load of unappreciative bullshit over what is essentially a free and very convenient, safe, and quiet place to stay.

1475,No A-holes here,"Edit: I’m not worried so much about society judging me “transphobic” and way more worried about being an asshole and potentially hurting Sam emotionally.

Burner account for privacy.

Sam (not real name) has been my best friend since 3rd grade. We bonded over being semi-outcasts. We weren’t bullied, we were outsiders, introverted and liked nerdy things like anime. We’ve best friend and basically have hung out every day since middle school.

We ended up going to the same college. Sophomore year we got an off campus apartment together. In like November, Samuel came out as Samantha, and began transitioning. Of course, I supported her 100%. She’s been my best friend for years and I want her to do whatever she needs to be her most authentic self.

This year,  Sam was presenting as female full time. We kept hanging out all the time like we did before, and our friends started to jokingly refer to us as a couple. Sam starting dropping hints about us dating for real. I didn’t pick up the hints until *she* finally asked *me* out a in January. I said yes. I figured that we hang out all the time anyways, and I like Sam as a person a lot. Maybe there’s another layer of romance that hasn’t been uncovered, you know? I was willing to give it a chance.

On our first date, we went to a show on campus and then hit a few LGBT-friendly bars. At the bars we started being more physical and sexual, until we went back to our apartment and made out. As it was happening, I felt like, although it felt nice to touch and be touched, it wasn’t amazing, and I didn’t feel romantically connected.

To be honest, I think a major factor is the fact that Sam is trans. Even with hormones and makeup, she still has a male skeletal structure and masculine voice and and frankly, a penis. I don’t want to be bigoted, but all that makes me less sexually attracted to Sam. But I figured—hey, maybe it’s just because of society’s beauty standards etc. so I’m biased and should just give it a chance. We’re still dating and getting more and more sexual.

The more we date, the more I feel like I’m just not attracted to Sam romantically. I’m not enjoying being physical with her. And then I feel dishonest for pretending like I am because I don’t want to hurt her feelings. I’m so worried that if I’m honest about not being into her romantically it will crush her, which would crush me because to be honest, I love her more than anyone outside my family—but I’m pretty sure I just love her like a sister. But I also don’t want to live a lie and both of us deserve to be with a partner that we’re fully sexually satisfied with. And plus we live together, so this is gonna make things really uncomfortable and awkward. And how would we even go back to being just friends again? Could we even?

This last weekend we had our first date. I get there early and wait for her outside and she shows up much larger than in her pics, but she's still cute and I'm not a picky man (plus tmi... dat ass). I figured that the pictures she'd used were from last year and that's fine. Not all my pics are recent either, I just threw up my best. 

The date was actually awesome. The crush is still strong even as I'm typing it but... fuck I was suspicious, alright? That whole twin thing was a weird red? yellow? flag, especially how she talked about her sis. Nothing bad, just... dismissive? Idk how to describe it. Anyways, so I check Facebook and the pictures she had used were from her sister's profile (not fully public but one was her profile pic and another one was visible on there so I'm guessing the rest are hers too). And I'm not sure how to feel now. On one hand, I like her. On the other, she's using her sisters pics to get dates and that's... weird?? But they're twins so she legit would look just like her sis if she lost a bit of weight so it's not really lying??? And I get why she did it, we all got flaws we wanna pretend aren't there, but????

I asked my coworker's their opinion and it's divided as fuck (one lad said I was fat-shaming/lacking empathy), so since I found this sub recently I figured I'd ask here. WIBTA for canceling our second date because her pics don't match?

At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. 

However, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said “oh sorry, here you go” and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn’t know how to react. I wasn’t sure what to say so I just said something like “did you really just throw that on the road?” And he nonchalantly was like “yeah” and shrugged it off. 

After seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I’m not a “save the earth” eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive.

She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well.

In hindsight I guess there’s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I’m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest.

 So this passed Monday, around 11 PM I was just scrolling through my texts to clear up space on my phone and saw she hadn’t texted me in awhile. Then I saw it was the same on Facebook and such. My heart just kind of... broke. I don’t know. I know this all sounds very petty, but it did. So I texted her saying, “So like you never wished me happy birthday... what’s that all about?”

Her response was this: “? I could ask the same of you??”

I’ll show the rest of the conversation, her replies will be marked by the letter “H”. 

Me: “I did. I sent you a whole collage and then sent you a Jake [one of our dogs]pic on messenger. I went around the house for baby pics cuz 20 is the end of teens and all you know?”

H: “I just happen to have randomly woken up rn but I don’t know why you’re up right now and I feel like you just want to start a fight or create a problem so I’m going back to sleep as should you and you have found something to be angry about that you had a week to mention.”

Me: “I’m not angry and I can see why it can be misinterpreted as angry cuz I was just sending multiple texts but the multiple texts was to clarify when I had said happy birthday. And when I asked about why you didn’t say it it’s cuz I just felt weird about it that’s all.”

H: “I don’t necessarily think you’re angry I just think that you have made something an issue just to have an issue because it’s late and the issue doesn’t really exist and you’re just making up a reason to be resentful.”

Me: “It’s just hurtful I guess. It just showed I wasn’t on your mind enough to text a quick “hbd” at the very least is all I’m trying to say.”

Her: “If it is so hurtful I don’t understand why you are mentioning it a week later that seems unfair.”

Me: “ I’m mentioning it a week later because I was hoping you would still end up sending something out eventually. But yeah sorry for being unfair I guess and it is late, I’ll go to bed.”

Her: “Whatever.”

1483,Not the A-hole,"So my GF and I have been together for a about a year or so now, we're both in high school - I'm about to graduate and she has another year to go.

My GF's best friend is a fuller gay gentleman (we'll call them Norman) who is the same grade as her, they've been friends since grade school, and she was his main support structure when he came out in late middle school.

Now Norman is Very open about his gayness, to the point it gets annoying sometimes - but, I get it because he's excited to be out, so we just let him do his things with the hopes he reels back a little with time.\*Note: I'm not the only one who feels this way, the whole friends circle (which includes other gay guys and girls) agree as well.

Anyway, so here's the deal: Norman gets very grabby with some of the people in the group, especially the girls...He will often ""jokingly"" grope the girls in the group and make comments about their breast size, texture, and if they're getting turned on by it. He will also often want to wrestle with them (sometimes by surprise), which; because of his larger stature, ends up with him on top of them and touching them inappropriately (breasts as well as crotch) and saying sexually suggestive things  - He does this to my GF the most.

What kind of annoys me is that most people will just play it off and say it's ok for him to do it because he's gay. IDK, it just really sounds Unkosher to me, especially because this is at school and he's been doing it more since I told my GF I wasn't very comfortable with him doing that stuff - at least to her right in front of me.

It now looks like he will purposefully go out of his way to touch her inappropriately right in-front of me, I really feel this way because he will intensely glare at me while doing it.

Idk, I talked to another friend about it and she said that I needed to put my homophobic feelings away and let him be this way.... I really don't feel like this is right....  AITA?

**\*\*UPDATE 3/5/19 9 hr after posting: First of all, thank you for all the input. This has really helped me think everything through, and really calmed me down - I was actually kind of having a nervous breakdown thinking I was some kind of homophobe for how I felt when I posted this... So again, thank you for for all the support.**

**\*\*Second(sorry if this is messy, pretty emotional atm):**  So a friend of mine, a girl in our friend circle we'll call **J**, saw this tread and on a whim hit me up asking if I posted it (she was the one who introduced me to this Sub, and with how popular this got, it kinda became hard to miss - she also allowed me to post this following info, thanks J!). I confessed I did, and she told me that Most of the girls in the group were actually very uncomfortable with how Norman was acting and treating them. They were gonna go to the administration themselves weeks ago but, Plot twist, my GF pleaded they don't - **Apparently she doesn't really like his actions either** but didn't want to see her best friend get kicked out or reprimanded for it in fear of him taking it out on her and unfriending her. J told me my GF had talked to them about how I felt, and when they told her what she was doing (not telling norman to stop) was disrespectful, she got very defensive of Norman - **Saying that apparently I'm just a big Homophobe that she would be dumping before she tells Norman to change** (apparently she told them that he should be allowed to express his sexuality however he wants)... She also apparently told him to do it more in front of me to annoy me/make me jealous... Now, if I didn't know J as well as I do, I would have never believed any of this.. but screenshots and other guys and girls co-corroborating this really nailed this coffin.

J cried through all of this and apologized for not telling me sooner, she was trying to schedule a one on one with me, but her own life troubles kept getting in the way. The girls were really trying to convince my GF report Norman with them, but now that I know everything they're ditching that plan. We will all be going to the administration regarding this tomorrow, and **I will be confronting my GF \*\*EDIT: And Norman** and most likely ending our relationship. I really do not feel like I should be with someone who mocks my concerns and degrades me to others behind my back. Not sure what the hell is going on between those two, but honestly I am just so done with this right now.

Thank you, I will update more after tomorrow.

Edit4: Formatting  


**Update 2 3/6/19 : Once again, thank you all for the support and input (and the gold holy moley, first time) - this has really helped me keep my composure with everything that has happened. Really didn't really expect this to effect real life the way it has.**  


**So here's what's going on:** Sorry if this might come off as short/anti-climactic, though J is still cool with me sharing - the others girls (and their parents) aren't as much, so I was asked to keep details to a minimum regarding things involving them - if you hear anything about this IRL, I ask that you do not harass or engage with anyone involved - as I have been made aware that such actions could influence some aspects of what will be happening.   


As for me, to keep a long story short, I met with my girlfriend in the morning before class. She was not made aware of what I learned, so it caught her completely off guard when I confronted her about it. I could tell she was trying to formulate some kind of defense in her mind, but all she managed to do was mumble a few things before bursting into tears and trying to apologize. I told her it was over and just left, I didn't want to do something I'd regret with all the emotions storming about. After that, I met with my friends (some of them came with their parents) and we headed to the administrative office. Again, sorry, but I will not be sharing more from this point on due to many obvious reasons, chief of which being respect to friends' request - However, I can assure you that matters have been taken over by the appropriate authorities.   


Thanks for all the support,

1484,Not the A-hole,"So we live in New England. It's not warm right now. Highs around 40, lows around 0. 

Last night my girlfriend wakes me up because she thinks she can see her breath it's so cold. I just let my bare shoulder sneak out from under the cover to feel the air and WOAH she was right. It was fucking freezing in there. 

While I am super uncomfortable, my main concern is the integrity of our plumbing. I DO NOT want our pipes to freeze and/or burst, so I tiptoe down the hallway to the thermostat to see that the heat on the second floor (where all the bedrooms are) is off completely. I assume this was an accident and turn it up to 62. Pretty conservative if you ask me. 

So anyway, I wake up to a string of text messages to the roommate group chat. The roommate who shall not be named apparently heard me get up and turn the heat on. He sends two side by side pictures, one of the thermostat set to 62, and one of another thermometer in his room reading 64. 

He says - and this is text messages copy pasta - ""Well it’s at 62 and my rooms at 64 so there something wrong with my heat."" He goes on to basically insist that until the landlord fixes the heat on the second floor, it's staying off. 

I tell him it's not broken. That two thermostats in two different rooms would often read a degree or two different. He says he can tell the difference and it makes him uncomfortable - he can't sleep.

I tell him I think he's full of shit. That nobody can tell the difference between 62 and 64. But I also say he can have it his way and if the pipes burst it's 100% on him.

He is hero. I know what you're thinking, he fought for the nazis and they're evil. I'm not denying Nazi war crimes, they did awful things however you need to realize the complicated situation we were in. The Soviets invaded and conquered Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia and fighting with the Nazis was the only way to regain our independence. The Soviets committed horrible atrocities against us and were by far the greater evil. Growing up he told me stories of fighting the commies and killing those bastards. Look i know atrocities occur in war on both sides and the Latvian SS did do some horrific things including taking part in Genocide. My grandfather even knew Herberts Cukurs, who is notorious for his crimes. My grandfather and his buddies were not involved in any of that. They only killed russians. Now in University we had a discussion about WW2 and I got my Grandfather to come over to speak. He comes he relives his childhood growing up in Latvia, soviet Union and fighting the Soviets. People were so rude to him. They would ask him questions such as ""why the fuck would you join the nazis"" ""oh how many jews are you responsible for killing"" ""i hope you burn in hell for your crimes."" One Israeli exchange student stands up and calls my grandfather a Latvian hitler and goes on about how he and the israeli people will never forgive my grandfather for what he did. I just about had it at this point and I scream at his face to shut the fuck up and tell him I'd knock him out if he or anyone else ever disrespected my grandfather again.I then remind everyone of the horrors of Soviet occupation of my country (nobody in the class is from the baltic region so they are unfamiliar) and explain how living under the soviets was hell. We starved and lacked basic human rights for the 50 years. Anyone who fought to prevent that was a hero in my eyes.  The Israeli  then proceeds to call my grandfather a nazi again and say that he belongs in prison for working with the nazi and that they should've joined the soviets. I just about lose it and with all my might gave him a right hook deeply cutting his lip. He didn't get up from the floor but the class was in awe. I am now under investigation from the school administration and facing expulsion.

1486,Asshole,"So this literally just happened 5mins ago as I type this. I just sold a car to a person amd they brought a trailer to bring it back. They had a 2hr trip each way and were in a hurry to get home as it ia very cold today and we have about half a foot of snow on the ground, which makes everyrhinf worse. First I had a who're of a time tryinf to get the car unfrozen as it has sat for a year. So after an hr I get it unstuck and head inside to wait for them. Well they show up 15 mins later and begin doing their thing while i get the title ready. Well they have the car half way on the trailer when this elderly couple shows up in there car trying to get by. Well I live on what can best be described as a goat.path. it is barely wide enough for 3 cars and the people buying the car had a 2500 Chevy Silverado or some shit like that with a trailer behind it so no one was squeezing by. Well the elderly couple aita there for a few minutes and the husband finally gets out and says can we speed it up. Well we were trying but you want to make sure.that care is strapped down or some bad shit will happen. Then his wife starts honking on the horn and doesn't let up and the husband says you can just pull forward and we can squeeze by. But since the car wasnt strapped down that wasnt possible and we explained that and he got mad. I guess he knew my grandfather because he threw his name out there saying this isn't the (insert my last name) I kbow. Which is funny because my grandfather would have told him to fuck off way quicker than I did. Which I told him while i told him to fuck off. It is really annoying how that generation calls my generation entitled when he couldnt be bothered to wait literally 10mins to strap a car down properly to avoid injury and possible someone's death if that car came loose. 


Edit: so people think I just blocked the road and tokd them to fuck off....not true...they pulled up and rolled rhe window down...I waved and the guy buying the car said sorry be done in about 10...the driver then proceeds to get out and walk over to the buyer and pretty much stand over his shoulder...at this point his wife lays on the horn as he mutters Shit. That is when I call him an asshole as he gets in the car and proceeds to say that my grandfather would never have done this...when I've seen him do much worse...that dude was a huge prick..different story tho...but anyway they turn around and head out the other way which is 5 mins longer to their destination ...



Edit #2: people seem to think I was blocking the road for the fuck of it...the road is barely wide enough for 2 cars in most points. If there was another option we woukd have preferred it. But they couldn't pull in my drive as it is a hill and the top they could have pulled in but the trailer woukd be in the road and then the car wouldnt be able to pull up it as the trailer would be facing the wrong way. We having logging trucks that block the road and I and other people have waited patiently fir them to finish their thing and move w.e. needs moving. This road is constantly being blocked by people doing things like plowing their driveway or loading cars. So there is no way they haven't run into this problem before. ",80,47,0.81

1488,Asshole,"Growing up, I lived with my mom and only got to see my dad every other weekend. My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn’t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.

My dad’s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.

My mom wasn’t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.

Now my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would’ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this.

1489,Not the A-hole,"Bit of some background: future MIL was, and is, a stage 4 alcoholic. She goes through bouts of getting help and when she feels better, decides to stop treatment. Inevitably, she falls back into drinking. While sober, though I've never seen it, I'm told she's a wondeful person. Fun loving, responsible, cheerful, etc. When drinking... not so much.

My fiance has had to live with this his whole life and I feel for him. She truly is a manipulative cunt and I don't like seeing this woman use and abuse him. 

She has insulted me to the point I will not have anything to do with her. Calling him on my birthday, during which I was hosting a party for myself with my aunt and uncle, and making snide remarks about my family being dead when he said he had no time to talk. My parents are gone, grandparents too, and the aunt who took me in after they all died had just passed the month prior.

He has distanced himself. We mutually agreed to disinvite her to Christmas. She has done nothing but be nasty to everyone, and throwing a tantrum. He proposed right before New Year's and she never even congratulated him.

Last night, she texted him at 4 in the morning saying that since he was able to afford a $10,000 wedding(we have to take out a loan), she wants him to pay her back the $3,000 she put down for his college education. From over ten years ago. She had to sell her 'diamonds' for that. Mind you, he's paid for her treatment facility, housed her when the family dropped her on him in his 20s, sent her money for bills even when he knew it was for fucking booze. 

I don't want this woman in my life, in my future children's lives, at my wedding, or anything. I cannot imagine the burden she has been not only to my fiance, but his entire family. 

I don't like ultimatums, but I will refuse a traditional wedding and reception if she's to be there. I would gladly give up wearing my mother's dress and get hitched at the courthouse over having this toxic human being included in her son's big day. 

I don't think he will necessarily have a problem with it, as he has stated he's completely done with her at this point. But his family might. They've not given her a 'tough love' dose, rather they've essentially enabled her past the point of return and I fear his family may take it the wrong way if we do decide not to include her.

So, WIBTA?

Tldr: fiance's drunkard mother has ordered him to pay her back for his college tuition from over a decade ago because we're paying for our wedding. Never mind all the money he's sent her over the years or housing her for free in his 20s. She's already burnt any bridge she could have with me and I want to disinvite her from the wedding but his entire family may take offense to it. I will push for signing papers at the courthouse and have no ceremony if it is not possible.

I suggested we go to Outback since I really enjoy it, its somewhat affordable and it was a quick drive from the shuttle parking lot. She said she would rather eat glass than eat at Outback. I asked her where she wanted to go so she suggested like an overly expensive, farm to table restaurant that was almost an hour drive away. It was already going on 8 and I was starving but it also meant that I wouldn't be at home until at least 11 with all the driving and I had an 8AM class this morning.

1492,Asshole,"Please bear with me through all these details. 
Long story short, I got addicted to opiates, and then heroin, after a car accident a few years ago that left me with chronic pain. 

I am not debating my assholeness when I was at my worst. I know I was bad. I lied to my little sister (who is now 25 and I’m 28), I stole money and valuables from my parents (this is what I’m most ashamed of) and it eventually got so bad that they had to cut all contact with me. I got clean through my own doing and only after I was 6 months clean have they all been willing to reestablish any kind of relationship with me. 

Moving forward to now, it turns out my little sister is getting married in a couple of months. I found out when my sister told me that I wouldn’t be invited because even though I’ve been clean for over a year and even though she’s proud of me, she still doesn’t trust me and her fiancé agrees that neither of them want me there “in case something happens”. She said she didn’t want me to find this out from someone else so she is telling me herself. 

When she told me, I didn’t yell, but I was noticeably upset and I said, “If you don’t trust me enough to not fuck up your wedding, why even bother having me around at all?” I then asked her if this was her saying this or her fiancé saying this, as he only really knows me as the addict older brother and isn’t my biggest fan, to say the least. She then got upset at me so I just left as I didn’t want to start a fight. 

Honestly, I was and am pretty devastated. My sister and I grew up super close and she was my best friend for a really long time until the addiction took over. I can’t believe I won’t be there for such an important life moment. 

I feel as though I have proven I’m stable enough by getting a good job, staying clean, and am taking care of myself enough to come to her wedding. 

This was all a few days ago and I haven’t spoken to her since. I don’t know what my parents know about all this but they didn’t bother to tell me about the wedding at all.

1498,Asshole,"Background info:

I workout 6-7 days a week. I have been for 6.5 years and well before she was a part of my life, and in fact, my body is likely (though she'd never admit it) what attracted her in the first place. 

Lifting is my main hobby. Outside of working (currently ~8:30am-6pm Monday-Saturday, normal hours 9-5 M-F) it's really the only thing I consistently do on a daily basis. I love it, it makes me happy, and it's really the only hobby I have. By the time I get back from the gym it's 8:30-9pm and I'm tired and lay in bed with my cat and watch Netflix until I pass out. I hangout with her either Friday or Saturday night every week.

So, this girl I have been seeing for about a year now brings up the other day how she's been getting ""weird vibes"" from ""people and her family"" about how I don't see her enough. She then transitions that to ""can you skip the gym one day a week to see me more"". I think she already knew I wasn't going to do that-- she knows me, she knows I don't skip unless I have to. But I told her, no, and now she's been being a dick and ice cold for the past 3 days and giving shit about how she ""sees where my priorities are"" and how she's going to ""stop giving a fuck because that's what I want"". 

I don't think I'm being unreasonable. As I said, it's really my only consistent hobby and I even told her I'd never expect her to skip something weekly that she really cared about. I told her I could even understand if she wanted me to do it occasionally, but to expect me to do it once a week is ludicrous to me.

I understand her intention for the question is just because she wants to see me more which is great, but I don't think she should be treating me like such an asshole for telling her it's not really something I'm willing to do.

Reddit, am I the asshole?

**TL;DR: I workout pretty much daily and girl wants me to start skipping to see her more**


Edit - Relevant info for people that don't want to read through 100 comments

1. I asked her if she'd like to join my gym and see each other more often that way, she pretty much said no and it'd be pathetic to join my gym and force me to hangout with her

2. I asked what a day that would work for her is or what would work for her in general, and she read it 30 minutes ago and didn't respond. ----- she responded as I was typing this and said ""nothing because now I know it won't make you happy, I'm not forcing you to want to see me. I thought you would want to, but I was wrong"".

3. She works out at planet fitness and that really isn't an option for me. I've gone there to meet up with her a couple of times and they set that dumb ass alarm off for no reason.

**Edit 2/update**:

Took a lot of the advice I was given here from both sides (I know I responded to more people saying NAH than YTA, but that was mainly me trying to follow rule 3 and accepting that the majority thinks I am the asshole).

Anyway, I took the advice I was given, and I'm going to be working on finding days throughout the week that she isn't working where we can meet up and grab some food or really do anything after I workout, also going to try to integrate Sunday as a day I do something with her regardless of what it is.

1500,Not the A-hole,"So I attend an all boys school, and just today we had a talk given by a transgender author and journalist. It was great, and the speaker was really good, but afterwards quite a lot of people were being pretty cruel about her and trans people in general (as usually is the case). 

The guy in particular has been a really close friend ever since I came to the school, and he's really smart. So it was a huge surprise when after the talk he told me that she (the speaker) was a 'cocky bitch' who should be 'fucking put down'. Ever since he said that I've avoided talking to him as I think tht it's pretty disgusting that he thinks that way, and i don't know if I can still be friends with him knowing his views on the topic. However I feel like I'd be overreacting by avoiding talking to him, considering how good of a friend he can be.

1503,Not the A-hole,"My aunt is half way across the US with two of my second cousins who are taking care of her after she ""decided"" to stay after going there originally as part of a trip. 


She's easily influenced and cannot make decisions. We all know my cousins made the decision for her. I think it's the best place for her, but my mom is trying to get her back home. My cousins want to put her in some form of special program for her because she cannot read and throws violent fits. My cousins know how I feel about her and that's why they're trying their hardest to prevent her from coming home. 

My aunt didn't get enough air to her lungs as a baby. As a result, she's been labeled (medically) as a retard all her life.  She's been bullied, used for her money she gets from SS, and is pretty much mentally 8 years old. I don't think it excuses her actions because no one in her life taught her right from wrong. She shouldn't get everything she wants on a golden platter or get away with everything she wants.

My aunt has done nothing but treat me like shit for the past 10 years that she's lived with my family. She's stolen my toys, threw fits on my birthday, broke my consoles, pinched, punched, and kicked me.
She's also called me a slut, whore, faggot, tranny, etc, but called my dad things that are a million times worse. She's insulted my mom as well.  

I cannot forgive her.

My mom should've stepped in a long time ago to prevent this. Her handicap does not give her an excuse to treat me this way. She's fucking 45 years old and 3 times my size (I'm 16). There were times she almost fucking killed me by throwing stuff at me like knives during her fits



I understand her situation, I do. But I think it would be best if she stayed as far away from me as possible. My mom has wasted over $10k on getting custody back at this point, and she's not even going to put my aunt into any kind of program.


My dad doesn't want her back either, or my grandma (her mom) who lives with us. They all think it's best if she stays.

1506,Asshole,"Her mother passed away recently and in the will, she clearly states that my fiance alone will get her whole house while her other children only get a small amount of money each. This is because when she was sick about one year ago, only my fiance stayed and took care of her while her other children only visit her once in a while. Now, my fiance's sibling pestered her to sell the house and split it equally for everyone (included my wife) because it's ""the right thing to do"". They said she is going to marry to me and will move to my house soon so it's not like she needs her house anyway. I should also note that they are living in their mom's house (which is now my fiance's house) for free and never moved away. It's a big house with 5 bedrooms. They are all adult, the youngest is currently studying in college.

The thing is my fiance totally agreed with them. She told me her plan to sell the house and I was angry upon hearing her plan. The discussion turned into an argument, harsh words started flying out (mostly from me) and she told me I would never understand the bond between her and her siblings as I am the only child and that I am too cold blood. Well, my plan was for her to move to my house and we would rent out her house and kick all of her siblings out of the house unless they can pay the rent. Yes, I dont want my fiance to take care these freeloaders anymore. They are all adult, they have some money from their mom so they should take care of themselves. We didnt talk for one day. I kept calling but she didnt answer.

I might have hoarding tendencies (and I don't think I realized how bad until now), and am generally lazy when it comes to cleaning. I have a 2 year old, and my boyfriend is the type to do what I ask, but doesn't go too far out of the way to do much more. He is an excellent father, and will happily do any baby things. But usually our weekly cleaning is: I do laundry 5 times a week, tidy up, pet stuff (daily), and clean up messes. He usually does baby stuff, he sweeps/mops every few weeks, does some tidying, and sometimes helps with sorting laundry.
We usually switch off on cleaning bathrooms and kitchen, though he usually does the kitchen.
Anyway, he hired a cleaning lady today and after 4 hours she charged $500 and left. I took a shower and couldn't find my toothbrush and deodorant. Weird, but $20 bucks to replace and sucks because both were fairly newish (cue freak out 1- we're too broke to replace new stuff).
I go out for a smoke and I look in one of the trash bags by the back door. I see a bra and a baby hanger (I end up buying new ones fairly often because my child has too many clothes and I lose them) (cue freak out 2- I have 6 bras).
So I spent an hour sorting through the 6 bags by the back door (the trash bin is full and tomorrow's  mission) and find an assortment of things including my ski jacket, a set of personalized oven mits my sister bought for me in Italy, a litter box scoop (and another is still missing), 2 necklaces, both of my belts, a number of baby toys (mostly bits and accessories to things), more clothes, and a number of toiletry samples.
So far none of his stuff is missing and beyond a few socks I haven't seen anything of his either.
He went to bed angry because he has to go to work in the morning, and I'm considering sleeping on the couch because I'm not sure I'll be able to go to sleep anyway.
My friends all think he paid too much, and I'm not even mad about that... I just wish my crap wasn't thrown away. And I'm going to finishing digging through trash on my day off.
TL;DR: My boyfriend and I are swap creatures and he hired a cleaning lady who threw away about $250 worth of my stuff. AITA for not being more appreciative of the gesture and freaking out?

TL;DR Below

I typed this out a couple of times because I felt the context was really important, but it gets way too big... so feel free to INFO if you feel like this isn't detailed enough.

Me(T)22 and my Ex(D)20 were together for about 4 years.

Before D and I got together she was in a very emotionally, and physically abusive, and sexually coercive relationship with a Guy we'll call M. It took about a year's worth of love and therapy, at the end of which we got together, to get her out of the deep depression she was in after he dumped her.

When we started Dating, M suddenly took interest in D again, he continuously pestered her to be friends with him (which I was adamantly against. Might sound controlling of me, but after learning the kinds of things he did to D and other girls I just couldn't allow him to be near her). After 2 years of this D agreed to be friends with him - D's therapist WHO KNEW THE THINGS HE DID advised that D befriend him as a means of ""letting go"" of the past and forgiving him.

I voiced my objections to this the moment I found out, but eventually accepted it because it was what D felt she wanted. 

Over the course of the next 2 years, D would get increasingly flirty vibes from M(late night Texts, long hugs, surprise kisses on the cheek, etc), and even though I wanted and should have told him off (or beat the shit out of him) - D would tell me not to, and that I should trust her transparency about it and just ignore him - so I went along with it. That was until I found out M was getting way too flirty with D and was driving her down and away from her life goals that she had been working so hard towards - after an incident where M confessed he still loved D and kissed her when she was in no position to resist (I was not there at the time, but her friends were and did nothing to help her), we talked about how D needed to stop interacting with M - She surprisingly agreed to that, and was realizing how toxic M was to her and her future. 

A month or so later I found out that they were still hanging out and doing things that might not have been cheating, but were definitely not good for our relationship and her mental health.

I confronted D about lying to me, and told her that she needs to stop seeing him or its over between us - to which, and I quote, she said ""I can't decide which one of you I love more""... I told her things were over between us the moment I heard that.

Since then I've been getting texts from her friends calling me an asshole and saying how much they always hated me. I also learned that D has been hanging out with M to cope with apparently the worst thing to ever happen to her, which was me... I honestly feel like I made the right choice, but I'm starting to question myself.... so AITA?

TL;DR - I dumped my now ex because she continued hanging out with her friend who was her extremely abusive Ex, even after she promised she wouldn't.

1521,Not the A-hole,"A little history first: my younger brother had a stroke when he was younger and now his legs are weaker than they should be. Because of this he has to wear leg braces for support and goes to school in a wheelchair in case his legs get to tired during the day. He is embarrassed of the leg braces and usually wears long pants to cover them. He’d rather go out without a wheelchair when we do errands or go out and only really uses it for school or times we know he will walk a long distance.

We had this new family move beside us 3 weeks ago and other then saying hi when we see them on their driveway as we enter our house we don’t interact.

But it just so happens that the timing of when my younger brother’s bus that picks him up in front of our house and brings him to school is the same time our neighbor leaves for work in the morning.  The driveways on our street aren’t the biggest and with the bus arm that is meant to stop cars from driving past the bus my neighbor’s driveway gets blocked. It’s been 3 weeks and it started with them smiling at us saying “oh don’t worry” to him being visibly upset about it, but there’s nothing the bus driver can do because there needs to be enough room to load my brother and his wheelchair onto the bus.

This morning maybe he was having a bad start to his day because as he was waiting for the bus to load my brother and leave (which takes 10 minutes at max) he starts laying into his horn and then steps out of his car and then the interaction begins:

Neighbor: Jesus Christ every morning you block my fucking driveway and I’m late for work!

Me: Sorry but there’s nothing we can do the bus only has so much room to get my brother and his wheelchair. Maybe leave earlier if this makes you late for work everyday

Neighbor: I don’t have to change my schedule for you, how bout the bus come earlier and doesn’t block me in, it’s my fucking property. Also the kid doesn’t even need the fucking bus I’ve seen him walk perfectly fine. The schools 20 minutes away my kids walk to school he should too.

Now here’s where I get pissed because he’s screaming this at a level where my brother can hear as he is getting his wheelchair secured in the bus.

Me: You’re a fucking piece of shit dude! First of all you have no idea what my brother needs and doesn’t need. Secondly it’s the fucking law for you to yield for a school bus so you can either leave earlier so you’re not late for work or fucking wait for the bus to leave and go to work.

He then starts yelling at me saying that I shouldn’t ever talk to him that way and I should respect my elders but my brother’s bus had already left so I tell him to fuck off and go inside my house. My mom heard the yelling outside and told me though I’m not wrong, I was kind of an asshole with the way I said it and now our new neighbor probably hates us. 

While I guess I could have taken a better way to saying it, the dude escalated it first but I was wondering AITA?

1 st serious incident was drunkenly screaming and having a fit because it was late and we asked her to turn it down.

2 nd incident was trying to convince him to quit his well paying factory job to go to this door to door scam which thankfully he did not fall for. She did and is now unemployed.

3rd incident was the most recent. Everyone was home but him so we all went out Friday and I knew she was down on her luck so we had her come out covered her bar tab etc. she described him as controlling but had a problem with all of us saying that was not okay.... once we got home she would not stop talking about it.

Basically my dad cheated on my mom with this woman. My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.

My dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she ""deserved"" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.

It went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were ""stressing him out"" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.

The funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. 

That was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her ""NOW"". I sent her one text saying ""I don't know what you're talking about"" and left it.

1531,Not the A-hole,"Sorry for the wall of text.

My husband and I have been married about a year and a half and together for 4. He is currently 29 and I am 26. My husband has quite a large friend group that I have met over the years. We have pretty close relationships with several of his friends and others that we have maintained a more of an aquantaince relationship with. Due to us living in the same area he grew up in, most of these relationships were from his younger/college years.

About a month ago we were at a party for one of his friends that he went to high school/college with. The party itself was fine and everyone was very nice. Most of the people there I had not met yet so he went and introduced me to a bunch of his olds friends. We ended up talking with one couple in particular for a majority of the time and they seemed really nice and nothing felt out of place or weird. My husband and the other husband said we should all get together sometime to hang out.

This weekend we finally had dinner with them this past weekend. Nothing overly weird or awful happened but I kept noticing the wife giving my husband odd looks and looking vaguely uncomfortable when we were talking one on one and making offhand comments that alluded to her knowing my husband better than me which I didn't pick up at the time but when I thought about it later on that night it seemed like weird things to say. 

So, Sunday night I come out and ask my husband if they maybe had dated during high school/college. He said no, you know I didn't really date much at this time (he has told me previously that he slept around with pretty much anyone and didn't seriously date until he was 23). Naturally I ask if they have had a relationship outside of dating and he explains that he had a pretty steady physical relationship that continued for about 4 years when she moved for a new job.

At that time I no longer felt the need/want to continue hanging out with this couple. My husband got confused and wanted to know what was wrong. I explained that I didn't want us to maintain a relationship with someone he had been intimate for so long with. He thought that was dumb and made a comment to the fact that she didn't seem to have an issue with it. I argued that based off of her reaction, she possibly did have an issue with it. I also said that I was surprised her husband even wanted us to hang out, and that is when my husband said that he doesn't think her husband actually knows about their relationship. 

This snowballed into a huge fight and I said that it wasn't up for discussion and he called me crazy and insecure for assuming anything would happen between the 2 of them now. AITA?

Tldr: hang out with a couple my husband went to school with, found out later that he slept with the wife and I no longer want us to maintain a relationship with them

After that I've gotten lengthy aggressive messages from Em which I haven't responded too, they mostly say I hurt Les that he idolized me and anonymously follows my accounts, at some point he read a comment mentioning that I'm an only child and had a violent tantrum. That worries me because our father had anger issues and severe depression that I'm also dealing with. 

I'm not interested in relationship with them but feel like an asshole for not wanting to be in their lives during major life changes. AITA?

TL;DR: I'm my fathers first born from an affair, now he's left his family and his other two children want me in their life, I don't want to be and feel like an asshole, am I?",27,46,1.0
1537,Not the A-hole,"I'm having an argument with my mom about this and I really want to know if I'm the asshole here.
I am VERY sensitive to pain so after a traumatic experience with my former dentist I changed to one recommended by my mom.
He was kind of a jerk, he seemed like he wasent taking me seriously and as I was explaining how I would be willing to pay more for a less painful solution on my following intervention he says something along the lines of ""You are a woman so you need to get used to pain. What are you going to do when you give birth.""
I have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.
I really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say ""Wow thanks, I can't have kids! "". (Total lie) 
He was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. 
We ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.
I think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. 
Am I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? 

TL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. 

Edit : After reading some of your guy's stories I see that this is sadly not a rare acurance, doctors and people don't seem to take pain and advanced alternatives seriously. It's at least good to see I'm not the only one that has been through something like this and I'm not overreacting.

Although I do feel bad for lying about something so serious and making my mom uncomfortable I think that was the right thing to do although I could have handled it differently. ",279,1728,0.96
1538,Not the A-hole,"My girlfriend and I recently got into a huge argument about paying for dates. She thinks that because I make more money I should pay for all of our dates and I think that because we do things that are usually free or cheap, like under $20 per person, that we should split the bill.

She thinks this is stupid and called me cheap. She said that if I loved her than I should pay for everything since I make five times more than her.

When there is a special event that we both would like to go to but she can't afford it, I have zero problem with paying for. But I think for everyday stuff like dinners, movies, drinks etc we can both pay our own bill.

1541,Asshole,"I (20F) am in my third year of university. I have a cousin (17F) (I'll call her ""V"") who lives with her parents (my aunt and uncle) about a 15 minute walk from my apartment. I've been in university for the last two years, while V is still in high school.

We both have parents who are culturally and religiously conservative. While I was in high school my parents were very strict around issues such as schoolwork, dating, socializing etc. Beyond attending prom with a friend from church, I did not go to dances, parties or any of the usual high school social experiences. At university, I intentionally decided to live on-campus in an effort to start charting my own path.

I knew that V was dealing with a similar high school experience to my own, so I had her over to my dorm a few times in my first year to hang out, since her parents would permit that. In truth, I was also insecure about making friends and a bit lonely in the dorm initially. Over time she and I became friends with two of my roommates. We began to hang out together as a group. I think she appreciated having a chance to relax away from the stress of her home life. In my second year, my friends and I got an apartment off-campus. V would come along to parties and would come out downtown with us sometimes. It also evolved into me being a cover for her - where she would tell her parents she was visiting me, but really got a chance to see her own friends. We would coordinate our stories and ensure the same lies went to both my parents and hers.

By the end of my second year my friends and I would often go out 3 or 4 times a week. My life had become quite chaotic - I would often get home at 1 or 2 in the morning, completely drunk, and somehow crawl to class in the morning, sometimes having snorted something to get me going. Guys came and went too. I thought I was just having fun, but it was quickly unmanageable. V would hang out and drink with us and sometimes we would get high together. I treated her like another university student, as she was always so smart and mature. 

This year I've cleaned up my act. My grades are up, and I'm in a much better place mentally. V, however, is not. The last few times we went out she was wasted before we even got to a bar. A few weeks ago when I had her over for dinner she was wearing the skimpiest dress ever and it was clear she was on something. Her insta is full of photos of parties and her in crazy revealing outfits. 

This week her mom called asking if I can talk with V. She said she thought V was drinking and hanging out with boys. I think she only knows maybe 20% of the story. I avoided mentioning any of this history and just said I would talk to her about it. Another lie. 

I know that she makes her own choices - she turns 18 soon. However, it feels as though if I had not invited her into my life, partially for my own selfish reasons, she would be in a better place in her own. I think it was too much too soon. AITA for enabling all of this?

1543,Everyone Sucks,"First I want to mention that I am 24 years old, so not a child. But I am still in the car with my dad quite a bit. However my dad has always done this thing where if you say anything that upsets him while he’s driving, he SLAMS on the gas and drives as recklessly as possible to intimidate you into shutting up. He does this no matter who is in the car with him, and has done it ever since I was a kid.

When I was younger, my mom reminded us to put our seatbelts on whenever he got in these moods and always double checked to make sure we were wearing them when he stepped on the gas. For about ten years, I have ignored this request. I feel like if he’s going to drive recklessly and put everyone in danger to prove a point, I’m willing to let him kill me so that he has to live with the guilt of killing his daughter for the rest of his life.

I know this sounds harsh, but I absolutely HATE people trying to bully people into agreeing with them and he’s always done this. I want him to see how dangerous his behavior really is.


Edit: So I feel like I need to clarify a few things. First of all, a couple of months ago my sister was in an awful car accident where she was extremely lucky to get out with minimal injuries. She was driving my car at the time so I’m without a car currently. I can’t  just take an Uber or the bus because I live in the middle of nowhere in a county with like 1500 people tops. We don’t have any public transportation and I can never get an Uber out that far. Most of my friends live 30+ minutes away in the opposite direction of where I work, (my workplace is an hour away with no traffic) its way too much to ask for someone else to help me out. He’s the only one that lives close enough to where it isn’t such a big hassle. It’s just a situation I’m stuck in until I can replace my car. 

Second, for the people criticizing my mom for only telling us to “buckle up” when he got like that, I won’t go into detail but my dad used to be more abusive than driving dangerously. He used to be incredibly violent (Mostly towards my mom), and she tried on multiple occasions to get us and herself out of the situation but he always found us and forced us back. She did what she could to keep us safe. My dad is and was friends with most of the police in the area and when she called the police on her for the abuse he would pretend to be asleep (yes, really) and they would leave. Which is why we couldn’t just report him. Whenever he got pulled over I our or the neighboring counties he would just get warned to “Watch your temper behind the wheel.” The only chance of him getting into any real trouble is if the state police caught him. Which they never do. He’s not nearly as bad anymore and most of my family have made amends with him. So when I had no choice but to ride in the same car with him again, it really hurt me that he still does that particular but, especially considering the fact that, like I said, we almost lost my sister in a car wreck.

That all being said, I do realize now that although I’m not the only one ITA. I already knew that my behavior was petty and childish, but I hadn’t thought about the fact that my actions could cause someone else to get injured or killed. Not to mention the fact that essentially what my end game (Should an accident occur) was emotional blackmail from the grave. No matter who that anger is directed towards, it’s an incredibly toxic way to think. Thank you to everyone who made me realize that, especially those of you who weren’t particularly rude about it.

Side note, I’m not suicidal but I do have a concerning lack of self preservation. I don’t want to die, but I’m indifferent towards the idea. My life isn’t really that important to me, so the fact that I was willing to die to prove a point didn’t even set off any alarm bells. And yes, these are all things I intend to bring up to a therapist when I can afford one.

1545,Not the A-hole,"Flying from Atlanta this morning I am about to give the flight attendant my boarding pass when a man cuts in front of me (he is in a boarding class above me), no bid deal but he does knock my shoulder in the passing process. Upon swiping his phone he is assigned a new seat. As I hand my pass to the flight attendant he comes back because the new seat is at a lesser value than what he paid. After several minutes of arguing with flight attendant and her informing him he will be reimbursed the difference he goes down the bridge. 

By the way, our flight is delayed 45 minutes. 30 mon just because and another 15 because somebody got sick on the plane and they had to clean it up.

We get to gap to get onto the plane and the guy in front of me stops the attendant and has an almost word for word replay of the conversation from just a moment ago with the other attendant. We’re at about 10 minutes of this guy bitching at this point.

We walk into the plane and he gets to the seat that was his, they had upgraded a paraplegic from basic to comfort so their gear and assistant could have the space (it’s immediately behind first class so there’s a good amount of space in front, next to and behind area, only 2 seats in a 3 seat row). Anyways this dude goes, this is my seat, I paid for this seat. 

The flight attendant comes by and they interact and he gets to a point where he says I don’t care which one of them sits in seat A, I want seat B! This is another 5 minutes of arguing before he goes back to his new seat 4 rows back, and yes he’s right behind me.

After everyone is boarded he dings the assistance button and AGAIN starts asking about his seat and a refund and how un happy he is, you can tell the flight attendant is over it, we are all over it and this guy is persisting.

Finally, again, this guy climaxes about just wanting the seat he paid for and I turn around and say ‘will you shut the hell up and be grateful you could even walk into the damn plane today‽’ (referencing the handicap person in his seat)

And the guy looks at me and says ‘how about you mind your own damn business?’ With some sass.

1547,Everyone Sucks,"Hello, I (31F) have been married to my husband (28M) for roughly two years, we dated for 1 year before that. In my past life before working at the church, I was a bartender at a popular bar. I made enough money to pay off my car and some credit card debt that never seemed to go away. Unfortunately, I had some issues with addiction and was not living a healthy lifestyle at the time. I had a couple of serious boyfriends and a dozen ONS before meeting my now husband.

I disclosed that I had a rough time through my early to mid-twenties before we got married and was willing to be honest with him whenever he asked about anything. My husband is an old-fashioned type and follows the adage of “a gentleman never asks, and a lady never tells”. This was fine for me because I wanted to leave the past in the past and he wasn’t a jealous type while we were dating.

However, I have a few tattoos from the days when I was in one of my serious relationships before my current husband. He never asked about these ones, so I didn’t feel like it was something that needed to be discussed. Whenever my now husband *generally* asked about my tattoos (I have a lot of them) I told him simply I liked the art, which is true. I knew when saying this in the back of my head that some of them had baggage and did not want to dig that up. At the time, I know he would have understood.

The conversation of tattoos did not come up again until a year into marriage. Because of talking about the loose associations some of them had, jealousy issues started finding their way into our relationship. Let’s say one of them had to do with my ex’s metaphysical snake. I love him dearly, I do. I want to spend the rest of my life with him, but these jealousy issues are starting to get cumbersome. It seems like every time he talks about this, he is possessed and wants to know all the dirty little details of this particular person in relation to himself.

I feel like he is views me like I am trash, even though he is using a calm, respectful tone. I feel like when he goes deep into the rabbit hole about this, the only way to help him is to talk about the details that he is asking about. Every time it is like putting the nail in one coffin but opening up ten new cans of worms. After growing tired, I told him that I do not want to talk about it anymore. Seemingly out of anger, he told me that he wants the tattoo removed or covered up.

I feel like he had his opportunity to find out about the details of all my tattoos and get them removed before the wedding. I could have been more open and forthcoming about the intimate nature of some of these tattoos, but we were seemingly operating under the don’t ask don’t tell philosophy. But now, there are early memories and wedding pictures tainted. I am hurt by him requesting me to remove the tattoos because it makes me feel objectified. It *seems* that this is leading to an ultimatum and I have decided not to remove it. Am I an asshole for not removing the tattoo?

Edit:

Yes the tattoo is about my ex's endowment. ",59,41,0.64
1548,Not the A-hole,"
Hi there r/AITA, I’m a 14M here. A few days ago, my dad called the police on my mom for assault. In a nutshell, a discussion about money became a fight, and my mom mainly started it but my dad was the one who called. After my dad called, my mom continued it instead of calming down. I witnessed most of the fight as I was trying to get my parents to calm down. My mom came into my brother’s room and told us not to tell the police anything, and later almost broke my brother’s phone because he was recording some parts. When the police came, my mom told them that the punch was accidental. When the police questioned my brother and I, we told them everything we saw and also the fact that our mom wanted to keep everything a secret. They thanked us and made our parents have to stay away from each other for a while. 
 
 Two days later, my mom came back and had a private talk with me. My brother and I now have to be witnesses at a trial, and my mom wanted us to plead the fifth. She said that “people usually don’t testify against their moms” and started getting worked up over going to jail. She told me about how people get killed in jail and how I didn’t care about her dying. She also stated that we would have to move since she would be fired from her job if she went to jail. She told me I was taking my dad’s side, and wanted to move out because she didn’t feel loved. She also sounded a bit mad at me for sharing the fact that she didn’t want us to tell the truth and the fact the my brother recorded some scenes. She was proud of us for being truthful earlier, though, so she was sending mixed signals to me imo. AITA for believing that my mom is trying to guilt me into pleading the fifth at the trial?

1549,Asshole,"My Ex left me about 7 years ago when our daughter (let's call her R) was 5. Since then we have shared 50/50 custody. I have re-married and have a 2 year old daughter with my wife and recently learned we have another child on the way. For the most part co-parenting with my Ex has gone well. We have always been able to work through the occasional conflicts. My Ex is a good person and loves R very much.

&#x200B;

R has been letting her grades slide. She gets excellent marks in all her classes. But lately she just hasn't been doing her homework. She says she forgets. Sometimes she has even done the work, but just doesn't turn it in. We have done EVERYTHING we can think of to help. Teacher conferences. Daily agendas signed by each teacher and reviewed at home. Daily homework checks. I work with her in the evenings (when needed) and take her to the library on the weekends she's with me to work on her assignments. We have taken her to Doctors and enrolled her in counseling to see if there is anything medically or psychologically that is contributing. So far the general consensus is that she my be suffering from mild anxiety. We have been working on this for a few months now.

&#x200B;

My Ex and I have different parenting styles. In my house people are held accountable. We all have responsibilities and we count on each other to do their part. I am not talking about anything extreme here. On a typical week night I do the cooking, R does the dishes, and my wife bathes the toddler. One of R's responsibilities is to keep her grades up. When her grades dropped there were consequences. I ""grounded"" her. All her electronics where taken away until her grades improved. No TV, no Netflix, no phone. Analog hobbies, musical instruments, and TV in the evening with the family were all still allowed, if she was caught up on schoolwork. I told R that she would remain grounded until she had at least a 3.0 GPA. My Ex's approach to parenting is much more laid back. I'd describe it as the ""let's be best friends"" parenting style. There were no consequences for R's falling grades at her mom's house. Neither of us agrees with the other's approach and the conflict between us has been growing rapidly in the last couple of months.

&#x200B;

This weekend R was at my house and things just fell apart. Earlier in the morning I had asked her to clean her room. I walked in a bit later to check on her and she just started screaming at me. She was furious. It took several attempts to get her to calm down enough that I could understand what she was saying. That's when she told me that she hated being with me, and she wanted to live with her mother. No words have stung me worse. I was in total shock. But, I think she is old enough to have some input into her living arrangements. I reached out to her mother and explained the situation. Mom was more than happy to come to her rescue and I have not heard from either of them since.

&#x200B;

AITA for being too hard on my daughter?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I should clarify the GPA thing... I am asking her to maintain an A or B in each class. Her grades are all posted online and we check them frequently. She is NOT grounded until we get grades at the end of the semester, all she has to do is catch up on the missed work.

1550,Asshole,"Not as serious as some of the other stuff I've seen on this subreddit, but I'd like to ask nevertheless. 

I'm a high school student. Recently, a coffee shop opened near my school, and I've taken to going there a lot (almost every day I'd say). It's really peaceful and atmospheric, and is a nice change of pace from school. I like studying there (and I get a lot more done there than at home), or just hanging out.

I'm thinking of going there later today to do my homework, but I don't want to buy anything. I've purchased something every other time I've gone there, but as a high school student (no job) this obviously isn't good for me money-wise.

I'd feel bad for not buying anything though, because they are a business in the end, but I don't want to spend money.

Even though it's an unloseable case for me, it's still time and effort, with no guarantee of seeing the money if she's too poor to even pay back the abysmal rate we agreed on.

""Hey. You may not know me and I'm still unsure as to whether it's inappropriate for me to send this message, but your daughter [L] borrowed $1500 off me to buy that dog she now has. There was a clear agreement in writing as to what has to be paid back and when and she is not paying it back. I send messages, both on Facebook and SMS and she ignores them - I think that's a clear sign that someone's dodging their obligations. The next step is to sue for it, which in this case for me is unloseable, but I'm just wondering whether or not to avoid the legal fees she'd be forced to pay you could either tell her to finalise it, or you could pay me it directly and then take it up with her.

1555,Not the A-hole,"Let me start by saying I am not a meninist, someone who subs to MTGOW or incel-like ideologies. In the least virtue-signaling way possible, I am a self described feminist and a liberal. 

That being said, I hate it when my friend(s) say that they hate men, as I am a man myself. Something about it rubs me the wrong way. I know deep down they are not talking about me, but whether I like it or not being a man is part of my identity. And when they say that, even if in their mind they aren't calling me a bad person, they are attacking part of my identity. 

This is something common in my friend group; a lot of the women will use phrases like ""men are the worst, men are ____, I hate men"". It's taken as a joke, and I didn't let them know it bothered me until recently. One of the worst offenders sent a message to our group chat about a guy she had a gripe with, and in her text, she explained something she did by saying ""or maybe it's just because I hate men"".

This was the straw that broke the camel's back, and I messaged her privately telling her how I felt: that while I realized she wasn't talking about me it made me feel uncomfortable having group conversations with her, especially because she knew I was present. 
She responded by saying that if I wasn't a bad man, than she wasn't talking about me. She also said that because I find it offensive I'm probably doing something bad she doesn't know about. (Not entirely sure what the implication is there, but I didn't like it regardless). 

I responded by asking if she wouldnt mind it if I said ""I hate mexicans"" or ""I hate women"" (of which she is both).  She said that it's different, because there aren't a majority group of mexicans or women who deserve that hate, unlike men apparently.

Side note: as I am writing this I know it sounds like rage bait, but I really just want to know if I am being too sensitive. She is a good person overall, but I feel like this is something she got wrong and I need some outside parties to set the record straight.

1556,Not the A-hole,"A bit of background: I have very severe period cramps. I’m on strong painkillers, which have side effects that make me very drowsy.
I’m also dealing with a number of mental health issues, one of which is anxiety about whether or not I deserve help/special treatment (this is relevant)

So last week, I had very bad cramps. They were so bad that while I was in school, I was curled up on the floor of the common room unable to move. I end up having to miss a mandatory assembly because I can’t move. My teacher is an amazing woman and is completely understanding when the situation is explained to her.

I end up missing two assemblies, but that was last week, and I assume the situation is over.

Fast forward to today, and I’m having a really bad day mentally. I’m exhausted, and extremely self loathing, and I’m contemplating skipping lunch (also mandatory)

I skipped lunch every day last week, which has resulted in teachers monitoring who goes to lunch.

I tell my friend I don’t think I can go to lunch (I have an issue with food, and anxiety around people eating). She is usually very understanding with my mental and physical limitations, so I assumed she’d be okay with it.

Instead, she rolled her eyes and said ‘oh yeah, like you skipped assembly last week’.
I was rather taken aback, but I reminded her that I skipped because I couldn’t move.
She said ‘yes you could have, it wasn’t your legs, was it?’

At this point I’m starting to freak out internally. I’m thinking, if she (my best friend) doesn’t believe me when I say I can’t do something due to a physical limitation, what does everyone else think? I’m getting very anxious, and I go on the defensive.

We have an argument, and I say that I think she’s being very insensitive to my situation-I don’t enjoy having to miss out on things because of my period, especially since it’s for a month every week (I miss out on good stuff as well, I often spend whole days in bed when I can’t move)
She takes offence to this, and tells me about all the times she’s supported me with my mental health issues (which she has, brilliantly) and how ungrateful I’m being.

I tell her that I’m extremely grateful for what she’s done for me, and I end up apologising for calling her insensitive. 
She apologises too, but begrudgingly, and I can tell she doesn’t understand why I’m upset, but I don’t dare try to explain for fear she’ll get mad again.
I know I should have handled the situation better, but it’s hard to deal with when I’m already dealing with a horrible, depressed day.

1557,Not the A-hole,"My mom got herself a dog on my birthday last year. He’s a Weimaraner puppy that my mom bought from a breeder. At first, I was really not looking forward to having a dog in my house even though I live with my mom only half the time. I am allergic to dogs and even though Weimaraners are “hypoallergenic”, I still experience hives from his slobber and when his fur makes contact with my body. 

My mom has had him for a couple months now, and, although promising she wouldn’t become a dog mom, she’s become a dog mom. Everything she does revolves around the damn thing and she can’t leave the house for more than an hour without feeling bad. Last night we went to a concert and she had her ex boyfriend come over and care for the dog while we were gone. What the hell? 

I feel like I could understand her love for the dog if he was sweet, but he’s an absolute menace. He ate my glasses, my heart rate monitor for the gym, my project for school... he’s not disciplined at all and every time he destroys something of mine it’s always my fucking “fault” for leaving it in his reach! I have to come home from school and spend my time that I could be working on homework sitting in the backyard with the dog to make sure he doesn’t get into anything. I am not allowed to work on my homework and watch the dog at the same time because that would mean “I’m not giving my undivided attention to the dog”. I have been grounded for this “offense” before. 

I understand that the dog is a puppy but he should’ve grown out of this phase already and my mom should discipline him! I had to buy myself a new pair of glasses (~$150), a new monitor (~$250) and I got docked points for turning in my project late because “my dog ate my homework”. He fucking did! 

I’m sick and tired of having to care for an animal I want nothing to do with. I don’t like dogs in general and I try my best to avoid them but it’s difficult when one lives in my fucking house!  

My friends always tell me that he’s so cute and sweet and that I’m wrong for disliking him. They say that I’m just projecting my frustrations with my mom on the dog. Are they right? Am I the asshole for hating the dog?

EDIT: I am a high school student with very little money (about $600 I’ve saved up from a summer job) and I had to pay for new glasses and a heart rate monitor myself with no help from my mom or dad because it was my fault I left the things within the dog’s reach. In the case of my glasses, I put them on my nightstand. No idea wtf the dog was doing in my room with the door closed. For my monitor, it was in MY CAR that my mom DOESNT USE and he still got it. I can’t stand them. ",106,84,0.93

1559,Not the A-hole,"WIBTA for calling the sheriffs office for my neighbor parking in front of my house? 

We moved into our house in June. According to the HOA, and the police dept says people aren’t suppose to park in the street. The streets are narrow and school buses, and emergency vehicles can’t get by when people park in the street.   There’s cutaways I’m the street so you can park there if needed and we all have driveways big enough for 4 cars. Our neighbor does it on a regular bases in front of our house. I would normally be bothered by it but they come home late at night. So my wife and I go to bed and the car isn’t there but most nights that my 1 year old son wakes up around 11-12 at night they are parked there the next morning. So it seems like they are interfering with my sons sleep. We’ve talked to the HOA, and they’ve said there’s nothing they can really do other than call the police to come give them a ticket but they’re not willing to do that. 

We’ve asked our neighbor politely twice now to stop parking there, they are waking up our son at night when they get home, and for a short time (2-3 weeks) they do stop. But it always starts back again. I’m getting tired of it and refuse to not be taken seriously about it issue that involves my son. 

Would I be the asshole for telling my neighbor, “we’ve asked twice now, this is the third time, I’m not going to ask again, next time the police will be involved” ? ",74,104,0.94
1560,Not the A-hole,"About a year ago, I met a woman at a party and we hit it off. In fact, we slept together on the night we met. In the course of this, I discovered that she was significantly younger than me (she's 19, I'm 35).

Some time after we met, she reached out to me on social media, wanted to meet again in a more dating context. I was reluctant for two reasons: first, I was fairly sure she had a boyfriend by then and, two, I wasn't entirely comfortable with our age difference. She assured me that she didn't have a boyfriend and, over time and a number of conversations, I came to believe that our age difference wouldn't be an issue. 

Finally, I agreed to meet, and offered a time and place. She declined, so I offered another time and place. We went back forth like that for a bit until she finally simply ghosted me. I felt a bit like a dumbass, and was a bit butthurt, but I dismissed it and moved on.

A little bit later, I saw some posts on social media from her that made it clear that she *did* have a boyfriend, and had at the time we were talking about getting together. I considered the whole thing a bullet dodged.

Recently, in the last month or two, she's been posting on social media again, but now she's describing her recovery from drugs (which is news to me, I didn't even realize she was an addict.) She's also talking about how lonely she is, how sorry she is that she burned so many bridges, and how she wishes some of her friends would be willing to re-connect now that she's clean.

This woman sounds like ten pounds of trouble in a five-pound bag, and I really don't want to get dragged into any of it. But a good friend of mine (whose advice I typically trust) said that I was being too mean and that I should reach out to her and at least be friends.

So, am I the asshole for not wanting to get involved with this woman and all of her drama?

TL:DR A woman lied to me about having a boyfriend, convinced me to date her, then ghosted me. Later, she claims to be getting clean from drugs and wants to rekindle the relationship at some level. I want nothing to do with her. AITA?

He is my little brother, 14 years old (me 22), i love him to bits but he has gotten to this edgy phase in his life, he has become extremely disrespectful to me and my mom, gets extremely violent or aggressive when he doesn't get his way, and is generally a cunt, if i buy takeout for the family and don't eat it right away say i go for a nap or something, he'll eat my portion without a thought, even if he has ate his he'll eat mine.

&#x200B;

when i confront him about it he'll say he didn't know, like i bought everyone they're separate dish and he already ate his but he'll take mine too, call me randomly names while i'm on the phone or on discord w/ friends.

&#x200B;

so one day i had enough of his disrespect and picked up everything i bought him and sold it to a friend, my mother called me heartless and that was the worst thing i could have ever done, and 2 days after bought him another computer, his behavior has not changed and he still acts the same, calling my mother a bitch and all that.

&#x200B;

only lesson he has learned from me selling the computer is if he crys to momma he'll get whatever he wants(and he knows this because he said it to me)

Will try and keep it short. I (23 F) am bisexual but I get crap from straight and gay people as I am currently in a relationship with a guy, despite having previously dated both women and men before, and my best friend is gay.

My best friend had  came out 6 months before this happened, but everyone and their mum knew, and understandingly became very much into pride, extremely vocal about gay rights etc. which I stress, there is nothing wrong with, but this did make him come across a bit sensitive about things. He's not like this anymore.

We were hanging out and our conversation went like this, not exact words but:

Best friend: Something about Gay Pride this year, excited to go, etc...Me: I dunno man. I think I'm going to give it a pass from now on.Best Friend:  Why so? It's really importantMe: I find it silly that it's went from a free event to celebrate and support the LGBTQ+ community to costing a fortune to go, do anything, and I'll be honest, I don't like how I get dirty looks when I show up with my boyfriend.Best Friend: Ah I guess.

Then it were really awkward. A little while later, he asked if I was going to a gay bar he had started going to because no one wanted to go with him anymore. I said no. We are all into metal and punk, and the gay bars in our city all play this crappy pop, synth, dance music.

Best friend then blows up at me, accusing me of being homophobic, not giving a damn about LGBTQ+ rights, and just in general insulting me. I tried to explain but he wasn't having any of it and accused me of faking being bi, despite knowing my previous dating history. The thing is, I used to go to Gay Pride every year, but now it's like £40 entry, everything's like festival prices for food, items, etc. and the music playing is acoustic guitar singers and z list pop bands, and I get made to feel uncomfortable if I attend with my male S/O. I also barely drink. I mainly go to gigs, and I hate sitting in bars, nevermind a bar that plays what is in my opinion shitty music for hours on end. This happened a few years ago. We have made up since then but I wouldn't say we're best friends anymore. We more just catch up with each on FB and very rarely hang out. AITA?  


TLDR: Happened few years ago. Best friend had came out 6 months prior, became super passionate and vocal about gay rights, which was fine. I'm bisexual but dating a guy. Got into convo about Gay Pride, how I don't want to go because it was purely a money maker now, as opposed to being about gay pride and I get shady looks for being with a guy. Asked me to go to gay bar that all our friends had stopped going because we're all into metal, and they play dance/pop. I said no because I hate the music and don't like sitting in pubs, he called me homophobic, got extremely angry. Made up since, but rarely hang out/only ever talk on FB so still friends, just not best friends anymore. AITA?",62,49,0.8

1568,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway. My girlfriend and I are in a huge/ potentially relationship ending argument. I need to know if ITA. 

I’m in a very LDR with basically the girl of my dreams. Absolutely beautiful, smart, driven. Things have been great despite being a several hour plane ride away from each other. 

She came to town, and I was so pumped to introduce her to my friends. They threw a party, and while on the way, GF randomly asked “are there any girls I should be worried about” This is probably where I fucked up,  but I explained that a girl I used to see will likely be there. Explained that we were supportive of each other during our respective divorces, and we hadn’t seen each other since well before I met GF. I was asked if we ever slept together. I said yes, because...we had. Also important to say that we never told out mutual friends about our fling, it wasn’t a big deal. 

Everything started out great. Everyone was so welcoming to gf, including ex who was there with a new guy. 

GF gets drunk and made a comment about single moms dating being weird, almost directly after ex mentioned  her children. She randomly asked why she divorced ex husband...in front of everyone, and then asked, again in front of everyone, where we had gone on dates. I was honestly so surprised. So was everyone else. 

I apologized to ex and her guy as they were leaving, and she said “no worries. Play 23 year old games, win 23 year old prizes” (were all in our 30s) and gf heard this and sobbed in the bathroom for the rest of the night. She was so devastated that I didn’t tell her that was out of line; however, I feel like nearly everything gf said to her was out of line. 

We got into the biggest argument about how I didn’t have the decency to stand up for her. I told her honestly, I should have stood up for ex when gf relentlessly tried to embarrass her, and she can’t be surprised at a little passive aggressiveness after the way she acted. 

She’s now back on a plane, and we will “discuss further” once she clears her head.

Am I the asshole?

Edit for clarification: friends are all in our 30s, girlfriend is 23. 

Edit 2: update: I’ve gotten a ton of requests for an update, so here it is. I admitted that I’m an asshole for how I’ve gone about things, and how uncomfortable she must have been. I adore her, but I’m not comfortable with the default response being “I’m jealous, I’m going to be rude to someone I don’t know” 

She is embarrassed and feels that those friends will always “choose” the other girl. I tried to explain that they would never choose, that they do love other girl (in their wedding, kid was a flower girl, etc) and that I can’t do anything about that, but I do know that every person there has embarrassed themselves drunk in front of each other. Every one of them, and I definitely think she can recover. But she doubled down on the jealousy a bit, and the situation made us both realize that we glorify each other from a distance, and that it’s probably not going to developed past this. 

For the record, neither me or the other girl have feelings for each other that aren’t strictly platonic. Yes, I understand her comment was towards me. Plus, her new guy is a great guy, and really tried to make her (and everyone else) comfortable in an uncomfortable situation, guess I should take a page out of his book. ",1659,15257,0.93

Now on Friday, we were out of food and needed to go grocery shopping again. I wasn't feeling up to going out so my brother said he'd do the shopping on his own, but he'll need my card since he was running low on cash, to which I declined. I had planned to visit my gf in Birmingham during the weekend (I told him about this prior), I didn't want to risk the chance that I might not have enough cash for all stuff I might end up doing there. I then bring up the fact that if he hadn't gone and bought that video game he could have funded groceries, and that he was making his problem my own.

This past Christmas we were both home with our parents and he brought up that he would be visiting Boston come March. I said he was free to crash at my apartment with me and my other two roommates. I told him that we have a pull out couch in our living room that him and his girlfriend could sleep on. However, this turned into a screaming match where my brother and mom yelled at me and told me how selfish I was for not letting him sleep in my bedroom (while I sleep in the living room). After about 20 minutes of this, I gave in and said ""sure, they can stay in my bedroom"".

&#x200B;

Fast forward to this past week and I started to rethink having him and his girlfriend stay in my bedroom. He said he would clean the sheets and everything, but the whole thing still weirds me out. My two roommates (who I each share a wall with), said they also feel uneasy having my brother and his girlfriend sleep in my room. So, I texted my brother a few days ago about how I feel pretty uncomfortable with the whole situation and would much rather they crash on the pull out couch in our living room. The living room in our apartment is connected to the kitchen, and basically comprises the entire communal space in the apartment.

&#x200B;

This set off a string of texts from him about how selfish and self-centered he thinks I am and how he would now need to pay for an Airbnb. He also said that his girlfriend doesn't want to stay in the living room. I get that I said he could stay in my bedroom over Christmas, but that was after being yelled at for 20 minutes by him and my mom. I should have given him more than a 2-weeks notice, but I am not sure if that would've changed his response.

1579,Not the A-hole,"I definitely feel like a potential asshole for this, but I'm at a point where I can no longer see satisfying sex as an option with my boyfriend. 

A little background: My boyfriend (26) and I (20) started dating 7 months ago. My BF is only the second guy I've had sex with and in the beginning of our relationship I would get really nervous every time we'd have sex. I wouldn't be able to have sex for longer than ~5 minutes without becoming uncomfortably sore.

My boyfriend was very understanding towards me and eventually I became used to having sex for longer periods of time. I also gained a lot of confidence in myself, and for the first time in my life I've begun to enjoy sex as something more than just a way to please my partner.  

However, within the last couple of months I've noticed that sex with my BF has become a lot less passionate and more one-sided. For example, our usual sex consists of him pressing his dick against my back and making little noises indicating he's in the mood. I have a pretty high sex drive these days so I'm almost always willing to oblige, but once we start it usually only lasts about a minute until he finishes. After that, he continues on with whatever he was doing before he got horny and I'm left lying there feeling 1) mildly used and 2) completely sexually frustrated. 

I've explained to him multiple times that I do not enjoy this type of sex, and that it makes me feel used and frustrated. He's always apologetic and says that he will do better next time, but the same thing happens again and again. 

Now whenever we have sex he asks for a blowjob first so that he can last longer when we have sex after, but that is almost never how things go. He lasts his usual 1-2 minutes, and afterwards I end up feeling twice as used. It honestly feels like he couldn't give 2 shits about my pleasure and only cares about his orgasms.

Recently I've started thinking about mentioning an open relationship to him. I know it seems drastic but in all honesty I just want good, passionate sex. I would prefer to have that with my boyfriend, but even with all my pleading it seems like he just isn't interested in that anymore. 

Am I an asshole for considering this? And WIBTA if I brought it up to him? Any and all advice would really be appreciated here. I love my boyfriend, and I would love to have good sex with him again, but he just doesn't seem that interested in me anymore and I don't know what to do.

I'm talking levels of wealth that my future grandkids would not need to work for a single day of their lives. I own a bunch of properties that I buy and sell.

I met a girl about 4 years ago who seemed pretty fantastic. This woman was born into a dirt poor family and went straight into work after highschool. She barely made ends meet but was a happy and humorous girl. We started dating, and for the first year I hid my wealth from her because I didn't want to attract gold diggers.

A few minutes after the last customer left, he comes back inside, acting hysterical. He tells me that someone must have taken his wallet off the front desk while he was arguing with me a few moments ago. Immediately I jogged to the front entrance for a look around, then went over to the security computer to see if I could roll back the camera feed. I couldn’t; it was password protected.

I went back over to him and told him that I wasn’t able to open the security feed, and that the thief was probably long gone already. I asked if he could come back tomorrow so that my boss could access the recordings, even offering to come in early so that the three of us could go over it together. He was furious at this, he got loud and demanded to use our front desk phone, or my personal phone, to call the police. He told me, very aggressively, that he wasn’t going anywhere until he’d filed a report and until the police had arrived. He told me that since the theft happened on my watch, I'd be in serious trouble for refusing to help him. 

I told him I was tired, that I had a class at 8am in the morning, and that a missing wallet that isn't likely to be recoverable isn't even going to put a dent in the list of priorities the police have. I told him I needed to close up shop and go home, and that I wasn't interested in placing a call and then waiting with him until maybe 2am for them to show up, or in dragging my boss out of bed to come in and do the same thing.

We argued and she told me to just go on my own but she was very angry and still brings it up. Saying ""I let you go to that thing on your own why do you need to go to this too.""

1585,Not the A-hole,"Basically, my brother (16) was playing on his PS4 still at 4 am while talking to someone through his headset. It woke me up so i went to his room and asked him to stop talking as me and my parents were all sleeping (or well, trying to). He got into a rage and yelled at me to fuck off and get out of his room. 

As his PS4 is connected with a cable to the router in my room, i told him if he didnt stop being loud i’d cut his internet off. Not even 5 seconds later he was talking loudly again so i went ahead and i cut all the internet to his room off and went back to bed. He stormed into my room yelling like a psycho telling me to put the internet back on ‘or else’. I told him no as its 4 am and everyone wants to sleep. He got so angry that he threw his playstation controller and his phone on the floor (which are both broken now). This also woke up our parents who got mad at me for ‘being dramatic in the middle of the night’

Btw, hes now crying that he broke his own stuff and blaming me for making him angry.

1587,Not the A-hole,"I’m currently 26 and live on my own in CA. I was born and raised in MA until a couple of years ago when I decided to move out. Anyways, my father passed away since I was 17 and since then, my mother signed me off as independent and took me off her health insurance. She told me everything last minute. 
She hasn’t exactly been there for me growing up either. When I turned 18, she told me to live on my own and she will find a place for just her and my brother. Growing up since then, I’ve been on my own financially. She’s barely helped me grow up into the person I am, asked me for money all the time and she’s never helped me get my license. I used to ask her to help me practice to get my license and she’d say no. I also asked for help financially on driving classes but she refused to help. Since then, I accomplished everything else on my own. I used to be jealous of people my age back then who would graduate earlier than I did. Couldn’t really afford school because I couldn’t afford to be in debt. 

Before moving into a different house, she asked me for my SSN so I can become head of the household and take care of the bills. Mind you, I was 18 at the time and wouldn’t be able to afford anything, and I’m sure my credit score will be ruined. But she would cover it up saying that it won’t affect me if the house is under my name. Later I found out she asked me for my SSN because she filed for bankruptcy. Of course at the time I said no because I did my research on what could happen if the house was put under my name. 

A couple of days ago, she texted me for my SSN. I asked her for what reason. She said “I don’t need a reason just need your SSN” and I said “Nope, I need a reason for this. “ we haven’t talked since. Am I the asshole? 

Since I moved, we also barely talked. 

EDIT** 
Thanks everyone for the response and messages! I appreciate the time you all took on your response. I never planned on giving her my SSN because I never really trusted her in the first place(I was more close to my father). I was in conflict with myself whether I was being really mean on not trusting her on anything and even thought of cutting her out of my life tbh. I was also afraid of what my other family members would think of me for not trusting or respecting my own mother(the older ones are full of gossip) but idgaf.

I do other chores in the house but she has done all the cooking- she makes breakfast, packs lunch and cooked dinner She never complained about it

However around 2 months ago she decided to go vegetarian for ethical/environmental/health reasons. She completely changed her cooking and stopped cooking meat entirely. I just find this so annoying since I enjoyed her cooking before and I'm a meat person. If I ask her to make something she used to make she'll say ""I can make it myself"" which is annoying because we had an agreement. I've talked to her about this but she thinks there's nothing wrong with what she's cooking and she makes sure it's tastes good.

I see that the children have designated helpers but otherwise are treated exactly the same as all children, expected to perform the same routine and participate in all the same activities, and generally seem to strike a great balance of being assisted without being discriminated against. I thought this was really cool of the school and teachers, and I expressed I was happy my daughter is attending such an environment where she can see and learn that just because people have different abilities, doesn’t mean anything is wrong, and everyone should be treated equally.

My friend took immediate offense to this. She said in return something like, “if you really respected disabled children and saw them as equals, you would not see their disabilities at all, and you would not even need to mention them being at the school as a ‘good’ thing because it would be just natural and not worthy to mention.”

Background: I am engaged to be married in August. My fiancé's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. 

Apparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fiancé apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fiancé was like ""aren't you so happy?""

I told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way.

1594,Not the A-hole,"My friend and I hopped down to a local brewery/bar last night to enjoy our Saturday night and get our drink on. I want to be clear that this is strictly a bar, like the kind if bar where they check your ID before you go in. It's not a big brew pub with restaurant food and plentiful seating, it's intimate and small and they serve primarily beer.

When we came in, it wasn't super busy, but there was a family with two small children, under the age of 4. Weird, but okay. However, as we drinking and chatting, I start noticing that the kids at the other side of the bar are being fairly rambunctious, standing on their chairs, screaming, and well, just being kids. After two drinks, this started to get on my nerves, as it is a small bar and the noise carries. The parents were doing nothing to quiet their kids and were just letting them yell and run around.

I tried to ignore them and focus on my friend, when I felt something body slam my leg. Yeah, one of the kids fell into my bar stool, and as kids do, it started to cry loudly. Mom came rushing over to get her kid and when she was picking him up, she looked up at us and chuckled, ""oh sorry, kids huh?"" 

My friend, being more polite then myself, just shrugged and said ""oh no worries"". Mom then said, ""hah, they're cute but such handful"". Me, being irritated and tipsy said, ""I don't think it's very cute that you're letting them run around unsupervised."" The rest of the conversation went as follows (to the best of my memory).

Mom: Seriously? They're just kids, they have a lot of energy.

Me: Ma'am this is a bar, of all the places you could have picked to let your kids run around in, this is probably the worst place.

Mom: I think your rudeness is unwarranted, they aren't hurting anyone.

Me: This is a BAR, where adults come explicitly to drink, where patrons underage are forbidden. I'm not sure why they even let you in. You have some nerve calling me rude while you ignore your kids and let them run into people and disturb our peace. 

Mom: I said sorry that she hit you, but I'm not going to apologize for trying to have a good night.

Me: Whatever you say, just know that many people don't appreciate kids in bars, and don't find them to be cute. Control your kids.

Mom: You don't need to be such a bitch. 

After that she walked back to her table and they stayed for probably another 10 minutes before leaving (probably because the kids wouldn't stop crying for not being allowed to run amok anymore).

1596,Not the A-hole,"Hi everyone, so my wife and I just had a baby, who is a girl. We have given her a female name and occasionally dress her in pink clothes or a bow, but otherwise have been raising her with very little gendered anything. I'm not going to give her exact age but she's young enough that she has zero concept of gender whatsoever.

Everyone in our family is very excited, including my cousin. (All adults in this story are 30-40 years old.) My cousin, who we’ll call Alex, is always someone I’ve gotten along well with and is one of my favorite family members. Alex has gone through years of exploration and trauma regarding their gender identity and currently identifies as gender non-conforming and uses female pronouns.

We have gotten along with her really well through the whole pregnancy except for the fact that she refuse to use she/her/hers pronouns for the baby. We have decided to use female pronouns for the baby because we believe that those are the pronouns that the baby is most likely to identify with as she grows up. Alex firmly believes that children should be allowed to choose their own pronouns when they are old enough to articulate them. My wife and I strongly feel that if our child doesn’t identify with her pronouns that we will fully support her by using whichever pronouns she wants. We also fully intend to let her engage with a full range of toys and experiences throughout her childhood that aren’t defined by being “girl” activities.

When we are in conversation and refer to the baby with female pronouns, Alex will respond using they pronouns. It is uncomfortable and also seems to be implying that the way we are raising our child is abusive or unacceptable. At best it seems passive aggressive.

I want to ask her to stop but I want to be sensitive to her trauma around gender issues? Am I the asshole? And if I am not the asshole, is there anything I can do to respect their experience while still using female pronouns for my child?",262,1523,0.93

My dog is not good with strangers (only men for some reason, god knows why) and he jumps back.

He fell back (not my intention) and bursts into a fit of tears. His mother appears out of nowhere and starts inspecting him and holding him. I get dirty looks from all angles.

1599,Not the A-hole,"First time poster here.

This happened this past summer. 

We live in a HCOL area. Lots of wealthy/entitled people. We are not poor, but (very) far from wealthy. 

The wife and I take our kids to the local public park. Now, this park is awesome and FREE. It has a huge splash park, three playgrounds, tennis courts, paved nature trails, etc.

The final cool feature it has, is a full sized carousel. This is the only thing that costs anything, besides stuff at the concession stand. It’s $5 USD per child, per ride. This is where the conflict occurs. 

After a fun morning of splash pad, my wife and I decide to get our kiddos some ice cream and then head to the carousel because you have to buy tickets at the concession stand. The carousel only runs every 15 minutes and by the time we get to the carousel people/kids are piling in. Now, my son can be picky and normally I don’t play along with his pickiness unless he’s willing to be a big kid about it. So, when we see the only seat left is a non-moving horse, intended for very small children, I ask if he would like to wait 15 minutes for the next one to get a better seat. He says yes and waits, just being a good kid, eating his ice cream and choosing the type of seat he wants. 

He settles on an eagle. It’s huge and colorful and he's really excited for it. 

Cue the Other Dad (OD). We make small talk ask our boys, who were about the same age, which animal they are going to pick. My son says the eagle, the other little boy says a lion. Cool. 

At some point in our 15 minutes we talk about how our local movie theater is great because you can pick your seat ahead of time and not be at the will of the “Social Contract” of waiting in line for your turn to pick a seat. From this I get the feeling that we’re both on board with the seat choices and the way our next shared experience should go. I was wrong. 

As soon as we get let into the carousel OD flat out runs right to the eagle and plops his son right on to it. 

I gotta be honest, I was flabbergasted. Normally, I would have just been like “oh well, dude’s a jerk” and helped my son pick another seat. I didn’t this time. I just had had a conversation with this guy. WTH?!

I looked right at the guy and said “ Really?! We just talked about this” He shrugged, as if to say “tough cookies.” 

Nope. Not good enough. 

Now, because of the nature of this ride the seats filled up quickly around us. I looked at him AGAIN and said “Really?” It was uncomfortable, to say the least. 

After a few VERY tense moments, he picked his kid up and moved him to another seat. And his kid started bawling his eyes out. It was bad. I felt bad. I still kind of do. 

I picked my son up and put him on the eagle and he thoroughly enjoyed his ride. We walked home with our ice cream cones. 

So, AITA?

TLDR;
I made a kid cry because I made his dad give my son a seat on a carousel after we had all discussed which seats we were picking.

He had mentioned that it's something he does this time of year to make some extra cash and I volunteered to help him today since he's not really a big fan of mine and I've been looking for a way to prove that I'm a good guy who'll treat his daughter right. We both went out in his truck and we spent a couple of hours going around a nearby neighborhood and shoveling snow off of driveways.

Things went good on the work aspect, but things went bad when we stopped for lunch. He did drive-thru for Chick-Fil-A and he pulled up to the speaker and asked for two meals with two bottles of water. I told him that I wanted a soda, but he starts yelling at me that I'm getting water because he doesn't want to spend the extra money for a fountain drink. I just sat back and shut up so that I couldn't be yelled at again. We got our food and he told me not to eat any in the truck since we'd be home soon. I was starving and I really was resisting the temptation to try and sneak a waffle fry while he wasn't looking. We reached a point where he was looking into his side-view mirror and I quickly snuck a waffle fry, but he saw me. He looked over to me with a pissed off look on his face, but he was also distracted and he had to slam on his brakes to avoid rear-ending the car in front of him.

1608,Not the A-hole,"Okay, I really am going to regret this later. 

Let me set the stage. I am 17 years old and I have divorced parents. I go one week with mom, one week with dad. I absolutely love my mom. We've had our rough patches, but we're close through and through.

My dad is okay. He cheated on my mom, causing the divorce. He married his paramour, then they broke up. Things were decent when my dad was single. It was just me, my dog, and my sister.

Then dad got with someone else. Immediately red flags go up. This woman is around 10 years younger, yet she looks older. Let's call her Brittany. Her and her daughter move in a week after I found out my dad was seeing someone else and I find out they got engaged a week later.

Brittany drinks a lot of box wine, leaves her things everywhere, and never cleans. She makes weird ass meals every day that rots in the fridge. She didn't have a job when she moved in, brought in student loans, and vapes with an old, disgusting juul.

She has strong views on feminism, but on a ""men are pigs and woman rock!"" side. My dad is a POC and she constantly brags to her friends about how she's a white woman who dates outside of her race. She always wears flip-flops and cheap, dirty pajamas and thinks it's quirky.

Brittany has a daughter I will call Kara. Kara is a clumsy 11 year old obsessed with looking older. She steals me and my sister's things so much, my sister (18) stayed with my mom full time shortly after that. Kara gets into my makeup and fucks it all up, steals my clothes and copic markers, and never cleans. 

Kara is irresponsible and told my dad about how she steals, but he did nothing. She thinks it's okay now. I have anxiety, and the way she stomps everywhere makes me panic. I told her politely to stop, and then Brittany got onto me for it. My dad only pays attention to her and ignores me, so i spend time in my room all day.

Then, to make things worse, my stepfamily and dad decided to get a pitbull. He's a decent dog, but he and my old dog, a smaller dog, fight constantly because they didn't introduce the dogs slowly. My dad knew fully that dogs barking triggers my anxiety, let alone fighting, but he still got the dog.

My stepfamily never takes care of it. I was the one taking the dogs out for walks and picking up poop when i was at my dad's house. If I'm not, poop piles up in the loft and the dogs become reckless and fight more without walks. It's really taking a toll on me mentally. 

I feel really bad for disliking them, especially because Kara is only 11. What's your take on this?

Tl:dr, My dad remarried and it's tearing my life apart.

1609,Not the A-hole,"The title makes me sound horrible but hear me out.

&#x200B;

My sister is severely autistic. She requires attention almost 24/7 and cannot be left alone. She is non-verbal and cannot take care of herself at all. Despite the fact that she is only 12 she is extremely destructive and violent and destroys anything she gets her hands on.

&#x200B;

I hate her. That should be wrong to say but it doesn't feel like it.

&#x200B;

I was only 6 years old when she was born and since then i've never solely had my parents attention. Even since I can remember the world has revolved around her. I was moved out of my room into the basement at 7 because she needed to be in the room next to my parents. All of my toys as a child were destroyed by her and my parents simply ignored me when I complained. Even when I was 14 and she destroyed a mac my school gave me I was in the wrong.

&#x200B;

Along with this I am expected to take care of her and drop everything I do for her. I can never make plans with friend because my parents ""expect"" me to be there if they need me to take care of her. Even when I do somehow get time to myself I am required to leave if they need me. If i do not then I am punished. The recent example of this is when I went to see the new spider man movie, and was ""grounded"" because i turned my phone off in the theater.

&#x200B;

It seems as if I am nothing more than a slave to them and anything involving her simply overshadows me. This last week I was chosen to give a speech at a school event. I was so exited and my parents promised to be there, but they never showed and claimed it was because of my sister. Anytime anything like this happens for me they are to busy with her.

&#x200B;

I've held this in for so long and it finally spilled out today. While talking about colleges with my father, he joked that I should get a degree that pays well so when their gone I can take care of my sister. I don't know why but this caused me to break down. I cried and screamed about how it always about her. I'm nothing more than a caretaker to them, that they always make it about her and that I'm expected to be her ""slave"" for the rest of my life.

I've locked myself in my room since then and my parents have not come to check on me. Am i the asshole here?

Wow, thank you for all the support and love that you guys have given me. I never expected this post to reach the popularity it did. Thank you all. After thinking about it for these past hours, you are right that I don't despise my sister. It's not her fault that she was born the way she is.

1613,Not the A-hole,"So this has been a back and forth between me (22m) and my girlfriend (20f) of about 1.5 years.  Looking to know if ITA, not looking for relationship advice.

We met in college, and it was in my third year I decided I didn't like my degree anymore, and decided to instead join the Air Force for at least 4 years to make money and then go back for a degree I did want.  When she met me, she knew that, and knew I was working to lose weight to qualify to enlist.

Now that I'm closer to that weight and have already talked to a recruiter for future plans, she's calling me the asshole because I'd be moving away for years and leaving her, despite the fact that she knew this the first week of dating.

AITA for wanting to serve my country?  It's not like I'm getting up and leaving, he have plans of marriage and she'd be able to go with me if she wanted to.",42,41,0.93
1614,Not the A-hole,"This situation is complicated. My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always ""in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family."" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.



The summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still ""in the future"" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.



A few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. 


So here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.



So that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.



When I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.



Edit1- thank you to everyone who commented so far. I am trying to respond to anyone who requests more information. Something that I think was misspoken in the original post is that I would not be hooking up with these women. It would be a direct sperm donation. For my one friend, her husband would be present.",413,902,0.92

Whilst he was out, I was at home looking after OUR children (our eldest who was poorly) and sorting out our house as we’re due to move soon..

1616,Not the A-hole,"My stepson is 8. I've been with his dad for 5 years, married for 1. I've been involved in my step son's life for 4 years. Last year, my step son was diagnosed with a learning disability that is not an insurmountable obstacle, but is bad enough that the specialist recommended a specialized school for him.

Between my husband, my stepson's mom, and me, we didn't make enough to afford the school. My parents offered to pay, and my husband and my stepson's mom agreed because it was best for my stepson. My parents are generous people and just came into a large amount of money from my grandmother's passing, which they have put away entirely to fund their grandchildren' education. They also live on the other side of the country, so we rarely see them, but when we do, they definitely take on a grandparent role with my stepson.

The thing is, my husband and his ex refuse to tell my stepson where the money for his education is coming from--ever. I don't think they need to tell him right now, but I think when he's older, it's unfair not to tell him that the reason he will graduate debt free from college is because of my parents' generosity. My step son's mom is open about the fact that she does not want him to know because she doesn't want her son to value my family's contribution over hers. My husband won't even engage with her over it, but I can tell he agrees with her and is uncomfortable with the difference in resources.

I'm not trying to do this so my stepson will like me more than his mom or anything like that, I just feel terribly for my parents because they aren't being recognized or thanked and never will be. On top of that, my stepson often asks why my parents don't come around very much and don't take him out and buy him gifts like his bio grandparents do, and it makes me so sad that he can't see what they're doing for him because they love him like they love their other grandkids.

My husband is refusing to engage with me about this and it's making me feel terrible. I know I'm just a step parent and not a bio parent, but it hurts me to see my family be treated like this. I just want my stepson to know one day so he can look back and understand that my parents love him much as they love their other grandkids. It's making me question how much my husband values me and how he sees me as a step mother. Am I wrong? Should I let it drop? I'm hurt but also very conflicted, because I want what's best for my stepson, but I also want my parents to feel appreciated.

1617,Everyone Sucks,"I took a 5 day vacation away from my husband and two young kids. I was discussing this at a family gathering a few weeks ago. My cousin, who has a kid about the same age as my youngest, kept saying how she could “never.” “I could never be away from her like that... you aren’t scared?” “Me and my husband are really attached, we wouldn’t want to be away from each other like that.” She said multiple things like that, several times said specifically that “she could never.”

Finally I was like, “I bet if you spent as much time with your husband or kid as I do with mine, you’d feel differently.” She was immediately taken aback, and didn’t say another word. I wasn’t trying to piss her off, I just trying to make a point. I’m with my kids and my husband A LOT. These 5 days are going to be just fine for me.

I am a stay at home mom. She works a full time job, plus a part time job. Her husband does the same thing, so I can only imagine they aren’t together a lot. My whole point was that that’s probably why she feels like she can’t, and I feel like I can.

We just went to a mutual friends wedding, this cousin was very cold to me. After everyone had a few drinks, a different mutual friend told me she was mad at me because I bragged that I got to be with my kids more than she does. I immediately knew what this was in reference too, although I wasn’t bragging.

I don’t think I did anything wrong. My comment was in response to her multiple comments. And it wasn’t anymore a bitchy thing to say than her saying she could “never” do something that I was just about to go do.

But I believe in being true to myself, so I don‘t really hide anything about my lifestyle, but we don‘t talk about it either.

Last week I came home late and began stumbling around in the flat because I was shitfacedly drunk. My dad saw me and asked if I had been drinking. I said yes, and he didn‘t have an answer for that. So I went to sleep.

Some days later he complained to my brothers about it, so one of them came to me and told me that I should have said no. I argued that I would feel like I‘d insult him if I lied blatantly in his face like that. My brothers‘ argument is that they know, but they at least want to live in the illusion that I‘m not doing anything „bad“. Like I just shouldn‘t adress the elephant in the room.

Now I‘m not so sure anymore. I feel like I‘d set my integrity aside for their comfort. They already know all my shit. I don‘t like lying to them. So, AITA?

1619,Not the A-hole,"So I made friends with two people (let’s call them Amy and Jack) and it was going great, we all had a lot in common. 

I began to notice that Amy would badmouth Jack to me and complain about him, such as his sexuality or lack of money. I thought she just needed to vent but thought they were unfair comments.

Then it got worse. Before we were all friends, a huge party had been arranged. Me and Jack were both invited but Amy was not. Me and Jack had arranged to go to this party months in advance. She knew we were both going and didn’t comment until closer to the time. She asked if we could try get her invited as she wanted to celebrate with us (Amy is shy around people she doesn’t know and didn’t speak to anyone attending apart from us), so we asked but got told no. We asked Amy if she’d prefer if we didn’t go, but she said she had no problem with it and told us that one of her other friends was having a party and she’d just go there.

Sometime later, Jack had informed me that Amy had a fanpage and asked if she’d mentioned it to me. She hadn’t. I thought it was odd she didn’t mention it considering how close we were so I asked her and she was vague about it. As i’m quite nosey, I asked her if I could see it and she wouldn’t let me. Jack ended up finding it. I found almost all of her tweets were aimed at me and Jack, slating us going back to when we first became friends and more recently, about how angry she was about the party. The tweets were really hurtful, some of them had her own MOTHER commenting (she spent most of her time slating people like a teenage girl whenever we visited) She didn’t name us, but the time frames matched up and we knew they were aimed at us. Jack just left it although he was hurt but I confronted her. She denied them being about us, but wouldn’t tell us who they were about. She then blocked us from the account.

I was irritated and used my old twitter account to watch her account. Surely enough, she continued to aim tweets at us and began posting our personal issues on there and mocking us. I confronted her multiple times but she’d just deny it and tweet more, so me and Jack both cut her off and stopped speaking to her.

Me and Jack are still friends to this day, and she is still badmouthing us to whoever will listen but we are still being told that we are horrible people for cutting her off and we’ve left her depressed. Im struggling to see what I’ve done wrong as I confronted her multiple times and she still would lie. I’ve lost friends as I won’t “give her another chance” but I really don’t want to, especially as I know her own family was badmouthing me. She thinks she’s done nothing wrong.

1621,Asshole,"I have a girlfriend, Amy, who I’ve been with for 9 months. The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. 

About 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn’t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. 

Fast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa’s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it’s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it’s finally “our time” and that she’s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she’s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn’t feeling well and left.  

Yesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):

> Amy: It sucks that you’ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. 

> Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?

> Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she’s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. 

> Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I’ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I’ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. 

> Amy: I trust you and I don’t think you’d cheat but I still think it’s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  

This went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. 

It honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn’t have to go with Melissa but I don’t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate. WIBTA if I went on this trip anyway?",287,374,0.86

1624,Not the A-hole,"Here's a link to the original post for everyone interested: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/avll8e/aita_for_not_wanting_to_live_with_my_girlfriend/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

The general consensus of the old post was that it was completely unacceptable and bizzare for my girlfriend to be okay with me being in the living room while she slept in a bedroom with her sister. I thought it was fucky too and thought there just had to be more too it.

When my girlfriend got home, we had a long talk about our living situation (we currently live together), my feelings, and her feelings.  It came out that her sister wanted her own room (she only wanted to apply to a two bedroom two bath place) and that the other guy living with us wanted his own room. The sister only wanted to share a bedroom with my girlfriend.

So I would have to be in the living room, but as we were talking the sister sent a message saying that she straight up didn't want me there because she did not ""like the vibes."" My girlfriend said she needed time to think about it, and the sister was not having it because she was applying the next day (she's not a college student, she just wants to work up here to apparently help herself and my sister. She likes her Coworkers and the area). My girlfriend and I's lease ends in 5 months. And theirs in 2 weeks.

The sister said my girlfriend could do better and that it wasn't a hard decision because family comes first. My girlfriend bought up the point that I would basically have one week to find my own place and the sister said that I should ""be a man and be independent and take care of my own shit."" When my girlfriend bought up the point that the people with more room - and their own room - in an apartment should pay more, the sister disagreed saying that it should be equal regardless of room. And then my girlfriend realized it was fucked for anyone to live in the living room, and that her sister only really cared about her own shit. 

 Their mother has always drilled family comes first into their head. My girlfriend said her sister has been this stubborn her entire life. It's always been what she's wanted, and nothing else. I did not make my girlfriend choose, but I told her she needs to do what is right by her. She needs to make the best decision for her future career, education, and goals. Make the choice that puts you closer to where you want to be. And DO NOT let people walk over you. I stood up for myself and I would except her to do so as well. 

So, my girlfriend decided to live by herself when our lease finally expires to focus on herself and her career. And I'll be living with her often, but my career field doesn't really allow me to stay for the silly lease durations here.  We then watched Free Solo and it was kind of like our relationship. I am about performance, about doing better, about following what is correct and accurate, about becoming everything you want to be. My girlfriend would like to be happy and comfortable while doing so too. We are not just things that make the rent cheaper. And we believe that our relationship is great, so, for any one confused, my girlfriend and I will live together for the next 9 months, then I'll be away for 3 months, and we'll probably get another place together after that. 

My girlfriend's final messages about her feelings was met with a ""whatever"" from her sister. I'm happy. My girlfriend is happy. I'm not commenting on her sister. ",67,508,0.97
1625,Not the A-hole,"So I (22f) slept with someone about a year ago. They gave me genital herpes. I later learnt that they knew they had herpes but didn't think it was important to tell their partners. 

So fast forward to a few weeks ago. I met a guy (25m) and we start talking, we flirt over text a bit and we decide to meet up. Before anything happens I tell him I have herpes and give him something information on it, I also give him a couple of websites so he can do his own research if he wants to. I'm on anti-virals, always use protection and never have sex curing/immediately after an outbreak. 

As you can guess, he catches herpes. This was always a risk, I told him this more than once, I even gave him a few days between telling him and us hooking up so he could research/let it sink in. I also told him explicitly that it was cool if he didn't want to have sex anymore.

Anyway, he calls me up and tells me, well he shouts it at me. I understand he's upset but he's saying really awful things about me, blaming me for what happened. I try and calm him down 'cause I know they actual worst thing about herpes is when you first have it and you suddenly feel very dirty.

He calls me up multiple times to shout at me and call me names. At one point he asks me how is he going to tell his family (why???). After he calls me a diseased whore I tell him that I'm going to block his number if he doesn't stop and he says I should take responsibility for what I've done. I hang up, send him some forums for people with herpes so he can have people to talk to and block him.

I spoke to a friend (she doesn't know him, didn't give her any details about him) and she says I should be more sympathetic 'cause it was kind of my fault?

I feel like I did everything in my power to keep him informed and that ultimately it was his choice, the only other thing I can really do is not have sex with anyone unless they know their status which like 90% of people don't.

We would be constantly going outside to play basketball and shit like that. Then one of the days I had a idea to just ware the same shirt I did the day before since I was just going to get it dirty anyways. I didn’t think anything about it. 

But when I got back home to my mother not even a day later we have child protective services at our door wanting to do an investigation because my dad called saying my mom doesn’t take care of me or clean any of my clothes. After the lady came in and investigated she was confused why she was even there. Our house was not dirty and my mom took a lot better care of me then my dad and step mom ever did. 

So after that I didn’t have to see him anymore and honestly I was perfectly happy not seeing them anymore it was miserable. This went on for maybe like 4 to 5 years ish. I decided to reach out to him because he made zero attempts to contact me. 

So when I met up with him again he just acted like it was all my moms fault that he tried calling but she wouldn’t let him. Which is a lie he never tried calling. I then maybe saw him 2 or 3 times after that between then and now which I’m 20 now and I was probably like 15 or 16 when we reconnected for the first time after he called for that investigation. 

At this point he’s told me so many different reasons on why that happened that I just decided that I don’t want him part of my life it’s always so negative when I talk to him and nothing is ever his fault. He even had the nerve to call me child ish for not texting him back and just ignoring him. 

So I just want to know if I’m really being a asshole for not wanting anything to do with him anymore. 

Also the only reason I’m using a throw away is there are people that follow my main account that know who I am and I don’t want them to know all this.

1640,Everyone Sucks,"I’m a wheelchair user, I work in a 20 story office building. We have maybe 15-20 lifts around the building, the small lift lobbies have 2 steps up to the office area, they aren’t busy as they are out of the way. I work on the 12th floor and our canteen is on the 8th floor. I use the main lift lobby which have 8 lifts. So I recently went for lunch on the 8th floor but sometime during that the 6 newer lifts malfunctioned meaning there’s only  2 in the main lobby working. I expected to wait a bit longer , but full lifts kept stopping completely full for 10 minutes, I then tried to pretend to squeeze in the packed lifts. 15 minutes go by I’m getting a bit pissed, the next list stops, people look at there feet avoiding me,  I asked if anybody could get out because I’ve been waiting a long time and there’s lots of stairwells and the outer lift lobbies are probably less busy, nobody does anything. I move forward stopping the door from closing and tell everyone the lift is not going anywhere and they are horrible people for being lucky enough to walk and ignoring me. The lift empties out and I get to my floor.

AITA , maybe people in the lift had non visible disabilities and I was a bitch 


Edit: I’ve concluded I am a sort of arsehole, it would have been nice if people had offered to get out and make room but I think telling them they were horrible human beings was out of line.  People always seem to be worried about not helping me and also patronising me, I think a lot of people in the lifts probably were just not sure what to do. Sometimes I don’t think to give up my space in the priority area ( they usually have fold down seats and offer more leg room and a space for crutches/ walking sticks and working dogs etc) on public transport to people on crutches or the elderly sometimes even though standing probably causing them pain and me just  grabbing the train or bus behind is inconvenient but not causing discomfort.

She's not paying me, her and her partner brought it up one time that they were going to start paying me but never came back to it.

But it's not my kid. 

We advised her to ask a friend of us who would like to babysit. But she doesn't want to do that, we think it's because she doesn't want someone she needs to pay. And it's not like she doesn't have any money.

1646,Not the A-hole,"I'm the front desk person at a small tech company. I made okay money for where I live, and considering I live a pretty tame lifestyle. It's not enough to afford vacations, eating out all the time, fancy clothes, etc, but none of that is stuff that I need or really want. When I take time off, it's usually to go camping in the back country, or to stay at home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. 

Some of the women I work with (not all of them) are... snooty. They'll often times get together after work to go shopping at the fancy mall nearby (with stores like Nordstrom, Tori Burch, etc), and the next day will come in and brag about their purchases, or talk about the fancy meals they had after. I always smile politely and comment on how that sounds fun -- and it does! The snooty part comes in when they sometimes ask me where I got my outfit, I'll inevitably say Goodwill or something, and they give that polite tight-lipped smile that says ""Oh, that's... cute."" I've heard them make comments about my outfits before, but I don't really mind. There are other people who work there who are much more down to Earth.

Here's the part where I might be the asshole. A few days ago, one of them was talking about how she needed a new hairstyle for spring, and she wanted to know if I knew of a good salon in the area, because my hair always looks nice. I said thank you for the compliment, but that I've cut my own hair since my mom taught me how.

She looked at me funny/wrinkled her nose and said, ""You cut your own hair?""

I said ""Yeah, salons are just too expensive for me, and I don't really do anything but trim it."" 

She snorted and said ""A decent haircut might cost something like $45, but it's so worth it.""

Here's where I messed up. My eyes got a little wider and I said, ""$45? What am I, Nelson Rockefeller?""

She got that tightlipped smile again and said ""Well, I suppose it might be a little high for... some people.""

I said ""$45 is my food budget for the week. I guess if I put that towards hair, it'd be a great way for me to lose a little weight!"" and laughed because I thought we were just joking around. 

Apparently, she didn't think it was all that funny. I can't stress enough that I wasn't trying to sound like an asshole, but it honestly shocked me that $45 would be considered cheap for a *haircut.* But she ended up going to the other girls and talking about it, and later in the day one of them caught me in the break room and told me that I embarrassed the other woman, and that she felt judged. 

I've been keeping to myself and not really engaging with them beyond work pleasantries. The other day, we were all pitching in for a farewell card for a coworker who got a new job, and the one who approached me in the break room said ""Don't worry, we'll put some money in from you. I wouldn't want you to have to cut into your *food budget*."" The two of them kind of snickered/laughed.

1648,Not the A-hole,"I (24F) have known this guy (22M) since I was in first grade. We grew up next door to each other and I considered him my brother. Even after moving away and going to colleges out of state we always kept in touch and saw each other to hang out over breaks. He was most definitely my best friend and we always joked that he was going to be my man of honor at my wedding.

Cut to 2 years ago when he starts dating this girl. She is absolutely perfect for him and is everything I would want for him and more. But slowly as their relationship got more serious he stops responding to my texts. He is always busy and can never hang out anymore. I try to be understanding that I could be intimidating to a new girlfriend since I’ve known him for so long. So every time I invite him out I always make it clear that she can come and hang out as well. Unfortunately we kinda grew apart but I still considered him a very close friend, so when he announced he was engaged after dating her for a year I was absolutely thrilled for him.

Fast forward to the past 6 months. I also got engaged (I invited him to my wedding), my father got diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer, and my father passed away. Not once did he text or call to say congratulations, show concern about my father, or even show his condolences. I know he knew about all of these events because my father was still living in the house I grew up in and he still lived next door. To me these are not the actions of a friend. People I had not talked to in 10 years were messaging me asking if I was okay and if I needed anything. Just shows how much a girl can change someone.

1649,Not the A-hole,"TLDR; How does a mixed race person living in Tokyo respond when fellow Americans compliment their English? 

I am half-Japanese, half-white, living in Tokyo. I get compliments on “how good my English is”, mostly from Americans. The thing is, I was born and raised in California, I am absolutely *not* fluent in Japanese (my mom moved from Tokyo with my dad and never bothered to teach me or my sister), and Japanese people think I am full white. 

I used to just thank people because I didn’t want to embarrass them. Like, I look vaguely Japanese and I’m living in Japan, so naturally they (the non-Japanese complimenters) would conclude I am full Japanese.  But then it turned into natural questions of “Did you study abroad in America?” or “Do you study English at [my Japanese university]?” and even more compliments like “You have no accent!” or “You sound like a native speaker!” I would have trouble coming up with reasons why I have a perfect American accent while speaking English, and it would basically become very apparent that I was lying, and it would make everyone, including me, extremely uncomfortable. 

Recently, someone complimented me on my English, and instead of thanking them, I said “Oh, English is my first language, I was born and raised in America” and laughed a little. My friend pulled me aside later and said I had been rude about it. I just don’t know how to handle this compliment. AITA for saying English is my first language?

*EDITING FOR INFO* because people are getting confused and I didn’t include that much detail because I didn’t think this many people would read this:

This was an interaction between a fellow American friend (let’s call her Sally), who lives in Japan, and their American friend (Tabitha) who was visiting Sally, and me. I met the two of them today to do a little sightseeing because it was Tabitha’s first time in Japan, and people think I am fun company. There was a slight lull in conversation. And then this is how the conversation went:

Tabitha: “Wow, your English is perfect, it’s so impressive!”
Me: “Oh, English is my first language, I was born and raised in America! Haha”
I forgot what Tabitha said exactly in response to this, something like “oops my bad haha” but Sally quickly changed the subject and I thought everything was fine. 

Later we were near Senso-ji (a famous temple) walking down the street with all the tourist shops, Tabitha was looking around and Sally stopped me and like whispered to me that I was an asshole for being like “English is my first language”. I was like “oh is she mad?” And then she didn’t say anything else because Tabitha was coming towards us.  

They are both white, and I chose not to include this initially because I really didn’t want people to jump on the “they’re racist” train, because in my experience, this *always* comes from a place of trying to make conversation, NOT racism. I’m editing this because people are thinking Japanese people said this to me, but no. This comment is always made to me by only Americans, who think I am fully Asian, of all races and ages. 

I posted this because I don’t know how to handle this comment. It’s always from non-Asian Americans, it never feels racist, and no matter what I respond, the person usually feels embarrassed and I don’t want to make people feel like that, so I was looking for some advice too. 

*I’m just gonna edit this one last time*: Racists do not get embarrassed, like, ever. Racists do not give a shit if you think they’re racist. This is how I know the people who ask and get embarrassed are not racist, they feel bad that they made me feel singled out or discriminated against or whatever. It’s like the people who ask when the baby’s due when the woman is not pregnant. It’s a bad question but their hearts are in the right place and they’re just trying to spark conversation. I don’t want to make people feel bad for trying to start a conversation, so I guess my revised question is:

What is the least asshole-y way to answer this question?

I've been through some tough times and used to fuck around a lot in my early years. I drive a truck, but I wanted something more. It was tough, but at 31 I decided to finally go back to school. I'm what they call a ""mature student"".  Everyone is a lot younger, but it wasn't a big deal. I could always find people to talk to in class. I have a few good friends and a girlfriend outside of school, who graduated a long time ago. My girlfriend and I are currently in a LDR for her work. I miss her a lot.

&#x200B;

I've always been a very social person so I started to get really lonely. It was affecting me and I wasn't really into any of the clubs. I thought it would be a good idea to go to some parties and meet some people. Whenever I would go, I didn't know any of the music and the energy just seemed off. People were polite, never rude, but  I could tell they wanted to leave.

&#x200B;

I was feeling lonely again last night and thought I'd get up and take myself to one of the frats. I would try one more time. When I got to the door, there was a guy who let people in. He just brought me to the side and said ""hey man, you seem really cool and all. But it's kinda weird when you come to the parties. No one has anything against you, but you get it"". He told me it was *""better for everyone if I just didn't come around"",* but it was nothing personal. He gave me a beer and a pat on the back. I told him not to worry about it, but I was absolutely crushed. He could tell I was hurt and told me not to worry, because ""there's some students around your age you can party with"". I just smiled and went home.

&#x200B;

When I got home, I called my SO to tell her what happened. She was telling me not to worry but said that I have to understand why they might not want to party with me. It has nothing to do with me as a person, but it's weird if I want to party with them. She told me I shouldn't try again and to just go to bars with a buddy.

&#x200B;

I was really hurt that she said something like that. It's not cool to exclude anyone, especially for something as dumb as being a little older. We're all students. She knew how big of a decision it was for me to go back. I had to really swallow my pride.

&#x200B;

We got into an argument and by the end of it she told me to act my age. But I am acting my age. It's not unreasonable to want to be included by my peers.

1655,Not the A-hole,"To elaborate, I am 17 years old but am turning 18 this month and I’ve already graduated high school so my mother decided since I’m about to be 18 and my girlfriend and I already have a house she’d let me move.

 The original plan was for me to get a job right away and so that’s what I did. The problem is the restaurant  I applied for (and others) needs proof of a vaccine that I haven’t received yet in order for them to start me. I also didn’t have an ID prior to applying  so I knew I would have to get one after. 

I would also like to make it clear that I’ve contributed over $500 from my savings since I’ve moved so it’s not like I’m not helping out financially. 

My mother lives 2 hours away from us and I can’t drive because nobody ever had time to teach me or take me to the DMV while I was in school. I needed to get my birth certificate from my mother to get my ID. After a nearly a week of my mother saying she was looking we finally decided she’d lost it and we asked my grandfather if he had it. Luckily he did so we picked it up and went to get my ID later that day. The courthouse said they needed proof of residence such as a piece of mail before they could print the ID so I went and opened a bank account and got a piece of mail from the bank (which took around 4-5 days because the mail didn’t run on weekends). After I finally got the mail and got my ID printed the last step was to get my shot records. At this point my future employer said they’re tired of waiting so they’ll give me until the end of the week and if I can’t get it then they won’t hire me. So I went and called several pediatricians that I went to as a baby to see if I’ve gotten the shot and all of them had said I haven’t yet. I tried to schedule an appointment at the health department and rite-aid but they both said that I would have to have a parent or guardian present in order for them to give me the shot so I’m probably better off waiting until I’m 18 or driving to go to a doctor where my mother can be there. My mother is busy all the time plus we can’t afford to keep driving back and forth all the time so we decided it’s best that I try to get a job somewhere else or wait until I’m 18 (which is only a little over a week away). 

Now my girlfriends mother is complaining that I haven’t got a job yet and is talking shit to her about me and saying I need to do more chores if I’m not working (even though I definitely do my share, and my girlfriend sees all that I do)

I’d like to note that I’ve never said anything to this coworker, but it bothers me every day.
I work at a small veterinary practice in California. I have a coworker who had a baby last year. Before having the baby this coworker was on top of her shit! She was the type to call any of us out on slacking and was the go to for any and all questions. She had a M,Tu,F, Sat schedule.
This is her and  her Husbands first child. Both of their families live across the county and both planned on working after the birth so they knew they would have to find a nanny/daycare.
Towards the end of the pregnancy, this coworkers mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Her mother died shortly after the baby was born. Our entire hospital (we are a tiny clinic) banded together and worked a ton of overtime to accommodate her to be gone a extra few months outside of her maternity leave to deal with the loss of her mother. 
When she came back to work she announced that she was putting her baby in daycare Mon-Thur and would no longer be working her normal schedule. She never thanked anyone for stepping up to help cover so she could have extra time off to grieve. She then expected us all to change our schedules on a whim to accommodate the daycare schedule she chose. She now gets a 3 day weekend every week. This is unheard of in veterinary medicine.
We again all changed our lives around to accommodate her. Anything to make her life easier with a newborn and dealing with the loss of her mother. We rearranged the break room to give her a safe place to pump. 
She pumps twice a day for at least 30-40 minutes at a time. She’ll clock out for lunch, clock back in and go pump for 30+ minutes. She’ll then pump for another 30 plus minutes on the clock straight before we close, when she’s done she punches out and goes home. She doesn’t tell anyone before she pumps so we’ll be swamped and suddenly down a technician with no notice.

1657,No A-holes here,"We have been dating for a year. I'm Agnostic and a firm evolution believer. He's a Christian, studies molecular & microbiology, and believes in microevolution but *not* macroevolution for several reasons:

1. He thinks that there are too many holes in the theory of evolution for it to hold true
2. Humans haven't been around long enough to witness and document development between two species
3. He used to be an Atheist and did his own research to come to his belief in Christianity/Creationism for macroevolution

I tried to have this conversation with him multiple times over the last few months, and he gave me some examples like the Cambrian explosion and woodpecker tongue, which (I think) are classic examples of what Creationists use to argue against evolution, though they don't ""debunk"" the theory as a whole. I understand that evolution is not a perfect theory - and, like general relativity and many other theories of science, there are going to be holes. But I feel like that evolution's inability to explain certain events doesn't mean direct intervention from a higher being - and, instead, just means we need to keep refining and improving the theory.

He says that there are people with PhDs in the science and theological fields who debate this on a regular basis and that one side can always provide a rebuttal for the other's argument, that it's a never-ending cycle of arguments that is up to each of us to determine which side we think holds more credibility. Ultimately, he decided that it was Creationism. I decided it was evolution.

I just think that you can't use theology to debate science (and he does - because he believes Christianity to be truth), but there is just so much overwhelming evidence for evolution in the science community, I just can't wrap my head around the fact that he is also a scientist yet believes this. We're both planning to work in the science field together in the future.

I called out her character and told her straight up that I thought it was shitty that I didn’t get a visit after surgery or during chemo. Not just no visit, but she expected me to drive 5 hours to visit her both two weeks before chemo started and again a week after it was over. That’s what led to the break up.

You have no idea what I had to go through and sorry but cancer and its treatment should be more important than your med school.” She didn’t think that I was being considerate of the stress she was under while I was undergoing an immense amount of stress and shock.

My mom and I have a very fickle relationship. She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. 

For the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. 

After telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an ""I'm sorry you feel that way,"" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)

Today, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago.

I'm a member of an organization that I've been in for just over 20 years and very very much enjoy going to this event I'm going to soon, that I've had to miss the last 2 years.  I've taken my wife with me every time I've gone since we've been together,  however,  she usually just lies around the tent while we're there due to the heat and said she doesn't want to go this year. I invited a gaming friend to go with me six months or so ago who is flying to the US from Norway just to go with me, and have been looking forward to the event ever since.  

Her side: We can't afford for me to go. The house needs work. I'm taking our only vehicle and leaving her without a means to get around.  Her health is not the best. Her mom will be pissed because she has helped us financially. 

My defense:  While money is tight and I will be on a budget, I've gone to this event in the past with less money and we are not going to starve or have utilities cut off for it etc. The house is really old, and does need work, but over the last few weeks I've been renovating our bathroom during my off time with almost no help from her. Her license is  suspended due to a drunk driving charge so she can't legally drive anywhere. A big part of her health issues is that she drinks too much, doesn't take her daily medication regularly, eats almost nothing,  and spends most (like 90% or more) of her time lying down in bed. I suspect she has mental health issues,  but she refuses to see a psychiatrist. The financial support from her mom has -never- been asked for and the biggest chunk of cash ($2000 +)  was to pay off her fine from the DUI. ",108,202,0.94
1663,Not the A-hole,"This happened back in high school (90s). I never thought I was in the wrong, but I was reminded of it the other day, so I'm here to accept my judgement from the community. 

I had been dating my girlfriend at the time for around a month or so. One night, while on the phone with her, she mentioned that she was going to hang out with a guy friend of hers, and I didn't really think anything of it. The next day at school, during lunch, she admitted that she cheated on me the night before. I'm probably the least jealous person there is, and I never really had a problem finding dates (not bragging - I was no Jonathan Taylor Thomas), so I told her I didn't want to be together anymore. No hard feelings. There were plenty of girls I would cry over while listening to Glycerine by Bush, she just wasn't one of them. 

The next night she called me like normal, we talked about school, I was a little perplexed, but whatever. She let me know she wanted to keep dating, but that I would have to ""make it up to her."" I was blown away, but honestly interested in understanding what she meant. She said I could fill her locker with flowers, write her a poem and post it on Geocities, you know, a grand gesture. I told her I needed to think, and ended the conversation.

The next couple days I tried ducking her, but she'd pop up out of nowhere wondering if I'd figured out how I was going to ""win her back."" Finally, I had a smartass idea: I told her to wait by locker after a specific class of hers and ""I'll show you how much you mean to me."" I didn't show up. She found me later, and was none too pleased. 

Her: I waited for you and you didn't show up.

Me: Well yeah, to show you how much you mean to me.

Her: But you never came. 

Me: Exactly, you mean nothing to me.  

Once the realization hit her, she started kind of silently crying, called me a dick, and walked away. I was smugly satisfied with myself, and I didn't see her again until things blew up randomly months later. 

AITA here? While I always felt her betrayal and her weird mind game warranted some kind of ""no uncertain terms"" response, I now wonder if what I did was cruel, because it hurt her more (a lot) than she hurt me (almost none). ",56,187,0.95
1664,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway coz reasons. So my wife recently received a not insignificant amount of money after her parent passed away. 

For background we have always pooled our money together to pay bills and expenses and split the remainder IF there was anything left. Over the years my contributions have been higher 99% of the time as my wife’s work is sporadic. Sometimes through her decisions sometimes through no fault of her own. She has always been not great with money and regularly overspends on herself and the household outside of our budget leaving nothing left to split once everything is covered.

We initially discussed using this money to finally clear our debts which would have used just under half of the inheritance (We have been paying the minimum for as long as I can remember as there is never anything left at the end of the month to tackle these). I can’t remember the exact timing but I think it was just before everything was to be finalised she suggested we not do that as it would use up a fair chunk and instead we should pay one debt and save the rest. I was in agreement as given where the money came from I didn’t think it was my place to really have a say.

Full disclosure: We both added to this one debt by buying some (very much needed) clothing which doubled the debt and this was then paid off.

Since then she has also bought herself, with my agreement some not inexpensive items that she had wanted for some time now and I would guess about a quarter is gone. She is still spending on smaller items but I’m starting to resent the fact that in my opinion she now has a personal slush fund for herself to use as she pleases while we still have the majority of our debts that I can’t really do anything with as my income is used to cover all the expenses. Her income is so sporadic and generally never enough to cover half.

My ideal would be to suggest she either keeps using her slush fund but contributes 50% of the expenses each month. This would let me have something at the end of the month/ Clear our debts while we still can or/ Stick will the plan and save what’s left.

I should also add that the majority of the debt is credit card debts run up to cover our living expenses when her income was low.

So will I be the asshole if I try to have a say in how this money should be used?


Edit to add: 100% of the debt is shared debt incurred since we’ve been married ",23,36,0.94
1665,Not the A-hole,"Tomorrow, my parents and I were invited to eat homemade dinner at my brother's girlfriend's house. I offered to make mini cupcakes. I spent the better part of two hours baking them. They had cooled and I was just about to pack them up and hide them because my dad is notorious for grazing off of foods, and he will eat and eat if no one's there to stop him.

Sure enough, in walks my dad. He beelines for the cupcakes with arms outstretched. I physically put my body in front of them and say no while trying furiously to shove them into a Tupperware without ruining them. ""I can have just one!"" he laughed, I laughed and hissed at him jokingly, which got more laughs. I figured he would stop at that, but he's still going for a cupcake. I managed to block him out and walk away. The mood was still light and playful (or so I thought). I told him he can have as many as he wants tomorrow, they're not even iced yet. I had the exact amount to make a perfect grid of cupcakes in my holder and I wanted to impress my brother's gf. I walked away with the cakes and that is that.

Fast forward two hours, my mom came home with groceries and I could get started on the frosting. She also brought home some fresh fried chicken wings she bought for Grampa's dinner (she's his caretaker). She said she got an extra one that Dad and I can share. I offer half and he didn't want it. I said ok, so I make funny ""Mmm! Yummy!"" sounds as I eat it. He joked, ""well maybe I do,"" and reached a hand out. I jokingly pulled back and said, ""I changed my mind!"" although I fully intended to give him his half.

Well I'll be damned if he didn't explode. He yelled, ""well I don't want it now! You always do this! You play games and act like a child! Like with the fucking cupcakes!"" and he stormed off to his office while kicking things.

Now I'm left wondering if I was being too petty and immature for not letting him have a mini cupcake. He's in the kitchen now baking boxed brownies that he's made clear are just for himself. He's fucking diabetic and doesn't need a whole box. I still need to make frosting, but don't want to be in the same room as him. 

Am I the asshole because I didn't let him have even a single cupcake? Or for playing games with the chicken? Am I always playing games?? I feel bad.",88,185,0.94

1667,Not the A-hole,"My aunt lives in a different country than I do and I occasionally visit her. After I graduated college, I decided I had a little bit of time off and decided to spend a couple of weeks at her place. I should add that she has 2kids (my cousins). One of them is around my age and he’s an overall great kid with a lovely family. The other one is about 7years my senior and an overall deadbeat. He didn’t go to college, doesn’t have a job, isn’t allowed to see his daughter because he doesn’t pay child support, but his parents let him live in their place completely free... 

Anyway, I know what a dick he is, so i never visit my aunt if he’s staying with her. he’s been to jail, and even stole around 400$ from me (he never admitted to it, but it was him), so I don’t want to be around him. This time, she completely caught me off guard and didn’t inform me that he was staying there until I literally saw him at her house when I arrived. I couldn’t change my ticket, so I obliged to stay there. 

A friend orders a mobile phone and has it delivered to my aunt’s house. When it arrived, I tell my aunt i’m gonna give it to her other son, but she disagrees and wants me to give it to her, so I do as she says. 

Before I leave, I ask her for the phone, she immediately goes to get it and she gives me a bag with a couple other things (phone cover, speakers) but the phone isn’t there. I tell her that the phone isn’t there. She starts freaking out and asks her deadbeat son. He starts insulting her and screaming at her, so she gives up. She asks me how much the phone cost and I look up the price and tell her that it’s 1000$. However, my friend bought it on sale for about 750$. 

About 3days before I leave, I ask her what she’s gonna do about the stolen phone; she literally tells me that it isn’t fair that she has to pay 1000$ when my friend paid less for it, so she’s gonna give me 700$ and I should just tell my friend what happened. I immediately get annoyed and tell her, in a very calm way I must say, that I’m not leaving the country without the phone and if I have to, I’ll miss my flight. She gets mad at me and tells me that I shouldn’t talk to her like that (I never raised my voice ir anything), but she doesn’t just have 1000$ to spend on a phone.

After a couple days, my cousin (the good kid), gave her 1000$ out of his money and I bought the phone. My cousin sided with me, but my aunt thinks I was an asshole to her son and I disrespected her for demanding payment, but I think anyone would’ve done that. So, was I the asshole? 

Tl;dr: aunt’s deadbeat son stole a new phone that wasn’t even mine and I demanded that I wasn’t leaving without having the phone back. 

Edit: I asked my aunt to pay for it because her son doesn’t have a job, nor a savings account, so he can’t pay for it. 

Edit 2: Amazon doesn’t ship to my native country, so my friend sent it to the US. 

Edit 3: I had to delete this part be cause it was over the word count- I didn’t keep the phone in my possessions because my thief cousin stole money from my purse and he unlocked the door with a knife. 

Edit 4: To the ones saying i should report him to the police. I wanted to, but my aunt begged me not to because he already has a criminal record and they might send him back to jail. 

Edit 5: I should also add that he constantly steals from his parents, so they have to give their expensive possessions to the neighbors. He stole his brother’s laptop back when he lived with them, and he even stole my little niece’s baby clothes and probably sold them for drugs -he’s also a drug addict- My aunt knows all of this and enables this kind of behavior. 

Edit 6: To the ones saying I was extorting my aunt for money, my friend bought the phone ON SALE on cyber Monday for 750$. When I realized the phone had been stolen, the sale was over and the phone was 1000$.

1669,Not the A-hole,"My daughter is 6 and we are very close. I recently expressed to a friend that I was glad she turned out to be a girl and he got angry and said I should never say that because it sounds like I value girl babies over boy babies and that I'm sexist and forcing my daughter to be girly and I wouldn't have loved a son as much.

Things may have been different if I had had a son, but I would have kept him and loved him just as much. I say I'm glad I had a daughter because my mother, who is also very involved with my daughter, was a single mom and my daughter's father has chosen to be completely absent. Now that my daughter is getting older and figuring out more of who she is, I have more applicable experience to guide her because I can understand what she's going through. Not to say I absolutely couldn't if she were a boy, but I can only speak from my own experience.

My daughter also has a lot of traditionally masculine interests as well as traditionally feminine interests, and I don't try to squelch them in any way. I don't like that she's a girl because I want to dress her up like a doll or anything like that, there's just something nice and relatable about having a daughter and having my ""core family unit"" of my mom, my daughter, and me being all women.

He's a good friend of mine, and I thought he needed the help, so I donated a large sum. (My contribution matched basically what everyone else combined paid) And I'm okay with that. I make good money, and I care about my friends. The other day, however, he posted that he had gotten a new tattoo. This may sound silly, but now I feel like rather than helping pay for his medical procedure, I've paid for his tattoo, and that kind of irks me.

1671,Asshole,"Let me preface this that I quit my ph.D program out of choice. Why? I was a middle-of-the-pack student. For an average student like me, I stand little to no chance in landing a tenure-track position even at an ""average"" university. What awaited me was post-doc purgatory and adjunct teaching, where you make a \*pittance\* for the amount of education you have invested in yourself. Foreseeing this, I noped the fuck out and jumped to the job market.

&#x200B;

Enter my GF. She is a 28 years old Masters student in engineering. She has informed me on several occasions that she wants to pursue a Ph.D after graduating from her current program. I have been urging her to think twice about this momentous decision. Here are my arguments as to why I think a Ph.D is not good for her:

&#x200B;

1. The Ph.D department she wants to go to is not that highly-ranked. Landing a tenure-track position after graduating from there is a snowball chance in hell.

&#x200B;

2. You don't need a Ph.D in engineering to thrive in the professional/industrial job market.

&#x200B;

3. She has never been on the job market. How would she know she wouldn't like it?

&#x200B;

4. I don't think she knows what she's getting into. It's clear she hasn't thoroughly researched this career path. 

&#x200B;

5. She's not that young anymore. Do you really want to use your prime years for an endeavor with highly uncertain payoff? Even if you manage to get a job after, that's \~5 years of opportunity cost gone. That's \~5 years in which you could have been working because a Masters is perfectly \*sufficient\* already. 

&#x200B;

6. I don't think her personality is good for academia. She is a very quiet and somewhat passive. Teaching, competing for grants, going to conferences, and all that jazz would probably be tough for her. 

&#x200B;

7. Hell, if the Ph.D is really needed for her next promotion, what prevents her from going \*back\* to it after gaining some work experience on the job market first?

&#x200B;

Most importantly, though, it's that I see myself in her. I believe I was in her shoes 4 years ago. I do not want her to make the same mistake I did. 

&#x200B;

Now, here's where I could be the asshole:

&#x200B;

1. She's allowed to do whatever the fuck she wants. Maybe I can give her some (unsolicited?) advice, but it's not my purview to tell her what to do.

&#x200B;

2. The big one: I'm not that young anymore either. I'm also materialistic. Basically, I don't want a future in which my partner doesn't really contribute to the American Dream because she's still studying as an 30+ years old. If we are to share our life together, I'd want her to work. I'm scared of the uncertainty that her preferred career path brings.

&#x200B;

Because I legit care about her and \*because I want someone who can help me create the future I want\*, I've been trying to dissuade her from pursuing her goal.

1680,Everyone Sucks,"My (28M) roommate (24F) is super quiet and keeps to herself which is no big deal, but my gf tracked down her public tumblr and shes constantly complaining like a 16 year old girl. Talking mad shit behind my back instead of face to face, like an adult. Calling me an annoying asshole and all sorts of other things I dont want to get into. The worst part is this is all AFTER I asked her if there's anything I can do/work on to make her more comfortable, nope she replies, all good. I get it that some people just want to complain so I let it go for a while, just ignoring it.

What broke it for me was shes always alone up in her room drinking and listening to her shitty punk rock music by herself. She posts on her tumblr all the time about how shes sad and that all her friends are gone. I usually keep my distance because that's what she seems to prefer, but I texted her and asked her if shes okay and let her know that I'm a good listener if she ever wants to talk or whatever.

So she ignored my text and posted on tumblr that I'm so fucking annoying and I need to 'leave her alone and let her live her life' comparing me to her dad. LOL WHAT LIFE. From what I can tell all she does is sit up in her room and drink alone. Yeah I'm going to check into it to make sure you're not going to kill yourself or burn my house down. Who the fuck reacts that way when someone asks you if you're okay or need help?

I've been nothing but kind to this girl because she seemed really lonely. I got her a space heater because my house is too cold for her. I got her a (used) bed from my parents for her birthday because she couldnt bring hers when she moved here. I'm quiet and respectful (I try anyway) and from where I'm sitting she just seems like a complete cunt. I told her she has one month to find someplace else to live as per our rental contract (she rents a room in my house, this is another favor I'm doing her because she found me on social media, I dont need a roommate but she was starting a new job here in two weeks and really needed a place).

Sorry for the rant. What would you do in my place? Am I a creepy cyber stalker? Am I justified in trying to find out more because shes so reserved? Blowing this out of proportion? Any responses appreciated. 

TLDR: Roommate has no problems with me when asks, but complains non stop on tumblr about me saying hurtful things. I'm doing her a favor here and when I saw that I gave her 1 month to find a new spot.

EDIT: before I kicked her out I warned her twice that I can see ever she posts and so can my friends, and that its embarrassing. And could she please make her profile private. That was too much to ask. Cue temper tantrum on tumblr about both myself and my girlfriend. I have no reason to do her any favors if that's how shes going to behave.

EDIT 2: Alright in all honesty, everything I've posted is true except for the fact that I haven't actually told her to leave. I wouldnt realistically evict someone because they said some mean things about me on the internet. 

I'm sure shes looking for another place now anyway, but I'm not going to inconvenience her with a time frame like that. $600 is still $600 and she always pays on time. I just wanted to know what people would think if I had terminated our contract. Thanks for most responses, from the people who could respond civilly.

1681,Asshole,"This is probably going to be a no brainer for you guys, cus I sure feel like a piece of shit.

So my husband is overweight and has tried going on diets and exercise programs multiple times, and it seems like every time I'd compliment him on weight loss, he'd gain it right back.

Last week, he said he was going on another diet and the other day, texted me that he lost 3 lbs and showed a picture of the scale. My husband has this pattern of relaxing on things whenever I give him positive reinforcement, we'll get to that later, and so instead of complimenting him, reminded him about the factor of floating weight. He did not respond to it until this evening when  he stepped on the scale with his clothes on and said that the reason he gained some weight was because he usually weighs it when he's nude, and then again I responded that floating weight is a thing. He then got incredibly upset and said that he needs encouragement from me, and not negative feedback, otherwise he'll feel like he's not making any progress. I tried apologizing and explaining that it wasn't negative, and that he seems to have a pattern of gaining the weight back whenever I compliment him, and said that I felt that the best thing to do would to be to not compliment and remain neutral.

He then blamed it on other factors; like the time I got kicked out of Planet Fitness was what made him stop exercising and made him gain the weight back (then afterward said ""I'm not blaming you for that"" as if that would make it feel like I'm not being blamed for getting kicked out.)

I then tried apologizing again, and tried giving another example of how me giving positive reinforcement doesn't work for him, as he does not do his chores or help clean the house on his own, as he needs me to tell him to and then compliment his work when he is finished. He then responded ""Oh so we're making this about that now?""

Frustrated, I left the room, saying that he's not entitled to my emotional labor. I feel horrible for brushing him off like that, but I really don't know what else I should do. Am I the asshole? Should I keep giving him positive encouragement and just keep coddling him in the hopes that he'll improve? Or should I just not talk to him about any of this?

My back would get really sweaty from sitting on some of the leather work-out machines, so I would bunch up the bottom half of my shirt and tie it so it wouldn't stick to my torso. The manager told me not to do that because it could possibly 'intimidate' some of the other female gym goers but I kept doing it anyway out of absentmindedness and the second time she caught me she started getting really aggressive about it and threatened to kick me out. I told her I wouldn't put up with her talking to me that way and then she replied ""then leave."" So I did. It's kind of embarrassing because I feel like I could have handled it better and I didn't think it was important to the story so I left it out. So TLDR: dress code violations. ",45,32,0.86

We’re a relatively close-knit group since there aren’t that many of us.

We were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).

Earlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.

I immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). 

But during this whole thing, I couldn’t help but wonder why she and her husband didn’t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.

Obviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I’m being too judgmental.

Please tell me - AITA?

1687,No A-holes here,"My wife and I were scheduled to have a baby late last year. It would have been our first child and we were on top of the world. The pregnancy, however, was a traumatic experience. It was a high risk pregnancy and my wife dealt with health issues throughout. As the pregnancy went on, my wife's health continued to deteriorate badly. Things did not improve over time, and the doctor had concerns about my wife's health and the condition of the baby. We made the devastating decision to terminate the pregnancy, and it absolutely crushed us.

This whole situation just destroyed us completely. The procedure had complications and my wife made it through some very tense moments, but she ultimately recovered. It's weird because people mourn in different ways. I've had friends who've lost babies and have memorialized them very publicly. I love it and have never had a problem with that. The thing is, with the way this pregnancy went, it's not really something we wanted to revisit with others. We privately made a decision that we will always love honor, and respect what we had, but we would keep it in our hearts and not display anything (like a memorial wall or a picture) Again, others may do this, but this was our private decision based on how we felt.

My dad has a tattoos of the names of all his kids and grandchildren. After the pregnancy, my dad asked me if we had picked a name out for our baby and we told him we had not decided on one. He then told me he had planned of getting a tattoo of the baby's name, but since we did not have a name picked out, he would like to tattoo the date that the pregnancy was terminated, as a tribute. Now I understand my dad's motive here. He is doing this from a place of love and feels he is doing the right thing to honor our baby. However, my first thought was ""oh God please no Dad"" and my wife's face told me the same story. I didn't say anything back to my dad, but simply nodded when he told me his plan. My wife later told me that she really does not want him to get the tattoo and doesn't think it is appropriate. This is not something she wants to re-live on a daily basis or every time she sees it on my dad's arm. I love my dad and I love him for wanting to do something, but is that the most appropriate way to do it? If we are at a social gathering and someone asked my dad about the tattoo, the last thing my wife is going to want is for him to flag her down and have her re-live that day. We just want to mourn privately. We do not want to re-tell the story and re-live the trauma. Don't we have that right? It's no one else's business. I've talked to my mom and she says it's a wonderful tribute and that I should be grateful. I haven't said anything to my dad yet because I'm not sure if I'm overreacting. It's his body and he can do whatever he wants, but AITA if I tell my dad we would really prefer that he did not get the tattoo?",64,141,0.94

My wife and I have been married for 4 years and have 1 kid and this is a constant disagreement. I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the ""management"" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?

1691,Not the A-hole,"First some back story; I (23F) own a car and she (21F) doesn't drive, so I drive us everywhere all  the time. I never ask for gas money, and I don't mind driving us to get groceries or to go out. However, lately she has been missing the bus 10 minutes before her shift at work and then asks me for a ride even though she leaves at risky times to catch the bus (leaving 3 minutes before it gets to the stop). The first few times I agreed because I didn't want her to get into trouble and lose her job - we are both in our last year of University and its not cheap.

Today is Saturday and the first Saturday that I haven't worked in weeks. I slept in, made myself breakfast and was catching up on the news when she comes running in to tell me, ""I just missed my bus, I guess I'll have to walk 20 minutes in the cold..."" in an angry tone. I just stared at her and said ""That's shitty"" and continued to read the news as she stood in my door way for 2 minutes before finally heading back out.

Our entire house knew, and they kept it from me. My boyfriend found out and they apologized to him, but never to me. I have been friends with them for a year and they never told me or apologized. I found out now and was pretty upset that everyone knew (but nobody ever apologized to me about it) and that my boyfriend never told me. He seemed to not understand why I was mad and said that they apologized (to him!) so it was ‘dealt with’. I don’t agree.

1693,Not the A-hole,"About a year ago, my family got rabbits. We originally had three - brothers - and each one of us had one rabbit dubbed as ""theirs"". For a period of time after we got them, everything went fine. We all took turns cleaning out the hutch, feeding them, filling up their water, ect. 

However, about six months after we got them, a fox managed to break into their hutch despite the precautions we had put up, and two of them were killed. The only rabbit that survived was my brother's. Shortly after this happened - at my brother's request - we bought a smaller hutch and moved his rabbit inside. As our house is fairly small, the rabbit ended up being moved into my room since I had the most free space.

I didn't really mind as I was assured that my brother would take the main burden of looking after it and, for a while, that's what happened. But barely a month later, my brother just completely stopped. I quickly became the sole caretaker of the rabbit. My brother would refuse to clean his hutch out or even give him water. I would attempt to get him to do it, only for my mum to tell me to do it ""just this once"".

Just this once turned into every time. I have limited mobility of my left arm thanks to nerve damage from an accident and, let me tell you, cleaning out a rabbit with only one arm is HARD. For the past six or seven months, my brother has done jack to look after his rabbit. The only time he shows any interest is when he wants to get him out of the hutch to play. 

I'm sick of it. The rabbit isn't even mine, yet I'm the only one who does anything to take care of him and there's a large chunk of my room taken up by a creature that I'm not even allowed to claim ownership over. 

Last night I snapped and gave my mum three choices:
- My brother either takes over caring for the rabbit and stops forcing me to do everything
OR
- The rabbit becomes mine and my brother will no longer be allowed to barge into my room to play with it
OR 
- The rabbit goes

My brother went into a screaming meltdown (He's 10 and he literally threw a tantrum over being asked to take care of HIS rabbit) about how I'm so horrible for wanting to get rid of the pet that he ""loves"" so much. My mum got snippy at me, telling me that it wasn't fair for me to expect my brother to look after a rabbit when he already has to deal with school and being on a sports team. 

I lost it at that point. I am barely three months away from my GCSEs and I'm currently being forced to juggle studies and a part time job. When I get to college, I know my workload will pretty much be doubled. I repeated my points again and told her either she picks an option, or I take care of this myself.

Don't get me wrong, I love that rabbit, but it's getting too much. My brother goes mental if I just take the rabbit out of his hutch to play without calling him into the room to join in.

I am not willing to do all of this for a rabbit that I'm not even allowed to play with.

1694,Not the A-hole,"TLDR at bottom. I used to work at both Pizza Hut and Papa John's and can barely stomach their food anymore, so whenever I get pizza delivery it's Domino's 99% of the time. When I order, I always order several of the extra cups or sauce. I don't expect it for free, I'll gladly pay for it if I can get the dinner i want. I use a lot of sauce on my food and also keep extras in the cabinet for home cooking and when they forget my sauce. I'm not gonna be an asshole and make them drive back to the store and back to me all for 1 garlic sauce for no extra tip, but after a while I get tired or having my order wrong.

The problem is, over 50% of the time they miss one or more of the extra sauces I paid for. Even after I ask the delivery person if they got all the sauces, they will still be missing or wrong. It got the point to where I've called the store and talked to the manager, he assures me it won't happen again and it does. So I started telling the drivers the next time they forget my sauce they won't be getting a tip. Now I used to be a driver too, so I know sometimes you forget things or the person on cut table didn't put the sauce in the box like they said they did. So I started putting in the driver instructions that I won't tip them if they forget my sauce. Nothing else I say or do seems to help. So last night, it happened. I ordered 11 extra sauces. I ask the driver when he gets there if he got all my sauce, he hands me a bag. Normally that's where I tip them but after getting it wrong so many times, I have to check. So I open it and check them, not only is the total count short by 2, missing 1 of the marinara cups and the only cup of icing for the dessert, all 4 cups that were supposed to be mango habanero were instead ranch that I ordered zero of. So out of 11 sauces I ordered and paid for, I only got 5 of them correct. 

Being an ex driver myself, I didn't want it to come to this. But it had gone too far. I handed him back the ranch that I didn't order and told him I won't be tipping because the sauces were wrong yet again and that next time if they wanted a tip, my order should be correct.

TLDR. I always order and pay for extra sauce with pizza, they have gotten my order wrong so many times I won't tip anymore if even 1 item is wrong or missing. Am I The Asshole?

1696,No A-holes here,"My husbands brother is due to get married in Italy in August, the plan is for everyone (except me because I’m due to have our baby) to travel to Italy from England for a weeks holiday and to attend the wedding. The following week there is a second reception being held in the UK for family. 

When I first found out I was pregnant I told my husband he could still go as he was freaking out about letting his brother down. 

As it’s getting closer I’m really regretting this decision and I really don’t want him to go as I’m scared that I’ll have the baby without him or that something will go wrong. It will also be the longest my little boy (who will be 19 months old) has ever been away from me and I’m dreading him going for so long. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m worried if I tell my husband that I don’t want him to go it’s going to cause huge arguments but I’m filled with dread At the idea of him not being here. 

TLDR

I told my husband I didn’t mind him going away with the kids to his brothers wedding the week our baby is due and now I really regret that and I’m scared of him not being here when our baby is born+ scared of my little boy (19 months) being away so long and so far away.  ",81,49,0.92

1699,Not the A-hole,"Happened a few months back, we dated for 2 1/2 years got engaged, I was getting out of the military and decided to stay in the area because it was close to her parents and career. So I bought a house with my gi bill, she was paying the utilities. About three months into the engagement she mentions that shes been thinking about not wanting kids. We had discusses everything before we got engaged so I was a little shocked. We decided to see a relationship counselor to figure it out. I got busy with work and school and never got around to finding one myself.
We went on a trip to see my parents and after that it seems like she starts compartmentalizing herself from me, wasn't really sure to do because I didn't know anyone in the area besides her and her family so I just hoped she would figure it out and maybe it was just pre marriage jitters. We sit down and talk one day and she tells me she doesn't want kids, and brings up a slew of relationship problems she has with me that she never told me before. 
I tell her she has to figure out if she wants to stay engaged or break it off, she says she wants to break it off. I went out on a walk to figure it out in my head because I cannot believe what just happened. I got angry and went back to the house almost shaking, tell her she has to figure it out now. She says she wants to break it off so I told her to ""Get her shit, get the fuck out my house I don't want to talk to you again"" She had two weeks and move out while I'm not home. 
About sums it up, just wondering because about a month ago I got a message from her calling me a piece of shit for kicking her out and not helping her through the break up.

Edit : Since people have asked I had a much longer write up explaining a lot of the backstory but it didn't fit in under 3k character limit. Obviously there is more to the story as in any breakup but this all happened within two or three months and before that we always seemed to work our problems out.

1700,No A-holes here,"This is a topic on my mind a lot, and I get judged quite a bit for it by my(29M) wife's (28F) family, as well as my own family.

When I was in high school, like most teenagers, I was looking forward to getting my license and driving. At 15 I started in drivers ED, and ended up passing the written test just fine. After that I began doing the driving practice, and I really struggled. Practicing was hard, specifically driving with my parents. My mom would freak out really easily, and I felt really nervous around my dad and definitely made a lot of mistakes. I eventually took a road test and failed, and that discouraged me for a few months, but then I got really dedicated to practicing, and tried again. I failed a second time due to the parallel parking.

I got really dedicated on the third time. My parents hired a private instructor, and I really tried my best. At this point though, I still did not feel like I was a good driver. I knew my weaknesses, and in certain high risk situations, my instincts were often incorrect, leading to a couple close calls.

On my third road test, things were going fine for the most part, but near the end, I ended up getting into a collision. On my road test. It was awful. It was entirely my fault, and I was extremely ashamed. Since then, I have not reattempted to take a road test.

The rest of my life has been largely unaffected. I lived on campus in university, so I had no need for a car (and no access to one to practice again for a road test) after that, I moved downtown and was within walking distance of my job. Currently I take public transit and it's not really an issue for me, and I'm pretty self sufficient without a car and can take Uber if I need too. I am a successful well adjusted adult.

I don't want to get a car, or my license, because I am concerned that I will get into an accident, harming myself, someone else, or potentially members of my family. The issue is that my wife has a car, and does all of the driving. Now, a part of me feels bad, that I should be sharing that responsibility, but I am legitimately concerned for our safety if I was driving. I don't want to deal with the judgement of our families, but I also don't want to put our future kids at risk while driving with me.

On the other hand, that will be a lot more responsibility for my wife if she has to drive the kids everywhere. I'm hoping that either I can find other ways to help out in the future.

TLDR; I'm a bad driver, and probably a risk to be on the road. I don't think I should get my license for my own safety, and the safety of others. I feel bad though, like I am not contributing enough by not getting it, and face judgement from extended family.

AITA for not wanting to drive?

1702,Not the A-hole,"Some background, I work in a small store that is part of a major industry. It's half retail and half physical labor, and recently we got a new Manager here at the store. Let's call him M, and besides M and myself we have one other full time employee, I am part time *just* below full time. Basically I work enough hours to be there enough to live, but just little enough that the company doesn't have to give me benefits.

Now, before M showed up we had a previous Manager with whom myself and my co-worker had no issues with at all. Previous Manager kept enough jobs moving through where we would hit bonuses and all around do fine monetarily. But i was asked to work Saturdays solo, since they both had newborns in the home.

This was fine with me, I jumped at the chance to get that 9 hour shift. The flip side of this is that I was off on Mondays, and over time Sunday and Monday became my days to take a breather. Before long, Mondays specifically became my time to go to CMA meetings in support of one of my close friends, who is recovering. This specific fact never came up with co-worker/ex-boss because, well, they never had any issue with me being off Mondays so I went about my business.

Fast forward to a few months later, old boss leaves the company, new guy moves in. Things begin to change in terms of, well there's more for us to do. I take on more duties (for no extra pay or hours, though they say ""you should've been doing this anyways), and the new boss who is money driven, damn near doubles the amount of physical work we do in the store. We work with paint, so we shift probably 8,000 gallons in a week, sometimes less, sometimes more.

One thing he consistently begins bringing up to me is having me work Mondays. I've refused flat out multiple times, for two reasons;

 1: I'm going to support my friend, no matter what. This guy was there for me in a big way before he fell on hard times, so I will return the favor. 

 2: I would be working 6 days a week, with no extra hours at all.

See, he can't get approval for me to technically work more. So he wants to spread my hours out across the week so I'm there more days, same pay, less days off. It's gotten to the point where when I come back on Tuesdays, he'll say ""me and [co-worker] did x amount of work yesterday, because you didn't want to come in to work."" Like he's guilt tripping me for having days off. 

I'm still the only one who works Saturdays, alone. Beyond this, there is a boss above him, who has even said (to the new manager, as advice about me/this, and I heard about it) that my ""days off aren't a garuntee."" Which is just...disgusting, to me.

Am I the asshole for refusing to do this? Also, I have talked with my co-worker, (with whom I helped keep the store open during the two week no manager period while the new guy was getting hired), and they have no issue with me being off Mondays.",33,33,0.96

1704,Not the A-hole,"So, this happened last year but I have been thinking about it a bit recently and wondered if I was the person in the wrong within this situation.

I became single in Jan last year.

I was on tinder and I met E. We got talking last March, and E asked me out on a date. I accepted.

We had an amazing date and I really enjoyed myself, so we went on a few more. He was so lovely- kind, caring, chatty, thoughtful and affectionate, and he made me laugh a lot. The thing is, E was a very chivalrous person and point blank refused to let me contribute to dates, to the point where if I did pay he got upset and quite angry.

Things were going good, and we were dating for about 2 months. I really enjoyed his company. 

Now, my birthday is in May, and I told him not to bother getting me anything as he had been so generous in the past. However, my birthday rolls around and he turns up at my house, and to my utter shock he gives me my present- a 5 star couples holiday to Tunisia. As soon as he gives me this, he asks me to be his girlfriend. I accepted.

Things went well, and the day of the holiday rolls around. He came to pick me up from my house, and suddenly he was like a different person. Literally a complete 180 of the person he was before the holiday- he was quiet, moody, and didn't speak to me AT ALL until we got to the airport. I thought he was just tired and gave him the benefit of the doubt, but when we actually got to Tunisia, he continued this behaviour- he snapped a lot, hardly said a word to me (and when he did it was about his ex girlfriend) and was on his phone the ENTIRE time. Literally 24/7- at dinner, at drinks, by the pool. He also hardly wanted to spend time with me, never coming to breakfast, going to bed very early and he slept pretty much on the opposite side of the bed to me. I kept asking him what was wrong, if I had upset him, if there was anything I could do to help but he just said there was nothing wrong. Honestly, the whole holiday felt as though I was a spare part and he had just taken me as he had no-one else to go with. This carried on for the entire 10 days we were there.

When we came back, he dropped me off at home, didn't even say goodbye. I asked to meet up with him the next day and said that I was breaking up with him for the way he acted on holiday- he told me he could see it coming as he knew he wasn't himself. I offered to pay for half the holiday, but again, he refused to let me.

Was I the A-hole in this situation? I feel like I was as he bought me a holiday, however he made me completely miserable the whole time, was very rude, constantly talked about his ex and was on his phone the whole time. At the time I felt as though I did the right thing as I wasn't happy at all, but I feel guilty that I went on the holiday in the first place. Is there anything I should have done differently?

Ok so I am a 17 years old male from Palestine (but I have the Jordanian nationality) 

I moved in to the USA when last year (school wise) ended. 

When this year started I didn't think that I'd meet anybody for the first few weeks but surprisingly. 
A guy asked me to come sit with him and his 5 other friends  4 males & 2 females,including me. 

I sat with them and we talked and it was pretty fun didn't expect my first day to go this way and it was pretty fun 

First Friday of school-year comes and they asked me if I wanted to hang out with them so I said sure.. I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met

The group & I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. 

Before Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. 

She told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. 

We hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. 

Now the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. 

Her parents hate me & my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations 

I told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. 

Am I the asshole? 



TL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few ""fake"" dates because we're from nations that hate each other.

1708,Asshole,"TLDR: I despise my mother’s boyfriend who has not treated me well and do not want him in attendance at my wedding. WIBTA for not allowing my mother to bring him? 

Basic backstory is that my mother and father separated when I was around 12 and have both since found new relationships. It wasn’t the messiest divorce, but by no means was it amicable and I was very angry for how it went down, especially in regards to my mother, for quite a few years. 

At this point, I’m 21 and have a wonderful boyfriend that I’ve been with for over a year. We’re living together in his country while I do university here and it’s been going well. We‘re not engaged, but we’ve spoken about it and it’s just a matter of when (I’m not pressuring him).

I despise my mothers boyfriend. My mother didnt handle a new relationship with this person and her children well. She moved him into our house without any regard for my or my sister’s feelings. We were just ambushed one day and told that he and his disabled mother were moving in. I admit that at first he attempted to form some sort of relationship with me, but when I didn’t bite, it became mutual ignorance. He then began to erase every semblance of my father from that house. He destroyed our pool, he turned my sandbox into a pit for his cigarettes, he painted over the mural that my father painted for me, etc. 

I never left my bedroom because I was so uncomfortable in the house and barely spoke to my
mom. The only time I got with my mother was when we would watch this one show every week. Once when we were watching this show, he came in, grabbed the remote from me, and told me about how I was such a terrible child who didn’t respect my mother or him and I needed to get my act together and then threw the remote and stormed out. I never again watched that show with my mother. 

After I went to university, things got a bit better with my mom and I worked on forging a relationship with her that didn’t involve him. And things are better now. We hang out and talk and I’m happy to have her in my life. But I will not go to anything if he is involved. To be honest, I don’t really care if she feels bad for having to pick me or him because I was never picked when I needed her when I was younger. She says I don’t want her to be happy, but I believe that incredibly selfish to say and I don’t want to deal with it. 

Anyway, here’s the basic question. I told my boyfriend that my mother could not come with him to our wedding. He doesn’t think that’s fair to her as he’s in a very similar situation with his mother and her boyfriend and that I should want my mother there no matter what. He tolerates her boyfriend and speaks to him because he loves his mother so much, but he doesn’t like him. I don’t want that. I don’t want to feel this hate inside me when I’m supposed to be my happiest. So WIBTA for only allowing my mother to come without him? ",46,64,0.95
1709,Not the A-hole,"So my gf and I will be together for 6 months on the 4th of Mars. We are in the same class in college (We are French, so it probably doesn't work like in the other countries; sorry for my english too), and we only dated for a week before becoming a couple. She's extremely cute and funny, and I really think that I love her.   
But we don't live together and for the moment, we can't, as we are living in student appartments (cheap, 9m² rooms), not in the same zone (she lives like 5 minutes from me though).   
And she always want me to go spend the evening with her and sleep at her place, which was okay, until i started going to the gym. You see, i'm a little overweight and while I easily joke about it with friends, my belly is kind of my sensitive spot. I'm going to the gym with the two other guys of our group of friend, and we're often going in the morning because one of my friend works on the afternoon. And every single time I sleep at my GF's place, she asks me ""You're sure you wanna go ?"" which pisses me off, as she doesn't seem to understand that i'm doing this for my health, not to escape from her.  
She also complained that I visited her less often that before, which is true. But everytime i go to her place, we sit in her bed watching movies, laugh a little and barely have any sex, and we're starting to argue more and more about crap. And the problem is that we're seeing eachother every single day of college, every single class. And she alwas has to sit next to me (I don't care, I mean, I still love her weither she's next to me or 10 row away).   
So sometimes, I just want to spend time alone or with friends over discord, playing, drawing or writing stuff, instead of doing virtually nothing at her place.

1711,Not the A-hole,"Edited to add: thanks for all the replies even the ones calling me the asshole. Good to see other perspective. I can definitely see where I could have done things differently and will certainly heed the advice to let him be an adult, you are right about that and I really truly am mad at her not him. I don't think I'll ever change my mind on her being a piece of shit though.

Throw away account obviously. But if she sees this and knows I'm talking about her. Good.

I (41) have been best friends with her (32) for 8 years. Since my son was 12.

My son (20) had just had his first big real heartbreak ever. I told her about this. In detail, she's my best friend. (We haven't lived near each other in a couple of years and she came to visit last summer and he was home from college) I thought they were weirdly friendly considering he's my son and she knew him as a 12 year old but they are both friendly people.

When I noticed him constantly texting her and knew how vulnerable he was feeling after above mentioned heartbreak I asked him if something was going on? He said no, I didn't want to intrude too much but asked her to ""cut back"" on the friendly chatter with my kid. She said okay.
She goes home I notice they are STILL texting constantly. I mention it to him again and he loses his shit saying I'm being controlling. So I tell her thinking she's an adult and a mom and will understand. I say hey I think (my son) is getting the wrong idea and you know he just had his heart broken. I know this sounds silly but I really need you to respect my friendship and my concern for my son and just cold turkey stop talking to him.
She was very apologetic, said she didn't realize, okay, done.

This was last summer.

Today I find out they are still talking. I get upset confront them both. Find out they HAD SEX LAST SUMMER. MY best friend and my son.

What the fuck.

Am I overreacting here? I find this very predatory on her part and disturbing. I've always noticed that she tends to like to lead guys on and I try and stay out of it. I was concerned there was some leading on flirtation going on from the beginning which is why I confronted her and said please stop 

Not only have they had sex, it was ONGOING. He flew out to see her behind my back! All of this while she's talking to me like none of this is happening and he's doing the same.

He says it was stupid, it's over, they are only friends now.
This is a grown ass woman with a divorce and 3 kids. He's a 20 year old college student who has had very few relationships in his life. 

She knew every detail of his recent heartbreak. She knows way more about him than he knew about her because she's my best friend and we talk about our kids!

Tell me straight up am I being an overdramatic momma bear or is she a predatory selfish bitch?

Bonus points if she sees this and knows it's about her because fuck you. 

TL:DR my best friend (32) had sex with my son (20) and an ongoing ""relationship"" behind my back and expressly against my asking them both to cut ties.

1712,Not the A-hole,"Ok, so some context here. This guy I work with is part-time; he has another job during the day. He is allowed to use the staff lockerroom facility, and he was vaping (from a mod, which is known for fatty clouds) in the bathroom. He ends up setting off the fire alarms for the entire building, which is a hospital. 

I only know about this because he told me, and later showed other co-workers of ours a video of him freaking out in the stall. (He even went as far to tell our boss about it.) I asked him what happened, preparing to hear about a hefty fine or something. Apparently his cousin is a security guard there; helped him sneak out of the locker room, and into the general halls. He walked out of there, while everyone else thought it was a real fire/emergency! He told me the staff were moving patients away from the area and some people were obviously very worried.  
Authorities were called as it was not a scheduled fire drill.

Here's where I might be the asshole: this guy was laughing about the whole situation. He also kept bringing it up throughout his entire shift. I had to hear about this for 5 hours people! He made it seem like it was funny and 'totally not a big deal'. I personally can't find any humor in putting people into panic, disrupting patient care, and just wasting time, funny. I heard that the hospital caught some footage of him exiting the hall of the lockerroom, and police are asking people for information. I'm really tempted to call.

1713,Not the A-hole,"So I am married with 2 little girls aged 4 and 2. I work abroad and spend a month away at a time so the MIL stays at my house to help with the kids. She recently got a new boyfriend who is an ex alcoholic and according to my wife a pretty nice guy. The problem is that when I go to work he has been coming over and basically living at my house, sleeping there and having free access to my kids. I have spoken to my wife repeatedly about it and said how uncomfortable I am with the situation but she won’t tell her mother to stop it.
I recently returned from work a few weeks ago and was met at my own front door by the MILs boyfriend with no shirt on acting like he fucking owns the place. He had been staying there for a week and even brought his friend over who stayed as well! The women have also been letting him take my older daughter for walks and to the park and stuff and it freaks me out! I know how vulnerable kids are and it makes me feel guilty about being away for work so much but I have to pay the bills. 
AITA for wanting to feel like the Alpha in my own house and for worrying that this guy has access to my kids and I can’t seem to do anything about?

Ok, Maybe ‘wanting to feel like the Alpha’ is a poor turn of phrase... I really just mean that I want to be treated as the father, provider and partner in the household and parenting even though I am away a lot. I want my concerns to be taken seriously and not feel like an Arsehole because I don’t want a strange man staying in my house while I am not there.

Edit: So it’s a mixed bag of responses, most of it constructive in both the positive and the negative. I should clarify a few things. My wife and I have talked about the issue multiple times and I have expressed my views clearly. I have never said that BF is not allowed in my house at all, I have said that he is welcome but as any other guest is, that is, in the company of MIL and not as an over night guest. I am supportive of MIL’s relationship but I want it conducted in the privacy of their respective homes and not in front of my children and in my home. But most importantly I don’t want my daughters to be left alone with BF or his friends under any circumstances. He could be the nicest guy in the world but he is not a relative and I really don’t know him from a bar of soap. It is a risk that I just don’t want to take. Prevention is better than cure 100% of the time and who knows, if he hangs around for the long haul my view may change but that time hasn’t come yet.",143,270,0.98

1717,Not the A-hole,"Search up my post history, I don't care. I'm at the end of my rope, she's at the end of her's and I can't do this anymore.

A week ago, my daughter (who lives with me - she is turning 30 soon) and I got into an argument regarding custody over her 3 year old son. We'll call my daughter Annie and her son Tommy. I have custody of Tommy because, at the time of his birth, Annie was on drugs. She's been sober and living with me for 2 years now. At this point, I still do not trust Annie with caring for Tommy full time/by herself considering she doesn't have enough patience/responsibility to care for a 3 year old, especially one that has a severe illness (cystic fibrosis). She still barely understands his illness (Annie asked me the other day why can't they just give him new lungs so that she doesn't have to do all of the work that goes into his care when she gets custody) and has refused to take over or even learn how to deal with all the insurance and hospital jazz.

Going back to the fight, Annie was pissed off because she thought she wanted the keys to my car. She said she had to go somewhere, but didn't specify where. I (nicely) asked here where and if she needed gas money and she just flipped out of nowhere. She threw one of Tommy's toys at the TV, cracked it, and then went on a rant about how I don't trust her and that she's a grown woman who can do whatever she wants. Mind you, almost a year ago, she crashed my car and blamed me for allowing her to use it. She also brought up how she doesn't get to be a mother to her son and blames me for them not having a good relationship.

I admit, I've got my own quirks that make me hard to deal with. I recognize that I have been a too overbearing and that I need to let her heal at her own pace, but I feel that I need to draw the line somewhere. I also said something I really regret: ""Maybe you should think about caring for your kid like I have to prove to me that you're an adult."" That's when she got pissed and almost attacked me before she walked out.

She was gone for 12 hours, despite knowing of a doctor's visit for Tommy I wanted her to be there for and knowing that she had to show up for work after the appointment. She comes back drunk as hell and smelling of weed. My one stipulation for her other than having a job is no drug use, legal or illegal - my daughter is very much a go big or go home type, and even though I recognize not all drug use is bad, I need her to focus on Tommy.

I told her she could come in and pack her bags. I also told her that I could take her to a shelter but she told me to fuck off and left back out; I have no clue where she is now. AITA?",126,806,0.97
1718,Not the A-hole,"AITA? So a friend of mine opened up to me about abuse she suffered while living with her father. To be as delicate as I can talking about this issue, I will simply say He repeatedly offended and groomed her her whole life and ended up hurting her badly many times. she graduated early just to get out of his home.My friend has a younger sister though, whose 16. My friend stated that she didn’t think her dad was abusing her younger sister, (despite what I consider to be very telling signs of abuse, and a near admission to it.)

I don’t want to ruin her relationship with her mom and siblings, but there is still a minor in that house and I’m not sure if she is being abused right now. I’m pretty young, my friend is 17 and I’m 19. I am afraid that my impulsively may have effected the outcome of my friend’s life negatively after she’s already had to deal with so much.

however, although he was mean to me, my parents want me to be the one to reconnect with him. he has a learning disability called auditory processing disorder, which basically means he has a hard time understanding what others are saying to him, even if its very simple.  because of this, he has a hard time holding down a job and passing classes and that sort of thing. my parents have almost been enablers of this, because they didn't tell him the severity of his disorder until fairly recently, and didn't enroll him with disability services or any sort of therapy for the disorder when he was younger. any time he has done something wrong because of the disorder, they haven't corrected him - they've only just passed it off as ""our son's so goofy! he doesn't know any better!"".

1723,Not the A-hole,"This is definitely a much smaller AITA than some on here, but its driving me bonkers. Context: I've lived with my boyfriend for over a year. He owns the house and pays the mortgage on it, but all other bills are split evenly... Except for groceries. Originally the plan was to take turns, which worked for a while. 

However, its deteriorated to taking quick grocery runs just to grab what we need, and since I'm the one who cooks most often (I eat keto so its easier for me to make the food) I'll typically be the one who gets groceries for dinner that night. Also among my purchases are modified versions of favorite snacks that fit my dietary needs (like Atkins bars instead of regular granola bars, or Halo Top instead of regular ice cream), which are generally more expensive than normal items.

My problem is that my boyfriend eats all my special foods instead of the plethora of things in the house that aren't keto (example, he has his own ice cream but will chow through a pint of Halo Top). I asked him to stop and his response is that he thought ""we shared things equally."" I wouldn't mind as much if he occasionally bought these things, but he doesn't. 

Recently I bought some keto approved snack cakes online and he immediately wanted some. I told him I only bought coconut flavor (he hates coconut). I actually got a variety pack. He caught me eating a lemon one and blew up about it because I lied to him, and we could have shared but I was being selfish, and that I was being a jerk about my food. I just dont wanna spend a bunch of money on pricey keto foods and have him eat them when he could eat regular food. AITA?

EDIT: Because this seems to be a big sticking point for people, the reason I do not pay half the mortgage is not because I CAN'T, its because my bf wants to move into a much larger house, which would require me to not have student loans.

They let their dogs poop everywhere and leave it there. They’re doing this like ten feet from the porch of the people who live below us, who also walk their puppy back there and they along with other tenants have talked about how they stepped in it a few times as well as they’ve had to pick it up themselves because their dogs tries to eat it and obviously they have no idea if the dog that left it has worms or some other poop transferable issues. Literally 100 feet away is a fenced off dog park area with dog poop bags readily available. 
The woman in the leasing office who takes my rent checks asked about us having seen one of these people and asked us to email a description of anyone we see doing this along with pet descriptions (the office has pictures of all pets tenants have registered with the office)
Today I recorded a girl walking two dogs, got her on camera letting them both poop and then after she looks around to see if anyone saw, she walks away from it. I tried to go outside to confront her before taking it to the office, but she was already gone by the time I got dressed and went outside. 
Tried to email the video to my leasing office, and afterwards was talking to a few different people about it and got wildly different reactions. Some people said I should’ve sent it and that it was justified, and others said I was an asshole for trying to mess up her lease and potentially get her evicted if she has lease violations already just because she left poop in nature where it belongs. Then I found out the video file was too large to email, and now I’m hesitant to email screenshots I took of her and her dogs due to the things people said about it being a bad idea. 
So, would I be an asshole for getting this woman in trouble with our leasing office just over dog poop? Is dog poop even that much of an issue that it should result in a lease violation?

EDIT: just to add in because a lot of people were talking about it, I went through our own copy of our lease and there is in fact a section that outlines rules about dog poop and does say that if you are caught not cleaning up dog poop it can result in a lease violation.

1732,Not the A-hole,"My mother-in-law moved in with us about three months ago. It's been ok. She and I are clashing personalities and cultures, and it's come up more often now that we share a similar space. She is a traditional Hispanic woman with a strong sense of decorum and family hierarchy. I am white, liberal in all ways, and agnostic about most traditions, including and especially the need to obey elders.

Before, out of consideration to my spouse and out of a belief in the my ""my house, my rules adage,"" I used to watch what I said around her very carefully because we only visited with her about once a month. But when my spouse asked if she could live with us, I said I was okay with it as long as I no longer had to walk on eggshells around her. My spouse agreed and told their mother that she needs to respect that we do and say things differently in our home than she may like. I don't know how her mother responded to that but it never came up again.

Last week, my 10-year-old and I were chatting while having breakfast while she was in the kitchen. We were goofing around and making bodily function sounds to each other. We are very mature, I know. But when I said, ""I fart in your general direction!"" and made a loud raspberry sound at her (she was giggling like crazy), my mother-in-law slammed down her coffee mug and said, in Spanish, ""Don't you dare teach my granddaughter to be so disrespectful. I will not allow this kind of vulgarity in my home any longer."" And I said, in English (I can understand Spanish but can't speak it well), ""This is my home. You don't get a say in how I interact with my kids, or how any of us speak or act."" She stormed away and now isn't speaking to me.

My spouse says ITA because I embarrassed her in front of our daughter and because I expected her to accept too much, too quickly. They also say that I am being a little culturally insensitive and that I need to respect that abuela will be deeply offended by how I spoke to her, so I need to apologize. But I think it was important for her to see that I will stand up for our interactions/myself and also to stick to what we originally agreed on--that I won't be policed in my own home.",2170,19393,0.92

1734,Not the A-hole,"My mother was with my stepdad for a long time. He physically and emotionally abused us, and sexually abused my sister before he finally got caught, arrested, and sent to prison, all while she stood by with her fingers in her ears because she “loves” him and refused to see the bad in him. I don’t think they’ve officially gotten divorced but they’ve since been separated and estranged. Since then she’s been dating. And they all look a lot like my ex stepdad, strangely enough. She goes through them pretty quickly, sees them for a couple months then on to the next dude. Well now she told me she’s been with this dude for 5 months so I looked him up. And of course the guy has a criminal history. Aggravated burglary, criminal damage, criminal trespassing, and domestic violence. Plus the dude doesn’t seem to know where his seat belt is since he has 3 separate seatbelt charges in as many years. So I told her and she got pissed, asking me if i didn’t trust her to pick a decent guy. Well no, I don’t, considering I was abused from the age of 3 to my early 20s while she stood by and allowed it to happen. I told her if she didn’t stop lying to herself about the men she’s dating, then I didn’t want to continue our relationship anymore. She’s always asking me to let the kids stay for a week or two over the summer and I just don’t trust her to take care of them, especially since I know how attached she gets to her men. If one of those guys touched my children while they were under her supervision I don’t think I could forgive myself.

She told me all about this amazing art he draws and how talented he is, so i asked her if i could see his art one day since it sounded really interesting.

Well today she showed me, the first red flag for me was when she went into Devianart.

The first thing i saw was a page filled with very vulgar furry art. (He was really talented tho). 

it was very cringy to look at, but i just went along and told her how amazing i thought the art was and how talented he was. 

She said i could look at the page myself sometime if i wanted to check more of his art out, so i did.

He had some art where you had to be 18+ to view, so i logged in and viewed it. 

It was basically furry porn, Scooby doo porn (yes ik), my little brony porn and then loli. 

He had a bunch of drawings of a mother and  daughter (the daughter looked about 7 years old) that laid in bed while they were naked and the mother was touching her. It was disturbing and gross to look at.

My roomate is a lot older than me and i dont really think she's into internet culture. So i dont think she even saw those drawings or knows what a furry or Brony is.

She seems so happy for this guy, but i just can't get over the stuff i saw he made.

She's only been my roomate for about 1,5 month, so its prob not something i should interfere in.

I still enjoyed the date and he paid our tab, after that we were speaking and he mentioned we should go to this cool other bar next time. And I just said I wasn't feeling anything between us, he was kinda bummed but said any particular reason? So I just told him I don't really like shorter guys, and he surprisingly took it very well. He said no problem I get it, thanks for the honesty and we hugged and went on our on ways. 

I told one of my friends this who's a guy and not short he's like avg height and he said that was super vain and shallow as the way I was describing him he was a nice guy and he can't control his height.

1737,No A-holes here,"Hello,

Backstory: I just moved to my fiancée's home country after having a long distance relationship with her for sometime. She's now 11 weeks pregnant and she's experiencing severe hyperemesis (incredibly bad morning sickness - more like all day sickness).

&#x200B;

I bought her a pregnancy pillow (one which can wrap around her entire body) recently, and she's been using it in bed. It's a queen sized bed, but with the pillow too, there's not a lot of room for me now, so I'm sleeping as far up against the wall on my side of the bed.

&#x200B;

Today she's told me that she didn't sleep well last night because she's having to get up around 4 times a night to pee (as a result of the fluids she's being administered to help with dehydration). She told me that once she did get back into bed, I was breathing in her general direction, and it wasn't very pleasant - which is fair enough, but I'm having trouble sleeping facing the wall, my arm now has a bad ache every time I am positioned that way. She also cannot face the other way as a result of having the line for her fluids in her arm.

&#x200B;

Now, I wanted to figure out how we are going to solve this - as the big thing here is that we need to re-arrange her room as a few pieces of furniture need to move around to make sure we both have access to a side of the bed, and also for room in the future for a crib. In lieu of that not happening instantaneously (need help from her brothers to shift the furniture), I suggested that I sleep in the front room until it comes time to rearrange the bedroom.

&#x200B;

She took this to mean that I didn't want to sleep next to her in bed anymore, which is entirely untrue - and I even made that clear, but she then says that I'm making a mountain out of a molehill out of the whole situation.

&#x200B;

What I can take away from this is that we are both uncomfortable, so I am willing to bite the bullet and go and sleep elsewhere so that she can be comfortable in bed.",56,187,0.96

My best friend, her husband, my husband and I are all friends and hang out fairly frequently. One day I get a message from her Husband on Facebook, and he had asked me for advice on marriage councilors ( as my husband and I have seen one previously)  this was in December.

Fast forward  until two weeks ago, my bestfriend told me that her and her husband were on a break. I thought based on what she had been doing that was probably a good choice.

 Her husband works for the gym I attend and I needed to put my account on hold. I messaged him asking if he could put the paper work for that through and he said he could. We chatted for a bit I asked him how things were going and he said they were okay but not great- I said that his wife had told me about their break and that I was sorry that they were struggling.

THEY WERE NOT ON A BREAK. So the. He starts rapid firing questions about it and I tried to deflect as much as possible.

She texted me until 12 midnight saying that because of me they are getting a divorce. So.

I take my privacy very seriously, and as such, I don't give passwords out to anyone, including my partners, and I hate it when people go through my photos or search history.

I'm not going to lie, I yelled at her and told her she has no respect for boundaries or my privacy. She kept crying and telling me it's okay, I didn't cheat, and she trusts me now, etc. This pissed me off, because she should have trusted me in the first place, and now I have no trust in her because I know she's the type of person who could even consider breaking into my personal belongings.

I broke up with her, as I have no desire to be with someone who doesn't respect my sense of privacy, and mistakes privacy for 'possibly cheating'.

1746,Not the A-hole,"Hello everyone!

Here's my story:
I have two sons, the older is 8, the younger is 7. I used to be a single mom for years. I found a great nanny 5 years ago, who helped me out a great deal ever since. She looked after them on weekends, picked them up from school, took care of them during holidays etc.
We became somewhat friends over the years, and she insisted taking the kids all the time. 
I tried to stay within reasonable limits and pay her as agreed, even though she never wanted to accept my money. Obviously, I insisted.

I usually had this feeling that she is overly friendly with me because I'm a stable source of income, but I hushed these feelings away as she truly handled the kids well and they loved going there.

Fastforward a couple of years. I'm about to get married now to a great guy who has been living with us for two years. He works from home so bringing the kids to the nanny once a week was more for keeping our routine and not pressuring my fiancée into watching my kids. We are planning kid no. 3 and thought it would be handy to keep the nanny for the future as well.

The problem started yesterday. We came back from a 5 day trip with my SO and picked the boys up from her place. I asked them how everything went and they (mostly the little one) told me that they don't want to go anymore because the nanny's husband gets upset often and he is scary. They said that he hits them and his own kids when they don't behave well in the car, and later precised that he never actually hit them, just threatened them. I should also mention that my kids have rich imagination and they do indeed tell white lies.
I figured it's best to go to the nanny with the kids to clear things out, knowing that she is veeeeery easily offended. I warned the kids to only tell the truth and to express their feelings to her, so it doesn't come from me.
In the end, she raised her voice and got really upset with my little one, saying that her husband is upset sometimes but he would never hurt anyone (I believe her), and that my youngest plays the baby to manipulate me. I understood that the whole thing was overreacted, but since the little one cried histerically today and yesterday as well, and he made me promise that he would not have to return to her place, I asked for her advice.
I told her that I believe her, but I cannot ignore my son's emotions and I would feel like a terrible motjer if I forced him to stay with her. I asked if she has any advice for me. 
At this stage she pulled her pokerface and told me that she was deeply disappointed that I side my 7 year-old instead of a grown woman and she made up her mind not to have anything to do with me or my children ever again.
I apologized but stood my ground and left. I made the kids say thank you and had them realize how much she has done for them/us over the years. She didn't bat an eye.

Any advice/opinion would be greatly appreciated ",102,189,0.92
1747,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend has this friend, let's call him Steve. Steve has always given me weird vibes and I tend to avoid him at get togethers. He never did anything blatantly inappropriate, but I noticed him staring at me a lot and he made off color jokes at times that were never bad enough to get upset about but were enough to give me a bad feeling.

I'm a waitress and Steve came into my restaurant with a few of my boyfriend's other friends. They sat in my section so I waited on them and was very cheerful and friendly, as waitresses do. Steve was chattier than normal and I talked to him a bit. After a little of this, I felt like Steve was getting a bit too friendly so I distanced myself for the rest of the meal.

My boyfriend sat me down that night and said, ""Is there anything you need to tell me?"" I was confused, he brought up lunch and I was like, ""yeah, some of your friends came in, why?"" This goes back and forth and then he tells me that Steve said I was flirting with him. Obviously I denied it because I wasn't flirting, I was just chatting with him and left when I felt like HE was flirting. My boyfriend told me he needed space to process, so I left.

I was really upset with Steve and with my boyfriend for the accusations, and was contemplating ending the relationship over it. My boyfriend calls a few days later and tells me he talked to his other friends and confirmed I wasn't flirting with Steve. I got really pissed and told him that if he didn't trust me enough to believe me initially and then needed to verify my actions with his friends, I didn't want to be with him anymore. He said he was just doing ""trust but verify"" and that he did trust me and this was a dumb reason to break up.

1749,Asshole,"I am in my mid-fifties approaching retirement and recently went through a devastating divorce. I lost my house, half of the savings and fortunately no alimony payments. My wife was a working professional and towards the end, it felt like marriage was more about frugal living than love. We had been married for 32 years and had two wonderful children, both of which are girls. I wouldn’t trade away my relationship with them for anything, truly my pride and joy. They are ages 26 and 29, three years apart.

However, I can’t depend on my limited family to deal with the crippling isolation after work. My wife and I were not social in the sense that I do not have a strong network to *jump back into things*. In any case at my age, the dating world has changed a lot compared to when I met my ex-wife. It seems that you have a couple of sites that are appropriate for your maturity that lead to date after date of noncommittal garbage. After several months of dating people my age to no avail, I signed up for a sugar daddy dating service.

For someone my age, I take great care of myself and go to the gym regularly. I was able to start a relationship with a 19-year-old that seems to have come from a rough background. I am a little worried about some of the shadier people from her past. But who am I to say anything? I have two kids. I care for her deeply and provide for her needs as she does for me. We have had this arrangement for about half a year and things have gotten more serious, we have started talking about marriage. I can’t help but feel guilty when I hear her talk about how she sees a future with me.

When she talks about marriage, my mind always goes back to thinking about how we met on a sugar daddy dating service and the rigid gender role implications. I’ve made a spreadsheet and if I work for an extra half decade or so, I could realistically maintain the relationship until I die. I just don’t have the self-control to tell her I have no interest in that level of commitment again. Partially, I am worried that she would not get along with the small remaining family that I have left.

Essentially, I am dating a younger girl as I am approaching retirement. She wants to get married. I plan on continuing this relationship for as long as possible with the intent of never getting married. I do not plan on communicating this to her. Love, dating and relationships seem to be morally ambiguous, am I an asshole for treating my girlfriend the same way people my age have treated me in the dating world?

Edit: I am not dating her out of revenge, rather this is a question aimed at dating ethics.",207,200,0.81
1750,Not the A-hole,"For context: So at work we have a policy, if something is in the lost and found for longer than a month than the person who found the item can keep it. I'd say a solid 90% of the time the lost and found is client stuff, but there is the odd occasion an employee's item gets in there. I'm the IT guy and I have someone who works under me.

We have a receptionist who was on mat leave and took 8 weeks off. During this time the guy who works under me found a power bank (Anker PowerCore 2680) which is not a cheap one either ($65). He was giddy about finding it and was all about it. So I said, sure if no one shows up to claim it in a month you can have it.

Well no one does, so I let him have it. Then 3 weeks later the receptionist returns from mat leave. She asks about the power bank and says she was looking for it and couldn't find it. Gave the right model and all that and showed me the Amazon receipt so I knew it was legit. Thing is though, I told the employee he could have it. So I tell her this and the policy is clear. Still, she gets all weepy, and maybe it's pregnancy hormones, maybe it's more. I guess I felt bad so I told her I would see what I could do.

I tell all of this to my employee and he is furious. He tells me he waited the month and followed the rules, and tells me that the power bank is his. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place, but I ultimately decide that since she was the original owner and she couldn't claim it earlier due to being out of the office, I make an exception and take back the power bank and give it to her.

Now he's pouting around. I understand it sucks. He didn't do anything wrong and this has never happened. I'm going to amend the policy with HR to better define that if it's an employee item then it goes back to the original owner. So we won't have a squabble like this.

First some background, I am a Disabled Vet with PTSD that manifests as anger, that is how I came by my handle. 

My son who is in his young 20s, had his 1st car accident last week.  Ever since the accident, my wife and son have been taking the word of the insurance people over me. Case in point, I told them to request a mobile adjuster to come to the house, so we have positive control of the vehicle until we sign it over to them, did they listen, no it is sitting in the lot of a local body shop.  We got word that they totaled the truck last night, now my son and Wife want to me go to the body shop (because my son works during their business hours) and pull all the Stereo Equipment that my son and I installed for Christmas. When I asked my son if he remembers what all tools, we needed to get the stuff out, he said no. When I said, that if the truck was still here, he could do it when he got off work, and I would not have to drag half my installers tool box with me and work in the cold, I was called an Ass.

The final straw, was when we were going over vehicles for sale, and came across an ad for a 2013 New Beetle. He said we should sue them for false advertising. When I asked why, he said because the 2019 model is the new beetle. I told him that it was VW that calls that body style the new beetle, to which he wanted to argue with me. When I spun my laptop around to show him where Wikipedia shows every beetle made since 1998 was classified as a new beetle, I was called an ass and he walked away. 

After I calmed down, I decided that maybe, since they where not listening to me, I would just remove my self from the situation. Besides, they have asked my dad (who knows several people in the used car business) to help, this would be another stressor (not bad one, but one none the less), so I know they are in good hands. When I told my wife this, this morning, she said I needed to get a grip, that my son is going through something and I was just being an ass because I was not getting my way.

Her email only said ""I'm so fed up of this shit. This is such bullshit. I wrote back to the professors giving them my support over this crap"".

I replied with ""Why are you so upset? How does this affect you? Do you even know who the speaker is? Or what they wrote about? It sounds like you want to be upset by something""

She wrote back that I was being an asshole and that she didn't ""know anything about the guy, but my professor said he isn't sexist or homophobic"".

I don't know anything about him, but from what my professor said, this man isn’t sexist and he disagrees with the decision to disinvite him.

And this does affect future generations. I don’t want the universities to become a place where people are silenced because their options are different.

Me: That's the entire point.

You got immediately emotionally invested and worked up, and even wrote back to the prof, with literally 0 knowledge on the subject. You didn't bother to even google the guy/issue and see what the controversy was, just formed an opinion because someone told you to.

Her: You don’t even know what I said to the professor [my name]. Anyway, clearly we can’t have discussions about this.

I don’t get why you need to be so aggressive about this. You owe me an apology, Im waiting

I said I am not letting my kid be named after a dog, for heaven's sake, and she got really upset and said that it doesn't matter because I've never even met her childhood dog, so why would I even associate that name with a dog? She said she named her dog that as a kid because it was a name she always really liked. She also said that dog was her best friend growing up, while I've never even met the originator of our child's middle name. 

Now she is really mad and she says she doesn't want the kid to have some dead person's middle name. She says I'm being selfish because 2/3 of the baby's name is already mine. AITA?

1754,Asshole,"There is a random collection of mugs in the breakroom at my office. They mostly say stupid stuff like ""This is Totally Wine,"" ""Live Laugh Love,"" and ""Strategic Planning Seminar '16."" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis. 

All the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard. This chore is done on a rotating basis. As a senior (but not managerial) staffperson, I am not on the chore schedule. Mugs occasionally get broken or disappear, and people randomly contribute new mugs to replace them. I have donated a few from different conference swag bags and whatnot. 

This morning, the person assigned with 'breakroom duty' had not yet reshelved the mugs in the cupboard. So I grabbed one from the drying rack. It said ""World's Greatest Dad"" on it. On it were some pictures of some kids building a sandcastle on the beach, posing in Halloween costumes, etc. I  thought ""that's weird,"" filled it up, and went back to my office. 

About twenty minutes later, my colleague came into my office and asked for his mug. (I don't know how he knew I had it.) I looked at it more closely and he is indeed in some of the pictures on the mug. I said something like ""Congratulations on being the world's greatest dad."" 

He asked me for the mug. I said I would put it back in the sink after I finished my coffee. 

He left, and came back with a new mug that said ""Happy Birthday."" He told me to pour my coffee in the ""happy birthday"" mug, so he could take the ""World's Greatest Dad Mug."" 

I said ""No, you're being weird."" He said that I should have known that it was his mug, because of the caption and photographs. He said that he left in the breakroom for yesterday's breakroom-cleanup-person to wash, and that he otherwise keeps it in his office. He said that all of the people on the chore schedule know this and do not shelve his mug with the rest; I just happened to get to it before he did today. 

I told him ""I have to get on a call at 9:00. I don't have time for this. I'll wash it out when I'm done."" 

I didn't have a call. But I did wash the mug and and deliver it to him at his desk. He just glared at me like I'm an asshole. Is he right?

&#x200B;

Edit: Someone suggested that I edit this to clarify that the World's Greatest Dad and I are on the same level of authority/seniority. Neither of us is on the chore rotation. Anyways, I apologized to him for being a prick. He was cool about it. ",358,733,0.89
1755,Not the A-hole,"Basically what has been going on for the past \~3 years is that I have done all the chores for my brothers. Be it laundry, dishes, cleaning stuff, walking the dog etc., I am the first person called and when she calls for all of us I am the only one that comes (I don't know if they ignore her or if they actually don't hear her).

&#x200B;

I usually do it without complaint, because you know, chores. However, in the past 2 months, I've been putting some resistance to it, and ask her to have my brothers do it. She says she will and then never follows up on it, and the next day I'm doing everything again.

&#x200B;

One day I make sure they come. I ask ""Maybe brother should walk the dog."" She says he can do another chore and I put my foot down and make her call him down, cause I've walked the dog twice that day, and she goes back to her office to work. Fucker says ""so which one of us are going? I have to get back to my game."" so I just say no I got it, and go walk the dog. When I get back I have another chore to do and I flip the fuck out on my mom. This was basically the interaction.

&#x200B;

Mo: Hey sheckle's, can you do the washer?

&#x200B;

M: No

&#x200B;

Mo: Why? I don't want to do it.

&#x200B;

M: Well I just think I'm doing everything and I constantly tell you what I do and why I think my brothers should do it, you say you will fix it by making them do the chores and they still don't come down, so you call me!

&#x200B;

Mo: Oh my god sheckles, stop worrying about your brothers, they are fine.

&#x200B;

M: Little brother hasn't even walked the dog in a week!

&#x200B;

Mo: 4 years ago you were just like him.

&#x200B;

M: Does that mean he should continue to be lazy?

&#x200B;

Mo: Sheckles stop being so petty, I tell you to do it because you do it the best.

&#x200B;

M: What the fuck does that mean? I do it the best because I'm the only one that does anything! Maybe you should teach them how to do chores and make them get off their games to help me!

&#x200B;

Mo: Stop being rude! I'm not talking about this with you anymore. 

&#x200B;

At that point I went to my room and I haven't left. It's morning and school is in a bit, and I'm not exactly excited to go down. I feel like I'm in the right, but I don't know. am I really being that petty? Should I just do the chores?

I rarely fight with my mom so this is a very big deal for me and I don't know how she reacted.

TL;DR: I'm putting my foot down about doing chores around the house and I got into a fight with my mom. AITA?

1756,Everyone Sucks,"So, for context, I have 2 roommates. One we will call C, and one we will call F. While C and I get along just fine, I find that F and I butt heads a lot. Not that F is a bad guy, he is a clean and organized roommate, just not a great friend.

Now, C has a girlfriend named M, who has never seen Lord of the Rings in her life. In fact, she just doesn't do movies well and finds action movies dull. So C and I were both surprised when we convinced her to try Lord of the Rings the following night. 

Now, M has a bad attention span with action movies, so I figured I would play it safe. I love watching movies with people who have never seen them. It let's me re-experience the movies through a different set of eyes. And I really cherish the LoTR films so I wanted her to have the best experience possible. 

I asked F is he was planning on having anybody over that night, and when he confirmed he wasn't, I asked if he could keep it that way. I told him what we were watching, and that I didn't want too many people there to distract her from the movie. In fact, M was the only person coming over. He seemed to be a little put off, but he asked if he could watch it with us, to which I said ""of course dude, it's your apartment too"".


Well, we get M over to watch the movie and get about 30 minutes in. M is watching intently, only talking to ask questions, and genuinely enjoying it.

When we hear a knock on the door. It was F's younger brother, who we will call F2. Now, F2 was like 2 years younger than the rest of us, and is a really nice dude. F said he wanted him over to watch the movie too. So we say ""um, sure"", and F2 finds a seat.

Within 2 minutes, the brothers are now talking about their days and just random stuff in general. This goes on for a few minutes, and it wasn't exactly quiet. I noticed that M has started looking back at them, So I pause the movie, and just asked ""are you done? We're trying to watch a movie.""

This got under F's skin, and he shot back that this was his apartment too, and he didn't like being told what to do. I responded that any other night, I wouldn't care, but tonight was a special night. And I asked him to respect that, to which he said he felt disrespected anyway. So he and F2 left. 

We then watched the rest of the movie and M really enjoyed it. Asking when we could watch the 2nd one.

I just tried talking with F about it, and he responded with hostility, stating that I put too much stake in movies and should care more about people. He also said that he invited his brother because I had asked him not to, and he said I had no right, to keep him from having people over. He also included that I apparently hate his brother.

So… thoughts

EDIT: Thanks for all the feedback so far! I didn't post here to try to validate myself, but to legitimately see if I was out of line, and work on things with F moving forward. So I'll take all these thought into consideration when I talk with him again about it!",30,84,0.94

1758,No A-holes here,"The character limit is killing me :D

My girlfriend (19f) and I (21m) have been in a really good relationship for over 1 and a half years. Currently I am on an exchange semester, I will stay here from the beginning of february to the end of June. We will not see each other apart from video calls during this time.

One month in, we were texting. In the transcript I’ll label her as GF and myself as I:

GF: By the way, if you are feeling anything like me, you can make out with any girl, as long as you come back to me

I: What? Are you completely out of your mind?

GF: I am fully on withdrawal from you. No, I’m serious, it does not matter to me, as long as you come back to me in the end

I: Do you need to confess something to me?...

GF: No

I: Then stop with this bullshit

GF: Trust me, I’m being faithful, I even have my own Cockblocker (good friend)

I: I hope so

GF: I am happy with you, I do not need anyone else but I miss being close to you, the only person I’ve kissed since you are gone was (female friend of us)

I: What kind of logic is that then?

GF: My logic, I want you to feel good and that your missing nothing

And then you aren’t all alone anymore

I: If you think I’ll give you a free pass just because you offered me one, you are in the wrong, If I wanted to make out with anyone else, I’d be single and would not be mentioning you in any conversation I have

GF: just so you know, I talk about you all the time too and even if you gave me a free pass like that, I would not do it because I’m feeling really happy in our relationship but I don’t want to force you to do anything that makes you feel bad when I’m not around

I: Do you really think, just because we are separated for 4 or 5 months that I jump on everything that moves? Do you really think our relationship means that little to me?

GF: no, but everyone has their needs, atleast I have our friends here, I’m not that alone here, I know that our relationship means a lot to you, that’s why I tell you you can do whatever you want, because I know that you will come back to me

I: Yes I’m “alone” here, without my friends, family and you, but does that make you think I do that kinda shit?

GF: I just wanted to give you the chance, I know that you love me and I love you, I never wanted to say anything that hurts you, I know you wouldn’t do something like that, but if it would help you get through those months, I just wanted to say that its OK for me

I: So wrong in place

GF: OK, I take it back, I’m sorry I just had it in my head and just wanted to say it, I’m really sorry and I love you

I: Can’t take something like that back, said is said and now I’m in doubt

GF: I don’t doubt you

I: But I doubt you now

GF: Are you serious? I do not do stuff like that

I: Yes, I am fucking serious

That was yesterday and since then we haven’t talked to each other. I kind of lost some trust in her now and I’ve been thinking a lot about what the future will bring

So AITA for being mad at her?

&#x200B;

  

Update:

We have been talking for an hour after she finished working, about the conversation and about us in general. She explained herself further and pretty much stated, that she only wants me to be happy even if it means that she isn’t. Yes it sounds pretty sad, but she justified it with me never seeing those people again in my life and if that is what it takes me for being happy, I’m free to do what I would like. Again, I declined that, saying that all I want is her and to go even further, her to be happy and feeling good. Furthermore, I can now understand why she wanted to give me a free pass, or as someone called it the golden ticket. She would rather stay in control of the situation, as she has never had a boyfriend that stayed faithful. I am more than sure that I want to stay together with her and hopefully improve our relationship so that she never thinks again she has to offer something like that for me to be truly happy.

I also asked her again if she cheated or thought about cheating, she denied that and I have no rational reason to think that she was lying. She also understands why I reacted the way I did, and we discussed that too. 

Due to this post, I got some insights and now I definitely see a few aspects I need to work on and a few others we need to work on together. But apart from that, I am really relieved and I still love her and she loves me. 

Oh, and she is not a Cuckqueen, we had a pretty good laugh at that :D

Throwaway as I don’t want my girlfriend to see this post.

Just a bit of background info: my girlfriend works in HR and I work in IT for the same company, however because we work in two different branches we only really get to see each other before/after our shift as our lunch breaks are scheduled at different times. Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we’re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a “surprise” she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn’t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn’t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples’ leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn’t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She’s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I’m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?",1323,2526,0.91
1760,Asshole,"So, to start off, maybe, it was a bit petty of me tbh. Anyway, I asked this girl Clara out on a date about a year ago. I was a completely different person then, and she turned me down. It stung like hell, but it did encourage me to better myself. Since then I've gotten in better shape, became more confident and generally I've had more luck with girls. I still never forgot what made me improve though, and that will always be a shitty memory.

Anyway, me and a few friends I've made since last year went out to a gathering. I'm still fairly new in their circle, and surprise! Clara was there. I think she recognized me but I wasn't sure. Me and her hit it off, and at the end of the night we had a date planned. The date went pretty well and we went on our second one last friday.

After this I went home and thought about where to go next, and I realized I couldn't really forgive her. So, she hit me up asking if we were going out again, and I sort of make a joke of it, blew it off and put her on mute. I haven't responded since then, and our mutual friends say she's been pretty upset, since she gets attached to people quickly, but the revenge I got was so sweet!

1762,Everyone Sucks,"Okay. So this happened a couple of years ago. My uncle picked me up from the airport with a girl that he called his ""friend"". We went around doing a lot of things together. I was pretty suspicious, like, who in the world is this chick? I remember meeting her several years back when. I. was younger, but it was like one meeting and I. was younger. This time I was basically going. around the city. with her and my uncle and so I. was like...  is she a mistress?? That was all I could think about. We went to her apartment, she took me. to the salon, we went out to eat, she even was there in the morning when I was hospitalized at the ER to bring me breakfast O\_O!

&#x200B;

After a while, I finally. asked. my mom who was surprised that I didn't realize/ask sooner. She. confirmed my guess. Yes, that woman was my uncle's mistress.

&#x200B;

Now, I had very conflicting feelings about this. She treated me quite nicely, and so I did like her. My grandma likes her. My mom likes her too. And both my grandma and my mom insisted that I don't say anything at all to my aunt and not mention her at all when we talk. Because my mom was like your aunt will be furious and it's not your business etc., and that you shouldn't interfere with these things, basically. Now, I felt really. guilty, because I like my aunt and I think cheating is wrong. But I also thought the mistress was a nice person. And I didn't want to be someone who... ruins the peace, if. you. know what I mean. So in the end, my mom. convinced me, I didn't say anything, and went back home when the summer. was over. Next summer I didn't say anything either. plus, my mom does have a good point that it isn't my business...

&#x200B;

Idk, I occasionally still wonder if I'm. a terrible person for not saying anything, so I wanted to ask this. here. if you guys. think I am an asshole for not saying anything in the end.

&#x200B;

Some more background info: In China, mistresses are fairly common (so says my mom). My aunt and uncle have divorced once. (idk the reason, I think she said it was several years ago), but got back together (my mom said because the divorce didn't work out, idky). They have a son (older than my by three years and already graduated college). My. mom says my aunt and cousin probably have their suspicions, but no one says anything. The mistress is not allowed to have a child (I think if she did all. hell would break loose if it is a boy). My uncle lives in an apartment with his mistress, while my aunt and cousin live in a different apartment (I've actually been to both and slept in both...)

&#x200B;

1763,Not the A-hole,"On mobile,sorry for the format and there will be a TL;DR.

So today I finally brought up the subject to my mother that I wanted my father to sit with his wife during my wedding. He and my mother have been divorced almost 20 years and he remarried back in 2004, she remarried 2 years ago but my stepfather passed due to liver failure. She flipped her shit and got professionally offended,saying she wasnt going to share the church pew row with her,she didnt raise me,and I had some audacity to ask her that,as well as treating her like shit. My stepmother has done nothing but treat my father, myself and my brother amazingly. My mom refuses to meet her because she still holds on to the past and constantly spits poison about her and my father. 

My mother made him leave due to constant infidelity,him in general not being around, and religious differences which they couldn't agree on where my brother and I would go to church.

My father did continue with his terrible lifestyle up until the point he had a serious medical issue that almost killed him and from there he turned his life around,getting clean,making time for my brother and I, trying to be apart of our lives, and sticking to his religious beliefs.

For context of our relationship my mother, post divorce for roughly 6 years, would take her anger and frustrations out on me because Iook just like my father and I had given up on myself at school due to constant harassment. Which in turn would cause a vicious cycle, crap beat out of me at school, being put down,wouldnt do my work,bad grades,mom saw grades,beating with a belt. Then her and dad would get into something trivial and she would treat me like crap on top of that,not making me dinner, took everything out but clothes,sheet and a pillow in my room. Would leave me at work with no ride back and would deny my brother coming to get me. Would also try to control every aspect of my life, such as work,extracurricular activities, etc. Which she had managed to do with my brother.

Needless to say once I could drive myself I made myself scarce and she still tried to control me. What caused me to eventually leave was a fight over the car I had bought with my money. After I had left I would live with friends and bounce around town until I managed to get a decent enough job to live on my own a few years back. Back in 2012 she had finally realized how bad she was treating everyone around her and finally got help but it seems over the past few years shes been regressing.

I feel like the day should be about my fiance and I and celebrating our love. As well as everyone enjoying the day and putting personal feelings aside to celebrate with us, at least being civil with each other. Was I an asshole for my request?

TL;DR:
Told my mother I wanted my stepmother to sit with my dad during my wedding,bad divorce between parents,moms a control freak,flipped her shit over the request. AITA?

1766,Not the A-hole,"I live in dorm style, on campus housing at a University with 3 other girls for 6 months now. It’s tight quarters, but things have generally been very chill and we’ve all become good friends. 

One roommate “M” has an emotional support dog who is two years old. The first week we moved in, the dog shit all over my rug and shoes and peed on my other roommate “H”’s bed. H and I tried to talk to M about it, but as soon as we brought it up she started crying. So, since we didn’t know her very well, we kinda just let it go to keep the peace. 

Since then, the dog has peed or pooped in the apartment about twice a week. I often clean it up. It sheds constantly and she never vacuums. M works long hours and keeps the dog locked in a small kennel for about 8 hours a day. When she comes home from work at 11pm or so, she doesn’t take the dog out, she just goes to bed and takes her out in the morning. She takes her out maybe twice a day, but never on a walk, just to go pee in the courtyard of the apartment building. She even had a tinder guy come to spend the night and the dog peed on her bed during the hookup! 

H and I used to take the dog out because we felt bad for it, but M would get on our case about not locking her cage right and other small stuff. We didn’t want it to become our issue so we stopped. 

The dog is very poorly behaved. It has bitten M on the face, growled and tried to bite guests, and it barks constantly. M lets it eat off our plates and generally do whatever she wants. She does not know any basic commands like sit or down or whatever. 

It’s really been getting on my nerves. About a month ago I talked to her in a very non confrontational way and very “let’s work this out together” attitude. I thought it went well, but the next day the dog shat on the floor again! I talked to her again the next week. Nothing changed. 

So todayyyyyy, she texted in the roommate group chat “I have said this before but you guys need to make sure the sponge isn’t damp after doing your dishes” and that was my last straw boy o boy. 
She is upset about such a minute detail when there’s the giant issue of her awful dog at hand. 

So I went down to the front desk and told them my concerns. The receptionist gave me the email of the apartment manager & said that if her service dog was acting this way she could be removed. I emailed the manager and she’s going to talk to M this week. I don’t think the dog will be taken away, I think I’ll just be moved apartments, but I guess we’ll see. 

I really feel so awful for doing this. I know it’s not the dogs fault & I want her to have a nice life and this isn’t it. I don’t want her dog to be taken from her, but I was just so tired of dealing w this every day. Her mom has a nice big yard and other dogs. The dog would be so much happier there. I do feel like such an asshole though because it’s her emotional support animal. I’m having inner turmoil & I can’t sleep. What do y’all think?? 

Next Morning Update: 
the manager emailed me and said she talked to M and  will be working on the situation. I’m not sure what that entails. She also said she could move me into an apartment with a therapy cat haha. I love animals but honestly I just want an apartment w no pets after this. ",178,472,0.97

“Damn 😍 your beautiful ”

Unfortunately, the girl I was originally crushing on saw it and went off on me about being a fuckboy and about how I shouldn’t hit on her best friend. I explained that I didn’t know and how I thought she had no interest in me and apologized for the whole situation. After some back and forth, she blocked me calling me an asshole after apologizing for everything.

1771,Not the A-hole,"This is actually a really weird situation I'm currently in. My husband and his wife had an amazing relationship. 

They had an accident which killed his wife, but my husband survived. This happened years ago. I understand that it was a very traumatic experience for him.

We've been married for 7 years and we have a 5 yo daughter together. We have an amazing relationship. He has this habit of buying me expensive presents. An year after being with him, I discovered that his wife and I shared the same name. I asked him about it and he told me that it was not one of the reasons he was attracted to me.

After we moved in together, he converted our backyard store room into her memorial. It has her pictures and other stuff belonging to her. And everything he buys for me, he buys for her. Literally everything. He got me new ring for Valentine's day. It looked amazing. And guess who else he bought that for?

I just cant help feeling that I'm just a replacement. If she were alive, I'd never be here. I just feel like her doppleganger. 

And we got into a big fight about this. I told him that this cannot continue and I feel really insecure. But he refuses to understand. He told me that he loves me and I'm the woman he chose to be with and I should never feel insecure about someone who passed away.

1773,Not the A-hole,"Dad killed in a t-bone collision.  It was a very traumatic situation for all of us.  My mother, wife and I live locally while the rest of the family live very far.  Taking care of things fell on my shoulders.  Not, like, ""Diggy, you must take care of XYZ"" but more like ""Diggy, just make sure Mom's okay.""

Court date came for this guy.  Everyone had returned back East, so I went.  It was super quick, over in like ten minutes.  The judge sentenced him to probation, license suspension, and Cal-Trans work.  (road work on the freeway.)  

After court, I followed him outside.  To this day, I don't know why.  I said, 'Hey.  Do you know who I am?""  He turned around and said yes, and he got silent and then said ""I'm sorry for your Dad.”  I talked to him for maybe 10 seconds, then I hugged him.  (I feel SO CRINGY thinking about this now)  I told him it's okay, I forgive you, and that was that.  

My family was FURIOUS.  How could I do that?  You were representing the FAMILY!  We all agreed at the funeral we were going to make this bastard pay!  I told them it was the only thing I could think of.  It was too much, and didn't want to hate anyone, I was too tired.  Their reactions ranged from anger to disappointment.  Not one family member was on my side.

My grandfather gave my wife and I $5,000 after the funeral in response to a letter I wrote telling him how dad's death made my life struggle even worse.  This  triggered my family.  I’m a greedy bastard. I was under obligation to share it.  That was not your money, its OUR money.  Grandpa died shortly after the funeral, and it was assumed as the 'last of the family line' that I would distribute it. 

Trying to do the right thing, I went through dad’s mail, found out his bank account info, and accessed it online.  I then did some sleuthing how to get the money out, full intentions of giving it to mom.  I didn't go so far as to contact probate lawyers which was the next step.

When I told mom what I was doing, ""that is not your goddamned money, you are a thief and a disgraceful child and are disgracing your father's name"" along with accompanying hate from my sisters.

My contact with my family now is so formal to the point of sarcastic, and no amount of explaining or apologizing has made a bit of difference.

1774,Not the A-hole,"Okay so yesterday my husband is made aware of momo. For those who don't know what it is, it's a creepy face that pops up in the middle of children's videos and tells kid to either kill themselves, or hurt somebody or do something bad. My husband says that he saw it six months ago and saw a video about it being true.

 My nine-year-old was very upset about it it was all they was talked about it school today. So I did some research and everything I can find online and so is that Momo is a hoax. There is literally no proof of it. All there is is a screenshot of the creepy face with either audio added afterwards or subtitles added to the bottom of the screen.

I told my husband and he gets very mad at me and tells me that I should believe him because six months ago he saw the video.  I said honey everything online says it's not true can you find a video showing me that it is? Then he gets really upset and says I'm calling him a liar because I don't believe that its real.

So he storms out and then text me that he doesn't want to talk about it anymore because he can't believe his wife is calling him a liar.

Now my husband is one of those that seems to think he knows quite a lot, the men in  his family seem to always be right and know everything. But my problem is that I'm allowed to question things and do my own research, if my husband tells me his opinion on something he has intimate knowledge of maybe car parts or something that he does. I believe him but he has no credibility on whether momo was a hoax or not. What does he have to backup other than he thinks he saw something 6 months ago and it's real.

I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for proof when everything that I can find says it's not real and it's only his word that it's real. Am I the a****** maybe if I show him this you might get through to him. Or maybe I'm in the wrong


Edit...

So to clarify. My husband doesnt think that Momo as a person or thing is real. But that it is actually being seen in childrens videos.

I immediately apologized and said “Don’t worry I’ll get you a new one ASAP, a tv like that is only like 80 bucks on Kijiji”.

I come over smiling and say hi, but she's not happy to see me. She says ""That was the most pathetic thing I've ever seen"". I sit down, not smiling any more. I take off my hat and gloves and put them in my pockets. She says something like ""Oh you're mad at me now because I called you out on being dumb?"". I say I'm not dumb, but she insists. I say ""I was expecting to meet you by the door and it's busy so I didn't see you at first"". She keeps arguing. I say this is a date and I think we should be nice to each other, and if she disagrees we can leave. She says ""You being overly sensitive is not my problem"". I repeat that I'm going to leave if she doesn't want to be nice, and she keeps yelling so I start to get up. She throws her hands up and yells ""Really!?"". I walk out and my wife doesn't follow.

I'm not sure whether I did the right thing. I know it's rude of her to be so vocally critical and insulting, especially in front of other people. For some reason she thinks if we meet up and she sees me first that I've done something wrong, like I don't care about her or I'm being lazy. I've tried to talk about it but all she says is that I should try harder. She's naturally very observant while I tend to start with where I expect things to be and narrow it down. Obviously I don't think this is important enough to argue about since the extra time I took was maybe 5 seconds.

For context, the burger place is right by our house and she wasn't in any danger walking back by herself. She says I am an asshole for leaving her, but I feel that the ultimatum ""stop calling me stupid or I'm leaving"" is such an easy hurdle.

Tonight I asked him how he feels about foreplay I.e if he wants to do it before I meet his mum or after, and he said he wants it to be natural and to do it whenever it ‘feels right.’ I responded that his stance on sex wasn’t when it feels right, but has an actual timing (me meeting his mum). Then he said I was killing the mood and I apologised and said I wouldn’t ask him anymore.

It’s my birthday today and I’m meant to be seeing him and staying over at his.

So that's not the issue here. What is the issue is me telling her that I don't know if I can stay with her or not.  


We had unprotected sex and she had not taken her birth control in about 2 weeks. She never told me this. In fact, according to her, she purposely just tell me. Since we've been together she has been on birth control and I've seen her take it on a usual basis in the morning. So I tended never to question her about it. We had talked about her wanting a child and I said I didn't want one until after marriage. She seemed to at least understand why I wanted that and then added, ""well I definitely don't want one until after college.""  


Fast forward to present day, everything has seemed to erupt. She's mad at me now. She said that I took my own risks by not using protection and she's right, I knew that and understand that well. I told her that I understood that. It's just that I can't help but feel like I've basically been lied to. She knows that I know that she's been taking birth control. She would always tell me when she was about to run out or when she had to go get more. Not this time though. It had been about 2 weeks since we had sex and then we had it about two weeks after she had stopped with the birth control. She *chose* that. Chose not to tell me.

My wife and I are fairly young (late 20's). I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. 
While I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.

Her parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.

I thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.

The real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially.

Bonus question: AITA if I use a sick day on my birthday? If I take a planned day, they'll rearrange my cake. If I take a sick day, they'll just have the cake without me. I feel like if I call in sick, I'm definitely an asshole.

Edit: I did hint (I thought strongly) that I didn't want to be included by saying Summer time and then only listing the month, and making other jokes. That clearly didn't work.

With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio.

However their mom is a recovering addict (who relapsed last year and just restarted recovery) and is currently living with my fiancee's mom since her and her ex-husband lost their house. They've been there for a year. 

In that year, it came to light that her husband was an abusive meth head and that is why he is an ex. That was 2 months ago. At this time, her sister has a new boyfriend who has already cheated on her and has to move out of his current living situation (with his ex) by tomorrow. 

So these two are moving in together. However, they don't know how to save money and have none to move out with. Even though her sister is living rent free at her moms. 

Her sister is constantly borrowing money. And every time she does, my fiancee asks how I feel about lending her money and every time I tell her I'm not comfortable with it as she never pays us back until tax time, this year we recieved a lump sum of over $2000 from her to cover what she owed. 

So my fiancee asks me yesterday how I would feel about lending her $1000 to move out. That is a fuck ton of money to just throw away, in my eyes.  She tells me that her boyfriend will pay us back next week from his taxes and until then we will hold on to the title of his car. 

I told her that I wasn't comfortable with it and that if we lend money to her sister I feel as if we won't get it back. Especially if we rely on her boyfriend, who has already cheated on her sister, to pay it.

In two weeks, my boyfriend's mother is going to celebrate her 60th birthday. It'll be a pretty big event, they ordered a huge banquet and there is going to be a dress code for the party (formal evening attire). Since I don't own any fancy dresses, I decided to wear a Qipao to his mother's birthday party. For those of you who don't know, it's a traditional Chinese dress. Mine is green with lots of golden embroideries, so all in all it looks very pretty and elegant.

When I told my boyfriend about it, he thought it was a good idea. His father on the other hand suggested that I should probably wear something more ""normal"". I'm not even gonna unpack this statement (I guess traditional Asian outfits are just too \~exotic\~ and \~out there\~ for some people) any further cause I can't be bothered.

Now, I'm pretty short on cash at the moment. I'm a Uni student and my side job's salary is decent, but I had to spend a lot of money on all kinds of stuff this month (rent, repair costs for my flat, insurance, meds, etc.). All in all, I simply can't afford to buy a dress right now. I even asked his sister and some of my friends if I could borrow one of their dresses, but they all either looked too big on me or didn't really fit the occasion.

I told him him about that and he insisted on me wearing something else. At that point I was just annoyed by his persistance, so I said ""If you want me to wear something else that badly, you can either buy me a dress or just uninvite me, plain and simple."". Needless to say that statement pissed him off, but he eventually gave in and said I can wear whatever I want.

Funnily enough, he was the only one who had an issue with it (which is funny cause it's not even his party lol) but he's a really bossy person who is used to getting his way so nobody else said anything about it (not even his wife).

Since it looks like me and my boyfriend are in it for the long run, I really don't want his father to have a bad impression of me and think that I'm rude or whatever. Part of me thinks I should apologize for the way I said it, but on the other hand I also feel like my reaction was justified.

1800,Not the A-hole,"I promise this isn’t a shitpost. 

Last weekend, my SO (21M) and I (20F) were taken out to dinner by an older family member of his. This was at a semi-upscale chain restaurant, not Olive Garden but very similar. After looking over the menu, I decided to order a $12 personal sized pizza. Wood fired pizza is one of my favorite things ever so I wanted to try theirs. Cue snickering from my SO and his relative. Okay whatever, I expected some lighthearted teasing since they know I’m a pizza addict and his family loves to tease over silly things. A little annoying but I’m more than used to it by now.

Later that night and for the next day or so afterwards, SO’s family member kept texting him things like “(my name) should have more respect” and “if you take her out for lobster she’ll just order pizza anyway.” Apparently my choice of meal really offended them? I genuinely don’t understand why it is such a big deal though. Their and my SO’s meals were in the ballpark of $20 each so it’s not like I ordered something pricey. To me, Americanized Italian food is mostly just different combinations of cheese, meat, bread, and sauce anyway so why my choice of meal is somehow inferior to theirs baffles me.

My SO is seemingly on the fence. I feel his relative may still be giving him a hard time about the scenario days later. He tried to get me to see the relative’s side and understand why that person sees it as a respect issue but also said he just doesn’t want to see me get bullied. I replied “why should I let someone bully me about my food then? that’s a middle school attitude and (relative) is acting like a special snowflake over it.” That might have been a little harsh but this relative is someone who criticizes the younger generation and constantly tells us we’re doing things wrong (cell phone usage, job hunting, etc) yet gets their panties in a twist over something as trivial as this. SO also thinks it might reflect badly on me as being childish that I ordered pizza, but there was literally a whole section on the menu dedicated to pizzas (the regular menu, not a kids’ menu) so I figured it was fair game. I would probably even do it again.

I’m of the mind that caring so much what someone orders on the menu to the point where it affects what you think of their character (within reason, i.e. nothing more expensive or complicated than what the host and/or the rest of the table orders) is one of the most petty/trivial social constructs ever and honestly don’t feel like I did anything wrong. Maybe this is something I should just take in and let slide since that person was raised in a different time though, or maybe there’s another argument for why it’s disrespectful behavior that I’m just not seeing yet.

Two years into the relationship he met this girl from work and they quickly became friends. I never really liked her, she gave me nasty faces and all. Clingy behavior. My boyfriend said this was all in my head.

Now they are quite close friends. This girl has won a 3day trip holiday to another country. Since she calls my boyfriend ""her best friend"" she asked my boyfriend to join. I do not want this. Although he says he can fix different hotel rooms, the anxiety that this gives me is insane. 

If he would go, it would be an almost free holiday for him. He is angry at me because I don't want him to go. He is still doubting.

I cannot join, since I have to work and I don't even have money for my own tickets and all that.

1805,Not the A-hole,"This issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.

I am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like ""Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19."" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.

But there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.

I was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.
It all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.

She had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's"", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.

I was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.

She is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.


Edit: I am honestly really grateful for not only judging me(not in that way) but also giving me love and support. Each comment means the world to me. I am honestly crying reading some of the encouragement. No one besides my family has said these things to me. I know it might seem silly,but it geniunely means the world to me guys. From the bottom of my heart,thank you.

Edit 2: Honestly the support is geniunely overwhelming. I promise to not let you down and to continue being a good person. Thank you for the gold.Thank you all so much for the private messages you have sent me too. I honestly have gone through as many as I can and I just feel really fortunate and grateful.

I sincerely hope you all have an amazing life ahead. Thank you so so much, this has been one of the highlights of my year.

Edit 3: I am sorry for boring you with all these edits. I geniunely can't thank you guys enough. I showed my parent's these posts and they had tears of joy too. I am so thankful to each and every one of you guys, loads of love.

BUT, I have been noticing a worrying number of DMs saying me I could have used her body and had some fun after knowing the truth etc.

I am not this kind of person and I hope nobody is. I have my own integrity. It's NOT right to just forcefully have sex with her, that's appalling. A couple of other DMs sent me links to secret webcams to expose her nudes etc. It's honestly horrifying. I am not that kind of person and shall never ever be one. I just want to make the world a better place and the people around me happy. 

I thank these people for their support, but their way to go around it is very wrong. A lot of women ARE amazing. My mother is amazing, the person who sent the screenshots is amazing, my coworkers are amazing, and I am sure many women out there are amazing.  Please don't tell me to take 'the red pill' or anything of that sort. Because I am not going to do that, ever. Please don't say all women are manipulative etc.

1806,Not the A-hole,"Sorry it's so long. I've have a close, but often contentious relationship with my daughter. When she became a mom, I became a full time babysitter for my grandson. She has to be at work by 7am and lives 30 minutes from me so I have to get up by 445am. Thankfully it's  usually only 3 days a week, and btw, I ABSOLUTELY ADORE MY GRANDCHILD! 

The first year I babysat it was maybe 8-9 hours each day i was there because my son in law was able to be home by 3-4pm, and I was just grandma being grandma and helping. Then my and my husband's financial situation changed due to a healthcare crisis and bills. I HAD to get a job again. 

It was humiliating to ask my child for money to care for my grandson, but that's what I did. I explained our situation and I told her I couldn't keep babysitting for free on a full time basis because it left me no time to get a real job that pays. We came to an agreement that she would pay me $100/week or like $35/day and I agreed to claim it on my taxes so she could have it as child care credit on her taxes. This was the 2nd year babysitting. 

During the 3rd year babysitting my son in law got a new job that often takes him out of town. Now instead of leaving by 3-4pm, I'm there till 5 or 6pm when another grandma takes over until about 8 or 9pm when my daughter gets home from work.  One night a week I do stay until she gets home,  giving me like a 15 hour day. I'm spending at least  10 more hours per week babysitting than I used to.

Now daughter is pregnant and when I half joking half serious told her that after the baby is born I was considering raising the rates from $35/day to $50/day she completely lost it. As in threatening to just put them both in daycare and never letting me see them again. I tried telling her that since son in law out of town so much that my days are longer now, 10 extra hours a week was basically another day. She wasn't having it and just threw in my face how much my mom helped me when she was little. For free. Because that's what grandmas do.

Am I the asshole for charging my daughter to babysitt? Should I have just quit babysitting,  made them put him in daycare and gotten a real job 2 years ago? At the time I felt like it was a good compromise. They pay me less than a daycare would cost so it's good for them and while I don't make anywhere near what a real job would pay it helps my budget just enough that I can keep my head above water.  Unfortunately, I'm just financially not able to do this for free like other grandma's do. 

Am I the asshole because she pays me at all?
Am I the asshole because I brought up more money for more hours/more kids, that are my grandkids?

Edit: I realized too late how bad it sounds when I say she's pregnant again. I am nothing but ecstatic over a new grandchild. I was feeling very overwhelmed and taken for granted when I wrote this and wrote that part very poorly. ",160,307,0.98
1807,Not the A-hole,"So, first time posting here. I 31F am in the midst of this argument with my ex, 32M. We dated for 2 years and his drinking became too much for me to handle so i moved out in May. We stayed friends. A few weeks ago we had sex because I missed hanging out with him and he had mentioned he wasnt drinking so much anymore, gave me some hope that we could try again.  But afterwards he told a girl we work with that we were having sex again. She in turn told at least 5 other people that I know of and suddenly everyone is asking me if we are dating. So, normally this wouldnt be a big deal, it's just gossip. But when we had sex the condom slipped off and I had to go get Plan B to ensure no preggers would happen. I also think he posted something publically about us having sex, in snapchat or something similar, because the day after i went to PP some rando on the internet posted an ad for prostitution services on my page. It's very catholic in my area, lots of prolifers who think women should be punished for having control over their reproductive organs. I assumed the prolifers found out and were trying to shame me for going to PP. After this happened i became deeply concerned that the local PP had shared my personal info, violating a HIPAA, and was going to report them. But when I started hearing people from work talking about me and my ex, my next assumption was that  it was my ex who had told. I confronted him and he admitted he had drunkenly told our mutual coworker. That was 2 days ago. Then yesterday he sends me a text saying it wasnt her, supposedly he was so drunk he doesnt remember. Obviously starting this relationship again before knowing more about his sobriety status is my fuckup. I accept that. But would i be the asshole for breaking things off with him specifically because he talks about our private lives openly? He says I'm the one who has broken his trust but I dont see how. ",26,66,0.96

1810,Not the A-hole,"As a little backstory, I have two girls under two (23 months and 10 months respectively). They share a room. In their cribs they have water, pacifiers, and those aquarium toys that you strap to the side [like this one if you are curious](https://www.amazon.ca/Baby-Einstein-Soother-Melodies-Newborns/dp/B07DM86Z43/ref=sr_1_1?hvadid=208314940932&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9000813&hvnetw=g&hvpos=1t1&hvqmt=e&hvrand=17693605500302293885&hvtargid=kwd-493729167072&keywords=baby+einstein+aquarium&qid=1551370162&s=gateway&sr=8-1&tag=googcana-20). I'd also like to note I am newly pregnant (and obviously quite ill with morning sickness and first trimester exhaustion). 

Anyways...

We start our day at about 7:30am. Normally the girls sleep until about that time (or even a little later sometimes). About 25% of the time they do wake up a little early. Today was one of those days. They woke up around 7am. I could hear them on the baby monitors pushing the buttons of their aquariums, and giggling/baby talking back and fourth. I chose to lie in bed half awake, and get a little extra rest for that half hour. At no point did they sound distressed. 

This isn't the first time I've done this, and whenever I casually mention it to my husband he is *appalled* and accuses me of ignoring/neglecting them. He feels I should be leaping out of bed the second they make a peep!

I mean, we have two video monitors (one pointed at each crib). I can see that they aren't in any danger. I can hear that they are content.

For years he has badgering me for more details about the things she would do to me, but I refuse because I don’t like how he reacted the first time. He keeps pressuring me though, saying it will help me work through it. And he says it’s not right for me to keep things from him.

I decided the best way to handle this was by sending out an anonymous survey where each person could make their selection. Long story short, when it came time to report the data, I needed to ask some people individually because I didn’t have what I needed (that was my bad). I didn’t want to do this, but I had to report it. 

I have a good relationship with this coworker; we talk a lot and get along great. Also for context, our agency is very tight-knit and VERY liberal/progressive, and things like race, gender, politics, and religion are discussed explicitly a lot because of the nature of the work we do. It’s not some stuffy corporate office where no one talks about things like that. 

Anyway, I assume this coworker identifies as Hispanic but I don’t know for sure. I figured it would be more respectful to ask her directly rather than assume and tick the Hispanic box just because that’s what she looks like to me. And those were my only two choices.

She got very offended and said she wanted to remain anonymous, so by me asking her directly, that all goes out the window. I totally agreed with that of course, told her not to worry about giving me her answer, and said instead I’m going to add a column to the chart I need to send off, that says “prefer not to answer” (which really should have been an option from the beginning.) She kept talking about how this always happens at every job she has. She asked if I was calling every staff member and asking them. I said no, and she chuckled and said, “That’s what I thought. I know why you’re asking *me* specifically.” (Our staff is almost all white.) She was fine by the end of the conversation but I feel horrible for putting her in an uncomfortable position.

We like going to Blaze Pizza since she enjoys the white or pesto pizzas, but we have a few requirements of them. They would need to change gloves, use a clean peel and paddles, and a clean cutter.  Now, in case you’ve never been there, Blaze makes personal pizzas in a line system, kinda like Chipotle, where several people would man a certain station of the line. Because tomato sauce is such a prevalent ingredient, and a lot of people handle the pizza, inevitably at least one person will make a mistake (e.g. using a cutter that was just used on another pizza). When this happens, they’ll usually apologize and remake the pizza.  Then they let us keep the old pizza (which I save for later) and sometimes they’ll even give us a gift card for a free one. Seriously, I’ve gotten so many free pizzas out of this. 

Am I wrong gaming the system like this (and also causing their line to slow down sometimes)?

I was an RA during college and a few of my old residents invite me to see their play production at the local campus on Thursday. I think that's a cool thing to do after work and text my mom letting her know.

I get home. My mom calls me into her room and my dad is already there. She begins by saying ""Your father and I received your request and we don't think it's in your interest to go because you need to focus on your exam.""

Now my parents are Carribean immigrants, so any questioning or refusal of their authority is concerned taboo/punishable by death. But for me I draw the life at being told living my life is a ""request."" This is also one of three times this month I've gone out after work or in the evening.

I explain where I'm coming from and all that. They don't want to hear to. So I'm like ""Alright. I'm going regardless.""

1828,Not the A-hole,"Hey so before i begin this i just wanna say I appreciate when my gf does anything for me even if its just poppin up at one of my lectures with a bottle of water - she's very kind and thinks about me a lot.

However....

I've noticed she does this thing where she'll do you a 'favour' that ends up requiring you do to more work than you wanted to in the first place. Its like you said you needed a new shelf and she goes out and buys the materials to build a new one but you just wanted to buy an already-built-shelf and not figure out how to build it. You appreciate the gesture but it's a little annoying you have to do this task you didn't want to do to begin with.

The best example of this is when she made pancakes. Ive been watching what I eat because im pretty out of shape and learned its due to overeating and sugary foods. My gf knows I've been being careful because ive been declining eating out and snacks. However I'm having a rough week emotionally and she offers to make pancakes for breakfast the next day. I decline. I'm trying to be good with my eating habits. She asks again later that day and I decline again. When she asks again later that night I get annoyed because I've had to decline a food I enjoy multiple times and she ends up pouting.

The next morning I have off so I just want to sleep in but I'm woken up and told to come downstairs for breakfast. At first, I'm flattered and hoping she's made the scrambled egg recipe I've been enjoying.

But no. Its the pancakes I declined multiple times the day before. When i don't look excited, she feels hurt and says she made them because I've had a rough week. Although I appreciate the food, i feel guilty eating the pancakes because of the diet (as this sugary breakfast kills half the calories I'm on) and feel guilty because she can tell I'm not enjoying myself. 

After breakfast she asks me to clean everything up and seems surprised when I look upset. But 1) i didn't want the pancakes and I made that clear and 2) the kitchen was a disaster. So not only did I get a breakfast I felt guilty about (without asking) but i had to clean up the kitchen too. Not how I wanted to start my day off.

This isn't the only instance. Shes done things like buy plants for people who don't want to take care of plants, cooked more unwanted food then asked to be cleaned up, or refusing to take no for an answer when you dont want something. You have to tell her no multiple times when she offers you something. Some times I want to shake her and say ""I'm not being polite! I really don't want that!!"" but it tends to fail or she feels hurt because you get annoyed (this doesn't just happen to me, I've seen it done to friends and family).

AITA for getting annoyed by her favours? How do I even begin talking to her about this feeling? She's kind of an all or nothing person and I feel like she'll be really hurt if I do anything.

Edit: I appreciate the advice and will talk to her about how the favours make me feel ! 

Also for any confusion on chore roles we are both women and divide the chores based on what we prefer (she doesn't mind cooking or doing the dirty jobs such as cleaning toilets or taking out trash but she doesnt like puttering so i do laundry and keep the house dust/clutter free) 
 
Edit 2: i diet but also work out! I saved up for a personal trainer and am doing my best to change my hard work into a lifestyle and not a quick fix diet solution :)

1829,Everyone Sucks,"I was seeing this girl that had a history of running her mouth. She even told me about all her ex boyfriend's fetishes (like being into feet and other dudes etc) and that he was jealous that the two of us were hanging out. This worried me, and I told her that I wouldn't be comfortable with her airing out my dirty laundry under any circumstance, and specifically asked her to never do that. She obliged, but I still wasn't sure if I could trust her. So I made up a social test.

I lied and told her I was into furries  (I'm not, though there's nothing wrong with people that are you do you) and I asked a friend of her's if she could help me test her by asking what my fetish is. She agreed, then went on to ask her when I wasn't around. I got a call back from her saying that the girl that I was seeing said I might be into furry creatures and stuff, and that she basically told her right away. So she failed. 

I did end up telling her that it was a test, but then she got furious with me. She thought it was unbelievable that I could betray her trust like that. She still wanted to see me but I needed a break. AITA?

1830,Not the A-hole,"I was asked by a female coworker to lift something heavy in the kitchen while I was working at my desk, but when I got to the kitchen, it was filled with other women having a conversation during working hours. I was offended that she would go out of her way to ask me while I was working just because I was the nearest available man, so I refused. The other women were clearly offended by my decision and some thought I was joking, so I kept on refusing until one of the women gets fed up and lifts the dang thing with ease. I thought one of them should have done it in the first place.

Am I the asshole?

Edit: To clarify, the women in the break room weren’t on official breaks. They just happened to be there because they all needed a second round of coffee and started a conversation amongst themselves. There are no official break times in my workplace. Also, I was working on something at my desk when I was asked to lift said object.

Edit 2: At the time of being asked, I was asked to help “lift something” in the break room. I assumed it was a package of mail or paper and I didn’t know I’d be doing it myself, nor did I know it was merely to replace a five-gallon bottle of water for the water dispenser.

Edit 3: This was not the first time in the day I refilled the dispenser. I’m the closest man who sits near the break room, so I’m regularly asked by superiors to change it and am not in a place to refuse my boss. However, the woman who asked me is not a superior and isn’t exactly petite either — none of them in the break room are. Furthermore, the cap on the bottle is one of those that prevents spills by being pierced when it’s placed on the dispenser. I have also witnessed a 4’11” woman change the bottle, so height isn’t exactly much of an issue here.

Edit 4: The woman who asked me does not have a poor relationship with the other women in the break room. She is also married with children and I’m the only openly gay man in the office, so, no, I highly doubt she was trying to flirt with me as suggested by some here.

Edit 5: I never lost my temper or became argumentative during all this, but some here assume I did. I just refused to do the task for her.

Edit 6: I am not the strongest person in the office — far from it. I don’t lift weights and stay slim out of preference. We even have some female gym fanatics here. Also, I barely know the woman who asked me. She’s in another department in another part of the office.

UPDATE: I very much wanted your responses because of a follow-up discussion with one of my female coworkers who was within earshot when all this happened. She still defends chivalry, while I obviously find it illogical. Our office is currently going through a renovation and, while clearing out a storage room, we discovered our old water dispenser involved in all this. Yes, everything I posted happened almost a decade ago. Our discovery sparked a heated discussion and I wanted to put the issue on this subreddit for others’ viewpoints to close our debate. I put little effort in my original post without thinking I’d get so many responses, so my apologies in advance for the list of edits.

I’m still employed with this company, and some involved have left. If there was any hostility towards me afterwards, it was not noticeable and certainly played no role in my eventual promotion. I’m glad to have played a part in changing the minds of my female colleagues. It’s no longer a habit for them to look for a man when some physical exertion is involved, and I am often told by women to let them handle tasks once exclusively done by men. Our head of HR also announced in a staff meeting that we’ll be employing more men to bridge the gender gap in our office, and some married coworkers told me they’ve even made positive changes at home as well — all stemming from a seemingly petty ordeal.",5545,15088,0.84

1832,No A-holes here,"I'm 20, a guy. Really fat. 320 pounds at 6'1''.

My family is very skinny and health oriented, I'm not. My parents didn't use to be but they did when I was around twelve and it's sort of been a big tension since. Everyone else in my family is really active into fitness/eating healthy, parents, two older sisters, older brother. I'm not. 

I've always been really fat. Was big as a kid. Parents gave older siblings a lot more attention than me generally and never really signed me up for sports/cared about what I ate, so I got big at five and stayed big. I'm cool with it. Got bullied a lot but otherwise it never really made a substantial difference beyond not being able to be good at sports, etc. I like eating unhealthy amounts of food and I'm fine with making my life a little shorter to keep doing it, and I hate, hate exercise. I'm fine with being a big guy and it's part of my identity in a lot of ways. 

Predictably my family doesn't like this. Again, big sports team/club family, gym rats, healthy eaters. They've really been bugging me with health concerns about it and I generally have just joked around them because when I haven't in the past it's started arguments and I hated getting into arguments with my otherwise very peaceful family.

I came home for a visit where everyone was visiting this last weekend and they basically held an intervention for me. About being fat. Again, not doing drugs, not going on crazed rampages, I just eat a lot of Taco Bell and look like I live in a van down by the river.

It was like from TV. They were all sitting down in circle and they basically sat and told me how they felt I was ""missing out"" on life. It was basically ""you aren't active and you can't run with us and you are out of breath and you never had a girlfriend and it makes me feel sad"". Most of that is true (I'm gay and have yet to come out to my family, which makes that bit of it more awkward, although I admittedly haven't been in too many relationships either way) but none of those are reasons why you hold an intervention. Then my dad pulls out statistics and tries to bludgeon me and I got really embarrassed at a certain point and just got up and then got in my car and left. Both my sisters were crying and they all kept saying how they ""felt responsible"" (which in a certain way is true of my parents, but it's not something I like ""blame"" them for) and it was so dramatic i felt more like it was like I had been in a DUI and killed people instead of being just being sort of ugly.

I don't know. I haven't spoken to them since friday, which is an incredibly long time to go without talking in my family. They've sent me a lot of texts and I've been ignoring them. I don't agree with their message but I understand they had good intentions but fuck it was so awkward and embarrassing and I'm really really angry at them. I feel guilty for leaving like that but jeez.

1835,Not the A-hole,"Last year we bought a house with an avocado tree in the front yard. The tree was dried up, almost dead, and only gave hard, black, tiny avocados. After a year of watering and trimming and love and care it started producing good avocados. Like, alot. Maybe 300-400. I picked them all the time, gave them to neighbors, the mailman, basically anyone who asks gets a handful. I am not stingy with my avocados. 

Well, I work early mornings and have to leave my house by 5 am. Couple of days ago I'm walking to my car and in my front yard is an old lady picking avocados from my tree! She has a pile of like 50 of them already picked and she had even brought one of those nice retractable poles with the fruit catcher at the end of it.  (It was a really nice one)
I was soooooo pissed I just walked right up to her and snatched it from her hand. She had a total 'deer in the headlights' look, but once I grabbed the pole from her she starts yelling at me 'hey! That's mine!! That's mine!' 
So I tossed it over our fence where our German Shepard was barking. (Good luck getting that back) 

Then i got right in her face and screamed ""Well those are my avocados now GET THE FUCK OFF MY YARD!!"".
I really scared her, I could see it in her face. I'm not hugely intimidating or anything 5'6""/F 135lbs  but I was livid and I seriously wanted to fight her but she was a thousand years old and looked like Mama Coco from the movie Coco. 

So I got in my car and sped away .leaving her to pick up the pile of avocados she had already picked. 

Well afterwards I was telling my coworkers what happened and they all said I was a jerk for screaming at her and stealing her stick since she was just an old lady probably trying to make some money because she's poor. 

And i'm thinking...am I the asshole?

If it makes any difference, I also told my neighbors what happened and they said they see her walk around our neighborhood all the time with that stick stealing lemons and other fruit from ppl. 

It's my stick now.

1836,Asshole,"The title sums it up. My boyfriend has a problem with staying awake when we have plans to call. We've been long distance for 6 months, and had this problem the entire time. He says he can't help himself if he's in bed and tired and I've said that it's fine as long as he says goodnight first, so I'm not anxious about him being mad at me. We always end up in a cycle where he falls asleep, I get really anxious and stay up late crying thinking he's mad at me, he wakes up and promises next time he won't go in his bed if we have plans or if he's really tired he'll say goodnight. This lasts for about a week and then the whole thing repeats.

Today we were on call watching Netflix and I remembered I had to get something from the library (for an assignment due at midnight). I got stuck in the elevator and around the time I got out, he stopped responding. I didn't notice immediately but once I did, I started getting worried he was mad at me for taking so long. I texted him a lot of apologies and eventually called him. This is where I'm mad: He let me apologize and apologize for taking so long and kept saying ""it's ok"". It was only after I asked explicitly whether it was me taking so long that made him ignore me that he said no, he was asleep. This made me kind of annoyed—he let me keep apologizing instead of cutting me off to say he wasn't mad and had just been asleep. I clarified whether he was so tired that he'd fallen asleep at his desk or whether he had gone to his bed knowing that we had plans to call back and finish the episode and he confirmed it was the second. I needed to cool off so I said let me call you back in 5 and hung up. He called back but I declined it, then he texted me saying he was sorry. 7 minutes later I called him back and no response. It's been half an hour and no response to any calls or texts so he's clearly asleep. I broke up with him over text, saying that my anxiety over this repeatedly happening (to the point where I'm sometimes afraid to hang up even if I have to go to the bathroom because I feel like I'll come back and he won't answer and I won't know what happened) is too much for me to handle right now. I'm at a really low point with my mental illness and there's a lot going on at school.

Clearly I don't think I'm the asshole right now, but there was another time I broke up with him over this (also over text and while he was asleep). When he woke up he called me and started screaming at me and punching his phone (we were on FaceTime so it was kind of scary, which sounds dumb I know) and saying I was abandoning him and being selfish, I didn't love him and I wasn't understanding enough. I felt terrible and we ended up getting back together. I know this reaction will happen again when he wakes up. I just wanted to get an outside opinion on whether this is a stupid thing to break up over before that conversation happens, since even though I don't feel bad now I know I will then.

&#x200B;

UPDATE:

Sorry to everyone I didn't get back to! I went to sleep. This morning I read everyone's comments and although I don't have the time or energy to respond to every single one, I still read them all (including replies to comments). I really appreciate all of your judgements, and any advice you've given on my anxiety or our relationship. 

I turned my phone on airplane mode because I went to sleep pretty late and woke up to a lot of missed texts, we haven't gotten the chance to talk yet because he's in school. I'm not sure what to expect for when we do. I'll be back home again in less than two weeks and we'll most likely see each other at least once. I'm a little scared of how he'll react (for reasons I don't feel like explaining, we won't be able to call and will have limited ability to text for a little over a week, starting on Saturday. I'm afraid anger over the breakup will build up and he'll act on it when we're together). 

I didn't want to exclusively respond to NTA or NAH statements but I really appreciate the understanding you have, and the concerns some people brought up about his anger issues really opened my eyes to the fact that it's not normal. We've been together for a while now and I've gotten so used to being afraid he's mad at me and then having him react like that (or similarly) when he does get mad that it seemed more abnormal to expect my partner to act any other way (this has been made worse by him telling me it was and I had to just get over my fear of him). 

To people suggesting therapy—I'm currently in therapy and have been since September, I've always felt uncomfortable bringing up fights with my boyfriend to my therapist and I didn't feel I could outright say ""I'm afraid of my boyfriend"" to anyone (even someone who would/could not repeat it elsewhere). But me filtering has been hindering my ability to get better, so at our next appointment, I'll come clean about it.

I closed the door and then told my husband that what he was doing was emotionally manipulating our son and that it was not ok.   I said that son was allowed to not give hugs and kisses.  I said that son is not responsible for husband's emotions. Husband said that son can choose not to give hugs and kisses but that he was affecting husband and that husband would have reactions to this.

I already told him not to tell me that because I feel genuinely bad, but he been guilt tripping me by saying that’s what he means and he’s not going to lie about it.

It's such a shitty thing to do, my girlfriend is crying because her sister's only point was ""it's family or him."" 


I've been with my girlfriend for 3 years. She's great.
We're currently living in a one bedroom place, but she'd like to get a bigger place with more people next semester to save money, and I think it's a great idea. It's a two bedroom two bathroom apartment in a nice area. 

But here's the thing, her sister wants to live with her. In the same room. And our friend already called a room to himself (my girlfriend and him were originally planning on living together, but my plans for the next year changed so I'll still need a place for college). So where does that leave me? The living room - which will apparently be covered with curtains or some type of barrier - or with our friend. 

My girlfriend and I are both college students that work while the other two only work, and I enjoy having an actual room to study and vibe in. She also said the rent would be split equally 4 ways, but I think the guy in the living room should pay a smaller cut while someone with their own room should pay more. And then my girlfriend and her sister may also want their mom to move up there. What the fuck even, I feel like I'm not even being considered. Apparently only 5 people are allowed to live there, and I'd be in the living room with their mother or someone else while the others enjoy a room. AND THIS IS THE BEST PART: her sister who has a boyfriend made my girlfriend sleep on the floor next to her (while she was in bed with her boyfriend). And if the tables were flipped, my sister's boyfriend would not be okay with it. But he's leaving back to his hometown so he's not in the equation. 

When I bought up my worries to my girlfriend, she just said she's always wanted to live with her sister and that my plans changed too late in the game. I told her that I respected that, but that I can't live in a situation like that. Her sister is the one who applied for her, so I'm sol in terms of lease security. It honestly kinda hurts because I've stood up and supported her, and now she's insisting I stay in the living room or just live with (mainly) her friend.

He has been dating this girl ""Liz"" for about 6 years and she is about to come unglued waiting for him to propose and he claims that he's just not ready yet. 

About 4 months ago, my brother found my Tinder account and he and his friends basically catfished the shit out of me using pics they stole from Instagram. I was an idiot and I fell for it, hook line and sinker. I wanted to get revenge on him some how but wasn't sure. 

The week before Valentines day I was in B&N and saw this book ""How to Buy Diamonds"" on one of the endcaps. I saw my chance so I bought the book. On Valentines morning I stole my brothers phone, turned it off and watched him stomp around the house which in reality was a pretty good prank. He went to work without his phone and since I was home all day, I ""hid"" the book in the stack of crap my brother keeps on the coffee table and at like 4 I texted Liz and said basically ""Bro lost his phone, he wanted me to text you to come over now if able so he can take you out."" She texted me back and showed up maybe an hour later. 

I made sure the binding of the book was plainly visible and let her in. I said I had to study in my room and closed the door. I could hear her flipping through a magazine and then about died laughing when she called her sister or friend and said something like ""he has a how to buy a diamond book! Oh my god. Do you think it's tonight? Oh my god! It has to be tonight. It has to be! I call you back as soon as it happens!"" I literally couldn't contain myself I was laughing so hard. 

So bro got home, they went on their date. Maybe 2 hours later they came back through the door screaming bloody murder at each other. Obviously he hadn't proposed and she was screaming at him why did he have a ""how to buy diamonds"" book if he wasn't going to propose. He was trying to talk his way around it all because she was furious with him. Finally she dug the book out of the stack of stuff and threw it at the wall. My brother obviously knew it was me at that point but Liz didn't care and said she needed a ""break"" to figure out if the relationship is really for her after 6 years. As far as I know she hasn't spoken to him in two weeks. 

For my brothers part, he understands that I was just getting back at him and he admits it was a pretty good joke but he is truly, truly broken hearted over Liz possibly breaking up with him over it. I feel really bad but at the same time I didn't make her freak out.

I saw they were close to the exit, and I realized it would be dumb to take 2 cars to the park itself, and then to try and find them and meetup with them in a busy theme park would've been a little hectic. So I asked her if she could just pick me up on their way and I can go with them and we can all arrive together.

In that sexy lingerie, she cried and I panicked. I ran and grabbed some ice for her shin. She blamed me for closing my legs because she said she'd never hurt me but I indirectly hurt her by closing my legs, and by trying to avoid me, she hit her shin on the side of the bed. 

I was in two worlds. There she was, sexy as sexy can be but wailing and shivering in tears. I found the situation humorous so I chuckled a little bit and she got upset because I found it funny that she got hurt. When I finally saw the bruise after a few minutes of ice, the leg had a dark spot. It swelled and bruised. She couldn't walk properly to the toilet so I helped her clean up and sent her to bed. I showered after she's in bed. Now she's sitting down watching a movie on her laptop while complaining that it's pain. 

I think she's forgiven me but I feel really bad and I think she might have gotten a hairline fracture across the shin. Any medical experts can tell me about shin injuries? Symptoms? 

Tldr: About to have sex and in a freak accident, Wife got injured and I accidentally laughed at the situation.

Edit 1: After seeing that she didn't break her leg, and it was a bruise/swell. The reason I chuckled was because of the situation and the circumstances I found myself in. My sexy wife all dressed up for me and I cockblocked myself. I feel horrible she's in pain. I wish it was me that was hurting. I can tolerate pain better. :(

Edit 2: Made trip to the hospital for an xray. No broken bones or fractures. ",111,98,0.83
1855,Asshole,"So, I met this girl from Berlin while playing a game of Counter Strike last year. We added each other to our friends lists and started talking almost every day for the next few months. We exchanged pictures (not nudes) and video chatted a little bit every now and then. Now this girl looked like an absolute 9/10. I started to fall for this girl’s personality and looks, also the fact she played my favourite game with me really helped. 

Over time one thing led to another and we started a long-distance relationship in early December. I booked a flight out to Berlin for the 17th until the 23rd to go meet the girl of my dreams. I was going to stay at her home, and she was going to pick me up from the airport.

My Dad took me to the airport and wished me good luck. Everything was normal that day, we had chatted all morning until I got on the plane. The wheels hit the ground at Berlin Schönefeld Airport, and I was ready. I get off the plane and text her to let her know I was here. I go through passport control and I'm stood outside the arrivals door knowing that the girl of my dreams is on the other side of that door, heart pounding, anxiety levels at maximum wondering if I'm going to be good enough for her. Nothing could have prepared me for what was through that door...

I find the courage after a few minutes of calming myself down and I walk through the door. I look up and down the line of people, but she is nowhere to be seen. I start wondering if she had bailed last minute. All of a sudden, what I can only describe as the female version of an extremely obese Danny DeVito who had been hit in the face with a shovel comes waddling out of the crowd calling my name. My heart dropped and all I could do was smile and wave. The first things through my head were the fact that I would be having to live with this goblin for the next six days and make sure I don't break her heart because I needed somewhere to stay and a lift back to the airport. 

We embrace in a hug as I devise my plan on how to make sure I don't completely destroy the mental stability of this already fragile girl. We go back to her house and she starts getting frisky. I don't like it, but if I don't go through with it, she will know something is wrong. Never in my life would I have thought, as a man, that I would have to fake an orgasm. 

I just have to grit my teeth and get through these six days then I can be back in the safety of my own home. Now obviously this girl was not the girl in her pictures. WRONG. She was, but she was an absolute professional at camera angles and lighting and somehow managed to maintain that perfect angle in all her photos and during our video calls. 

I got home and couple of days later I come up with some bullshit about how I can't deal with the stress of a long-distance relationship and that was my reason for breaking it off. She gets really mad at me, calling me an asshole and all that.

1856,No A-holes here,"So I signed up for an online psychology class at university. Sixty percent of the grade of the course was comprised of 8 different essay assignments (one due every 2 weeks). The rest was from quizzes and such that did not need to be graded by the instructor.

&#x200B;

The second week of the course, the professor sent out an email saying she had broken both wrists (among other injuries) and might be late on grading. Completely understandable. However, I had just submitted the first essay when this happened and was eager to get feedback so I could fix any problems for future assignments. I've found in college that even when being careful to read the assignment grading rubric, sometimes a student's interpretation of the expectations for the course are not very clear, so feedback is vital to success.

&#x200B;

Anyway, by the time the 2nd essay was due, the 1st essay was still not graded and no feedback was provided. I understood that, even if I was a bit disappointed. However, by the time the 5th essay was due, the 1st essay and all other essays were still ungraded and no feedback was provided. I was quite annoyed at this point. I could be failing the course without even knowing it and it was approaching the deadline to drop a course. I sent an email pointing this out and asking if there was any way she could dictate the grades to someone else who could type them, etc. I realize that's a big ask since there are tons of students and a huge backlog of essays, but I just thought I'd throw it out there. She responded in a furious manner and said I wasn't being understanding of her traumatic situation and there was nothing she could do. I felt **mortified** after that.

&#x200B;

The situation ended up being pretty inconsequential as I passed the class with a good grade. She finally graded everything in the last few weeks of the course (no feedback though).

&#x200B;

But really, am I the asshole here? I feel horrible that she was injured, but students pay a lot of money to enroll in university courses. If she wasn't able to provide any kind of feedback, perhaps the class should have been cancelled. I'm particularly interested in how professors feel about this situation and how it could have been better handled.

She admitted to knowing she rambles. She knows where I’m coming from and that it’s not like I have a problem with her being proud of these things, just that the conversations are one sided. All is well, this wasn’t a detrimental fight like it may come off through text  Personally, I agree with the few ESH votes. Me for not caring enough and her for caring to much

She’s from New York and is Dominican. So naturally she’s always bragging (there might be a better word) about it. But she is so damn long winded, constantly repeating things over and over. I can’t stand to be in these conversations that you just can’t escape and they just keep going and going and going and going. 

“New York’s food is the best, OMG NO the bodaga, the bodaga on the corner, the fucking best sandwich’s OMG NO you don’t under stand the best and oh the dancing the dancing is so fun and the parades omg the parades and my people from my island and and....” 

It. just. Doesn’t. Stop. It’s the only thing she wants to talk about, where she’s from. Like, it’s cool and all but I could give two shits about where I’m from. I could not imagine moving somewhere and this being a thing I do. It’s just a bunch of small talk that doesn’t mean all that much, you know?

So I was just sitting down eating with her while she rattled on and on about New York and the island, not saying anything, just eating cause I was fucking starved and she looks at me like “oh you’re not interested?”

And I said “no, not really, i mean...” 

She got all pissy and stormed off. “Oh ok what I want to talk about isn’t interesting, right, that’s how you feel, right” 

I told her I think it’s just a meaningless conversation, you’re just going on about how great it is. Like cool but I just don’t care that much. And I’m trying to eat...

1862,Not the A-hole,"warning: wall of text. Lots of backstory. 

Several years ago my wife and I had a destination wedding in another state. Her whole family went. Her parents are divorced and the older of the two brothers lived with his mom.(this is the brother in question) Because they didn't have a lot of money they road with us in the car and took a bus home at the end of the week. (We stayed a second week by ourselves for a honeymoon). 

Her mom talks about that trip all the time. she said it was one of the best trip she ever took in her whole life. she talks about how much she loved to go back there someday. 

so this year for Christmas we decided to surprise her with a suitcase and a letter saying basically that we were taking her back there this summer. Because my wife sister is older and married now they will be going also. 

A few days ago I find out that the brother somehow thinks that he was invited to and that he's going on vacation with us. My wife doesn't really care so long as he pays his own way. 

Here's the problem though. This brother is like the most socially inept person I've ever met. He never learn to be an adult and is just a complete embarrassment to be around in public. He has this really annoying need for constant attention. If people are talking about things that he doesn't know about or have any experience with, he will just start making stuff up. He makes up insanely unbelievable stories about things he's done or seen that anybody would know is not true. And when you're talkin about things he will try to correct you and tell you you're wrong and then make up lies to support it. 

Ex: someone asked if Dr pepper is made by Coke or Pepsi. I explained the doctor pepper is its own company and not made by either. He chimes in that dr. Pepper is actually made by Coke but Coke keeps it a secret. I told him that's ridiculous. He tells me that his friend's dad is the CFO for Coca-Cola and told him that they make Dr pepper. 

It causes a lot of stress in the group. He will start trying to cut me down and tell lies. I will call him on his lies and expose him. Then he will get mad and pout and everyone will get mad at me for being mean to him. 

so anyway I find out that he thinks he's going on this vacation. I told my wife no way. If he's going I'm not going. We have going on a week-long trip with him before and it was a nightmare. everyone was mad at me the whole time for arguing with him. They think I should just let it go and let him lie. 

Part of me realizes that since I'm the only one that has a problem with him, I should bow out. But my wife and I are the ones that planned this trip. This is our vacation spot that we go to every year on our anniversary. (Forgot to mention this trip would be on our anniversary).

1863,Everyone Sucks,"I’m a freshman in college in my second semester with a roommate. I’ve been having issues that I think are valid, but may very well be selfish. I don’t want to act on them until I’ve been judged. 

What are the issues? Here we go.

1. My roommate blow dries her hair while I am sleeping (well, trying to sleep). I have a sleep disorder so I sleep at weird times. But she blow dries her hair at 9 am. Which is really early for me. 
My side: she should go to the bathroom, I’m trying to sleep. 
Her side (likely): it’s her room too and it’s not her fault that I sleep a lot. 

2. She opens the blinds while I’m sleeping. I was sleeping at 1145 am today. She comes back from class and opens the blinds. I grunt so she knows I’m here. The blinds remain open. 
My side: I’m SLEEPING 
Her side: it’s 1145 and it’s her room too 

3. Her bedtime varies greatly, and when she goes to sleep, I can turn on NO LIGHTS. By varies I mean 8-1230. It’s a complete surprise. 
I come back from rehearsals and I can’t put my stuff away cause it’s pitch black. Now, this is fair and I understand, but my main problem is when I’m asleep, she comes in and turns on the lights. And I mean at night. Like, if i go to bed at 11 and she comes back at 1130 she will turn on all the lights and wake me up. 
My side: this is an unfair double standard 
Her side: not sure what she’d say

4. First semester I was never in the room, so I never threw my trash away in the room trashcan. She would throw away everything in there, and then ask me to take the trash out every 4 days. Even though often I had literally nothing in there that’s mine.

Anyway, today I was in my junior year Literature class, and we were discussing a book (I don't remember which one) that had the N word in the first chapter we read. Our teacher skipped over it (even though she was reading off things like shit and fuck) and as expected me and a few friends cracked some jokes about it. (EDIT: it was an n-word pass joke.) I then casually mentioned that I think it shouldn't be a big deal to say it if you're just reading it aloud straight from the text. I was met with disagreement, and not wanting to back down I kept arguing my point. I was trying to be respectful, but people kept interrupting me by pointing out that there's a history behind the word, just saying it is racist, while I was trying to say that there's nothing inherently wrong with the word so long as you're not trying to use it in a derogotory sense, and that just reading it from a book that was assigned for class wouldn't be a big deal since it's literally in the book, why would a word be in a book if you weren't meant to read it? Things escalated to the point where one student was yelling over me every time I tried to talk, everyone was calling me a racist, and that same student was willing to fight me over the issue.

I have no idea what influence it has on him tbh, but he seemed pretty normal (except for being quite quiet) so I never treated him differently.

So I saw the open spot, put my stuff there and installed myself. About 20 minutes later the co-worker arrived and saw me at ""his"" place. He looked at me and conversation went as next:

Him: ""Can you move, that's my usual place""

Me: ""I know but it's an open office here and I need to sit with my teammembers""

Him: ""There are some spots left in the upper floor""

Me: ""Yeah, but my team is here""

He sighed and just left. Then some of the people in around us accused me of being insensitive and that I should have given that place because he's autistic and can't go well with ""changes"". Others said I had the right to sit there since it's an open office and the co-worker needs to accept it.

TLDR for the last post; I (44M) live with my girlfriend (32F) and my two boys, 8 and 14. My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.

A lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn’t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn’t unknowingly been hurting my children. 

And then my girlfriend realizes that I’ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I’ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.

I understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother’s trip as it was about her.

1867,Not the A-hole,"I couldn’t think of a better, more neutral way of putting it, but that’s essentially what happened..so yeah.

I dated her for about 3 months. She was really gorgeous ,confident and free spirited. I loved how silly and bold she was, it was something that made her really unique in my book. 
This whole thing happened a month ago. I had a really, really big presentation and I got really tensed. I had the opportunity to invite my gf to the function, and so I did, on the condition that she would not embarrass me and not drink, because she had a habit of drinking a lot during such occasions and losing control. 

Well, turns out she made fun of me just because she thought it was hilarious. She burped loudly when I was talking to my co workers, and told about how I didn’t even have sex because of the stress. She proceeded to ask my coworkers if they could resist her body. They were obviously uncomfortable too. The presentation ultimately went horribly bad at first because she kept making stupid silly faces backstage, but then I just ignored her for the rest of the night and all went well.

First thing I did when we sat in the car was saying I was breaking up with her that night, she told me she was just trying to lighten my mood. I refused to let her touch me then, and dropped her off to her building. She said she wasn’t going to go till we sorted out the issue, I just told her to get out.
 Then I gave her a text message saying I was sorry for being rude to her but we weren’t compatible, and to just move on with her life.

Fast forward to today, I bumped into a friend of hers who said that I had been an asshole for her to break up with her for being ‘silly’ at a gathering, and that no one could believe I turned out to be such a jerk.

Now I am already seeing someone, but this interaction made me question if I had indeed been a jerk. An unbiased opinion would help.

My boyfriend (early 20s) and I (same age, F) have been dating for 3 years. He was actually the one who introduced me to weed when I asked him to a little before our relationship began. He had a history of heavy smoking; my parent are very anti-drug so I was very new to it. I love him very much, and we don’t really have any issues apart from this one.

Anyway, for me, weed was pleasant but it was just a phase. For about a year now, I don’t have any desire to smoke. Especially after I’ve seen what it’s done for my boyfriend. 
When he smokes, he has little motivation, he has dropped out of school many times. He will say because of money, but he continues to spend money on weed? It’s been an issue for a while now. I try not to be judge-y. I really tried to be okay with it but something inside just rejects it. I just want him to be his best self, and get ahead because smoking has been part of what’s put him behind. 

I’m thinking of telling him that it’s me or weed. I hate to sound controlling. I don’t want to say he can never smoke again, just that he needs to stop buying it in quantities that feed the habit.

Yesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.

My friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to ""even things out"".

1872,Asshole,"I’m a 21 year old living with my parents and my two younger brothers (both in elementary school). My schedule consists of working ~8 hour shifts Tuesday, Thursday, and weekends, while having class for 8 hours on MWF. This does not account for time spent on homework. 

I pay my parents $150 in rent every month because they claim to be struggling with bills and I can’t afford my own place only working ~30 hours a week on $11/hour. 

However, they seem to be doing fine, buying new beds and televisions and generally blowing money on unnecessary things. 

Since I pay for my own car insurance, gas, tolls (necessity, unless I want to use double the gas and take 90+ minutes to get to school), and phone bill, I’m stretched thin on money as is. I’m barely able to save for when I’m out of school, let alone spend money on anything during my little free time.

So given the situation, if I asked them to hold off on asking for rent, would I be an entitled asshole? Or would that be reasonable?

Edit: The general consensus so far is that yes, I am the asshole. I felt so when I first posed this question to myself, but I wanted some outside opinions. While I don’t agree with the attitude some have presented, I understand the judgement. I have lived on my own before, and I understand that it can be much worse. However, I personally feel like that money would be much better put towards my loans before they start gaining interest. 

Edit2: I'm thoroughly convinced that half of you are not reading the entire post. I am aware that this is not a lot of money as far as rent is concerned, I lived on my own for over a year when we first moved into this state, but I was not in school. 

When my classes started, my parents asked me to move back in with them, knowing that I wouldn't be able to work enough while in school to pay for a full apartment's worth of rent. I do my own laundry, keep my area clean, pay for my own food, gas, car insurance, tolls, EVERYTHING. 

I know how to manage my money, but when you're in class 24 hours per week and working another 28-30, the amount of gas and toll payments skyrocket. And no, there aren't any alternatives to my route, not without doubling or tripling the amount of time it takes me to get anywhere.

One of the older chemists that works with me on my floor seems to frequently make trips to the bathroom. From conversations with him, I know he is originally from a foreign country (this will be important later, maybe). Now the frequent bathroom trips aren't an issue (who cares), but it's his behavior in the bathroom that I take issue with.

He will spend upwards of 15 minutes grooming himself in the bathroom. This includes, but is not limited to: brushing his teeth, shaving, washing his face, etc. He tends to make a mess and take up space when doing this, but what really grosses me out is the sounds he makes when doing this. All manner of slurping and gargling noises as well as gutteral throat clears and spitting of loogies. It's a show. He also does this whole act regardless of whether there are others using the bathroom or not. I mention the fact that he is from another country because I believe cultural norms could be at play here, as well.

So my question is two-fold. 

1. AITA for thinking this is disgusting and should not be happening?

2. WIBTA if I mentioned something to him?

Last week she told me that she thought maybe she was bisexual and wanted to try out a threesome with another girl.  I’m not into the idea at all and told her I really wasn’t comfortable with it.  It turned into a fight.  She told me it’s every man’s fantasy and really didn’t get why I was uncomfortable.  It’s not my fantasy.  
 

Last night she brought it up again.  Now she wants to have a free pass.  Where she can have sex with a girl without me even being involved.   She said I could have a free pass too, but only with guys to “be fair”.  This is a bullshit free pass.  I’m not attracted to men at all.  I told her no and it got tense.  

I can understand her wanting to try and see if it’s for her, but it’s just not a fair situation to me.  She basically just wants to cheat on me and for it to be ok. It would be fair if my free pass was with a girl.  And as ugly as that situation feels I might agree to that.  ",78,157,0.96

My friend then went on social media and made fun of my brother.

I told the bf and he was surprisingly happy about it.  I just don’t get his mindset, we have like no money.   We can’t afford to support a baby.  I’m a big believer in my body, my choice.  I told him that I didn’t want to have it and he didn’t take it well.  

We have talked about marriage and kids.   I do think he’s the man I’m gonna be with for the rest of my life and want to have kids with him, just not now.  He thinks he should have a say in it and told me that abortion is a line he’s never wanted to cross.   He won’t be crossing anything though.  This is my choice, my line.  

I really don’t think he will break up with me over this, but if it did come down to it I probably would have the baby.  I love him so much.  I just don’t think this is the right choice for us.

He adopted a new male name, started taking hormone supplements, had surgery, and even grew a beard. For the most part, mutual friends seemed pretty supportive, as did his family.


However, lately he has been developing a nasty misandrist streak, talking about how men are awful and should die. These weren't just a few sarcastic comments either. He has been harping on this for months and was directing his vitriol at male friends (who are probably all ""former"" friends by now). 

Eventually I had enough so I replied with the following question:


""If you hate men so much, why are you trying so hard to transition into one?""

A few years ago, my sister had a falling out with the family. I was living with her at the time. She was doing great, but then all of a sudden just lost it. She met a horrible guy, made a bunch of dumb decisions, became a drug addict, left her husband for him, screwed us all over financially, etc. We all did EVERYTHING WE COULD to try to help her, but ultimatley this guy was dragging her down and she was choosing him. He was violent, drug-addicted, manipulative, was draining all her money, and just a loser. He physically attacked my father once. She broke the lease on our house and didn't pay a cent, stole our money, caused a bunch of damage to the house that we all had to pay for, and cut us out because we didn't get along with her BF. After a long and hard struggle, we chose NOT to support her decision to be with him, told her she'd have a place with us if she ever saw things for what they were but we would not enable that.

&#x200B;

This was EXTREMELY hard for me. It hurt me really bad, and still does. I've struggled, but have come to a point where I feel like I'm ready to leave the situation behind me and move on with my life. She hasn't reached out to me or been apologetic or regretful in any way.

My mom has been still keeping tabs on her. We know my sister is living in a homeless shelter. My mom checks the arrest records and often finds either my sister or her boyfriend. She checks the updates on my sister's Facebook. She calls hospitals and sometimes finds that my sister has been in for an OD, a psych stay, etc. We know my sister has had a child, which has been taken away by CPS because the dad broke the child's rib.

I have come to a point where I do not want to hear about all the horrible things going on in her life. I'd like to move on, but it hurts me freshly every time I hear about what she's doing. I KNOW it hurts my mom deeply too, and she cares so much. However, when she finds something out about my sister, she tells me what's going on. That makes things hard for me.

I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.

I am an ex sex worker - she knows this.

December we discuses fund-raising, one of the fund-raisers was for a local shelter that deals with sex workers. She was very vocally against this saying ""we are supposed to be for women, not people like that, they know what they are getting into and deserve everything they get."" One of the other volunteers spoke up about how often sex workers were assaulted, she said that she doesn't care and repeated that they knew what they were getting into, and that it took away from real assault victims like \*\*her\*\*. At this point I spoke up saying that I was feeling attacked as she just blamed me for my assault. She immediately back peddled and claimed that ""this is just my belief about ""those women"" and that she didn't mean \*\*me\*\*.nope, can't say sex worker and not mean me. She then said she has the right to her opinion, but I have to understand that she didn't mean it that way. She apologized for me ""taking her wrong"", it's BS and I'm not happy.During this meeting she also sais that she would never be able to give pro-choice info because its against her beliefs (not a religious belief, she's an atheist), she didn't know it but someone present had an abortion. She was reminded that in the mandate we are a pro-choice center and she can't try and bully people out of their decisions. She said once again that this is just her belief and that she should be allowed to have whatever belief she wants but she will just have to leave her beliefs at the door. As we were all leaving the school, she stops me in the main area and demands I forgive her and give her a hug in font of about 30 students, knowing that if I said no I would look like an asshole.

I complained to the head of the center, but she is a student and doesn't have any control over anything. She brought it up to the school staff member that is in control of hiring and the budget, but so far nothing has been done about it.

My next step is to lodge a formal complaint against her. I been resistant in doing this because 1) I would have to come out as an ex-sex worker to more people and 2) I am a mature student in my 30's whereas she is in her early 20's and it kinda felt like complaining against a child

She has now applied to be head of the center and it looks like she'll get the job because sh'e manipulated the student union into backing her by saying we've discriminated against her by not allowing her beliefs (again not religious).

I am very afraid that she is going to say something to someone who has been through those things when they have come for support. If was younger and still in sex work when she said that to me it would have devastated me and I probably would not feel safe at the school.

If her diagnosis is truly the worst-case scenario of MS, I don't know what kind of future to expect.

1895,Everyone Sucks,"Background: religion has always been a touchy subject in my family. I'm treated as the ""black sheep"" of the family for being anti-religious, and come from a family of 6 kids (same parents) of Roman Catholic background. I'm also the only one among my siblings who doesn't have a criminal record, or doesn't live off the state (i.e. welfare), or have a child out of wedlock.

&#x200B;

My 2 younger brothers are living with my parents, and 2 of my older sisters live in other countries (don't miss them; both are living off the state's good graces in Minnesota, last I checked). One of my older sisters, Ada, is suffering from terminal cancer (Hodgkins, spread to the liver and bone marrow). My two younger brothers have been basically taught to hate me ""because I refuse to join them in heaven one day"" along with the other two sisters that live in the US. Ada is probably the only sibling to treat me decently, but she's quite well indoctrinated. Her husband left her 3 years ago to start a ""sales business"" in the EU, which was basically a pyramid scheme.

&#x200B;

My wife, sons (2, 4) and I live quite comfortably ($270,000/year, both of us are engineers), and moved up to Quebec, Canada. Ada has asked me to watch over her daughters (3, 4, 6) when she passes on, but has made a point of stipulating that her estate (about $320,000 tops, most paid for by our parents) will only be made available to me to pay for the girls' expenses, cost of living, etc.; if my wife and I ""raise them proper"".

&#x200B;

While the girls are poorly behaved in general, they are kind girls, and I genuinely want them to prosper (out of compassion, and maybe some tribal/clan-line loyalty). My sons also love playing with them. However, taking on 3 extra kids with a ""gun to my head"" in terms of access to additional funds to raise them is unacceptable: I will **not** sacrifice the college funds and future of my own children, no matter the cost. I also won't tolerate asinine bigotry like religion in my house.

&#x200B;

1897,Not the A-hole,"About a year ago my parents put down a down payment on a house in a city that I had lived in a couple years and my brother had just moved to at the time. Ever since then my brother and I have paid for everything(mortgage/insurance/taxes) evenly. It’s pretty decent 3bd/2.5bath house. The house is still technically is owned by my parents but it’s the only thing in their will that goes to that brother and I equally, and not the other two siblings(Who live in different states)



Now shortly after he moved to town he met this girl ‘Nina’  Who he got engaged to on Valentine’s Day. Now, I was totally fine with her until very shortly after their engagement, when she asked when I was moving out.  I was like “What? This is my house” well since she doesn’t own a house, she just assumed she’d move in and I’d move out, so they could “be newlyweds and have their own place” I assumed she’d moved in, and was planning on talking to my brother on him paying 2/3rd of the utilities when she does. I’d understand this if my brother decided to buy half the house from me, and I was in a position to buy another one, but neither of us are in that point of our lives where we could. Also, I feel like this is my house and I just plain don’t wanna move out. I tried to talk to my brother about it, and he said he hasn’t thought that far ahead, and thought she would move in too, and we’d all live together till I found my own spouse(which 1. I’m single now and 2. I feel is kind of antiquated) also I love my brother, but he doesn’t have a spine when it comes to her, and I’m afraid her hostile energy towards me will make me feel unwelcome in my own home. 


Another factor, that I just want to pretend I don’t know about but I do, is that she never stays over, and they don’t have sex when I’m here. Now I travel a lot for work, so that hasn’t been a problem imho yet. Also I just thought that was mainly because we’re all church-going type people who pretend we don’t have sex to people we aren’t married to, but it could be like in general that could be a problem. 


AITA for not letting them have the house? And any advice on how to calm down this situation? After her getting all huffy about it, I feel uneasy her moving in at all.


**EDIT/UPDATE** 

So I(a female btw) talked to my brother, as well as my parents on the phone, for like over an hour, and got a text from Nina. I'll try to make this as concise as possible. Well first talking to my brother, I think he sensed this stuff was really bothering me, and tried to reassure me 'nina' wasn't going to be a roommate from hell, which I've had before, and he will of course pay 2/3rd of utilities. Their wedding day/move in time, is actually going to be further away than I thought it would be(I thought they'd get married within 2019, but really they're looking for spring of 2020 wedding date) He said, that if nina and I don't get along as roommates he will hurry up the whole moving to the another city thing. But wants to live here till 2022-23. He doesn't think it would make sense to buy or rent another place in the city we live in now. 


Well then I talked to my parents, my dad tried to explain how the house money/equity worked but I still don't think I understand it all. The house is in a trust, that my brother and I are the benefactors of. If my brother decides to leave(or me) we have three options that we both have to sign off on to work. First one is to get a roommate, and the money covering theirs is split equally in equity between us. So, while I'd only pay for half of the house, I'd get 75% of the equity earned during that time. Also, the extra roommate money(which really could be a thing, the market rate of a room we're living in is probably $200 more than we pay) the person staying gets to keep, and if we don't have a roommate, I'd pay 75% of the mortgage and he'd pay 25%. The math of this kind of makes my head hurt, but I'm like 'okay' and I think make the most sense when talking to them. The second option is to buy them out but I was like ""Dad, how am I going to come up with $$ to do that?"" and basically it'd be like a second loan, and he'd get a lump sum. The third option is to assume all mortgage payments myself(which right now isn't realistic) and my brother walks away, but when the house is sold he gets a percentage,(but not half, it all depends on how long I'd pay for it myself, like the first option.) My parents also talked to me about how they weren't going to let their house get overrun by nina if that happened, and they'd need to leave if she gave me problems, and they were going to talk to my brother about how he was responsible for making sure she didn't because if it's me against her, they'd move. My brother and I had lived together outside of our parents house, before and never had major problems, and since we've had this house, never had any major problems, we are really good at co existing we each other. So if he brings them in it, he's responsible for taking them out. Same if I got married and he and my husband didn't like each other. 



In addition to this, Nina texted me said *""hey, I'm sorry for thinking you'd move. I really didn't think we'd all live together, and it's a big house for one person whose not home a lot. I do want [brother's name] and I to have our own place, but if you don't want to leave, I know it's on us get that! I hope we can get along, and be good roommies and sisters-in-law!""* I think the whole ""Hey you're not home a lot"" thing is a little bit of a jab, but overall, I think it will be fine.

So I head over to the school and they tried to stop me from getting her, saying that they had a court order on file. after a back and forth with the principal and an officer she brought, I finally convinced her to call the AGs office and they’d tell her that it wasn’t valid.

I felt bad for her son and sent her a private message that said I would tell my son, Timmy, to include Pete in their recess activities so he wouldnt be lonely and hoping the bully wouldn't bother Pete since he is around other kids.  She replied back and appreciated the gesture.  I spoke to my son that night and asked him if he knew Pete.  He did but they didnt talk much.  I told him that Pete was having problems with another schools kid.   I asked him the same thing i told the parent, if he would include Pete in their recess activities.  He said he would.

The next day I get a call from the school principal.  The principal said that Timmy and his group of friends, probably 4 kids, confronted another student that was bullying Pete.

1904,Not the A-hole,"For some context, my husband and I have been together for 5 years. In the middle of these 5 years, we started an online business together.

The business was my idea, and I was fully prepared to go through it on my own. However, my husband, upon seeing me struggle with some aspects of the business, decided to help me, as he had a lot more knowledge than me in the area. Of course, I was happy to get the help! But he kept repeating stuff like ""You'll never be able to do this without me"" ""I sacrificed years of my life for YOU""  


His parents had abused him emotionally growing up. I took him into my house (before we were married, we were fairly young), tried my best to give him what he needed. However, taking care of someone who's been through that took a toll on me, and I ended up snapping on him multiple times. I'm not proud of those moments.

The abuse caused him to become extremely impatient. He would lose his shit every time I did a small mistake, go completely bonkers whenever I would cry due to his outbursts. I began to be afraid of little things. I was scared of giving my opinion (and thus, would default to agreeing with him). I was so scared that it affected all of the spheres in my life.This only caused my productivity to drop like mad. However, because of my drop in productivity, the rest of our team was starting to view me differently. I could've understood if it was just a professional thing, but something about how they were talking to me felt off.   


**Here's why I became very suspicious of my husband:**

He vents to others whenever we have a fight. He'll go up to his friends, his family and just about everyone and give us details about our personal lives. He'd detail nearly everything I've done and said to him. However, I would hold it in, all of my feelings, and I'd rather talk it out in private, just between me and him. This led to our entire circle getting his side of the story everytime, further isolating me socially. I couldn't help but shake the feeling that he was doing so with our business partners as well. I asked him about it, and he lied to me and told me he never revealed anything personal to any of our partner. So, I logged into his emails and read the back and forth between him and the BPs.  


And here it was. Laid down were detailed facts about our fights, relationships and just generally my flaws as a person. Basically, he ruined my chances of ever starting anew with any of them, as they now have access to parts of my life I never gave him the consent to expose.

I confronted him about this and told him that I went through his email. He immediately went for the divorce and is considering kicking me out of the company(Which is now easy to do, since pretty much everyone hates me - AND he told them I went through his emails)  


I feel horrible for breaching everyone's privacy. I feel like an utter piece of shit. But a part of me can't help but think that I was right to dig further?",163,490,0.96

1909,Not the A-hole," 

As part of a scheme I'm working on to try and not want to blow my brains out, I keep my interactions with my mother to a bare minimum. After realizing that a lot of fucked up stuff that happened during my childhood and early twenties was inexcusable, borderline sociopathic behavior and realizing that she relentlessly attacks her children's self esteem so that they will never grow out of their fucked up co-dependent relationship with her, I actively pursued the juuust right amount of Mom in my life: as little as possible without causing a whole thing with my siblings. She gets a call on Thanksgiving and Christmas and a card on Mother's Day and her Birthday. End of list.

It was a good system while it lasted, but that all went up in smoke when my husband and I had to take in my nine year old nephew. It's a long story and the why isn't super relevant to the AITA question. My husband and I are indefinitely raising my nephew. He's a really great kid and we both consider it a privilege to get to be there for him. Obviously, this means I can't continue to freeze out my mom without keeping her from her grandson which isn't something I'm willing to do. My nephew is really fond of his grandma and she's never demonstrated the kind of psychologically abusive behavior I remember from my childhood towards him (although I keep my head on a swivel for it). She's now regularly around my house to visit my nephew. I'm polite to her but keep it very all-business. Any personal questions are met with vague, noncommittal answers and I always steer the conversation back to logistics around visiting/babysitting/going out with my nephew. I'm committed to not letting her use my nephew as a shoe in the door to my life.

My husband, on the other hand, doesn't seem to share my commitment. His parents are very religious and more or less disowned him when he came out of the closet and we've always been supportive of each other's family baggage, but that seems to have all went out the window when he met her and she was suddenly around the house a lot. They will call each other 'just to catch up', go out to lunch, see a play, ect. I've made it very clear that I do not like this, but he always laughs it off like I'm fucking Lorelei Gilmore and not liking my mother is some fun ""quirk"" of mine that can just be waved off. I lost it when I found out he was telling her stories about me in college, dating, and just generally gossiping about my life in ways he knows I actively try to keep her in the dark about.  We had a tiff where I said I felt disrespected by him having such an informal relationship with my abuser and he said I was being controlling and if she's going to be in our house all the time, he should be free to do what he wants to make their relationship work.

Basically, we’ve been dating for a little more than a week since our mutual friend got us together, and he’s really sweet and nice though a bit hard to relate to since he’s popular and pretty confident. I know that my boyfriend has been attracted to me since 9th grade (we’re seniors now) though, so it’s exciting. 

The problem is that, since I’m shy,  I’ve only ever really had internet friends besides my two decent friends at school. One of my Reddit friends I got along with really well, and I added him on Snapchat and Twitter, which I only use to lurk since again, I don’t really have friends and my school friends and I only really hang out at school and text sometimes. I’ve been talking to him a lot since then, and we share a lot of memes and stuff, it’s fun.

My boyfriend added me on Snapchat and saw that I had a 267 day streak with my internet friend, and freaked out since my internet friend is the only one actively on Snapchat besides my last snapchats from about 20 weeks ago. My boyfriend asked me who it was and I explained that I met my internet friend a while ago. He asked if I’ve ever flirted with him (and I have) so I said yes, and admitted that we’ve mutually sent nudes back and forth a lot. My boyfriend got SUPER mad, even though I haven’t flirted with my internet friend at all since we’ve been together? I even told him that I have a boyfriend now and internet friend was all for it since he knows how I struggle to even just get friends. 

I don’t want to drop my friend just because I’m in a relationship now, and when I don’t flirt with him he really understands me still, we have really fun conversations about our similar hobbies and he gets me a lot since he has social anxiety as well. I also know a lot about his life now, his friends, his family, his pets, and crushes and stuff so I’ll feel a bit heartbroken if I end our friendship, especially since I don’t know if my relationship will last.

1914,Not the A-hole,"Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bde1zk/update_wibta_if_i_took_another_job_with_a_way/

Hello again everyone, i forgot to update this post to include the link to the update. 

Greetings everyone. Throwaway for obvious reasons.

Forgive me if it turns out a bit long.

So, a bit of background.3 years ago I decided Im gonna change my career and become a programmer. after attending a coding bootcamp my friend told me i can join her startup (startup was based in USA and she is a senior developer there) as one of the 3 interns. The startup was struggling so the employment was not guaranteed. I was just happy to be learning and doing something I actually enjoy.

The CTO was personally teaching us and we learned a lot. Unfortunately my savings ran out and i informed my friend and the CTO that i had to find a job . They understood and we parted on good terms.

I did some freelance jobs which wasnt stable, but was better than nothing. 2 months after i left the startup got funding and hired one of the 2 other interns. since the company was based in US, their base salary for a junior exceeded the local salary 5 times.

After a year of freelancing and instability, one of my other friends who was in the coding bootcamp with me told me that their company has a vacancy. i applied and after a grueling interview got the job. The founders were trying to hire people that would stay with them for a long time. they werent sure about me, that i ""wouldnt quit after a couple of months"". My friend reassured them that i needed something stable. Which is true, i dont like frequent change and needed stability.

I thought i would stay in that company for more or less a long time. The atmosphere and environment is great and bosses are decent. The only downside was the pay, but since it was stable and enough to pay the bills and leave a bit of spending money, i cant complain.

Fast forward 3-4 months. 2 weeks ago my friend from the startup tells me that the other intern they hired (who was getting 5x my salary) quit. I was surprised but paid no mind. Today that same friend asked me if, hypothetically, i would be interested in working with them, implying i'd get the same salary as the previous guy.

So now im conflicted. i dont want to get ahead of myself but i have a feeling that the work offer is likely to happen. I had a friendly chat with the CTO 2 days after their guy quit and among other things he asked me questions about my employment.

&#x200B;

To be perfectly honest the thing that is making me consider is that the salary is so high. I wouldnt be considering leaving if the prospective salary was 2x my current salary. but 5x makes a considerable sum. Part of me wishes the offer never comes so i wouldnt have to make this choice. But another part of me wants to earn more than i am currently earning.

WIBTA if i quit my current employment 4 months after being hired and knowing that the people who hired me were wary of this thing happening, in the first place? I dont want to be selfish and be someone who ""chases money"", but i also dont want to look back and regret missing this hypothetical opportunity.",63,55,0.92
1915,Everyone Sucks,"Long story short, today in class this woman brought her child, who kept crying and making noises during the lecture. She had to get up repeatedly to take him out the class, and it kept breaking my ability to focus on the teacher. She would look at me, laugh it off and say sorry, as I told her that she should consider putting the little guy in daycare. She scoffed and said that she can take her child where she can; and acted like I was the one being obtrusive. When the kid started screaming I told her to ""shut her baby up"", where three other girls found my comment offensive. The teacher didn't mind me saying it. The kid then kept pulling my pants and so I pulled my leg away and caused it fall (on accident), which I don't think is my fault. She placed her phone on the desk to record the video and then stood behind me as she tried to hush her baby. Her friends kept scoffing at me when I ignored her crying kid. I just wanted to attend class.

I pick her up at the airport and the “surprise” is another friend of mine. Which I’m happy about but I immediately ask, “so where are you staying”
They assumed they could both stay with me even though she never mentioned a second person. So I let them both stay.
I requested a couple days off to be with them. But the next day they stay in bed and don’t do anything until like the middle of the day we just go get dinner. And when we get home they just go in their room all night.
The next day they leave to pick up a car they’re renting and then don’t come back until 8:30 at night. I sat at home waiting for them all day. I requested these days off and lost money for this.
They get home, use my kitchen to make food, then go to their room for the rest of the night. 
The next morning I’m just really angry and awkward and I go to my room to change and don’t come out for a bit. When I finally do come out they’ve left again without saying anything or inviting me.
I thought they were nice but it really feels like they’re just taking advantage of me for a place to stay and I really want them to pay me back for the money I’ve lost and I want them to get their shit out and stay at a hotel.

I started dating a beautiful woman, let’s call her Jessica (32), two years ago now and we are getting on great. She moved in with me and the boys about a year ago and I feel like we are getting used to life together as a family.

I can only imagine how hard of a time I would have if I were in her shoes having to get used to a completely new way of life.

She doesn’t contribute with any money at this point and I’m okay with it - we’ve all been in tough spots and I love this woman. But then I asked her if she could look after the kids, pick them up after school and so on, and she completely freaks out. Calls me a complete asshole for using her as a babysitter and says that I am not taking the responsibility I should be taking as a father. 

I have struggled as a dad in the past, I wasn’t the most mature man when my kiddos were born and this leads to me taking her comment very close to heart. So I’d really appreciate some comments from a third person perspective.

1919,Not enough info,"Me and my wife back in the middle of college. We were each other's first real relationship, and I don't think I would've ever graduated if it wasn't for her. Thanks to childhood abuse, I've been diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety, severe depression and more. Starting in high school, I attempted suicide 5 times, but thankfully none ever succeeded.

The only people that know my mental illness are the therapists and psychologists I've been through, and my wife. And it's only thanks to my wife finding out I was suicidal that I ever told a therapist and got medicated. I am not exaggerating when I say I feel like had I never met her, I might be dead today. Shes told me similar sentiments about how I've helped her get past her trauma, but I definitely think she's done a lot more for me than I could ever do for her. We got married after 7 years together.

I still LOVE my wife, I fucking worship the ground she walks on, I would take a bullet for her. She herself is a dream wife, sweet, gorgeous, funny, understanding, and a super high libido. We agreed not to have kids until well into our careers, and she's now 5 months pregnant with our first. Outside of sex, our relationship is great. We love to surprise each other, we still (mostly) communicate very well, and we always work past our fights amicably and quickly.

But the past 5 months, my appetite for sex just died. I have no idea why, hers seems practically the same and she's the pregnant one. It's gotten to the point where we had sex <5 times the past few months. Most nights I'll just go down on her or use toys until she finishes, fall asleep, and occasionally masturbate in the morning. I was hoping that was enough, but recently she made a comment about we don't have much sex like before. I lied and said it was because of work stress, but she seemed hurt.

My shame peaked yesterday. I was chatting with an older coworker, definitely WAY less my type, and the conversation got flirty. I stopped the conversation only a few minutes in (I will NEVER cheat on my wife) but I noticed, suddenly, I had a huge lust for this coworker, a sexual lust I hadn't felt in... 5 months. Before yesterday, I had ZERO interest in this woman sexually, and now I'm suddenly getting thoughts while my pregnant wife is at her job?

I'm at a total loss right now, and darkness is entering my thoughts like it's high school again, except this time my anger is directed at myself. How could I be so shitty to the person who I love? To the person who's the only reason I'm not buried in the ground? She DOES NOT deserve this, and if I told her the truth, she'd be devastated. I want to get counseling, but since everything else in our relationship is great she'd immediately deduce why I'm asking and be equally hurt. I'm just such a shit excuse for a husband, and I try to please her every other way but I'm not man enough to please her sexually.

Anyway,  I asked for initial startup funds (mainly it was going to be for  contracting employees.) in exchange for equity... again belittled   or outright went back to the default, ""you shouldn't be starting  something if you don't have the money yourself"" (keep in mind none of  them have ever done... a successful venture out on their own.. or have  experience in doing something similar..even as an employee for someone  else)

So I am very early into a pregnancy that I am miscarrying. I was recently starting to suspect I was pregnant, and going to discuss it with my husband. Later in the day, the bleeding began. I have had successful pregnancies with bleeding and miscarriages before, the bleeding is different for me.
Two days after the bleeding started, I had my annual GYN exam. I told the doctor my concerns, after a few minor tests, he confirmed that I was miscarrying a baby.

Now comes the part that makes me question if I am an asshole, I really don't want to tell my husband.

My reasons for this are mostly that he will shut down emotionally and not want to talk about it anyway, which hurts me far more than just dealing with it alone, and that we have a lot of other things going on in our lives at the moment. This seems like something unnecessary to pile on him.

I feel so guilty and like I am being very selfish and have a lot of mixed feelings about telling him.

1923,Not the A-hole," We've been friends forever. I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.

My life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26

She's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).

Now, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.

I've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. 

At work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.

She has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.

At this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?",162,542,0.91

You might imagine how difficult it was to come out as bi to all my friends, him included. He was suprisingly alright with it, and continued treating me as normal, which was nice. However, a certain meme began to spread around, particularly on Instagram. It was the ""Anti-LGBT Emoji""(And yes, I know that to some it means ""no homo"" but that isnt the case for Tom. The specific memes on Instagram he was liking all referred to it as the ""Anti-LGBT Emoji"")
I saw him liking these memes on Instagram. I was kind of annoyed at the meme and Instagram as a whole, but all I had to do was close the app and it was gone. This wasnt good enough for Tom though, and he started sending it to our group chat. I had told him to cut it out and made it clear he was getting me mad. Of course, this only made Tom want to do it more. He kept spamming the emoji and eventually I just muted the chat. I was thinking ""He's being annoying and purposefully trying to make me angrier, but it's fine. As long as he's dropped it by the time I'm back, I'll let it go.""
So then I decided since I came out privately to everyone who mattered to me, I was finally ready to come out in a more public way. I made a profile picture for myself on Facebook with myself in front of the bi pride flag. Uploaded it, and sure enough...
Tom, in the comments, with the Anti-LGBT Emoji on my profile picture that I used to come out publicly. I had enough. I didn't care if it was just some emoji.
You see, I remembered a few monthes ago when Stan Lee passed away. Tom was very upset, and fell into a slump for a while. I did my very best to help him out of this slump, and I remembered him telling me ""He was my hero, man. I really wanted to meet him. I wanted to go to cons hoping I'd meet him.""
I saw an opportunity to hit Tom where it hurt. I replied to his comment with ""Haha! Good one Tom, wanna know whats funnier though?""
""Is it [Emoji]?""
""Nope! That you thought youd actually get to meet Stan Lee before he died!""
and thus followed a long comment chain where he tried to justify his emoji and even some of my friends jumping in trying to convince him to just stop (mind you, this is all public, including to my parents.) 
It ended with me explaining to him that even if it was a joke, everyone has jokes they dont like, even him. He said he would stop doing it, though he didnt apologize.
It has been almost a week since then now, and I've been thinking it over. In my head I think I did something good, but in my heart I think I feel bad. We havent talked since then, and the rest of my friends have started pulling away from him. This situation isnt entirely why theyre pulling away from him, but this was the straw that broke the camels back.",22,32,0.94

1928,Not the A-hole,"This is a doozy, bare with me.

When I was 16, my first girlfriend, also 16, became pregnant. Her parents literally uprooted their whole lives to move away due to it. We found out one day, I was barred from seeing or contacting her or her family by threats of police involvement the next day. I was a dumb 16 year old: I was scared of my parents, scared of her parents getting police involved, so it was a ""secret"". 

My parents still don't know because I don't even know what I would tell them. It was literally a month later they were gone. No trace at all. To give an idea of my girlfriend's thoughts, she was scared but didn't hate me or anything. It really boiled down to her ultra-conservative parents. This was before Facebook and before teens had cellphones, etc, there wasn't really a place I could follow her, at least not for a couple of years.

I'm 33 now. I'm married, I have a daughter who's 3. I still think about my ex-girlfriend. I never forgot. I wasn't able to find her on Facebook until a couple of years ago. She also has a daughter, my daughter, a 16 year old. She looks so strikingly like me, it's unreal. She looks more like me than my 3 year old.

If there's anything I want more in life, is to reconnect. I always wanted this. I would have dreams, very frequently, about meeting my older child, even before I saw photos. I would give my house, all my money, everything but family to make my family bigger.

But my then-girlfriend is married now to someone else. They have an established life. Hell, I have an established life. It becomes an internal struggle between wanting to reconnect more than life itself versus potentially putting their lives into catastrophe. I can't just inject myself into their lives, it would have a negative net sum I'm sure. Plus I don't know how my wife would react, I haven't even told her. I assumed they had a termination and that was that, so it never came up. I should have in retrospect.

1929,No A-holes here,"This was a while back but I went to some swanky bar in San Fran and this cute girl started talking to me. She was a little bit forward, which was somewhat unsettling.

But we went back to my place and things got weird from there. She started demanding that I order pizza because she was hungry. And then she grabbed my laptop and put on some really obscure movie. When the pizza got here, she started jamming it into her face with no plate or anything. On my bed. 

The next morning I offer to buy her breakfast. Really I just wanted to get her out of my apartment because I was becoming increasingly unattracted to her. 

Problem was that every restaurant was closed. So after about the 3rd restaurant she started saying that I could just take her home. So I agreed and started headed to the next block over where my car was parked. She must have liked me and been nervous. But the stuff she was saying was just... weird.

I tried to blow it off but then she said words I'll never forget, ""What kind of car do you have? If I like it I might just have to steal it!""

I mean. Of course. Of course she's kidding. Right? 

But it was the maniacal cackle that followed that made me start thinking. What if she liked me and I didn't like her back...how would she handle that? 

I nervously decided against bringing her to my car. I just didn't like the idea of night after night having my car parked out on the street completely vulnerable. 

Instead of bringing it up, my instinct was to think of some way out of this. 

I was spinning myself up thinking of all the crazy horror stories I've heard on Reddit. That's when I resorted to drastic measures. 

I kept insisting that I treat her to breakfast. That it was the right thing to do. Wouldn't take no for an answer.

My plan was to invite her to sit down, go to use the men's room, and then simply never return to the table. I didn't know what else to do. 

But after literally the 8th restaurant we went to was closed (wtf), I began to panic. How was I going to get away from this woman without taking her to my car?

That's when I saw the shining beacon. A tiny convenience mart. I walked in, grabbed a frozen steak sandwich, some kinda potato, and an orange juice. I told her to get whatever she wants and I set my stuff on the counter. 

She was in back of the store. I was in the front. I put my index finger up at the clerk to signal like I just received a phone call. I held my hand over the phone and said, ""gotta take this, put everything on my tab."" He looked confused. I didn't care. 

I walked out slowly. As soon as I was out of sight, I shoved my phone in my pocket and ran faster than I ever ran before. 

I heard her call after me like 30 seconds later. She said, ""wait, where are you going!?""

Without looking back or slowing down I yelled, ""it's an emergency!""

She was pissed. Started sending me angry texts. I just apologized and said it was a personal emergency. 

But at least she doesn't know what my car looks like. ",216,983,0.92
1930,Not the A-hole,"Not here for validation. Haven't been thinking too clearly and need some strangers to weigh in, my support circle has given me mixed responses

When I was 28 my wife of 7 years (together for 13) and 4 year old daughter died in a home invasion while I was helping out a friend a few hours away. Afterwards I survived two attempts on my own life, went through a a few years of drug and alcohol abuse and homelessness as I stopped working. After a lot of effort I got back on my feet.

I've turned 40 a few months ago. A few years ago I met my current wife. We had been friends for a bit and have been together for 2 years. She knew what I'd been through and was extremely supportive, we've helped eachother through a lot and have overall had a great marriage.

The other night we had a major blow-up. We've both been dealing with family issues and work related problems and had been short with eachother for a few days. We went out for a date which helped, and she asked to go the next night as well. I had already committed to helping a friend move that day, so I told her we could the day after. In retrospect I know this was wrong of me.

For the first time she start swearing at me, pushing chairs, telling me to leave. It ended with her saying, verbatim, ""last time you neglected your fucking family for a friend you lost them, that's on you. What if we had a kid [my name], would it take letting them die too before you smarten up?""

I left that night and came back the next day. We talked and she was extremely apologetic and said she's just been stressed from work, but it came out that she had always been jealous of my first wife which she never mentioned before. I told her I wanted wasn't sure if I could be with her, she's been staying with her sister but begging me for a chance to work through it.

Friends are mixed. Some support me, others think I owe it to her to try to move past it because it was one issue in an otherwise solid marriage and because ""I do still think about my wife so she's right to be jealous."" I visit my family on their birthdays and Christmas. I keep a photo of my first wife and daughter in my wallet (I also keep one of my current wife) and I've had their names on my back for 10+ years. That's it. I don't compare her to my first wife, nor do I love her less and I don't wallow in grief while ignoring my marriage, I just don't feel like being remarried means I have to act like they never existed. She knew I was a widower when we met. She was the one who offered to talk to me about my wife back then, and I haven't talked to her about my wife since we married. Had she brought up these concerns in a better way, I'd have gladly reassured her and worked on it, but while I can forgive a lot I don't know if I can forgive or ever forget how she said it.

I need opinions. I love her, but I feel sick in my stomach when I think about her now. I feel so betrayed and hurt because while things are said in anger this felt purposely crafted to hurt most",492,1567,0.97

1934,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway.

I've been with my boyfriend for a bit over a year, and he's really great and things have been awesome. But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. 

We have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.

I want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. 

I would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. 

He became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. 

So I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?

His logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. 

My logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. 

I'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are ""just what happen at strip clubs"".

He also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?",734,854,0.94
1935,Not the A-hole,"I have an infant who is currently in the crawling stage. He goes everywhere in our house as fast as he can on his two little hands and knees. Then he immediately puts whatever he can find, including his hands, in his mouth. For this reason, I have hired house keepers to mop and vacuum all our floors monthly, and keep shoes in the mud room or by the front door. Just to minimize how much gross is tracked into the house for my baby to crawl in and consume. 

My parents will come over about twice a month after the baby is asleep to keep an eye on him while my husband and I grab a late dinner or drinks. This is the only time my parents babysit or contribute towards helping with the baby. So while I’m really grateful for the free help, I don’t feel like we are abusing the system. I also order them in dinner when they come over. 

My mother has now decided on these  occasions that she doesn’t like taking her shoes off and just wears them. Even when asked directly to please take her shoes off, she responds “no. My feet get cold. I’d rather fight with you about it.” And then refuses to do it. Period. She has been offered fuzzy socks, slippers, or to bring her own slippers with her if she prefers. Nothing is acceptable other than wearing her dirty shoes all over our house, so for days after these occasions I am finding pieces of rocks, grass, dirt tracked in. 

AITA for not wanting her to come over if she doesn’t take off her shoes? I don’t need free babysitting, I can happily pay someone. So I am thinking of telling her that if she can’t respect the rules of my home, she’s not invited over until she can. I hate to be uptight about this, but it’s gross to me and I am specifically paying cleaners to mitigate the dirt in my house. Just trying to get some perspective. ",230,464,0.95

1937,Not the A-hole,"My wife is a nurse and works weekends from time to time. I work M-F. Because she is working on the weekends, sometimes I take our son to the local zoo or out four-wheeling in my Jeep, or to the beach. She feels that she doesn't get the one on one time with him like I do. Bear in mind, she works 3-12 hour shifts and has 4 days a week off. 

Occasionally, I will go out of town on a Jeep trip (I've gone twice in the past year). I would prefer it if she came with me, but she doesn't really care to ""sit in a car"". I wish she enjoyed the hobby as much as I do, but I understand we don't have to have all the same interests. Sometimes she would want to go, but because we have young kids, it may not be conducive so she stays home with them. 

She has a friend with a kid that is near the same age as our own. Every time this friend wants to get together with my wife, she never wants the family to be included. It's always dinner and drinks with the girls, beach trip with only the kids-no husbands allowed and now, she wants to my wife to bring our son to Legoland for the weekend and I am not permitted to go.

My wife is saying that I get one on one time with our son and this is an opportunity for her to do the same. I think it is a good idea for her to bond with our kids one on one too.

We are currently fighting because I think it is unfair/my feelings are hurt because she is taking our son on his first trip to an amusement park and I wont be apart of that memory. My feelings are that if she wanted to bond with him one on one, she could do the same type of things that I do like taking him to the zoo, the local water park, the beach or whatever, just the two of them and then we could do an amusement park as a family.

I told her I wouldn't care at all that she was going if she wasn't taking our son, but again, I am bummed that I won't be apart of the memory. When she was telling our son last night about the trip, he asked, ""why isn't daddy going."" I wanted to say ""because mommy said I can't,"" but instead I just told him that it was a trip for just him and mommy.

I slept on the couch because she thinks I am being selfish and manipulative. There really isn't a point to fighting because I wouldn't go on the trip at this point, even if she begged me. I asked her if she could name a single one of my friends that makes her feel excluded and unwelcome and she can't. She recognizes that her friend always wants it to be a girls only or no husbands type of deal but justifies it as ""I don't have very many friends I want to hang out with."" I feel like she is putting her relationship with her friend before ours.

Honestly, if she just said, ""I can understand why you are disappointed you are missing out and I'm sorry,"" it would go really far but to blame me for how I feel is really getting under my skin and escalating the fight much more than it has to be.",313,250,0.93
1938,Not the A-hole,"So I’m 17 and yesterday it was time for me to go get depo shot (every three months). I have been looking at the nexplanon implant (every 5 years) because I thought it would be more convenient and overall better. 

I brought up the implant with my mom and she told me to wait until I’m 18 (3 months from now) and she wouldn’t even talk to me as to why I wanted it. That was it. 

I went and during the appointment I asked if I could do the implant and they said they could do it for me and I went ahead and got it inserted (mom wasn’t there). When I told my mom she hung up the phone on me. She forgot about it and things were fine and when it was mentioned today she said she forgot about that and she was upset that I went and got it. I told her that it would be better for me to go ahead and get it now while I’m not working full time like I plan to be after I turn 18 in the summer and my arm can heal fine (I work retail and have to lift heavy cases and stuff).

She said she wanted to do ‘research on it’ and kept asking if I even knew the side effects which are no different that the depo shot.

I feel like she’s overreacting and mind you she has an IUD so I’m not too sure why she’s going so hard about it. What would’ve been the difference between now and 18? I’m not sure why she thinks I’m not allowed to make choices like these on my own. 

Also I’m not sexually active or anything and she knows that. I just wanted something more long term.

1939,Asshole,"So this happened when i was in 10. Grade. For the sake of anonymity i will not give the name of the school or any students and teacher names.

So i was raised as a patriotic child since my father was a member of the army and my mother was a teacher. I respect soldiers of my country more than anyone else. And i used to have a lot of fights against other students and teachers for saying pro-terrorist stuff. I live in turkey btw just to clear things up. So around 5 years ago in my class there was a girl in my class that would go to meetings of some terrorist groups because she supported their cause.
Well i would get mad at this but since this did not affect me that much i never cared too much to say anything about it since she never confronted me about my ideals.

Her last words i heard was that she was going to a meeting with her family to support their cause.
Well the next days on the news i sae that there was an attack on the meeting site and that some people had died. Well those days that kind of stuff would happen very often in turkey so it was not surprising that it would have happened in a meeting. 
After the weekend the whole class was aware of that she died and stood silent in a means to grief for her. 
Well i wasn't having none of that and spook out during the lunch break that she was supporting an illegal party that would use every means possible to get what they want. So i told that she knew what was coming her way and that she deserved it since she supported them.

So to say i got a lot of backlash from my comment on her death be it from my classmates or even other teachers

1941,Not the A-hole,"

Some background: My grandfather just passed away at the end of January. He was closing in on 90 and lived a very full life and died very peacefully in his home which is exactly where he wanted to be. 

This is where the story gets very sticky, my grandfather lived in a cheap tract house and was very frugal. His only passions in life were woodworking and his garden. But to my huge surprised I was named as his sole heir with life changing money. With the house, everything in it and cash his estate was valued at a little over a million dollars. 

Here's where it gets even stickier. My mom passed away 6 years ago. She had one sister who I was fairly close to and from her I have 3 cousins. I don't know the full details of why my aunt was estranged from my grandpa, in fact all my mom ever told me was ""it's between the two of them."" I have mixed relationship with my cousins and because their mom was estranged from my grandpa, they never had a nice word to say about him and I don't know if they ever met him. To be fair, they probably never had the chance to get to know him like I did. Cousins and aunt did not attend the very small funeral I set up for my grandpa either. 


Now she and my cousins have been basically calling me nonstop somewhere between begging me and demanding of me that I split the estate 5 ways. 

This is what both of my attorneys have essentially advised:
No matter what I shouldn't split the estate 5 ways. If I do decide to be incredibly generous, it should be split 50/50 and my aunt and cousins can divide their half however they like. Both attorneys have advised against this period, as it's not in my best interest. 

I can write 4 $5000 checks out of the estate to get them to go away. $5000 in our state's probate system is generally seen as ""enough"" of an inheritance to be essentially be uncontestable and my aunt and cousins will have no further claim on my grandpas estate, or none that a judge would be willing to hear. The first attorney strongly advised I do this. 

I do nothing. I am carrying out my grandpa's wishes to the letter and that is my responsibility and also my benefit for staying close to him in his lifetime. This is my second attorney's preferred course of action. 

But this is not about the legality of the situation. This is about what SHOULD I do and would I be the asshole if I keep the entire estate for myself. Just over a million dollars is enough money for me to finally fund a retirement account, have a down payment on a decent house and actually save some money. I have no designs on a big blow out but maybe updating my car would be nice. I could do all of that with $500k, but that number sure looks different that $1 million.

She’s been very sad, and I really do feel for her and his family, but at the same time I find myself some what emotionally distant from her. Not that I feel insecure that she had feelings for him, but that ultimately I hated this guy and can’t match her feelings. 

I never knew him personally. The first time I ever heard about him was early on in our relationship when my fiancé showed me messages he had sent her of him and his friend talking shit about me and trying to get her to hangout with them. I brushed it off as a jealous ex. Why wouldn’t he feel anything but dislike for me?  The feeling was mutual.

I fell quickly for my fiancé and in the first year took her on a trip she had been wanting to go on for her birthday. In the middle of conversation at dinner, he calls and she answers. I felt extremely disrespected and we had a discussion about him. She told me all about how there were no feelings for him, that he used to hit her and pull her hair and threaten to come to her school and beat her up. I took her word and moved passed it, but not without new disdain for him. As time went by in our relationship, more details about him would come up here and there, none of them flattering.

Then came the news of his OD. I’ve been trying to be as supportive as possible of my fiancé, but I also feel torn and guilty. Deep down, I felt like if it had to happen to someone, who better than the druggie who put hands on my fiancé. I’m not angry at her for feeling sad, but I do feel slightly confused and slightly distant. 

I never heard a single positive word from her or her family about him until his passing. She’s been telling me and her friends about how he was a good guy. I do understand he must have had some great pain in his life, as I don’t believe well adjusted people just casually get in to heroin, but I also feel a lack of sympathy and empathy from the way he’s been framed for me all these years. 

Last night she was telling me again about how good of a guy he was and randomly mentioned how he never tried to get between us. I had finally had enough, not in an angry way, but I calmly reminded her of how that wasn’t true and that this was the man who hit her and threatened her. She told me that wasn’t true and that he had only ever pulled her hair and started explaining that by saying she had made him angry. Lies of him hitting her aside, I still said that’s no excuse for him putting his hands on you. I told her I didn’t care for him and it made her even more upset.

Last night I reminded my DH that he needed to pick up our son from school because I have an event today-an event that goes til midnight. It’s been on the calendar for a month, but he was still shocked and a bit upset that I’ll be gone so long. No biggie tho, he’s happy to have some one on one with his kid. 

We go to bed late and he’s trying to get something started. It’s been a couple days, but I’m just not feeling it. Not in a bad way, I’m just really content with the day and for the life of me cannot think my way into sexy time right then. I told him we could have sex if he was determined, but that I wasn’t in the mood. I feel bad for turning him down, but I got really cuddly which he loves. 

This morning it’s pitch black out and I can tell DH is trying to get some sexy time started again. He keeps moving me around to cuddle closer and tries to kiss my neck and such. He also keeps pulling the blanket off my butt and I’m freezing to death. I’m clearly trying to sleep and roll over to signal, not now, buddy. After almost 40 mins he’s like “okay, gotta go, last cuddle!” Right as my alarm goes off. So I yelled “I just want to sleep damn it!”  Right as he goes in for a last hug. He says “fine!” And gets up. I hit snooze. 

Not two minutes later our son (3years old) starts whining in my face about how daddy left and he wants his TV (he gets 30 mins before school so I can get dressed). I’m furious and call DH and tell him next time he refuses to let me sleep, at least take a minute to take care of the kid. DH said “I know you hate me so much, but I’m not even gone yet, I’ll fix his TV.” 

I don’t hate him. I’m just about to go into a 15 1/2 hour work day with only 4.5 hours of sleep and I don’t see why wanting to sleep til my alarm is a crime. I feel bad I turned him down twice in a row, but can’t a guy take a hint that I want to keep sleeping?

Hey, I moved into a new apartment the 15'th december 2018 with 2 acquaintances, the apartment got 3 bedrooms, 2 of them are smaller and the bigger one is about 40% bigger than the other 2.

So before we moved in, I asked my roomates (let's call them X and Y) who was taking the big room, X says that he doesn't care, Y says that he really wants it. Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked ""Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).

After about 3 days, Y says ""I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?"" so, once again I finally gave in and said ""I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room."" Y agreed.

Now fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues ""It's not fair that you and me got the same m\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent.

She told me that she wanted to have sex badly. I was also in the mood for it and I agreed. So we got into a position she was comfortable with and we try do do it. Then she wanted me to go down on her. That's when it hit me. Her vagina stinked. It had a weird smell and it was repulsive. Maybe because of some hormones during pregnancy idk.

I just couldn't. She understood that something was up and asked me. I told her that her vagina stinked and she needed to clean up before we can do anything. She started crying and accused me of cheating (?) and told me that I didn't love her anymore. 

I actually love her so much. I want to have sex too but I couldn't. Did I overstep. AITA here?

1951,Asshole,"First I just want to say that I'm not the kind of person who demands expensive gifts but we do gift each other a lot of things.

I and my boyfriend have been together for 10 years. We live together, and we have a 4yo daughter. I was waiting forever for him to propose. So I was really excited when my sister told me that my boyfriend asked her which kind of ring would suit me and he sent her some pics from Tiffany's. I was super excited and hyped and I kind of guessed that he wanted to propose on our anniversary.

The day comes and I'm really excited. We went out for a romantic dinner, got back and when we were watching a movie he suddenly got down on his knees and asked me if I wanted to marry him. I said yes and then he showed me the ring. It was not even a new one. It looked old and the stones looked average at best. When I asked him about that he told me that his mother gave him her ring.  He told me that it had a great sentimental value since his father was the only man his mother ever truly loved and I'm the only woman he'll ever love. His father is no more, and his mother gave it to him. 

It's all sweet and cheesy but it doesn't look great. Also, I don't want the begining of my new life to start with a second hand ring. When I told him this, he was very upset and told me that he never thought I was so materialistic and he just left. He's not even answering any of my messages or calls. Was I wrong?

So I know it's only been a day but I got a bus ticket for later today back down to my place so I thought I would have one last chat with my mum and dad before I cut them out completely. 

I said I would just listen to why they decided to do what they did and they didn't have a good enough reason, they were saying how they didn't know what to do and dad thought that by acting like his father (my abuser lost his father in a motorcycle crash) he would stop. 

I then asked them why they failed to protect me as parents they had no answer and kinda just looked down at the floor. 

I told them that they are lucky I was so strong and got through my eating disorder and other issuss myself because from now on I would be doing everything myself. 

I also added that I would be keeping in contact with my younger sister and if anything like this happens I will be calling the police and getting custody of her, so you better not fuck up with your other daughter. 
(I'm keeping an eye on my sister) 

I told them that this would be the last time they see me and I got up and left, both mum and dad cried a lot and begged for my forgiveness but refused and left.

1953,Not the A-hole,"This happened a while ago so bear with me as I try to recollect what happened.

&#x200B;

I planned to go to a concert months in advance with my girlfriend at the time for New Years Eve. She agreed, we bought our tickets, housing, and travel and everything was set. We drive a few hours to get there a few days before to settle down and explore, but the day of the concert she gets sick (a cold maybe) and decides not to go to the concert. We have a few other friends coming along, so I was really agitated and repeatedly (maybe 3 times) asked her to confirm if she really didn't want to go. This also wasn't the first time she bailed the day before on a concert, last time also because she got sick, so understandably I was pretty emotional but it was out of our control.

&#x200B;

About 2 hours before the concert I called her one last time to make sure she didn't want to go. I had to resell her ticket last minute because I didn't want it to be wasted, so I wanted to 100% make sure she wasn't going. She flipped out over the phone and turned that against me saying it was her money and I didn't have the right to tell her what to do with it and that I didn't care about her health because I kept trying to convince her to go to the concert despite being sick.

&#x200B;

I figured that if a friend bailed on me last minute, I would also try and convince them to reconsider, especially when we all planned this months ago. I didn't want to bail on my other friends going as well, it wasn't fair to them as we all took a road trip for this concert, so I went to the concert without her.

&#x200B;

She then attacked me saying if I really wanted to spend NYE with her, I shouldn't have gone to the concert and spent time with her (took care of her while she was sick) even though she agreed to spend NYE with me at the concert. I later found out that she went to another party with her female friends and had drinks while ""sick,"" claiming that she didn't want to be alone because I still ended up going to the concert. To be honest, she did not seem sick at all (when I came back at 3am she was still up and being active), though that's not for me to decide. I felt betrayed and when I confronted her she said she felt down at the time and didn't want to go to the concert because it could've made her sickness worse.

1955,Asshole,"I have a 50-50 custody arrangement of my 8 year old daughter (Lisa) with my ex-wife/her mother (Ariana). For the past few years I have been making it a point to not attend events that Ariana is attending, and she has not been attending events that I attended. If it were up to Ariana, we would be chums - I, however, do not wish to have a friendly relationship with her. A civil relationship for the child's benefit is all that is necessary.

Lisa joined a sports team this year, and the year-end banquet is coming up, at a restauraunt 10 minutes from my home. Ariana informed me that she would like to attend. I requested that since Ariana attended the first game of the year (which was scheduled on 'my' day) that I be able attend the banquet (which also happens to be scheduled on 'my' day) alone this year, and she attend next year's banquet. Ariana replied that she would be there ""no matter who has her that day"". She offered to sit at a separate table and that Lisa would sit with me. 

I explained to her that I did not think it was best for Lisa to have both parents at the event, but only be able to sit with one, and that sitting together was out of the question - I have no interest in conversing with Ariana. I reiterated my request to switch who takes her each year, and that I be able to take her to the first one (since she attended the first game). 

After a few more exchanges with this same story playing out, she informed me she had explained to Lisa (she was home with her at the time) the situation, and had explained my feelings about not wanting to sit at the same table with Ariana, while in the same email explaining my feelings incorrectly.

I told her that I didn't think it was the right thing to do to put Lisa in the middle of this argument, and that it wasn't her place to tell Lisa how I felt about the situation. I informed her that constituted disparaging me to Lisa, and was justiciable - then told her not to do it again. 

I then told her that I had discussed the situation with Lisa (I waited a day so I could discuss it with her in person), and that Lisa did not want to be put in a situation where she had to choose between her parents, and that Ariana will be taking Lisa to the banquet by themselves this year, and that I would like to take Lisa myself next year. I also included that Lisa said this seemed a fair way to do it. I know this seems hypocritical considering I just called Ariana out for it, however... damage control.

Ariana replied that she is not taking Lisa to the banquet just because I decided she would, since it will be 'my' day - that I needed to make it work. She said if she finds out that Lisa doesn't go because I was ""too busy"" that day, it's my fault that Lisa was unable to attend. 

TL/DR - I wanted to take her by myself. She said no, she's coming too. I said, fine, you take her. She said, no, you bring her and if you don't you're the parent at fault.

1956,Not the A-hole,"We're both 22, and been together 7 months and ever since I started bringing her around my group of friends she started to poke fun of one of my boys for being short. He's like 5'5 on a good day but we don't ever really make fun of him ever for it because its just a shitty thing to do. She did though and would say he's a midget in most countries, can he drive without a booster seat etc. All this stuff infront of our group of friends when we're out and at first we laughed of course but it got super weird when she kept saying shit like almost every time we hung out. He would usually just laugh along or just say you bitch jokingly but I could tell it got to him of course because it was getting to be too much. I spoke with her about this and she just said she was trying to be one of the boys and it was just banter, but I told her if its just banter why don't you joke about any of the other guys then? She just said short guys are more funny to poke at and shit like that, I told her straight up to not do this shit anymore after like 2-3 months of it. My short friend went away on a semester abroad and came back about a month ago so we all went out since we haven't seen him in a while and my GF came along and she starts with the short jokes, it gets so awkward because she's insulting his height for no reason. My other friends leave with my shorter one to hit up a different bar and I told my gf we should go to my place and talk.

When we got to my place I was pretty annoyed she'd act this way still and told her how would she feel if I made fun of one of her chubby friends for being fat and she said its not the same thing and other bs. She had a smirk on her face the whole time and that pissed me off so I just told her its done and to gtfo out of my place and to take her things. She started yelling and shit and said how could I break up with her over jokes with about a friend and I didn't want to hear it. She called me a dumbass douche and a variety of other insults.

After reading some of the comments, I realized what a selfish, immature asshole I was being. Also realized that I did not want to lose her despite my initial anxieties. I’m deeply ashamed of the original post, but I felt that I should update since it’s been a few weeks.

I apologized to my girlfriend for the way I acted. She forgave me, but things were different. She was not bringing it up anymore and I could tell she was still really hurt. I felt like shit, which I deserved. I decided to try to show her I’m ready to be supportive. I accompanied her to therapy a few times [not seeing the therapist myself, just waiting for her in the waiting room].  I started researching this topic trying to figure out how to handle it. I ask her about it and tell her I’m here if she wants to talk. I’ve been trying to do nice things for her around the apartment to show my support. I know it probably sounds ridiculous but I really wanted to make it up to her and had no idea how.

A few days ago we had a very long conversation where we laid everything out in the open. I told her why I was so distant at first and how I’m afraid to hurt her, and she told me how badly I made her feel. She told me a few stories about what she went through too along with telling me what she needs from me. It was really emotional. I think we are in a better place now. She seems to feel more comfortable around me again, which I am glad about. The idea of me attending therapy as well came up but sadly we don’t have means for that right now. She still attends twice a week.

As far as our sex life goes, it’s pretty much nonexistent. We have had sex one time since on Valentine’s Day, and it honestly wasn’t enjoyable for either of us. It does suck but I’m okay with waiting until she’s ready. 

I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little intimidated still because I am. I feel all the time like I need to be extra careful with her now which I know isn’t true. It’s gonna take some work for both of us. I appreciate all of the comments, good and bad, that made me wake up. She deserves a partner who has her back and I’m trying my best.

1959,Asshole,"My school had a blood drive today and I'm really passionate about donating blood.  My mom has had a couple of close calls in her life that were saved due to blood transfusions, and thus I get easily annoyed when people don't donate if they don't have medical, athletic, or religious excuses.  I try really hard to spread the word out in my school, so was irritated when I learned that my close friends didn't donate solely because ""they didn't feel like it.""  I told them that if they don't have an excuse like listed above, then the only reason they didn't donate was because of their own negligence and laziness when it came to finding the desire and time in their day. Keep in mind that our school gives excused absence for the classes we miss, and that you are free to donate anytime during the day, even after school, so that everyone can come during any free time. They said I had a superiority complex just because I donated, but they don't know that it has impacted my family on a more personal level.  My intention isn't to make them feel like bad people because they didn't donate, but just to drive home the fact that they could help save lives if they just took a few simple steps. 


Edit: Yeah it's pretty clear ITA.  I can never really see eye to eye with my friends and can probably never really understand their reasons for not donating, but at least I shouldn't guilt trip others.  Hopefully I can be in a situation where it's confortable enough for me to attempt to share my more personal stories with them. ",126,74,0.76

1963,Not the A-hole,"AITA for having my deaf-mute neighbours' dogs removed from the neighbourhood?

My parents and I live next to a deaf-mute couple who own two dogs. In the past we had no issue with them, but our neighbours have allowed their dogs to bark all day for HOURS ON END. Naturally due to the neighbours' deafness, they cannot hear their dogs barking and it simply continues....

When the issue first occured, we left a note in their mailbox politely explaining that my brother and father work jobs that require them to wake up early in the mornings and the incessant barking was becoming an issue. A week went by and we received no response, yet the barking continued. Eventually my mother contacted the father of the deaf-mute husband and explained the situation, his only response was to laugh and tell my mother ""your husband and son should just use ear plugs or sleep in different rooms"".

My mother decided to contact the local council about the issue. After about two months, the council issued a formal warning. The barking continued....

My mother contacted the father again abd explained our situation, the father explained in an irritated manner that ""the dogs are there to help his deaf-mute son and wife with their daily activities due to their conditiod, and that we should just put up with it"". We were confued, surely there is no need for their dogs to incessantly bark like that though? 

Eventually we sought mediation from the council, and the council ruled that one of the dogs be separated and live at the father's property. The neighbours were not happy but complied for a while.

This brings me to the present. I am starting to get fed up with the fact that the neighbours seem to pay no regard to us or the official warnings issued by the council.

So I took matters into my own hands.

Unhappy with the fact that the father neighbours are so inconsiderate and seemingly thinking that this issue is a big joke by laughing at us whenever they see us, I contacted the father myself this time. I explained to him that the barking has continued for months now despite our complaints, and how his son laughs whenever he sees us, I gave him an ultimatum.

They either adhere to the official orders ruled by the council, or I take the matter to the court. This did not sit well with the father, as he decided to abuse me over the phone calling, my family horrible people, stripping his disabled son and wife of their right to have dogs.

I filed for the court proceeding and the magistrate ruled both dogs off the premises as it was quite clear to her that the dogs were merely pets, rather than aids, as there was no paper-work to prove such a thing.

While we are happy with this outcome, we still cop abuse from the husband and dead-mute neighbours occassionally....

**TLDR on bottom**

2  years ago, in college, I helped this girl out by taking her lease(sub-lease) for a room. She had 3 months left. Lets call her Sarah.

We agreed on a move out/in date and notified the landlord. No big deal right? Well, 3 days before move in date, she texts me and says she has to stay for  another month because of a trip. I'm like wtf? My buddy has people  moving in and I have no where to put my things. On top of that, we agreed on a date.

Here's what she said:

Sarah: Well, we never had anything in writing and I need the room until mid June.

Me: Well, I really have no place to go, can we work something out if you're going to be gone anyways?

Sarah: I don't know, I have a lot of stuff and I leave right away.

Me: Wtf? Seriously? I'll be homeless and my friend has people moving in also. My stuff is all over his place.

Sarah: I'm not sure what your point is.

Me: We had an agreement. Can't you put it in storage?

Sarah: No. Sorry, but hey thanks for understanding.

Me: No.... I don't understand, what the actual fuck?

Sarah: Yea, you can talk to Bob(Landlord) about if there's an issue.

&#x200B;

Bob was no help. He basically said, since we have nothing in writing, she's still on the lease. I was pissed but what could I do? If I back out, it could be impossible to find a decent place.

So, whatever, I dealt with it and crashed on the couch for a month. I finally moved in. But, that's not all. A month later, she came by to  visit a room mate and bursts into my room without even knocking. I was just watching TV, no big deal, but still fucking rude and I know  she did it on purpose. She had a smirk on her face and was like ""Oops,  sorry."" And closed the door.

A few months further down, she came by and said she wanted to go grab something in one of my room mates rooms.

Me: Too bad, I can't let you just walk into someone's room while they're gone to dig around for something.

As she was about to explain herself, I slammed the door in her face with a big smirk on my face. She pounded on the door and said WTF, and of course, called me an asshole. I laughed and said, pound it once more  and I'll call the cops. She left quietly but complained to her guy friend. Later, he tried to give me shit about it but I'm like fuck that, if something disappears, who do you think everyone will blame? So, he let it go.

She cost me a shit load of hassle and trouble, I feel like it didn't really make up for it totally, but I don't feel bad at all.

I had to get a storage unit for a  month before I could move in. She even burst into my room without asking  a month after, while I'm there. A few months later, she comes by, I  didn't let her in and slammed the door on her face. She, of course,  called me an asshole.",22,81,0.88
1965,Not the A-hole,"So I feel a little backstory is necessary here. I (27M) been married to my wife (28F) for 4 years now. I've always had a good relationship with her parents, even if our personalities and views don't always align. My wife and I both work full time and we've always striven to be financially independent.

Recently my MIL got fired from her job, and has picked up 2 lower paying jobs to keep the light on etc. This was just the beginning. Things just got worse and eventually they had to file for bankruptcy. I really felt for them and my wife, but I just couldn't seem to wrap my head around how this happened.

So MIL starts hitting us up to borrow money. I had no problem with this. I came from a poor hard working family of farmers so helping each other out was a part of life. It started out small, $20 for gas here $40 for groceries.  Not soon after though the dollar amount began to increase, 100 bucks until payday for ""insert reason here"". I never felt any resentful for helping, but hearing her telling us she'll pay us back and never did started to get to me.

I knew something was up, I never suspected drugs (No real changes in appearance or attitude for what it's worth) but something had to of changed. I ask my wife if she would be willing to sit down with her mother and try to figure out what the problem is. So she leaves one night to go over and chat, hours pass and when she returns, her mother admitted to having a gambling problem. (Not as casino's, rather ""hot spots"" which are basically just a room with video slots and poker.) This honestly kind of shocked me, I don't want to see her and our family suffer.

Since this opportunity showed itself, my wife and I set up our cell phone plan under my name. Enter the in-laws, my wife told them about us getting on the plan and they immediately want on. I am VERY reluctant to say the least. The plan is in my name and since we haven't seen any of the money we've loaned out back, I feel like this will just increase our payments when they inevitably don't pay for their share. I feel this is my credit score we're talking about so I will have NO choice but to pay it no matter what happens.

I've tried to offer alternatives like setting them up on a pre-paid since I've never really had an issues, even offering to give them some old phones I have (nothing great but solid mid range devices). They don't like this idea and shunned the idea of having to downgrade even a little. This really rubbed me the wrong way so right there I said ""Well I don't feel comfortable at this time but I'm still more than happy to get you set up on prepaid. They were instantly pissed, but i don't care. My credit score is important to me and something I've worked hard on.

My wife is now stuck in the middle. I feel bad for her because she has a hard time saying no. I don't want her parents on my plan where I have a strong feeling I'll be paying their whole bill for 2 years. Am I the asshole??",22,66,0.97
1966,Not the A-hole,"We are both in our early twenties. I have been dating my fiancé (now ex, I guess) for 1.5 years. At first, our relationship was great. I thought I was so lucky to find someone like him. We moved in together after 5 months of dating. 

He then became more controlling and posessive. He would do crazy shit like smash my phone against the wall, lock me in the house, flush my birth control, etc. He even became physically abusive, e.g restrain me, choke me, slap me, etc. 

I was scared to leave him. But due to my low self esteem I thought he was the best I could do. That is why I accepted his proposal. He basically said “If you dont marry me you’re gonna end up dying alone.”

About 2 weeks later, he got deployed. His deployment is 3 months in length. Currently, we are precisely at the midway point. With him gone, I realized that I was much happier being alone than being with him. I started going out with friends again and having a life outside of work. I felt more happy and live than I had in months.

After a lengthy emotional talk with my family, I decided to break my engagement with my fiancé. 

We had been chatting via Skype and messenger for the past month pretty regularly. He gets angry if I don’t text him everyday. The last few days, I haven’t texted him at all.

Then, this evening, I decided to send tje following text:

> Hey. Sorry for not messaging you more this past week. I’m been really busy with work. I’ve also been thinking about us and I must admit I’ve had my doubts about our future together. 

>To be honest, I do not think we are right for each other. I’ve been thinking about all the times you’ve disrespected me, treated me like crap, not listening to what I wanted. I don’t need that. Life is too short to stay in a relationship that makes me cry everyday. 

>I’m moving my things out of the apartment tomorrow. You don’t have to worry about me, I’ll be fine on my own. I’m sorry if this was sudden. I think you are a great person and I’m sure you’ll meet a woman who you can respect and who can respect you. If you treat her better than you treated me, I’m sure she’ll stay. 

>I love you and I will be your friend always,
T

I thought it was a pretty nice, respectful message. But then he responded and went mental, calling me a whore and a liar and threatening to “hunt” me down when he came back. 

I told one of my friends about this whole thing and she was shocked that I ended my engagement via text. She said it was a “dick move” and that I should at least call him or break up with him in person. I told her the reasons why I could not do that, but still she said he deserved better and that he’s probably heartbroken right now. She really made me feel like shit.

1967,Asshole,"Before jumping to any conclusions, here’s the backstory and where I’m at:

We’ve been together for 4 great months. She’s a great girl and I’m so happy with her. But, one flaw: she never reaches out to me.

I call/text her everyday just saying hi and seeing how she’s doing. You know, “boyfriend”, type stuff. And it’s easy for me to do when I truly care for her. After 3+ months I started getting annoyed. Realized she has never called me ONCE. I repeat, NOT ONCE. I know she really cares for me and wants to talk to me, so it baffles my mind why she won’t reach out. So, I started waiting to text her - i went crazy. I felt this unspoken tension the whole day and i knew she was waiting to hear from me. She eventually texted me, late at night (midnight) just saying goodnight and she hopes everything is okay. I said goodnight and said everything was good. Come the next day, no message until late, again. I opened up and told her how I feel like I’m the one reaching out all the time and I get no initiation from her. I told her I just want to feel more, “wanted”, and a simple text/call during the day could do all that and more. When I told her all of this, she replied:

“Hey, sorry if I dont text/ call you enough. I’ve never been good with that stuff but I’m going to try and work on it 🙂 I appreciate you always making an effort to talk to me. It’s dumb but I always think “I’ll just let him call me when it’s convenient for him so I know I’m not bothering/interrupting him” I know I can always talk to you if theres an issue and trust me, I had every intention on talking to you about whatever was going on at some point today. I want you to know you can do the same with me!! Even though it was only 1 day it was so not like us not to speak so my mind was racing automatically thinking the worst (typical me) and so I made myself so upset/sick over the fact that something was possibly not right. Sorry if any of this sounds dramatic but its 100% the truth. I just care about you A LOT and I want you to know! With all that being said, no need to not talk to me until I talk you anymore, I get it now and will make more of an effort 🙂”

I felt great reading that. So relieved. But, 2 days have passed and she hasn’t reached out all day. Of course, I could reach out to her. The phone works both way, I know that! But, I want to see if she really meant what she said.

Side note: She’s a quiet girl. An absolute DIME, but very to herself. So much so that this girl is a 10/10 but I’m her FIRST boyfriend at 21 years old. Maybe she’s new to the whole relationship thing? But, still. She acknowledged it and said she’d change. But, seemingly hasn’t.

1970,Not the A-hole,"My now ex girlfriend lives with her sister, and I would often spend time with both of them and sometimes just her sister. For the first two years, I was madly in love with my ex and the sister was always supportive. We all got along besides small fights between my ex and I or my ex and her sister. 

However, after year two of dating, I started to notice some problems that my girlfriend and I had. Things like her not being as kind to me as I would have liked or her being very extroverted and me being very introverted. We would frequently have fights revolving around these issues.  Despite these issues, we were still working hard to rise above them and live happily (nothing worth breaking up over).

Now brings me to the meat of the problem. My ex girlfriend's sister was introverted like me and was much kinder to me and all people in general. Granted she had her own problems, but they were issues that never really bothered me. Because of this I saw myself falling for her sister. I still loved my ex at the time, but I couldn't stop my feelings over her sister. I also think it's important to note that I never acted on these feelings besides maybe some mild flirting that I quickly ended when I realized what I was doing.

I tried for multiple months to suppress these feelings and find ways to make me not be in love with her sister. I tried everything I could, but I finally decided I had to end things with my long term girlfriend. She was shocked and angry to say the least. I explained that it was because of the other problems mentioned before (partially true), but I never mentioned her sister. She was very angry with me saying it was abrupt and things were improving. I said how sorry it was, but it just couldn't do it anymore.

I have since cut off all contact with both her and her sister, and I have no plans to try to make a relationship with her sister. So reddit, AITA?",27,44,0.92

1974,Asshole,"Some backstory: I dated a girl back in 2016, let's call her A. We lived together fairly early on, and shared an apartment with my sister and her girlfriend. My sister and A got along well, but as far as I knew weren't best friends. Generally, my relationship with A was rocky. I had just come out as lesbian and this was my first actual relationship with a woman. Looking back, I realize that I was so excited to explore my newfound sexuality that I settled for the first woman that seemed interested in me, and that was definitely wrong of me to do. We moved in together out of necessity (her mother, who she previously lived with, skipped town and left her homeless). I went to school and had a job and it seemed like she didn't want to much other than watch TV, play video games, and stay at home. I felt like I had more of a lazy friend than a girlfriend. It isn't a relationship I look back on fondly. After about 9 or so months together, I decided it wasn't the relationship for me, I wasn't happy in the slightest, and it wasn't going to work out. I broke up with her, and she moved out of the apartment and to a different city about 2.5 hrs away. She would text me occasionally, making sure I definitely wanted to break up. I definitely did. Eventually, I blocked her. I thought that was that.

Fast forward to a couple months ago. I get a message from my sister asking if my current girlfriend and I would come to a 20-person surprise party she was planning on throwing for her fiancee in March. I say of course, count us in. After all is said and done, I get another message: ""Don't h8 me but A is invited too"". I was a little blindsided by this message, as I wasn't really aware that they were still in contact after A and I's relationship was over. I replied ""If you want her there, that's your decision. But my decision is that I'm not comfortable going if she goes. It makes me uncomfortable, and it's a weird situation altogether for both me and J (my current girlfriend).""

Now, I didn't mind not going to this surprise party. However, she then told me that I was going to have to get over it, because A is coming to her wedding (happening this summer) as well. The wedding is also going to be small, about 50 people so they can convey an ""intimate feel"". I feel I'm put in a bad predicament here. On one hand, I don't want to upset my sister and demand that she change her guest list so that I can feel comfortable. But, I want to be able to have fun. I also don't want to cause any sort of drama with my current girlfriend.

1975,Not the A-hole,"I’m going to be real brief. I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he’s actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. 

But I’m pregnant with his child. I am hiring an attorney to guide me through the child support process.

He is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn’t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don’t even know how she found my number!

1976,Not the A-hole,"Long story TL;DR at the bottom. 
Kinda in a rush so writing it really quickly.

My friend somehow catfished me and got me to send nudes to someone I thought was a girl.

He shows the whole school my nudes and I don’t find out until the evening. When I found out I was with some friends and they got super angry at him and said if you want us to, we can beat him up.

I said “do whatever you want”, they did not touch him once but they came to his house and yelled at him a lot.

He got angry at me for “sending them at him” and “he could have gotten hurt” and his excuse was “it was all just a joke and then someone overheard me talking about it and made me show the pic”.

Am I the asshole here? I can’t be?

TL;DR: My friend catfished my nudes and said that it is my fault that people are angry with him for it.

1978,Not the A-hole,"This happened a while back but it still bugs me to this day, you guys let me know if I'm the asshole.

So my mother's cleaning lady and I were friends, when I got home from school we would chat a little bit. She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.

With this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.

Luke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. 

So the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.

Luke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed ""What the fuck! this is all Chink food!"" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself ""what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace"".

After an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.

The girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.

The next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?",158,1556,0.93
1979,Not the A-hole,"Me and my friend (lets call him Ian) have been pretty close for the past two semesters at college. We talked almost everyday and hung out with mutual friends together all the time. A month ago Ian met my boyfriend for the first time, and the day after sent me a series of really weird texts, one of which insulted my boyfriend by comparing him to a really unattractive character in a movie. I asked him why he was acting so weird and he wouldn't tell me. 

Eventually a couple of mutual friends told me that Ian has had a big crush on me for awhile and that I was the only one in the dorm hall that didn't know. It's been a week and Ian and I haven't really spoken to each other because its been so awkward, but I've been hearing weird things that he's done or said. For example, last Wednesday he refused to talk to anyone and was only using sign language. I've also been told that he said ""Well MooseLand's boyfriend is a senior so they're not going to last long. I'm not giving up"".

Today he texted me and asked if I was upset because he insulted my boyfriend. I said ""I mean it definitely wasn’t cool, but I’m upset about other things as well"". He apologized for the lack of communication and then followed the apology up with ""on the flip side though, you probably could have done a better job communicating what was going on with (boyfriend)  months ago. I think you were a little naive/unrealistic about what was happening"". I explained to him that my boyfriend and I only started dating in January and that I told him about my boyfriend multiple times. I also said that I had zero idea that he was attracted to me. The final text he sent me was ""Oh wow. Literally everyone in (Dorm Hall) knew I had feelings for you, I assumed you did too. My bad. I guess I took things wayyy too slow.

1984,Not the A-hole,"I'm normally a good tipper.  20% is normal, but I'm OK with more depending on the situation.  

Yesterday, I booked a spa package for my wife and MIL.  Relatively nice place, with treatments costing north of 200 bucks each.  As I'm talking, the woman on the phone taking the information lets me know there is a ""living wage surcharge of 3%""

Here's the AITA bit.  I usually tip well, as noted, but when there is a *mandated tip* (such as for a party of 8 or more), that's all you get.  If you charge me 15% percent for my party of 8, or a 10% for a ""service fee"", well, that's what you wanted so that's what you get.  I'm not going to tip on top of a mandated tip.  I'm not even going to pay the difference between the mandated portion and what I would have paid otherwise. 

The ""living wage surcharge"" is just galling.  If you are forced by law to (or simply want to) pay your employees more, that's your issue.  If you want to pass the costs on to the consumer,  fine.  Raise your prices like every other business does.  If you present me with a ""surcharge"", I'm treating that as a mandatory tip.  

I feel bad for the masseuses, because a 3% tip sucks, but I feel like it's their employer who fucked them over, not me.  Besides...assuming they are now getting a ""living wage"", which is reasonably inferred from the presence of the surcharge, it's not like they are one of those workers whose compensation scheme is based upon tips, right?",130,242,0.94

He began lecturing me like I was a child on making more time for them and that as the eldest I should be looking after them. He's from Iran and told me he took care of his parents up until their deaths and I should be doing the same and if I'm not doing that as the eldest I would be seen as a bad son if I was Iranian. 

I'm not usually one to get angry at something like this but lack of sleep and this random guy talking down to me annoyed me enough that I snapped at him and told him to fuck off and mind his own business.

1986,Not the A-hole,"Yesterday Me and my girlfriend of 2 years got into an argument about our relationship. We both are in our 20’s and we live together. 

What sparked the argument was me trying initiate a intimacy night with her. She said to me she wasn’t feeling well and I respected her choice. I decided to get some sleep and just lay on my side of the bed, she knew something was getting to me because I usually hold her when I sleep.

I told her that I wanted to have some alone time with her because it’s been a day we both are free and able to fully enjoy each other’s company. She has a Gall bladder issue and is soon to get it removes due to it causing her not to feel well and she reminds me she doesn’t feel good. Sometimes it doesn’t affect her at all and when I do try to initiate when she’s not feeling like crap, she turns me down and I’ll just accept that and move on and hope for another time however being turned down over and over just takes a toll on me. 

She asked me about my feelings and I just tell her what was on my mind. yesterday I took her out to have fun together because we rarely do, due to our work schedules and time. She works 12 hour shifts 3-4 times a week and I work a regular 40 hour work week, sometimes working on the weekends. She tells me that the only reason I took her out that day was to get “something/sex” in return and this is what I told her. 

I told her that I took her out that day because we rarely spend time together due to work, you deserved to be treated out because you work hard, I do things for you because I care and love you and I don’t expect nothing in return like making you breakfast every morning because I love you and I want you to come home to a meal and not starve when you just worked a 12 hour shift. I clean the house because I know you are tired working. I do all the chores around the house because I know you don’t feel good, I do small tasks for you like getting you a drink from downstairs or Microwaving popcorn so you can watch your tv shows because you mean the world to me and I will do anything for you. I don’t do things to get “something” in return, I do things because you mean something to me.  

I then proceeded to tell her how I don’t feel cared about, I told her, you don’t say I love you to me unless I say it first, you don’t text me how my day is unless I text you first, you don’t initiate sex unless I do, you don’t do small tasks for me when I ask for it, i.e grabbing a soda from downstairs for me. You don’t take me out or treat me in anyways like I feel cared about unless it’s a holiday. 

After I told her all that, she just said she was sorry and I just left for work and now I feel like an asshole for telling her how I feel.

1987,Not the A-hole,"So. This happened almost 2 years ago. I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. 

Kinda long, so I apologize. 

So, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. 

The night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. 

My husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. 

When I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. 

About an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, ""well....it was on the calendar"". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. 

So. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. 

Edit to add: I absolutely realize my failure in not checking the calendar.  I didnt add, because this got so long and wasnt sure anyone would read it, so I sort of summerized. However, the part that upset me most, was his teacher did not think it was a good idea, and suggested I be called back. The director said no, and that he needed to ""get used to them"". So, I added this as an edit, as its come up a bit in the comments. 

Last edit: Thank you for ALL the feedback. I've honestly gone back and forth on this for awhile, and hearing both sides has been really refreshing. There is no book to prepare for parenting, or even life in general.  Sometimes, things happen, and we react in the most innate, downright raw manner. I recognize my shortcomings in this situation, and I hope to move forward with the knowledge to do better in the future. Again, thank you all. ",140,506,0.94
1988,Asshole,"So at the beginning of our relationship a year and 3 months ago, we discussed to each other what's wrong with our Instagram, and I complained about the people she's following (over 1k people) and eventually she deleted her account. There wasn't much wrong with my account since I only followed people I know in person etc (around 50 people) but I did uninstall it.

Recently we took a break for about a week and we both got Instagram back, her creating a brand new account and me using my old one. She started talking about some people she follows and I went to investigate. She's following exes of hers, people I told her not to have any contact with (because they  tried to get in the way of our relationship or flirted with her etc) and again, a shit tonne of people she doesn't know.

1989,Not the A-hole,"Dated this girl for about 6 months nearly 10 years ago. We were both undergrads at the time. She was diagnosed bipolar with a history of substance abuse and risky behavior, and I was not the most stable college kid either. I didn't find out about the diagnosis until after we started dating.

Given this, I'd say the relationship went about as expected. We got together and had a blast doing all of the dumb, impulsive things that undergrads do.

She ended up cheating on me on a trip out of town one weekend. I tried to forgive her, but the relationship deteriorated quickly from there. We split up a month or so later, and she immediately slept with a few of her old friends and made sure to tell me about it. She'd then get fucked up at a party and call me to come pick her up and take her back to my place.

So, being the smart, mature dude that I was back then, I willingly participated in this shitshow for a few months. She would occasionally talk about getting back together (which I did want back then), but then would flip and shame me for staying in her life and stop talking to me for a while, only to repeatedly initiate contact. This went on for a few months after the breakup.

Eventually I graduated, got a job, and moved out of town. She continued to contact me with the whole I miss you and also I hope you die thing. She would occasionally tell me that I was a shitty person to her and that I should apologize. So I did apologize several times for my admittedly shitty behavior during and after our relationship. I tried to sever communication, and really went through a period of reflection and self-improvement, to ensure that the shitty actions of my youth didn't carry over into my adult life and hurt anyone else.

So I end up meeting someone, and the relationship gets pretty serious. When this news reaches my ex, she goes ballistic. Once the threat of her doing something to herself settled down, she again starts emailing me with the same stuff. I realize that I should have blocked her, but after several threats and serious attempts, I was afraid she would try something. After several years of this, I get engaged. A few nights before the wedding, she contacts me again asking me to admit to her that I hurt her. I ask her to kindly fuck off, telling her that I'm getting married and that she needs to come to terms with the fact that we'll never be together.

That was over 3 years ago. The other day, I get an email (on a new email address that I know she got from one of my ""friends"") from her asking how I'm doing and asking me if I ever realized that I was a shitty person to her, because she needed to know that I realized it.

So Am I still The Asshole? Should I continue to feel bad about something that happened almost a decade ago in University, despite repeatedly apologizing, trying to learn, grow, and be a better person because of this, and repeatedly trying to sever communication with this woman?

1991,Not the A-hole,"I'm 21 and in college, my brother is 26, and has recently become a police officer. I'm pretty left and he's fairly right and we both sort of have always had an unspoken pact not to discuss these things around each other because both of us have strong disagreements. I've heard him some stuff I'd strongly disagree with over earshot, but nothing that a super large chunk of the country doesn't also believe in.

My older brother and I used to be very close and we have drifted a bit, mainly due to the way we view each other as people. I came out as gay a little way ago and am sort of naturally very soft-spoken and effeminate and he's a ""macho guy"" stereotype in a lot of ways, not to oversimplify. There are a lot of ""small"" issues I've had with him on my frequent weeklyish home visits. We get along better on the phone where we talk once or twice a week, basically entirely about baseball, our only real shared interested.

Otherwise, he says shit I find gross, he can be condescending/paternalistic, he has pulled me over three separate times as a ""joke"" as I was driving back home, scaring the shit out of me each time.

In truth though none of these are the ""real"" reason. Last time I was home we were playing a family game of rummikub and basically he told a story about how he pulled a guy over with his wife and one year old child in the backseat, basically scared him into agreeing to let him search the car, and then arresting him for an absurdly low amount of MJ. (like, a joint's worth, if I understood correctly). He went into great detail about how the guy and his wife were both sobbing while it happened and trying to tell him how it was medicinal and he (my brother) said the whole thing with this great smile on his face. 

I don't want to sound dramatic but it was so fucking crazy. I kept thinking that it sounded more like a fisherman talking about catching a fish than a human being. He laughed and threw in jokes about and mentioned that the people were visibly poor (shitty car), and he still did it and didn't sound remorseful. It wasn't like ""oh, i don't agree with it but it's the law, sorry"", it was ""lol then I took them to jail, I managed to trick him into agreeing to the search, I win the game! fifty points!"".

I have never smoked but I have a good friend I met in college who has a chronic physical condition and who smokes regularly and says that it has basically allowed him to live. I kept thinking ""man, you'd do that to my friend, you'd do that to anyone"". Like he's fine with totally ruining lives over nothing.

I haven't spoken to him in two weeks without an explanation beyond ""I don't want to talk rn"". I feel completely disconnected from him as a person and I honestly don't see how I could reasonably separate what he proudly does for a living while giggling and him as ""my brother"". It's so shitty and blatantly evil.

1992,Everyone Sucks,"I (36M) was married to my wife (same age) for 6 years until she passed away in March 2016. Quick backstory - we met while I was deployed to Iraq in 2008 (former USMC, she was with an NGO), and it just sort of happened. It was a pretty intense time in both our lives, and we didn't intend to stay together after all was said-and-done, but I couldn't let it go. After the tour was over, I took leave, went to Belgium (where she's from) and basically said I loved her and wanted to make it work. We got married the next year, and we have a daughter (8F).

I took it hard when she passed away from pancreatic cancer. I've been through a fair bit in life, haven't had issues with PTSD from my time in the service (somehow), but when she died I just lost it. Lost a ton of weight, quit exercising, drank a lot. It went on like that for a year, until my parents and friends basically were like, ""Ok, JetBlueWaffle, time to get your shit together and move on.""

Her sister (33F) moved to the US, and is staying in our house. She just started a new job, and I offered her the room so she could save more money before she got her own place. We get along really well. She (as well as that entire side of the family) was really supportive when my wife passed.

Anyway, a few nights ago, we had sex. I didn't really intend on it, but we'd been having a lot of wine, etc... She was complaining about her boyfriend back home, I was talking about how it's hard to date and manage work, and we did it. All things considered, it was enjoyable.

But sure enough, later that night she texted me saying that ""The guys at the party say I'm too drunk to talk to you.""

I called Anna and told her that I felt like she was standing me up, and that if I didn't see her that night than we were done dating. She insisted we weren't over yet and would talk another day, but continued to refuse to meet up. I told her we were done, said goodbye, and hung up.

I didn't hear from Anna the next day but that afternoon a mutual friend called me and told me Anna was ""super depressed and scared."" And told me I should go to her house to check on her. I went because I still cared about Anna and I was worried about her. When I got there Anna was crying and started hugging me and kissing me and telling me how she still wanted to be with me. She never told me why she was so depressed but I could tell I was making her feel better so I spent the next few days with her. During that time, we hung out, had sex twice, and mostly just enjoyed each others company.

Despite the fun we were having, the way she stood me up when we were supposed to talk really bothered me, so I finally insisted we talk about our relationship. During that talk, Anna never told me why she wouldn't meet up that night, but eluded that something happened. At that point I bluntly asked if she had sex with someone that night, and she told me she did, but not until after our conversation on the phone. (She didn't use protection either) I told her how hurtful that was to me, but that I wasn't surprised because she cheated on her last boyfriend. (Which is true) She got very upset when I said that and insisted she wasn't in the wrong for her actions. I understand that I ended things with her on the phone that night, but I feel like the way she acted like nothing happened when I saw her the following day, telling me she loved me and wanted to be with me, and having sex with me, was wildly inappropriate. Had I known that she had slept with someone else I certainly would not of spent the following week with her. She purposefully kept that a secret so as to not upset me and avoid making me not want to be with her. I ended everything with her after that. So, am I the asshole for feeling like I essentially got cheated on?",395,1517,0.96
1994,Asshole,"I’m 29 and my now ex boyfriend, Justin is 20. We had been dating for a little over a year. I’m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. 

I met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he’s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.

Don’t get me wrong Justin’s nice, he’s attractive, and he’s good in bed, but I just don’t love him like he does. He’s just young and too emotionally immature. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I’ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn’t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he’s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he’d find another girl, but he wouldn’t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. 

Am I the asshole? ",109,39,0.64
1995,Asshole,"Pretty short story. This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. 

&#x200B;

   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be.

   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?",320,400,0.91
1996,Not the A-hole,"Three weeks ago, my parents asked my to help them with cleaning and working on the roof of their second house they want to sell. I told them that I would try to get off work that day but there was no guarantee. I tried to get anyone to cover my shift, but no one could, not even my boss. I told them the day before that I couldn't come. Ever since then they have been very angry with me, and will be taking my truck tonight. This will disable me from working my two jobs. So, AITA for not wanting to skip my job and help my parents?

Background: I'm a 21 year old college student who works two jobs doing around 50-55 hours a week every day with hardly any day/time off. I live with my friends in an apartment. Parents also work all the time, and have little free time.

Background 2: I wanted to take this semester off, to save money and work on myself and come back in the summer semester. Parents blackmailed me into going to school by threatening to take my vehicle. It's still under their name for insurance purposes even though I payed them fairly for it 5 years ago. I have to pay the school for the classes I'm taking. My parents disagree with my lifestyle (they don't like my girlfriend or liberal mindset) and are trying their best to control me and keep me in college. I want to learn and graduate soon, I just needed to save more money to keep going. Now I'm working too much to even focus on classes I'm paying for this semester.",19,37,0.89
1997,Everyone Sucks,"I work on a team for a semi-large computer networking firm. My team comprises of me and about 7 others including our boss. This team is one of the ""Upper"" management teams. All of us have masters in comp sci or computer engendering with my boss having his doctorate. We pretty much have final say in anything related to the network and oversee most of the workers and the day to day operation of the network. This is where Brian comes in.

about 3 months ago Brian was hired out of nowhere and brought onto the team. Quickly we found out that the kid was a fresh graduate from college with a bachelors in electrical engendering who was related to one of the owners. This already put him on the outs with us. Almost all of us had at least 4 years experience when we were hired or went through a rigorous hiring process. Outside of him needing his hand held for the first while or so, I tried to be optimistic and friendly with him. Tried is the key word.

He's gotten on almost everybody's nerves and has made sure to make himself the odd one out in every situation. He act's as if he's better than everyone else and makes you know that. This would be bad enough, but he quickly started to complain about how we talked too. In the office when it's just the team, we try to be casual with each other and most of us will swear or make ""inappropriate"" jokes. Well, soon after he was hired Brian went to our boss to try to get us ""reprimanded"" for, as he puts it, ""Inappropriate actions"". My boss pretty much told him to calm down but Brian has made it clear that he doesn't like it and we need to change. Whenever he hears us swear he gets very passive aggressive, making sure to ""fake swear"" with us (you know how like kids will?) and direct it towards the person he has a problem with.

There are multiple other problems with him as well like his immaturity and and weird views on the media but those are not my concern. Well, with everything that's been going on with him, me and my coworkers slowly decided to simply ignore him. When ever he would try to talk to us we would ignore him unless it was work related. We stopped eating with him, we stopped allowing him to join in on conversation with us, and we pretty much ignored him unless we needed to talk to him. Apparently this hit him hard. From what I understand he's called the heads crying about this multiple times and has complained to hr who refused to do anything. Along with this, without us constantly helping him he's taken a huge hit in performance. Apparently even though he's only been on a few months my boss says the heads are looking into terminating him due to his lackluster performance.

I do feel a little bad here, we did pretty much stop associating with him abruptly and we are his coworkers. But he shouldn't have been hired here either and he's extremely pushy with his views so I don't know. No one on the team want's to talk about it so I'll just ask here, Are we the assholes here?",80,109,0.89
1998,Not the A-hole,"So, recently my boss has been getting pissy recently about some employees taking ""extended lunch breaks"" as well as leaving work up to an hour early. Our lunch break is already pretty long, an hour and a half, and we and our work hours are 8 hours in total including the break. So, I totally understand where he is coming from.
HOWEVER... I have always taken my lunch break and napped in my car instead and just ate lunch after work. Eating mid work always makes me very tired for the second half. Today boss was walking through the parking lot during lunch and walked by my car and saw me napping and knocked on my window and proceeded to make a big fuss about how I was sleeping in my car when I should be at work. I explained that I was on my lunch break and that napping helps my productivity more than eating but, he just left me with, ""Your lunch break is for eating and you should go back to work when you are finished eating not when the lunch break is over."" Am I the asshole for taking a nap instead of eating lunch?

EDIT: Lots of people commenting on the fact that my lunch break is 90 minutes. I should have made a preface that in the U.S. military we are normally given 90 minutes because everyone on post takes lunch at the same time and most people eat on post or at least close by, out of convenience. This can make for quite a long wait for food. My typical day is definitely not 6.5 hours long.",158,570,0.97
1999,Not the A-hole,"Howdy, y’all. 

So about a year ago, these 3 gals moved into an apartment in our building. We actually moved from that unit, to another in the same building. The ended up pushing their move-in date a week earlier, and bringing their parents to make demands on their behalf, but were generally polite despite requiring we suddenly clean up a week early for them. 

Since then, they’ve taken to ignoring us on the street. We’ve all just tried to be neighborly, but have since given up wasting time on it. The building is in a more expensive part of town, quite “unique,” and the rent is incredibly low. So “it is what it is” has become the motto for this dilapidated gem. Now, about the note...

It’s their first apartment. They’ve had issues with taking out trash for nearly their entire time here. While there are cans on the roof, most of us just go ahead and take our trash down to the dumpster. The place is owned by an older couple, and having the husband drag our trash all the way downstairs is something we and other tenants would prefer to avoid. Besides, there’s much more important work to be done around the place. 

But these gals can’t even be bothered to bring their trash outside. They just let it pile up outside their door, inside the building, and stink begins to fester. So the owner eventually hauls it all the way outside and downstairs himself. I found him doing this one day, fumed over it for the night, and we wrote a note the next morning. It read;

>	“Look-
    Leaving your garbage up here is *trashy*. Leaving it up here to rot & stink up the building is disgusting. But- making it such a problem that other people have to take care of it is **fucking shameful**. Get your shit together, ladies. 
Sincerely,
  Who cares, take care of **your** shit.”



I feel kinda bad. The wording was strong. But the trash is gone. AITA?",439,5244,0.96
