0,Asshole,"Hi reddit! My girlfriend just moved to the City for a job and is staying in a dorm style apartment. She got a random roommate from out of the country and while she isn’t the most talkative, she keeps to herself and hasn’t been a problem. 

My girlfriend texted her a few weeks ago asking if I could stay over, in which she responded that she “doesn’t feel comfortable with an unknown man staying the night”. Now when my girlfriend texted her, I had already met her on several vacations, gone out with her, showed her around helped her explore the city etc. So I’m definitely now just a random man. However we respected her wishes and I didn’t stay that night. 

This upcoming week my girlfriend had won tickets to see a show that we have been trying to see for a long time. The show requires you to stand in line at 6:30 am, and the train from my house into the city is over an hour long. My girlfriend confirmed the rules with her dorm staff that you didn’t need permission for overnight guests from your roommate (something she had checked before picking this place for reasons like this) and texted her roommate in advance to let her know that this particular night I would be staying over. Her roommate replied basically saying that we are disrespecting her culture and that my girlfriend should have “tried to convince her to let me stay” when in reality she doesn’t even have to give her any sort of notice. 

So reddit, WIBTA if I stayed over?",61,64,0.91

3,Not the A-hole,"I go to university in a pretty big city and while I usually stay close to campus I like to venture off it. On Saturday I (F19) matched with a lovely lady (F18) and we agreed to meet today for coffee. She was not from the university but a local, which was fine by me. After coffee we walked around for a bit and it turned out she was walking me to her house, where she invited me in. I wasnt going to turn her down and she and I began to get physical.

I felt very comfortable with her, she respected my boundaries in everyway and slowly but surely I felt happy enough to start really getting into it, but within about 10 minutes her doorbell rings. Turns out her babysitter had brought back her son and dropped it off to her. At that point my date wanted to continue but I really wasnt comfortable dating someone with a child. I found it awkward and a huge step outside of my comfort zone. So when my date decided to try and ""start again"" i told her I didnt feel comfortable having sex with a mother. When asked for an explanation why I wasnt able to give one other than me saying ""i cant explain it im just not comfortable."" She tried to start again one last time by making a move to which i backed away. 

So my date then told me I should go home. Later tonight I got a text from her calling me heartless, and I later checked on tinder and she had unmatched me.",68,110,0.88
4,Not the A-hole,"Okay, so context is hugely important:

https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/comments/dcw9h9/best_friends_just_had_their_child_yesterday_and/

My friends had a baby, but doesn't look like he will make it. I've been covefing for him at work. Our company has been pretty good about letting him be with his family, the President just asked he carve out like ten minutes once or twice a week to call and give an update.

I've basically taken over his workload, which has been hugely problematic for a million different reasons. Namely, he codes in languages none of us are familiar with, so I've had to reverse engineer all of his work just to keep his programs afloat. Long story.

Last week, I stopped by his house because he'd asked me to come over, he just wanted company I think. As I was leaving, we briefly talked about work, I said I had a pretty good handle on things, just for him to keep me in the loop if he does anything, and that if anything, it was actually *easier* for me to manage his clients alone without his involvement (too many cooks in the kitchen, etc).

Today, I code a project for him up and send it for approval, the President CC's him on the email out of habit. Well, he winds up telling everyone to cancel the project, that he coded something completely different up lastnight, to just use that.

Well, the President replies to all, saying he needs to communicate better, that he basically just wasted a lot of my time (and, while I wouldn't bring it up, also the VP's time, because he had to help me with coding something). My friend then responds that he had ""already talked to me in-person, but didn't relay it in an email"".

My friend then shoots me a text, saying it ""wasn't the reaction he expected"" after staying up all night working on it. I said its fine, just to follow up with the President, that it sort of sounded like he was throwing me under the bus. He just texts back that he said we spoke, but he just failed to follow up by email.

I'll be honest, I don't see any way to take this other than, yes, he was throwing me under the bus to save face. Keep in mind, he is technically supervisor of our department. I've been stretching myself pretty thin, both covering for him at work (since nobody else is really capable of stepping up to do it), and also being there for him personally.

It just feels like a peak into how he actually views this friendship, that he'd throw me to the wolves before risking looking like he needs help or acknowledging he made even a trivial slip up. Our company isn't even *asking* him to work, just to keep us informed if he does, or give some basic guidelines to the people covering for him.

I'm obviously not going to raise the issue again. It feels like I just need to mentally remove him from the ""friends"" category and plant him firmly as a ""coworker"" in my mind. We've been friends for like 12 years (only coworkers for past two), but it definitely felt like he exploited that friendship just to make me look like the issue here.",27,28,0.88
5,Asshole,"Backstory:

So my son (15M) already has had hair loss. We don’t know why or how, but the whole top of his head has no hair. He has a really bad bald spot. It occurred over the summer. He just has some on the lower back of his head and everywhere but the top of his head. We bought him a durag to wear to cover up his bald spot. He wore it to school, and the principal yanked it off his head and confiscated it. He then called us in for a meeting about my son’s behavior (wearing the durag), calling it “inappropriate”. I told him my son had alopecia and just wanted to cover up his bald spot. The principal wouldn’t budge, so I chewed him out. I was pissed that my son had to go to school looking like that, since he’s already pretty embarrassed about having the bald spot in the first place. AITA for chewing out the principal?

EDIT: so I’m gonna point this out: I had a doctor’s note and showed it to the principal (school policy states you can wear headgear with a doctor’s note) but the principal didn’t budge

EDIT 2: I’ve confirmed it with the doctor they say it’s alopecia",648,2921,0.96
6,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I are getting a divorce. Without bogging the story down with unnecessary details, we’d been in couples therapy for a while and one day we were in there and she said this isn’t working and I want a divorce and I said I wanted to make it work and she said she was not interested in that and that was that. 

I own a cleaning company. I’ve been doing my wife’s sisters small business for free since we’ve been married. 

Once we were formally divorced I shut off this service. 

She called to complain the maids hadn’t come and I said I thought she’d realized that since her sister and I had been going through a divorce for the last few months that she should be making other arrangements. 

She said I didn’t give her any notice and she didn’t have a cleaning service in her budget because she’s been using me for years. 

I said I could make some recommendations for cheap, reputable people in the area. She said she needed a few months more to get the money together to hire a new service.

I said no can do. I’ll be completely honest, half of it was that without my wife’s income alongside mine I am making less now and need the income from a paying customer in that time slot, but I also don’t want to have to deal with anything on a weekly basis that reminds me of the divorce. It’s been painful and long and I am desperate to put all aspects of it behind me. 

But I didn’t tell her and I should have, I realize, formally discontinued she service. So, am I the asshole?",279,1053,0.97
7,Not the A-hole,"Edit 2: y'all I suck and am a shitty wife. I'm so used to him using all the data that I didn't check the last 4 of the phone number. It was my brother this time. I owe my husband an apology and a case of beer. 

Edit: thanks for the suggestion to use an mp3 player! I totally forgot those existed! That solves my data issue entirely! 

Ok, here me out. We have a family plan with my brother, my mom, my husband and I. Every now and again we would run out of data, but for the most part we stayed at our limit. I get a discount on our plan due to my job and right now an unlimited plan through Verizon is not feasible. 

My husband started a new job in August. Ever since we have been running out of data with days left in the month. I will purchase an extra GB and he'll use it in 2 days. I've talked to him about it, tried to get him to monitor his usage, tried to reason with him, but yet he continues to go above and beyond each month. 

For context, we have 12 GB shared between 4 of us. If my mom uses any data she uses about 1% each month. My brother and I each use about 3 GB. My husband uses over 6 GB each month.",75,37,0.78
8,Not the A-hole,"Hi all, I’m looking for honest advice and I thought this would be the best place to get it.

So I got engaged recently and my friends and family want to celebrate. I work weekends so I’m always pretty busy but I had two dates that would be the best time for a dinner or something like that since me and my fiancé don’t want anything too big. We said we would be happy with a few drinks and not a party with lots of people, we only wanted something low-key since we’re both not really outgoing people.

That was fine, I told my parents and my mom picked one of the dates. To be very clear, it was agreed that this would be a dinner with only close family on my side, just a dinner with drinks and nothing else.

Then a couple of days ago, in front of most of my close family, my mom announces that we’re having a party in our house which includes my family and my fiancé’s. Everyone is really excited about it and my sister asks if she can invite her friends as well. Me and my fiancé are taken aback and don’t really know what to say and since I’ve been put in an awkward situation, I kind of agree to keep everyone happy.

I talked to my mom later privately and told her again we didn’t want a big party and she agreed, saying it wasn’t going to be “that big”. I asked how many people would likely be going and she said as many as you want, then listed off all the people on my side that would want to come. I tried to explain that my fiancé’s close family is quite big and they would not all fit in our house (We both still live with our parents but are trying to move out soon) but she kind of brushed it off and said that we could invite whoever we want.

Now this thing we didn’t want is growing arms and legs. My sister is inviting her friends who are wanting to get their hair professionally done for the party when I’m not even going to that effort myself. A distant family member is coming over from another country and people I barely know from distant parts of my family are asking if I’m having something and giving me very generous engagement presents. It made me and my fiancé feel quite uncomfortable to say the least.

I just want to say that we do appreciate that people want to celebrate the fact we got engaged and it’s nice of them to sort of organise something for us but not to this extent. We would probably have to book a venue and catering for all these people going now and we really don’t want to spend massive amounts of money since we’re trying to save.

My fiancé says we should just cancel everything and tell everyone the party is off but I’m more reluctant since I don’t want to offend anyone. So we’ve decided to take it to reddit because we’re both suck on what to do and how to handle this without coming off as complete assholes. 


So, would I be the asshole if I point blank cancelled this unwanted engagement party?",23,55,0.94

10,Not the A-hole,"   My siblings and I (M27, M22, F18) didn't grow up with much money. My mom always worked the extra mile to provide as best as she could, but couldn't afford to take us on vacations and stuff we always cherrished as a family.

   She's been in a new commited relationship for almost 8 years now. Her boyfriend is filthy rich, and my mom is finally doing pretty good for herself too. I like the guy, but have the feeling he doesn't like me or my brother much for holding contrasting view points. They belong to a very conservative generation in a very conservative city. My sister is more aligned with their views.

   He has 3 sons of his own (M27, M24, M21), and for the last few years they've all gone on plenty of vacations that mom's boyfriend paid for. He takes everyone, including his son's girlfriends, but my brother and I. I didn't take it personal at the beggining, but soon realized we just weren't considered part of the new dynamic as my sister was. As if this wasn't hard enough, their longest trips are mostly during Christmas and New Years. 

   I tried confronting my mother about our feelings on the situation a couple months ago. She told me that she's even offered to pay for our part, but her boyfriend doesn't even allow that. He says that his oldest son just doesn't accept us (which I know to be true being the POS he is, honestly), and that he wants his son to have a good time, therefore we are not invited. My mom's boyfriend is pretty controlling, so I'm sure we would be invited if it was his will. Basically, his son is just an excuse.

   My mother feels for us, just not enough to stand against her partner. And deems me as a drama queen trying to deny my feelings. She low key knows the resentment that is growing in me and specially in my brother (M22) who still lives with her and is literally left alone each time.

   WIBTA if I sat mom down and and talked to her on how this makes us feel, potentially creating friction in her relationship? Or should I get my brother to go to therapy and accept my mom's cold hearted choice not to stand up for us? I could even pay for myself, this is not a money issue at this point.

   TLDR; My brother and I are left behind when family goes on vacation. WIBTA if I brought this up, risking putting pressure on my mom's relationship?

12,Not the A-hole,"Me and my boyfriend went to a hamburger restaurant and asked for our sandwiches. When it arrived, i asked if the waiter could bring some ketchup and mayonnaise for us (we're from Brazil, so it's often common here to eat our hamburgers with those souces). The waiter said that the establishment does not work with ketchup and mayonnaise, that it only has their own sauces. For me, it was fine, so i asked for their Provolone cheese souce instead. 

Okay, than we started eating our sandwiches, but than it became a thing: we think a hamburger and fries needs some ketchup to get a better taste. It's not that the hamburger taste bad w/o them, we just prefer with ketchup, we think it's a plus. 

After eating, we were paying for our meal and i asked why they don't work with ketchup. They explain that they want us to taste even more their own homemade sauces and the taste of the meat. I agree, it's their beliefs of what the client should appreciate in their hamburgers. But that would be awesome too if we had the chance to choose what kind of sauce we wanna eat with our sandwiches and fries, cause they would taste even better with them.

13,Asshole,"For context: my girlfriend and I are both in our 20's, and we've been together 6 months.

I recently got a great job doing R&D for a pharmaceutical company. My girlfriend never finished college and doesn't have a clear idea of what she wants to do with her career, and she currently works as a waitress at an Italian restaurant near where we live. Now I worked in food service when I was in high school, so I understand what it's like. People are rude, the wages are low, etc. However, my girlfriend's constant complaining about her job has really started to wear on me. My job is objectively harder, and I went through 6 years of brutally difficult school to get the degree that made it all possible. I've worked very hard for a very long time. I finally said what I've been thinking yesterday after she came over after work and started complaining yet again. I didn't say it in a mean way, but I told her that I have a difficult job as well and I was getting tired of her being so negative all the time. After she pressed me, I admitted that yes, my job is harder than hers. She got very upset, left, and has not spoken to me since. AITA?",131,208,0.85
14,Not the A-hole,"I am a 20 year old female. I work in an office building. My shift starts later than everyone else’s(11am vs 6-9am) as I handle incoming cases after hours. I leave at 8pm, after it gets dark. Usually by the time I get to work there is no parking available in our building’s lot. By the time I get back from lunch, I MIGHT find a closer spot if I’m lucky. That’s not usually the case however, so I end up parking in the adjacent lot. 

My problem is that every time my shift is about to end, without fail, my male coworkers INSIST on moving my car closer. It’s only parked a short, well lit, 2 minute walk away. I tell them no and they practically demand that I hand over my keys. It makes me uncomfortable because my car is not super clean and more importantly it’s in my mothers name. I used to work night time security in a relatively dangerous position so this walk does not bother me, what does is someone I barely know taking the keys to my car. 

My coworkers always get very upset when I try to be firm on my stance. They say it’s for my safety and it makes them feel better. I asked my dad for advice and he said I was being over dramatic and I should just let them move it without fighting them.

17,Not the A-hole,"I have an old friend who visits for coffee/drinks, occasionally lunch, every week or two. We both work as consultants and work from home with flexible hours so can do this whenever suits which is sweet, and I welcome the company during my otherwise fairly solitary workdays. 

However, I've started noticing that every visit, he goes to the bathroom and spends 20-30 minutes in there - clearly taking a dump - and uses a minimum of an entire roll of toilet paper. Not only this, but several rolls of paper seem to just disappear from the bathroom. No empty rolls in sight. This has started happening every visit.

I was so suspicious about it today, so, during a second toilet visit he made, I opened his bag to find two toilet rolls stashed that I'm sure were from our bathroom (they have a distinctive color/pattern that's not all that common). I was so furious about it I took them out of his bag and put them in a cupboard. I planned on asking him about it as soon as he came out but I was overtaken by rage, and then when he returned I was overwhelmed by doubt and embarrassment that I was being strange and unreasonable. I felt like I was going mad and I stupidly said nothing. I keep changing my mind about who is the bigger asshole. 

So he went home and is now probably wondering where his toilet rolls went, or he's worried about me posting this right here. 🤦🏻‍♀️

18,Not the A-hole,"I'm in high school and this girl Lauren was ""bullying"" me. I put bullying in quotes because she didn't do a very good job, it was more annoying and sad than actually upsetting.

I didn't even know this girl until gym class this year. We were playing volleyball which I suck at. She was on the other team so she should be happy I suck but she kept mocking me until I got pissed off and said ""shut the fuck up, it's just a game!"" 

From then on, Lauren decided that whenever she saw me she'd screech ""shut the fuck up!"" In my face and laugh stupidly, and if she couldn't get away with that she'd stare at me. It was obvious that she was staring because she would make direct eye contact and would sometimes move her head to keep watching me. It was really dumb, like something a little kid would do to scare someone.

After about a week of this, Lauren and I were in the locker room changing. I had my shirt off and I saw she was staring at me again. I knew it wasn't a sex thing, she's not into me, she was just being an asshole like she had been since volleyball. I still didn't like that she was staring at me without a shirt and I was really annoyed at how long this was going on so I yelled,""Lauren, stop staring at me while I'm not dressed it's creepy!"" Some other girls heard and looked over at us. Lauren yelled that she wasn't staring and that I was crazy, and nothing really happened, but the other girls were giving Lauren weird looks. I didn't think it was my problem what other people thought was going on. Lauren left me alone after that.

I told my parents sometime later, thinking they would think it's kind of funny/dumb story, but they were really upset at what I did. They said I could have really messed up Lauren's life by making people think she was sexually harassing me. They said that I either should have told the whole story to the other girls so they would know that Lauren wasn't really sexually harassing me, or told a teacher. I didn't say anything to the other girls because they're not my friends and it would be weird to just tell them all this stuff. I didn't tell a teacher because the teachers make a big deal out of bullying and make you go to mediation sessions and I didn't want to waste time on this stupid problem.

During and after college, I paid for all my own bills and my parents pretty much stopped supporting me because I can afford to pay for myself now.

22,Everyone Sucks,"Okay so I’m  a 23 yo male I’ve been at my job for 6 years and I feel as though I’m able to do anything that comes my way in relation to my job and have been praised by my boss for being a great worker. And I’ve had multiple promotions since I started. 

About 2 years ago they had the idea to hire a new guy to help out and keep the work load off me a bit, I thought it was a great idea but wasn’t too convinced I needed the help. 

Anyway, they hired this 40 yo guy that had no experience in this position what so ever and that’s fine but it was my job to teach him everything I know. As you can imagine it would of been a bit strange for a me in my 20s to tell a 40yo what to do and how to do it, so it was difficult to teach this guy I felt it was because of my age that he didn’t respect me as much and didn’t listen to much of what I was saying.

Well, recently I  found out that he is getting paid significantly more than me I was instantly furious! For two years I’ve been training this guy everything he knows and I feel completely stupid for only finding this out now. 

I went and spoke to my boss about this and the reasoning behind it was because of my age and the fact I have no kids. I went absolutely off! How can you pay someone based off their age and not their experience in the job and the fact I have no kids is not a valid reason to pay me less. 

I walked out and told my boss to go fuck herself. And told my co worker good luck managing the job by himself. 

Am I the asshole?

I have every right to stand up for myself. And the fact my boss thought it was okay to underpay staff she CAN go fuck herself. I’ve spoken to my lawyer and he is pursuing it further, I’ve even asked other staff that work there and they believe they are being underpaid as well.

26,Asshole,"So I live in a duplex on a busy road surrounded by shops. The two duplex’s are 3 bedrooms each and while they’re separate leases/ apartments my friend group of seven actually lives in all of the duplex. 3 in the left side and 4 of us in the right. My best friend and I share the biggest room on our side. 

So all seven of us have cars and we have one back yard that holds about 3 of our cars at a time. It’s usually just first come first served with the backyard tho. So the rest of us have to park on the street. 

Usually this is fine and there is usually parking but every once in a while someone will park directly in front of our house. Which honestly we don’t really care about but it can be annoying having to park a few blocks down to find free or non timed parking. 

So for the past few days a car has stayed parked in front of our house. We assume it’s someone that lives a few streets down but we really don’t know. I was honestly getting fed up though since I work nights and this usually means I’m the one having to park multiple blocks down at 4am and walk back to the apartment.

I talked to all my friends that share the duplex and asked if it would be cool if I put a note on the car asking them to keep their parking in front of our house to a 2 hour limit. Everyone agreed it be smart because someone of them have had to do the same and park far down. 

So I left the note and about 3 hours later a very angry man knocked on both our doors. Everyone that was home came to the door and he began screaming at us immediately. He told us we had no right to touch his car. I tried to apologize and explain but my friends began ganging up on him and threatening to call the police and lying saying we pay for the parking spots so he could get a ticket if we called. He left flicking us off.

I apologized to everyone and they said it’s cool but when I told my mom she said that he was right that I shouldn’t have touched his car and it was public parking. I feel really bad for causing a scene. AITA?

Also sorry for the grammar. English is not my first language.

When going to work there is a turn at the end of the street so that when my Ubers pull up, I get it on the driver’s side directly behind them, mostly because it’s the closest door and it would be weird to go all the way to the other side.  

However I’m also a little bit of an introvert and don’t like making conversation and I’m relieved sometimes that it makes it less likely for people to talk to me because they can’t see me. I don’t do it on purpose but I do like it.

I told one of my driving friends this and she got super mad, saying I was rude and disrespectful. I’m in someone’s car and using their property and sitting directly behind the driver when I’m the only person in the car is weird and disrespectful to the driver. I depend on them for a service so I should be respectful enough to stay in full view, especially since I am a stranger to them. Now I’ve never heard of this, but again I don’t drive. I told my godmother and she agreed with my friend. I told another friend and she agreed with me but she also doesn’t drive.

So reddit, I’ve come to you. Is it disrespectful to sit behind the driver if you’re the only passenger of the car?

EDIT: 

1. The problem seems to be that when I sit in the back, that sometimes I sit directly behind the driver. Not that I should sit up front.

2. I don’t actively choose to sit behind the driver. A lot of times when making the turn into my job it just ends up that the backseat behind the driver is the closest door.

EDIT 2: I see some people are saying it can make drivers feel unsafe and I will take that into account moving forward. But my friend seemed to think it was more of a respect thing, equating it to “disrespecting the man of the house” so that’s kind of where I was coming from. Your advice is helpful, nonetheless :)",73,116,0.91
29,No A-holes here,"So to start off, I’m an artist. Love drawing and painting, it’s been something I’ve done my whole life.

Recently, there’s been a lot of drama and debate over sexy art and drawing boobs and that sort of thing on Twitter recently, not sure if anyone here would have known about this or if it reached outside of artist circles at all. I’m a bisexual woman. I love drawing big honkin’ anime titties. I also draw porn sometimes. A lot of what I draw is in that general area.

Anyway, there was a post going around from a woman about people yelling at them for drawing sexualized art, and essentially telling them to go away and stop trying to police them. I shared it in a group chat we have, saying something along the lines of “I relate to this so much”, and another member of the group really took issue with the post. She went on a big rant, saying posts like that are just seeking male approval and being complacent with oppression. I fired back saying that I personally like drawing those same kinds of images, and don’t do it for anyone’s approval, it’s just what I enjoy. She then replied saying that my art was contributing to sexism and objectification and that she “hopes I can break away from that mindset” or something, and ended with saying I had internalized misogyny.

At this point I essentially told her to fuck off, and basically didn’t check or post in the group the rest of the day. I later got some messages from people asking me to apologize to her, that they get why I’m upset, but that it was just an opinion and she “meant well”. I pretty much refused unless she apologized to me for insulting me and my art.

I don’t think I owe her an apology. She insulted me and my art and insisted that I was brainwashed by men. So, am I the asshole here for not apologizing to her?",62,81,0.84
30,Asshole,"My brother in law is getting married next April. My wife and I have a daughter who will be 1.5 years old at the time of the wedding. Initially they had planned to make their wedding entirely no kids, but made an exception for our daughter as well as the daughter (1 year old) of the best man.

We were informed this weekend that the bride would like for me (as well as the wife of the best man and their daughter) to sit in the back row during the ceremony with my daughter so as to avoid any potential noise. My wife (who is included in the wedding party and will be standing up front during the ceremony) is pretty upset by this and feels that it is rude to ask direct members of the family to sit in the back. Personally I am not particularly offended, but I tend to side with my wife on this. Our plan would be to just have me sit with the rest of the family in the second row on the outside and be able to sneak away if our daughter happens to start stirring or making any noise.

The bride is concerned that this will 'ruin her moment' and is pretty insistent that I sit in the back. The groom is not bothered at all by where we sit but, understandably, is also deferring to his wife to be.

I am not one to ruffle feathers, but curious to see if my wife and I would be the assholes if we insist on sitting with the rest of the family?

Some additional context. The guest list is approximately 175 people, the wedding is taking place outdoors at a beach hotel very near to a pool with plenty of noise. The area where the wedding is taking place is right by the beach and generally the 'kids club' area, but they are removing all the slip-n-slides and toys and putting out chairs/decorations/etc.

EDIT: Appreciate all the feedback - realizing it’s no big deal where I sit, and the back is definitely easiest. The bride and groom have already compromised so this is definitely fair to us. Thanks all, glad I got some unbiased input.",86,63,0.88

33,Everyone Sucks,"So I put this story on r/maliciouscompliance, and had a lot of people saying I did the right thing, and people calling me a bully. I’m in 10th grade and the first part of this story is in March of this year. So me and a group of my friends were at our schools  youth group (I’m catholic) and I was trying to show one of my friends a picture on my phone. While I was scrolling to it,  I scrolled past a very unflattering picture of David, and my friend started laughing. A few other people came over and saw it, and they were all laughing. Then David came back, saw it, and ripped my phone out of my hands, and slammed it on the ground, completely destroying it. He wouldn’t pay for it, so I eventually just bought a new phone. 

Later in the year, were at a party, and I had my laptop. I don’t remember this very well, but at one point he was holding it and accidentally smashed it against the wall, and broke the hard drive. He wouldn’t pay for that either, and my dad bought me a new one. 

Now fast forward a few months to last week. We’re in math class, taking a test. The teacher steps out of the classroom for about 25 seconds and David asks me for my answers. I’m still mad at him for the past events, so here’s where the malicious compliance happens. I notice he has one answer filled in the wrong spot, so I told him he could, and after he got about 15 filled in, he realized he had them all in the wrong spot, and erased all of them. right as he did that, I turned mine in. The teacher gets back just as I’m sitting back down, and David’s pleading with me for the answers. The teacher asks what’s going on, and I told him that David was trying to copy my answers.

With that out of the way. I don't know this guy ""too well"". My gf has known him since HS, we're now in college. But, he's never had a BF (or a gf for that matter) and he gives me some weird vibes.

My GF says in HS (when they were \~16) he gave them some sob story about being gay/fitting in/etc.

Anyway, apparently her + her friends and him go shopping and he helps give them opinions on stuff. This also means he is around when they're changing. ""But, it's okay because he's gay.""

The straw that broke the camels back was last weekend. She went on a ""girls trip"" to her friends mountain cabin. He went along as well. All but one were topless in the hot tub because the one friend forgot to mention it so my gf and the other girls just went in in their undies (no bra) as they didn't bring swimsuits.

I tried talking to her that this is weird. She says I'm being homophobic, he's gay, and ""not getting anything out of it."" It still makes me uncomfortable.

This is the first time in my life I have actually grown a beard, and felt like keeping it. A few months later, and after learning how to trim it, shape it and keep it healthy - it looks good.

However, the wife isn't a fan. While she hasn't openly said she likes or hates it, she got super pissed last night when I said I wouldn't shave it off for our annual family photos in a couple of weeks. Her biggest issue is she doesn't like facial hair and I never asked her permission to grow it.

I responded with when was the last time she asked my permission to change her hair color or style - which she has done multiple times in the past few years. 

I could understand if the beard was shitty - but it is professional looking, so I don't see what the issue is. I've gotten complements on it, and I personally like the overall look.

Her old school is in the same district as the school that’s closer.

Neither my mom or I start work until later on in the day so we get to sleep in a little bit. 

Since my sister wants to continue going to her old school I have to wake up around 6:40am pst to take her to school. I don’t have a problem with this but it does suck to not be able to sleep in. We have 2 dogs who like to wake up between 5:30am-6:00am. I told her since I’m waking up way earlier than I should be just to take her to school than it’s her responsibility to wake up and take the dogs out in the morning. 2 times she has REFUSED to get up and take the dogs out because she’s “tired” and I let both those times slide. But today she tried to pull that same stunt again. This time however I told her that she’s being very unappreciative of the fact that I wake up way earlier than I should be just to take her to school when there’s a high school like 5 minutes away that she could easily go too. I told her it wouldn’t kill her to wake up at 6am or earlier instead of 6:20am (she wakes up at this time to get ready) to take the dogs out. I said to her that it’s not fair for her to expect me or my mom to wake up and take the dogs out just because she’s feeling tired when I’m already doing her a favor.

She speaks both English and Japanese fluently, which I think is so great. I also speak languages besides English, such as French and a bit of German.

Recently my girlfriend has wanted me to learn Japanese as well, mainly because she wants me to be able to communicate better with her parents, who I am visiting next spring. Her parents speak some English but it’s limited. When I last met them I could get along with them just fine though.

She taught me some basic Japanese herself, but she says she’s not a good teacher and wants me to take this Japanese for beginners class that is being taught by her friend from university. I did attend for a few sessions, but they are quite long and the homework is rather intensive so I stopped going.

I work long hours as a lawyer and I just find it really hard to learn such a complicated language on top of my already busy schedule. I told my GF this, but she became upset because she says I’m not trying hard enough to learn her language/culture which are both important to her.

45,No A-holes here,"Hey Reddit, 

I haven’t been able to concentrate all day because I feel like TA but I thought I’d ask the masses. 

My husband and I both live and work in Boston and we have pretty similar work schedules, leaving plenty of time in the evenings to be together. Over the past two weeks I enrolled in intensive therapy to help with an eating disorder so I’m away for most weeknights, not getting home until 9:30. I also need to get into the office by 8 AM to be able to leave early to get to the session on time. This has led to a lot of stress and overall lack of weekly happiness on my end. 

At the same time, my husband is having a really tough time at work. It’s a myriad of the usual problems—a boss that doesn’t care, too much work, no support, etc. The biggest problem is they canned his boss so now he has the workload of two people, no promotion, and they hire new people for his team but only in their Canadian office, not the one in Boston. So he still has no help with this and it’s been nearly a year. 

Our initial plan was to meet up for lunch on the weekdays because by the time I get home from therapy I end up simply going to bed because I’ve been out for 14+ hours. This would allow me to see him at least once during the day. Unfortunately, due to his work issues he hasn’t exactly been joyous during lunch. The past couple of times we’ve met up for lunch he’s been in a HORRIBLE mood due to experiencing some issue at work, whether it's a nasty email or another new hire in the Canada office. He’s unresponsive, unenthusiastic, and the entire time I’m on the verge of tears due to his lack of interest in cheering up and just hanging out with me. 

I’m having a really difficult time dealing with his bad mood during my one hour off in the entire day, so today I told him I couldn’t get lunch because “it stresses me out so much.” It did not go over well--he's not speaking to me. I feel horrible because he doesn’t have a big support system so I am the only one he has to talk to, but I need to try to have just one hour of a genuine break in the day to get me through the next 8-9 hours without his piss-poor attitude and sulking making our lives worse. AITA?

EDIT: I skipped therapy last night to go home. I apologized for how I behaved, we agreed to both be more positive during our lunches together, and he agreed to seek therapy (and will look for a new job as soon as he gets his end of year bonus)",35,47,0.85

48,Not the A-hole,"Back in my senior year of college, I had a roommate from China. We weren't very close but we got along fine. She adopted a cat while we were living together, but when our lease was up she decided to go stay with family back in China for a semester. I liked the cat and she couldn't take it with her so we agreed that I would take care of the cat while she was gone and she would send me $50 a month to cover food and other expenses. I still ended up having to pay a little more out of my own pocket but I didn't really mind because he's a great cat and I liked having him around.

Well, that was three years ago. After the first semester ended she told me she was going to stay in China indefinitely and wanted me to continue taking care of her cat. She stopped sending me any money about two months after that. So, I have had this cat living with me for three and a half years and have been paying to take care of it completely on my own for almost three years. I have barely had any contact with my ex-roommate during that time because she was avoiding acknowledging that she wasn't paying me.

I love this cat more than anything. He is my best friend. He has gotten me through some really difficult times. I have bought him giant cat trees, toys, paid vet bills when he needed surgery, I would do anything for him. Originally I was just watching him but I thought my old roommate was never going to come back for him and I now consider him to be my cat. I have now owned him for much longer than my roommate ever did.

Yesterday she messaged me saying that she was back in the country and wanted to arrange to pick up the cat. She also said she would pay me $500 for taking care of him all this time. She owes me much more than that per our agreement, but I don't care about the money. I just want the cat and I feel like it should be mine. I know the agreement was that she would come back for it but I think it was reasonable to think she had changed her mind by this point. I told her this, and she got very upset and accused me of stealing her cat. I don't know what to do. She doesn't know my current address and I don't want to tell her. I don't know if she would go to the police or sue me but I don't think she would.

Would I be the asshole if I just told her that the cat was mine and stopped responding to her? I feel horrible about it but I can't lose my best friend.

My cousin moved into the area and I wanted to get close to her so started hanging with her more and it was going great. I'm really happy about this budding relationship because I don't have a lot of family plus she is just a super cool person. 

So we invited her to the house for the first time, she came in and my husband said ""would you mind taking off your shoes?"" And she just said ""no I'm not going to."" Not rudely or antagonistic but a flat refusal. My husband didn't want to make a problem so he dropped it and she wore her shoes inside for the whole visit. 

Now it's happened all 3 times she's come over. The last time when my husband asked her she said ""I will wash my shoes off with the hose if you like or if it's a problem for you I'll just leave."" Again he did not want to make drama so he let it go, but now he says that was the last straw and we have to have a discussion with her or she can't come over. 

My first reaction was to be on my husband's side. I think my cousin is being extremely rude. I don't believe it's a health issue as she has gone barefoot with me swimming and at yoga. I can be a doormat of a person as I have a pathological drive to accomodate people (yes you could psychoanalyze this and I'm aware it's not normal, I'm working on it). Because I'm terrified to inconvenience people the thought of having to bring this up to my cousin causes me great distress. The alternative is just to quit inviting her over altogether which makes me pretty despondent.

I said alright if it bothers you I won't do it and tried to roll over and go to sleep too but she kicked me out to the couch because she was so ""angry and creeped out"". I really can't understand where she is coming from on this, am I the asshole here?

UPDATE:
Sorry not much to report, she got home from work and was not interested in talking. Just went in the bedroom and shut the door. I had to leave for work as I was already late just waiting for her to come home. So I just let her be and left for work. 

Also for those wondering it had been 20mins since she took the meds when this happened and it was 50mg of Unisom.

UPDATE 2:
Well she video called me while I'm at work (we usually do this) and is just acting normal as if nothing happened. She had her 8yr daughter with her too on the video call so I decided to not bring it up. Guess this is just gonna go under the rug and I won't try to play any games after she goes to sleep again. I'll never understand what happened and I guess I just have to make my peace with that.",105,179,0.91

OK,so i (39f) have been living at my friend's house for almost a year.i moved there because my husband was secretly spying on me while he wasn't home and when i confirmed that,i decided to leave him(not the full story but the rest isn't important).now,i'm living at my friend's house,pay rent and everything and she asks me if i could stay with her son every now and then so she could go out with her bf.i have no problem with that since i'm really thankful for her help and i'm happy to be able to return her favor.now,i started going to the gym with my nephew a month ago and she started getting really annoying with her requests but i help her anyways.2 days ago she said she got holidays for a week and asked me if i could call in sick for that week so i could stay with her son while she would go out with her bf to ride the motorcycle with him.i immediately refused,she insisted but i maintained my position.

I don't consider changing my position but i feel bad for refusing,so AITA?",31,42,0.86

So this is an old story, but it somehow keeps getting brought up again. I think it’s one of the most ridiculous things I’ve ever heard so I thought I’d share and get a new perspective. This all happened 5 years ago (before I was even in the picture) and MIL can’t seem to get past it.

Important to know, but my husband was very sheltered. MIL got more and more controlling and protective his senior year of high school, and she only got worse when he went to college (he lived at home during college, no dorms). This of course is only met with more angst and rebellion from my husband. Also important to know, MIL and FIL have been divorced for 8 years when this happened. FIL paid child support but there didn’t seem to be any consistent visitation agreement. The point is that FIL had limited involvement in my husband’s life but still paid child support and tried to be supportive when my husband came to him with problems.

So this happened when my husband was 18, in his second semester of college, first ever spring break is coming up. His good friends are going to unnamed theme park in Orlando Florida. My husband wants to go but has no job and is broke, so of course he asks his mom. MIL’s EXACT response was “I don’t think that would be a good idea.” Husband isn’t sure whether to interpret this as her not being able to afford it, her simply not wanting him to go and refusing to pay for it, or both.

Either way, my husband is a good sport about it and takes no for an answer. So, like any child of divorced parents he asks his dad. FIL gives him the money to go and tells him to have fun.

Now my husband fully understands that MIL will have an absolute temper tantrum if she finds out that he’s not only going on the trip against her will, but FIL gave him the money for it (these things seem to be a competition to her). So my husband tells her he’s going to spend the night at a friend’s house and they leave for Orlando that night. 

My husband texts her when they’re 30 minutes away and explains that he’s already too far away to turn around and come back, that he has all the money he needs and not to worry. MIL calls and texts several dozen times, leaves crying voicemails, he doesn’t answer or pick up. MIL threatens to send her fiancé to come after him and bring him back, but fiancé agrees with my husband, my husband is already too far away, and let’s face it, a legal adult. MIL figures out several days later when the trip is almost over that there’s nothing she can do so she tells him to have a good time and let her know if he needs more money.

5 years later MIL keeps bringing this up in front of people and I feel she’s trying to guilt my husband. She brings it up so much that I have to wonder if I’m looking at this wrong.",27,103,0.94
65,No A-holes here,"Posting anonymously for reasons. And sorry, this is a long one.

For some context, I work for a small dog grooming business. We stay very busy, especially this time of the year, and only have a small group of employees, only ones that are truly needed for us to be able to work.
I am the only person that works here who can do everything, and the only one at the moment who is grooming at all. The owner of the business used to do most of the grooming but she was recently diagnosed with cancer and has just started chemo 2 weeks ago, so now its just me. 
I tried a couple years back to quit, but was talked back into staying by the owner. I have currently worked here for 9 years and me and my boss(the owner) are very close(we spend every holiday together since we both dont have much family to spend it with) and she has helped me since I moved out on my own to survive basically.
But the thing is, this job is way too much for me, I essentially hate dogs now and my mental health is taking a huge toll because of it. And to be perfectly honest I'm scared of what i might do if i become angry with one of the dogs. 
I'm basically running this shop on my own and I never wanted to be a business owner. There are a lot more reasons why I want to quit, but my main thing is, would I be the asshole if I quit my job here, leaving the shop to probably have to go out of business(after 45 years)because they have no one to groom and my boss is too sick to teach anyone anything?",21,29,0.91

68,Not the A-hole,"Using a throwaway because this is the story of another family member who wants judgement but doesn't know how to use reddit. I will write in first person to make it easy to read. 

My dad died in 2013, leaving me (42), my younger brother Jake (36) and my step-mum (70). He had lots of health issues, so his death was not unexpected. Beforehand, my dad approached Jake and explained he was deep in debt from online gambling. Jake agreed to take on the debt and kept it a secret from everyone including his wife with whom he had a daughter (1). He now has 2 kids.

A month ago Jake called me in tears. His wife threatened to divorce. They were denied a mortgage for their first home because of the debt, and Jake had to come clean. Jake wanted me to take on a majority of the debt (which was about £10k total) to help pay it off.

I appear to be in a better financial situation than Jake. We have one child who is 13, a house and both have full time jobs plus my mother-in-law left us a large sum when she passed. We theoretically could have helped pay a significant amount of the debt. However we said no because:

1) None of our assets were liquid, it was all invested. He expected me to sort it all in one night which would have been impossible.

2) My husband and I agreed to put aside the money from his mother for our daughter when she turns 18

3) My husband works in an industry where he could be out of work for a period of time and as he gets older finding a new job is harder we wanted the money as a safety net

4) Our daughter had won a scholarship to private school, but it was not a free ride and was costing us, but she was really enjoying it and thriving there and we didn't want her to change schools.

I told Jake we would help him reorganise his finances, find him a financial advisor, babysit his kids when he went to financial advice appointments, help him sell some higher value items (he spends a lot on computer and gaming tech) or otherwise help minimise and manage the debt. We even offered to take on a small portion of the debt, but nothing close to what he was asking.

Jake was fuming, and l have barely spoken to him since. I am livid he made such an irresponsible decision without informing his own wife let alone me or my step-mum. My step-mum took out a loan to pay the debt so it is sorted and they have their house, but has been badmouthing me to the family. AITA?",52,132,0.95

We had about 4 solid options going (varying from my father's middle name, her grandfather's name, and 2 that we just liked the sound of) and now there is a 5th one thrown in as a serious contender from my wife's side. She likes the name ""Nate"" because of a coworker ""Nathan"" she is especially close to (not the actual name.) There had been some drama at her workplace in which Nathan had her back, protected and defended her. They aren't friends outside of work but close at the office. I have met Nathan at holiday parties and he is a good guy. I don't have any problem with him - but I don't want our son to be named after him. To be 100% honest, I vetoed it almost immediately and my wife got annoyed with me. When I told her I just don't want our son to be associated with a work friend, she said that this was an important person to her. I asked her if she would be okay with naming a daughter after ""Alyssa,"" my coworker?

70,Asshole,"A little background first. I go to this restaurant a lot. Enough to where many of the staff know my name. I’m very friendly and try to tip well. Never had any problems.

Anyway, my friend (will call him Cotton) invites myself and a friend (will call him James) I was already with to go eat. James didn’t have any money, so I said I would cover him. So, we get there, order food, and eat at the bar. Everything was good, we finish eating, and I ask for my tab.  Before giving me my tab, the bartender serves some drinks, which is fine, but before she can get me my bill, the power goes out. After 30 seconds, it’s back on.

Here’s where the controversy starts. Once, the power is back on, I wait to ask for my bill again for a couple mins, because they’re busy, but once I do ask I get a very stern “You need to be patient” from the bartender. Now, I must admit, that pissed me off, but didn’t really influence my decision. After another couple minutes I say that I have other things to do, can I just write my name and the order I had for James and I and I’ll pay the next time I’m in. She responds with, “that it’ll only take a couple mins to fix”.  Both her and the other server went in the back, were there for over 10 minutes. That’s when I wrote on a napkin my name, order, that I’d pay next time I’m in, then left.

Cotton stayed and must of gave them my phone number, because about 20 min after leaving I got a phone call with a voicemail saying that I needed to return to pay my bill.

So, AITA?

TLDR; Power went out at restaurant. Took too long to get my bill, so I wrote my name, order, promise to pay next time, on a napkin, and left.

Edit: Just to clarify a couple things, not that I think my asshole verdict is going to change, but just so things are clear.  
1.	When I said they were busy, I meant they were busy dealing with getting the machines to work, not customers because there was only about 12 total, so when I asked for my bill the second time I thought things were all good.
2.	I guess it might sound entitled, but when I explained that I’m a regular and they know me, I just meant that the people working there know I live close by and that I would definitely be returning, so it’s not like I wasn’t going to pay. I definitely am going to pay it with a large tip.",90,59,0.81

74,Not the A-hole,"I feel terrible even typing this out, but I think our dog deserves better and I need external opinions.

My now-husband (then-boyfriend) adopted Luna 4 years ago when she was 2 months old. We weren't living together at the time, but from what I witnessed he seemed like a good dog dad. She was potty trained fairly quickly, and learned basic commands right away as well. 

He owns his own business, and worked a ton during this time so I never witnessed any walks-- but again, we weren't living together yet and I assumed those were happening when I wasn't around.

After we moved in, I realized that no. Walks were not in fact happening. I should mention that Luna is a German Shepherd mix. She has seemingly boundless energy when she does go outside. And I know this breed craves having a job or purpose, and walking is pretty much non-negotiable. However over the years, my husband has not incorporated much physical activity into Lunas life.

Now, I have to be straight up here-- I'm not a dog person. I had a little 8 pound shitzhu when I was growing up that I had to train, walk twice a day, and pick up after. Especially during my teen years, it was a responsibility I didn't appreciate. I loved my dog, but I know the work you need to put in.

I feel so sad for Luna because she gets so little attention from her person (my husband). She has always been his dog, and I feel resentful that I should have to pick up the slack. I have taken her to the dog park a handful of times when the guilt really gets to me, but I know that limited attention is not fair to her. Husband doesn't care for the dog park, doesn't take her on walks, and when he gets home he shoos her away because she's very needy and will be alllll over him.

I have gently broached the subject a few times. I see Luna laying on the ground like a lump on a log and feel bad. I see how she is when she's allowed to play outside and how much she LOVES running around. I've suggested either we take family walks together with Luna, or we find a family who would love her better. Both options have been scoffed off.

I think I need to have a sit-down, come to Jesus talk with husband and figure out what the solution is. Personally, I don't know if my husband is capable of changing up his daily routine to incorporate time for Luna. I think she'd have so much fun with a young family who would take her for long walks and occasional hikes. Right now, she's merely existing to eat and sleep.

My wife (33M) is a stay at home mom to our 4 and 2 year old children. She works very hard as well taking care of them as well as a majority of household duties. For the past four years, as soon as I got home around 6:30, I would immediately start helping with dinner (my wife and I eat a later dinner than our kids) and with helping take care of the kids. Once the kids were asleep, I would have to do work from home until I would go to sleep. I was okay with this even though I was exhausted because I understood that sacrifices had to be made. However, I am now completely burning out.

I told my wife that I feel like I need an hour to myself when I get home from work to unwind so I am not in a permanent state of stress and exhaustion. I have literally zero free time on weekdays. I offered to allow her a break from 7:30 - 8:30 while I put the kids to bed, but she didn't like that idea since it would involve my only time with the kids being putting them to bed, and then she would never be involved in that. 

I understand her perspective, but I also can't keep continuing like this. I feel like I need an hour off to do my own thing so I don't go crazy. My wife thinks that the most important thing is me spending some time with my children, not just putting them to sleep, and that we need to make sacrifices for the next few years until they become more independent.

I can just bring my laptop and graphic tablet to Johan's place, so it works out.

TBH, I don't get nearly as much work done at Johan's as I'd like. I always get interrupted because the kids need attention or there's a chore to do. Mom would do the chores, but I spare her the work; I typically wash the dishes, clean every mess the kids make, tidy up the place, do the laundry, anything that needs to be done besides cooking and buying groceries. Mom and I sometimes spend the night, and we eat dinner at Johan's place almost every day.

Well, Kelly has this e-commerce project and she wants her own website. She's a secretary, so she doesn't have experience running a business, but of course I support her. Johan can code, so he's been working on her thing for a while, and they asked me to draw them a logo, which I did for free because family asked.

But then Kelly came to me with a shitload of requests, and turns out she expected me to do ALL THE GRAPHIC DESIGN of her whole website, including a unique cartoon illustration for *every single product she plans to sell*.

I tried to explain that I have little experience doing graphic design so they should hire a pro, and that her project would require dozens or even hundreds of hours, and even if I were to accept it, I would only be able to work on it when all my paid work was done, so they wouldn't see any of it before months or years. I said if they really wanted me to do it, they would have to actually hire and pay me for full-time work, and I'm not cheap.

Kelly was disappointed but accepted it, but Johan pulled me aside and tore me a new one. ""We don't make relatives pay for doing favors,"" he said. ""I never asked you to pay me for living in my house and eating my food every day."" I got super mad because I feel like without me, they would do a ton more chores and might have to hire a full-time maid/nanny or send their kids to daycare, and I don't eat more than a couple euros' worth of food per day.

We helped Ben plan out his outfits for the whole week and he took it home with him after school.

I agreed and headed straight to the nearest grocery shop, prioritising the items on her shopping list, then grabbing a few items only adding up to about £3 for myself, since I was only given money to buy what was on the list, the extra things were paid for from my own pocket (it was a smoothie and some oven onion rings or something like that).

Sister in law is pregnant (3ish months). Asked if we do take away and eat at their place? No drama so long as I get my Greek meats and see everyone. 

Yesterday a group message was started saying she is cooking on Friday and wants me to bring a salad and mum to bring starter..... I kind of stay quiet. Happy just to see everyone. Sad about no Greek  meat. 

Mum says she will bring prawns for a starter. An appropriate replacement to the Greek meat as far as I'm concerned. Sister in law tells her no. Starts getting pushy on what we can/can not bring. 

I am about to tell everyone in the group that I will be at the Greek place on Friday. Come, don't come, whatever.  I'm going to do what I want to do (feels like a bit of a toddler move, but think this is the only way to get my point across).

Before they saw I was back I noticed something on their phone screen. A real cute picture of them being sent out on Facebook messenger to someone other than myself. Tattoo visible, same clothes they were wearing at the time. It had to be taken that day.

At first I thought nothing of it, but that changed when I saw their reaction to noticing I had arrived. As soon as they saw me, the phone screen was instantly locked and in their pocket. Everything about their behavior changed (body language, tone of voice, facial expressions, word choice, etc). It was almost a 1:1 match of their reaction when their parents come early, unannounced and almost catch us in the bedroom. They were acting like they were very close to getting caught in the act. I wanted to say something then, but I didn't know what to say. Nothing notable happened for the rest of the night. 

Fast forward to yesterday, they're asking me for the pictures we took with my phone. Okay, that's fine, I send them over. I take this opportunity to ask them if they took any pictures that same day. They said they took a picture earlier in the day, but that was the only one. They sent me the picture and it was not the one I saw on their phone Saturday. I asked if there were any others and they said no. At this point, I can't shake the feeling that something's going on. For the rest of the day, my messages back were few and far between. They were double texting me, showering me with compliments, sending old pictures of us, ""so happy together"" type messages, etc. I've been played before, I know the signs. 

I am seeing them again today for birthday dinner with their family. I don't want to hold this down until a ""convenient"" time and I don't want too much time to pass before it's no longer relevant. Would I be the asshole if I brought this up today, on their birthday?

Ninja edit for info: we have a very good relationship. Neither of us have done anything to wrong each other and we have very strong communication with each other. We've had misunderstandings in the past then ended up being nothing and joked about later. I'm not planning on walking in there accusing them of infidelity and certainly would not bring it up at dinner in front of the family. I would simply ask ""why were you so quick to hide the picture you were sending this weekend?""

I have had 0 reason to suspect anything of them throughout the entire relationship.



UPDATE HERE

TLDR: He was hiding something but not a side bitch. Financial conversation regarding myself. Situation explained, dinner is at 6 as scheduled. 


For starters, some of y'all were confused with my use of they/them so here's the info on that. They were born a female and are transitioning to male. I'm used to using their preferred pronouns so that's how I wrote my last post. How I identify is irrelevant to the story. I understand that can be confusing. Just go with it. 

For convenience sake I will refer to my SO as **HE** from now on. 

I got off work early and he wanted to come over to hang out before meeting the family for dinner later. I told him I had something to talk to him about and he was okay with that. He came over, we talked. When I brought it up, I was calm. I told him how the moment looked from my perspective and asked if he could explain what I had walked in on. He immediately started apologizing and explained everything. He wasn't hiding the picture, but the conversation below it in the chat.

This was not an important detail in my last post, but now it is. He doesn't know how much I earn, but he knows I am much more financially stable. I'm the kind of person who loves to share and take care of others. If you're in my house, you're getting a hot meal before you leave. That's how I was raised and will raise my own. 

Earlier this month, he found himself in a situation of a dire need for X amount cash. He didn't have the money, neither did his parents. When he came to me about said situation, he wasn't asking for help but venting about it and telling me he didn't know what to do. Being the kind of person I am, I bailed them out, expecting nothing in return. 

Back to the story. He was messaging to his sister about the above financial situation and how I helped. He hid the message because he didn't want me to see it and think he was only with me for the money. The picture was there to show off the new tattoo. He volunteered his phone and let me scroll through the messages. The picture, timestamps, and conversation all match their verbal story. We're all good and dinner is still on as scheduled.

Some of you seem to think I felt he was cheating. Given the context of the post, I can understand how you'd draw that conclusion. I did not suspected they cheating, (although it was in the realm of possibility) I suspected they were hiding something from me and the picture could have indicated cheating. Some of you also think I planned on bringing this up at dinner in front of everyone and ruin their birthday intentionally. It was literally written in the post that I would not be doing this. The question was ""WIBTA for calling him out today"" not ""WIBTA for ruining dinner."" Read the full post before commenting.  Thank you for your time, have a good day.",149,465,0.88

89,Everyone Sucks,"Long title, but short story. My close friend ""Kate"" and I are SUPER into Halloween. We love all things spooky and we get hype about it. All our friends know this, and we alternate throwing a big Halloween bash. As a result, during the week of Halloween, people prank us a lot, and are always bringing cool or spooky stuff to us, etc.

One of our friends decided to prank us the other night by scaring us while we were out jogging, by jumping out in full costume with a knife. Obviously, we were terrified. Where I got so scared I kind of froze, Kate immediately booked it running, almost knocking me over in the process, and literally ran all the way back to her car and drove off. By this point, I knew it was a prank because our costumed friend was laughing his fucking ass off.

She did apologize for leaving me, but she said she looked back multiple times, and I was never running with her (she did not). She also said she waited for a second when she got to the car to see if I was coming, but I REALLY doubt that because I could see her. Apparently, she called one of our friends first thing to tell them they needed to come to where we were and call the police, but that friend was in on the joke and told her what happened.

Anyway, my feelings are really hurt about this. Not only did she completely abandon me, she almost knocked me over, and she drove off immediately. I also screamed her name and she didn't even turn around. I get the initial fight or flight response, but to not even look back or wait even a second in the car for me to catch up really rubs me the wrong way. Our friends are split between thinking it's hilarious, and thinking it's hysterical. No one is willing to judge anyone to be an asshole. Things are tense, so I'm thinking of not going to her Halloween party this year, though that devastates me as well and I'm not sure how we'll stay as close as we were when I know that she would literally leave me to die.

**EDIT:** Just to be clear, I am NOT upset that she ran away. I know it's a natural reaction to run away. I'm upset that she nearly knocked me over, didn't look even once she was in the car, and that she immediately sped off in the car such that even if I HAD been running to the car, I wouldn't have been able to get in before she took off. Even though she claimed she did. I know this, because my friend almost immediately revealed it was a prank, so if she'd looked back at us at any point, she would have known there was no real danger. I also know when she called my friend, which was well after everything went down.",215,358,0.91

Every movie/series we have watched together we have bought or watched on netflix. Once I found out that he had pirated the movies I told him straight away I wouldn't be watching them.

94,Not the A-hole,"Hi,

So I run a youth group and myself and the other youth leaders were talking about dressing as the entire scooby doo gang for halloween. I was gonna be Scooby, and get a Scooby Doo onesie from Amazon. It's the whole body costume with ears etc., and a hole for a face.

I was telling a group of friends what we were doing, and how I was going to then paint my face brown with some of the Scooby freckles etc. One in particular suddenly had a face was like I'd just slapped him. ""You can't do that!"" he said. ""That's blackface!""

Turns out he, and several others at the table, think that me, as a white guy, painting my face Scooby-Doo brown, would be blackface. To me I hadn't even considered that there would be any racial connotations whatsoever - it's a dog, not a person of another race - and that I shouldn't do it. Not sure whether it matters, but everyone saying it would be wrong was white, the one black guy at the table had no problem with it at all.

To me, this seems like an incredibly unhelpful level of insensitivity which is only aimed at getting outraged wherever possible, not at actual injustice.

So, if I go ahead with dressing as Scoob for Halloween, face painted brown (AS A DOG) - WIBTA?

Edit: Forgot to mention, one guy said ""Even if it's not wrong, if you took off the costume you'd just be left with a brown face and that'd be really bad"" which I guess is true that I'd have a brown face but I don't think brown face instantly equals racism so I think unless I run for prime minister of Canada in 40 years time and the photos resurface I should be good?

95,No A-holes here,"Okay so a little background here. I found out when I was 16yr that I was adopted along with my little sister. The mother I was raised by is technically my cousin but no matter what she is my Mom. 
Anyway since finding out I never talked to my birth mother. She was a prostitute and drug addict that had 6 other kids who the state took away from her, with me and my little sister being the youngest (sister is 26yrs now to me being 28yr) that she just left us at the hospital after giving birth to us. She did drugs and dangerous thing so I was born sickly and my little sis was born premature. I have no memories of ever seeing her growing up before we moved to a differant state, so she had never really been in my life. 
My Little sister went and got in contact and eventually went to meet her. I refused and would not let my sister give out my phone number or Social Media accounts. So years went past and I refused to ever talk to or see this women.
Now fast forward to a few months ago my sister called crying at 4am asking to come over so she did and she told me in her words 'Our Mother' died last night. I just sat there expressionless thinking that women was not my mother my Mom is. Anyway I got up and left to sit in the patio to smoke and was in tears. Not sad ones but tears of anger for never having a chance to tell this women off and angry that my sister was so effected by that whore. 
I ended up telling my sister this and she said I was a bitch for feeling like that. So My question to you here on Reddit Am I the Asshole for not feeling sad like she was here?",141,792,0.92

She replied with a snarky what and I asked her why she unplugged my phone. She responds with ""I got tired of listening to your music"". I told her that if she wants a ride home she'll have to listen to my music. I then unplugged her phone and started driving. Then she gets bold and while I'm driving unplugs my phone and starts playing her music again. So I pullover and tell her to get out. She kinda sat there and looked confused but after repeating myself a few times she hopped out. I wasn't expecting the backlash from my stepmom when I got home. She was pissed and ""threatened"" me with calling my dad and telling him about my reckless behavior. She went on to call me an ego maniac and other names.

104,Not the A-hole,"I moved to Canada with my mother and 2 (younger) sisters 5 years ago (August 2014) because my mom remarried with someone that lived in the french province (Quebec). He has 2 children, one that was 17 (stepbrother) and the other 19 (stepsister) at the time. Before we moved, my family lived in the U.S. and came to visit my stepdad and his family during the summer. I was excited to meet his kids, especially since I've never had a brother before. When we first met both of them sounded like cool people to hang around and get along with.

&#x200B;

For 5 years, he never said a word to me. But this isn't what triggers my anger. It's what things he does and how he gets treated. For example, my siblings and I do house chores to keep it clean for a couple bucks a week. But John doesn't do anything at all. He treats the place like it's a luxury hotel. My mom and stepfather cook food every night and he only comes upstairs to eat it. He never eats breakfast or lunch too. One time my parents were gone for the night on a date night and it was a ""find your own thing"" to eat. John chose to eat a can of Chef Boyardee Ravioli, but he literally didn't know where the can opener was and how to use it, so my stepsister had to help. Keep in mind, John was like 19/20 years old when this happened. Whenever he uses the bathroom and plugs the toilet, he just leaves it there. Also, He doesn't shower, never brushes his teeth, and does not wash his hands.

&#x200B;

2 years ago on a Sunday morning, John was at the house alone for a few hours. We have 2 dogs, so he usually watches them when alone. When I came back, I went downstairs in my room and smelled something really funny in the air. Once I entered the bedroom, I saw 2 big brown splotches on the carpet next to my desk and bed. One of the dogs dropped a dump on the floor and John didn't even notice. I went to tell my mom and stepdad, and my stepdad was in total defense of John. Now I like my stepdad a lot, but every time John is in concern of some sort of argument he always sides with him, which is not fair to me in this type of situation. He said John didn't know, but I could literally smell something from the staircase. So he got to sit there and leave the dump on the floor and I ended up cleaning it up.

&#x200B;

So from 2014 to today, nothing still hasn't changed. He still does the same stuff like I explained previously. What makes me pissed is that he doesn't talk to anyone but his stepdad and stepsister (when she comes to visit). I just find it annoying how I wanted to have a brother/stepbrother so bad, but I end up with this person. Someone who doesn't keep good personal hygiene, doesn't talk to any of my family and spends all day on the computer playing video games. He's 22 and has a job, but for someone who doesn't talk to me despite us sharing a room, stalks me on social media and on Twitch when I'm livestreaming, and is a complete weirdo.

108,Asshole,"So I started out in a commission only job for a small commercial real estate firm a could years ago.  About 3 days into the job the person in their Accounts Payable/Accounts Receivable position went to lunch and never came back.  They offered me the job, they lowballed the pay but hey it was better than working nights at Walmart so I took it as it fit my experience.  I was tasked with putting together a manual for the position, now this struck me as odd since the only person that would perform the duties of the job was the controller who had been there for years.  I dragged my feet putting it together but fast forward about a year and I could sense some major bad vibes from the controller.  She didn't like me, I tried to be cordial but quite frankly she was a horrible manager.  The owner called me into his office one day to review my position, said I was doing a great job but he really wanted me to finish that manual and make sure my email was well organized (major red flag).  I put together the best manual they've seen (nobody in the office knew dick about Microsoft office), put it on the company network and let the boss know it was ready.  The next day he called me into his office telling me I'm always too late (I had been one minute late 3 times in the last 6 months) so I smelled something fishy.  I locked the manual with a relatively simple password and the next day made sure I was in on time the next day.  After lunch I got called into the office and told I was late so I could resign or be fired.  I walked, they called me two weeks later asking for the password, I told them they were a bit late on their request.  AITA?

EDIT: thank you for the lively discussion!  To clear up a few points I was not solely tasked with writing the manual, I did the job and wrote it as time was available.

I was sort of surprised he asked for sick leave as I was pretty sure he's used it all up. My manager said he can ask for one in advance and she was happy to give him one cause it seemed like he was seriously sick.

I was pretty annoyed he lied to the team especially since the convention dates were announced 8-9 months in advance where he could have asked for the dates off. I'm wanting to tell management because what he did really didn't sit well with me and knowing how busy my shift on Saturday was, Sundays are usually a lot worse...

So...WITBA if I told the managers he faked his sickness to go hang out at a convention?",38,39,0.91
118,Not the A-hole,"So tonight we go out to a gas station place where you can order ahead on the app so the food will be ready for pickup. My husband orders a sub this way, but I decide to get a prepackaged sandwich off the shelf when we arrive at the store. 

We arrive and his order is not ready for pick up. So we pay for my sandwich and our drinks and go sit down (there's a dining area where we we like to sit and eat). We both keep an eye out, but no order. However he tells me to go ahead and start eating. I eat slow, so I started. As time passed, he became increasingly agitated. After 10 minutes past the time it was scheduled to be picked up, he says, ""I guess it's not coming"" in an annoyed voice. Though I already know the answer, I suggest going up and asking the people. He refuses. I then offer to do it for him. He refuses. I am calm and nice the whole time, because I want us to both enjoy our meal together.

More time passes. I'm eating slowly, hoping his sandwich will come out soon. Suddenly he snaps at me, ""Go ahead and eat!! Just eat your food!!"" which honestly surprised me because he was so angry. Plus, I *was* eating. 

I start to feel really weird and bad that he is just going to sit there and eat nothing and not help himself. I suggest again that I could go up and ask them. This only annoys him more. He threatens to leave me alone and go sit in the car if I try that, which hurts my feelings. 

So I quickly change gears....if he refuses to ask the people who make the fresh sandwiches, let me go to the deli and get him a prepackaged sandwich like mine. He refuses. I stand up, thinking that if I just go do it by myself he'll acquiesce (and it wouldn't be emasculating because there's a divider and the cashier wouldn't be able to see him, they'd just think I was getting another sandwich for myself. Not sure if that was his concern but I figured it would work out just in case). 

However, when I stand up and start walking he puts out his arm (he is much bigger than me) and stops me. He stands up and bends down and gets in my face and tells me to stop and to sit down. He looks enraged. I am kind of scared because he's never ever been violent with me in the 15 years we've been together. 

I sit down. I offer him the other half of my sandwich and thankfully he takes it. I give him the pretzels from my hummus box and he takes those, too. 

On the ride home he told me that if I ever offer him help like that again and he refuses, to just let him alone, and that I make it worse (""it"" I guess being anxiety?) by offering help. I tried to get him to talk about the anxiety itself—I really wanted to understand—but he got defensive. 

Looking back, I think he should have handled his feelings and he at LEAST should not have taken his frustrations out on me in public. Even when he was silent he was being a total asshole, angrily scrolling through his phone as I sat across from him and ate in silence. AITA for wanting to help him, though? It just felt so weird to sit there and watch him be mad and not offer to help.",67,72,0.87

120,Not the A-hole,"Going to make this as short as possible and using a throwaway. 

I work in a department of about 40 people. Within the last year, several women and men in the department have been hooking up with each other. Furthermore, some of them talk casually about it and don’t care who hears. Which is all fine and dandy, except many of them are married, some with children. 

I know from multiple sources who the cheaters are, who is hooking up with who, and have seen text messages to prove they are sleeping together. As of this moment, I know of 4 different men, all in the 20s-30s range, who are cheating on their girlfriends/wives with female coworkers. And not just kissing- I’m talking about full blown sex. 

What irritates me is some of these guys act all godly on Facebook. One just had his 2nd child about a year ago. It’s been happening so much lately that I’m getting sick of hearing about it. 

I want to clarify: I know *none* of their wives personally, and I interact with them minimally. I am thinking about making a fake Facebook account and just messaging all their wives the details of who they are having sex with and then never logging into the account again. They might not believe me, but that’s up to them. 

WIBTA if I do this? I am very conflicted because I don’t know their wives personally, but if it was my husband, I would want to know.",61,30,0.85
121,Not the A-hole,"Some context: Me (20) and my brother (23) both have our own cars, I’m at university with no parking space not far from home so I leave my car at home during the week and just use it one evening a week when I need it. 

My brother is too lazy to get his MOT sorted, despite reminders from my parents, and now our mechanic is unavailable so his car is currently undriveable. Because I don’t need my car during the day, I’ve been letting him use it so he can get to and from work. Without it, he’d have to walk ~15 minutes to the metro, get the metro 20 minutes into town and then walk ~15 minutes from there to work. 

(Aside from the following conversation, he has also not been particularly grateful, saying homophobic things to get at me and jokingly saying he won’t fill the tank back up for me when he’s done. I have also repeatedly picked him up late at night to save him getting a taxi home, but when I asked him once to give me a lift to the metro (train) he grumbled significantly.) 

So... on Halloween, I’m going out with my friends to a haunted corn maze. My brother knew and booked the same date and time - mildly irritating because I just want to spend some time with my friends but oh well, no big deal. I hadn’t really thought about getting there - my friend normally offers me a lift but failing that, I can always drive right? I went home at the weekend and my brother came in my room. 

Brother: how are you getting there on Thursday? 
Me: I think I’m gonna drive (don’t want to assume my friend will take me) 
B: Oh. Cos I’m gonna drive and I’ve offered my mates a lift. 
M: You don’t have a car??
B: Yeah... I was just gonna use yours. 
M: Well how many of you is there? 
B: Well me and I’m taking 4 people. So you’re gonna have to get a lift off your mates. 

So not only has he assumed he can have my car, he’s not even left me a space in it. I hope you can see why I’m mad. 

Had he asked nicely, I would’ve happily asked my friend to give me a lift so he could take his friends. But because he just took my car for granted, I decided he needs to learn his lesson - my parents would normally step in to save the day, so he’s never learned. I text my 3 friends who are going and offered them a lift (also in gratitude for my friend who regularly offers me one) and explained the situation to my parents so they won’t bail him out. I have text my brother to tell him he will have to sort him and his friends out. 

He has two days notice but there are 7 of them now with only his friend’s car, so they won’t all fit. They won’t be able to get the bus as it’s late and in the middle of nowhere and so a taxi would be quite expensive. 

AITA for taking my car  back and leaving him potentially stranded?  Should I offer him a lift in the one remaining seat in my car?",15,30,0.96

Some lady with only a bunch of Halloween candy (Rx drugs are rung up in back by the pharm techs mind you) cut the entire line and walked right up to the spot behind the person checking out on the right.

I just looked her dead in the eye and said, ""excuse me you know what?  The line starts back there were all here waiting.""

She looked horrified and pissed off and said ""well isn't this register open too?""

I have a tendency to be very assertive.  So I said ""it is, and we're all waiting in one line, and I think we are going to just go to whichever opens up first.  The.  Line.

I don’t sit in an office all day, I’m usually walking  the building and dealing with other departments. I just don’t like the added attention that comes with a costume, it actually makes me very uncomfortable.

Two coworkers in my office decided a few weeks ago that our small department would all dress up in matching costumes for halloween. They had a small discussion of who wanted to portray who (we are being characters from a popular movie). I tried to stay out of the conversation, and tried to passively give them a hint by saying “oh I don’t really dress up for Halloween..” This was ignored and they assigned me the last unpicked name.

These two coworkers spent a whole weekend buying supplies and making props to go with the matching costumes. They are asking that everyone wear specific clothing to go along with the theme.

The pie came he insisted to pay for it, which I thought was nice of him. He was grateful for me letting him spend the night, and said how much he was looking forward to having this pizza again. I had a slice and he had 3, he had been driving all day plus he paid for it so I really didnt think much of it at all.

About an hour later, my friend calls to let me know he made it home safe, but he was mad he forgot to take the pizza home with him. I told him it's all good, and my gf and I actually just polished it off, and thanked him again for footing the bill. That's when his tone changed completely.

I asked if something was wrong. And he said ""oh well I was just calling to see if you could freeze it and send it to me, but I guess nevermind now"". I thought he was kidding, but he wasn't. I explained that isn't exactly practical, and I assumed if he wanted it he would have remembered to take it.

130,Asshole,"My lifelong best friend, Eddie, started dating his boyfriend, Logan, for about two years. I’ve always gotten along with Logan and we often joke back and forth. Logan is FtM trans and passes perfectly, I’ve literally never thought of him as a woman or anything. 

Over the weekend they both came over and smoked a ton of weed. Note that when I’m high I have diarrhea of the mouth and I talk *way* too much. At some point the two slinked off to probably fool around while I watched TV and when they returned I jokingly asked them what they were doing, to which Eddie jokingly replied “Sucking his dick”. This is usually our humor so it wasn’t TMI or inappropriate or anything. 

I joked back “Now I know you’re lying. Logan doesn’t even have a dick!” I thought they’d laugh and play along but instead it got awkward and Logan said something along the lines of “Yep, thanks for the reminder.”.  They were supposed to spend the night but Eddie called it off early after another awkward half an hour and Sunday morning he sent me a text saying jokes like that aren’t really appreciated and he’d like me to apologize to Logan for my “transphobic comment”.

We have a system where we try to plan out our dinners a few days in advance. We both work full time and get off around 4:30, so it’s important for us to know what we want. 

Late last week I had gotten somewhat sick with a stomach virus and was still recovering. However, the day I got really nauseated I ate a salad with a small burger and threw everything up. You know when you eat something while nauseous and throw it up, you kind of turn against it? Well that’s what happened.

So I warned my wife on Saturday: this week I want no salad or burgers. She said ok. Today we get home from work, I ask what we are eating since we both were indecisive. She said she didn’t know but would get it started. I told her I would go take a shower and would be down. 

As soon as I exit the shower, I smell meat cooking. I go down and she literally made hamburgers. I told her “hey, I thought we agreed no burgers for awhile after I got sick?” She replied “well there isn’t anything else to eat, so this is what we are having. Besides you aren’t sick anymore”. 

I sat in stunned silence for the remainder of the cooking and when she gave me the plate, I got up and threw it in the garbage and we got into a spat.

So I work at a kid-friendly theme park, and during Trick or Treat season we give prize bags to kids that do a trail around the whole park and find different items.

  


It was nearly the end of the day, so we were becoming quite lenient when giving out prizes e.g. giving out a prize no matter how many they found.

  


This family walks over, mum, dad, a kid in a pushchair and a kid that was standing.

  


Me: Hi, do you know what's going on here?

  


M: No, can you explain?

  


I then basically cover what they have to do and explain that they can do their best and still get a prize bag.

  


M: Can the little boy get a prize anyway as his brother won't stop crying?

  


Me: Unfortunately not, as long as you do your best that's what matters.

  


M: So he has to miss out because of his screaming brother in a pushchair? (Said quite aggressively ngl)

  


Me: I'm afraid there's nothing I can do; you can try and find some items and then bring it back.

  


Mum then has a little rant at me and the situation, proceeding to call it 'disgusting'.

  


D: Karen! (Not her actual name, just a placeholder)

  


I then decided to hide away in the room I was in so that I didn't have to deal with angry people anymore.

133,Asshole,"I am a high school teacher. At my school, we accept late work without docking points, and we don’t grade on things like participation.

I do not assign homework. The work students do for me is done in class, because I generally don’t believe in adding to students’ schedules. 

This student, Alex, was given bountiful time to read and write various essays in class. 

The issue began when Alex missed an essay we wrote. I allowed her to come to my study hall to write it with my help. This was about 5 weeks ago. She did not write it. When I asked her if I could help, she would ask questions that made it evident she had not even begun to read.
Example: “wait, is Gatsby the narrator?”

She is fully able to to read and has demonstrated so.

Last week I began reminding students that the last day I would accept late or missing work was Friday. Alex now had two essays she hadn’t written. The second essay was based on readings of the students’ choice. She had not done any reading, and so had nothing to write about. 

When I informed her that she would need to read at least three short stories to write the paper, she said “I’ve never had to read to pass an English class before.” 

If a student doesn’t complete the essays, the class is marked incomplete and they must retake it. She knew this, so she spent the entire day Friday writing both essays. 

Instead of doing what the rest of the class was doing, Alex spent the hour typing her essay. I repeatedly told her not to, and she replied with “I’m writing my essay though.” She had been given over a month to write these papers, including extensive in-class time before they were actually due. 

Another teacher mentioned to me that she spent the entire period in his class on Friday typing her essay for me, even though she had missing work for him and he asked her to focus on his class, not mine. She refused.

Finally, at the end of the day Friday she turned both essays in and said “I’ve been around the block a few times, I know how to not do any work and still pass the class.” She then pranced out the door, shouting “yay, I’m not going to fail!”

The point system at my school works in such a way that when I put the grades in for those essays, regardless of quality, she will pass my class with a D. 

However, she hasn’t learned anything from the class. She didn’t do the required reading, and she repeatedly refused to do what other students were doing throughout.

I talked to administration and was told that if she fails my class no one will fight me on it. 

Points-wise, she passes, but I feel like allowing her to pass when I know she didn’t do any work whatsoever, and ignored work in other classes to scrape through last minute, would be sending the wrong message about how to succeed in the world. 

Should I just pass her and be done with it, or WIBTA if I failed her?

EDIT: I would definitely BTA. I was having a moment grading her terrible essays. But I absolutely can’t take my frustration with the policy out on her when I didn’t provide any consequences beforehand or modify my own rules to follow.",606,2250,0.95
134,Not the A-hole,"A and I have been best friends since high school. After HS, I moved away for college but corresponded constantly via phone/etc...

About 5 years ago, A had a complete mental breakdown and manic episode that left him temporarily institutionalized and, eventually, put into the care of his mother. The episode was so intense that, in the aftermath, he was basically ostracized from his entire friend circle. While he was recovering, his mother called me and asked me if I could be there for him as all of his friends had abandoned him. I promised her I would continue to talk to him daily, as well as clue her in when I thought he might relapse. Over the course of 5 years, A has had 2 more episodes. The last one ended with him being thrown in jail for assaulting an officer.

A is basically invalid. He does not think he can hold a job. He is entirely dependent on his aging mother and does nothing but sit in his room all day and play video games. Previously, he drank and smoked heavily, but he is now abstaining as per his probation. He believes weed is the only thing that makes him ""normal.""

A has become insufferable to talk to. He's irritable and argumentative. He's contrarian to the point of asking your opinion just so he can shit on it. He demands that his viewpoints on serious topics be taken despite refusing to contribute to society in any manner. Anything that he does not understand, he will dismiss. It sounds like I am describing a person with severe mental illness- and I am- but A has periods of lucidity where it seems like I am talking to my friend again. Otherwise, he has devolved into a verbally abusive, racist, sexist, homophobic teenager in a 30 year old's body.

I cannot talk to A about my life and my accomplishments because he considers anything that doesn't match in his view of comfort as ""insane."" I.E. he believes me having a career and continuing my education is ""insane"" and berates me for it.

Long story (relatively) short, I walk on eggshells every day with A as I do my best to uphold my promise to his mom. The stress of dealing with a person's constant abuse is taking its toll and I have periods of ignoring his texts. Of course, this only ignites his ire. For the most part, I shrug his BS off and pretend to be the high school version of myself that he remembers and is comfortable to talk to. Recently it is just becoming too much.

I feel horrible but I want to cut A out of my life. I know I don't owe him anything but I'm certain that the trauma of him losing another friend would be devastating on his mental health and, further, the well being of him mom. I want to reach out to his mom and say ""I just can't tolerate his behavior any more."" On the other hand, I feel like I'm being unreasonable to not just suck it up and help out a sick friend in the minimal way that I can.

135,Not the A-hole,"*Tldr my niece asked me if I believe in God, I told her no. My sister is furious I introduced the possibility God doesn’t exist to her kids. AITA?* 

My sister and I were raised Christian, not super Christian, just like church on Christmas and Easter type. 

She grew up and found religion in a big way, married a religious guy, is raising her kids very Christian. They go to a Christian school, their predominant community is their church, all that sort of stuff. 

I have a pretty close relationship with her kids, they don’t live close but talk on the phone every week. 

The oldest is 11 and recently I was out there visiting them and we went to spend some “girl time” just us. 

She asked me whether or not I believed in God. She said she was having doubts. Literally came out of nowhere. I said “You want pizza?” “I don’t know.” “But you love pizza! Aren’t you hungry? What about Chinese?” Then she says “Yah that’s fine. Do you believe in God?” 

I asked what she meant and this is a summary of a much longer conversation but basically she said she was curious because I never go to church and because she asked her mom who wouldn’t answer. 

I said I didn’t personally but there was nothing wrong with believing in God and there are a lot of great things about religion. She asked why I didn’t believe in God and I said (again, just a summary, there was more nuance) “I need to see things to believe them and science explains pretty much everything else.”

The summary was “So God could just, not exist at all, and it could all just be science and stuff” and I said “well that’s what I think but that doesn’t mean it’s right or wrong, no one knows for sure.“ 

So she goes home and this conversation comes up with her mother because she wanted to talk about people who don’t believe in god (as far as I can tell it was in a “Will I see aunt Watermelonactuary in Heaven” kind of way) 

But my sister is furious I’d suggest to her God doesn’t exist and it wasn’t my place to have that discussion with her and I should’ve redirected all these questions back to her parents. 

I kind of thought at the time it was a discussion about my personal beliefs so I was entitled to have it but I didn’t consider how it might confuse or upset an 11 year old because I never “believed” at that level.

I'm a brown woman (23) working in an especially white male dominated branch of engineering. I graduated a couple years ago and landed a job at a small (15 people) firm, where I was the only POC.

There was this guy, Drew (30), a full time tech (not an engineer-he graduated with a two year degree from community college) and had worked there for 3 years already. 

Drew made really racist and sexist remarks constantly while I was there. In my first week, he left an article on my desk about an indian father who flew into the US to beat his daughter. He loudly asked me if my brother and dad take turns beating me, and if my husband would do the same. He'd make comments about my chest size (""I can't imagine someone breaking up with a girl who's got a rack like that"" -Drew, to me, at the Christmas party). He tried to show up to my house randomly once, but neighborhood security would not let him in. 

I made lots of complaints against him, but the owners really loved him for some reason. They paid him around $10k more than me a year, even though I graduated from one of the top engineering schools in the country and he didn't have an engineering degree (this is something I found out because he came and bragged to me about it. I asked the owners why he made so much more, and they said it was seniority). 

Within the first 3 months I had surpassed him in drafting and had to help him all the time. He would stop trying on difficult work because he knew I would fix it. He would harass me during these times and I couldn't focus on my own work because I was always helping him. So I went to management and asked if they would let me make training documents instead to limit my interaction with him. They agreed, so I ended up making a manual around 200 pages long for him to reference. He'd always complain that it was too hard for him to understand, though. However, the company really valued it and would use it to train new employees. 

Anyway, I landed a new job and put in my two weeks. I refused to train Drew during this time. On my last day, I deleted my manual from the servers in a way that it could not be recovered (I handled the office IT as well). 

I've gotten calls from the company asking about it, and I said I didn't know what happened and that it's on them. I know they're really struggling to train their new employees on these workflows that I've developed because Drew never learned them properly and they now have no reference. My friend said it was a real dick move of me because they had paid me to develop that, and the new employees who have never done me wrong are the ones suffering. I just didn't want Drew or the company to benefit from it after their treatment of me, but now I'm not so sure. 

AITA?

Edit: There are a lot of people concerned for my professional references from this company. I just wanted to say that the actual owner/founder (whose name carries a ton of weight in my industry) loves me and has given me great recommendations. I work with him a lot still and we have a great relationship. He's *very* old fashioned and would not get involved in ""office drama"" (what he calls anything having to do with HR). As for legal repercussions, this company has a history of shady business practices that would make it difficult for them to pursue anything against me. I have consulted a lawyer with far more information than what is included in this post.

Another Edit: A couple things worth addressing considering the attention this post has received. 

1. I did not mean to imply that I was better than Drew because of his degree compared to mine. His degree does not help him in his role, and his contributions in his 3 years at the company were pretty minimal. This is why I mentioned it, to point out that neither his degree nor contributions to the company justify his higher salary. I also am able to make design decisions as a drafter, which is something he refuses to learn how to do. He did the bare minimum. There's  reason it only took me a few months to surpass him. 

2. When the company reached out to me about the manual after I quit, they never accused me of deleting it. They reached out asking if I had a version saved somewhere because they had lost access to theirs. They've been having server issues causing files to revert back to previous versions on several files, not just this one. They're still having server issues. I have theories on this, but I'll put away my tin foil hat for now.

3. When I said not recoverable, I meant by the people at the company. Of course if they ever decided to hire an IT company (or some sort of computer company? Idk much about all that) to fix their server issue and restore files, they'd probably pretty easily be able to recover this doc. When we first started having these server issues I tried to convince ownership to contact someone who could help because it was beyond anything I could figure out. They were fine with using our workarounds instead. The company I worked for is NOT an IT company. It was a tiny engineering firm. Anyone with a background in environmental, civil, agricultural, etc can attest to the fact that there are plenty of engineers in the field without a strong computer background.",626,2961,0.94

140,Not the A-hole,"So I’m 24 and my GF is 23, we’ve been together 3 years if that matters. She’s a cute girl and likes to wear cute clothing when she goes out, which usually consists of tight, see through, open middle and spandexy type stuff. 

My gf has got breasts that she claims are hard to find a proper bra size for, and when she wears  these weekend-esq. clothes with an open middle she has frequent nip slips that she doesn’t realize happens, and I mean FREQUENT. Maybe every 4-5 minutes, that don’t get put away until I or someone points it out, for the same thing to happen 5 minutes later. 

Well after a few years of this it’s got on my nerves. I’ve become visibly upset lately when it happens, because I don’t want my gf to parade around with her nipples out. I told her this and to try to find some equally cute clothes that cover this problem, as I’m sure they exist somewhere. A few weekends ago my friends, I and her went out. Before leaving the house she had a few slips and I told her “why don’t you just wear nice, cute clothing like (friends girlfriends name) where her nipples don’t become exposed every 3 minutes?” Well this caused her to become upset and think I was calling my friends girlfriend more attractive or something. That night was basically ruined and we went out with friends and hardly spoke. 

In the last few weeks she’s brought it up several times without closure. Every time stating stuff like “who cares if my nipples come out, they’re just overly sexualized and it’s not a problem if men have their shirt off.” Or “it’s basically the same thing as wearing tight jeans and having a mans penis bulge” to which I countered neither of these things are alike.

She stands her ground that I’m an A-hole who should let her wear what she wants, I stand my ground that it’s trashy and preventable, while looking equally good in alternative clothing. She continues to bring this up every week with no real solution, so I’m asking you reddit (and she’ll read the responses), AITA?",168,204,0.9

I got sick of this shit so I called him out for it on Facebook telling him to stop making this about him and to stop seeking attention and sympathy on Facebook. Millions of people were in New York when this happened who were more affected than he was. He’s not special or unique and what he’s doing is pathetic. Most people supported me while others said I need to be more sympathetic.

142,Asshole,"Background: I’m a fairly damaged human – I have complex PTSD and severe anxiety and social anxiety among other things. So I don’t react to most situations like a ‘normal’ person would. Due to the mental shit and a very painful illness which affects my mobility and energy levels, I rarely leave my home. I’m lucky enough to work from home.
 
My husband (45M, let’s call him Alex) and I (45F) go every year to his sister’s very cool and fun Halloween party. This is practically the only social event I manage to go to each year, and actually enjoy.
 
Alex’s best friend (33M, let’s call him Nick) and I have never really gotten on very well. We both love Alex, so we both tolerate each other fairly politely, and due to all my issues, we rarely see each other. (They work together, so see each other every day, and have ‘boys’ nights’ several times a year at Nick’s place.) Nick is a real ‘bro’ type, and Alex and I are both nerdy types, and I have little love for the whole bro thing, but that’s my problem and I don’t put it on Nick.
 
To finally get to the point, along with all my issues, I also have a severe fear of clowns. It’s not just a little bit scared, but actual pure terror. It kicks in my PTSD fight or flight reaction very strongly to even see photos of clowns. Whether or not you believe coulrophobia is a real thing or not, the physical reaction I have to all clowns – but especially creepy clowns – is very real – racing heart, sweats, nausea, etc. Creepy clowns just fuck me up, and badly. I’ve tried therapy, but nothing seems to help.
 
Nick knows this about me, but I doubt he really understands or gets it. He’s a ‘just get over it’ kind of guy. He wasn’t going to attend, but that changed, and he insists on going as Pennywise. He absolutely loves Halloween and has tons of costumes, so he could come as many things. But nope, it’s has to be Pennywise. Alex has told him how bad I get, but Nick either doesn’t get it or doesn’t care.
 
To be fair, I have no control over the other guests. There could be someone else coming as Pennywise, in which case I would need to spend the party in the guest room. But I don’t expect really anyone to come as a clown, or Pennywise, as they are all very nerdy and would think Pennywise is too ‘mainstream’.

I half-believe Nick is not letting go of the Pennywise thing because he will think it is funny how scared I get. That’s how he is. But I have no proof of that. And I can’t be sure how much Alex has pressed the point since he is a people-pleaser and a very non-confrontational guy.
 
QUESTION: Given my background and how this will likely be the only event I’ll go to this year, AITA to ask Alex to really press Nick about choosing another costume?
 
Tl;dr – I’m genuinely terrified of clowns and husband’s best friend insists on going as Pennywise to the one party a year I can go to. AITA to ask him to choose another costume?",179,284,0.87
143,Not the A-hole,"So, first time posting here.
On mobile with Shakey hands cuz this just happened. 

It started with me scrolling through Facebook where I saw an event in my GFs relationships. I don't remember being mentioned in any posts so i click to look. It says she is married to one of her friends who I know is gay but idk if he is open about it to all of his other friends. 
I take a double take and check his account to make sure I'm not going crazy and see it's true. I screen shot it and message my GF asking what it means, she explained it was a joke bit I wasn't happy about it and asked her to take it down.
She refused and even got the other guy to text me saying it was a joke. 
Story over? Nope.

I would have let this slide,.it's a joke bit then my mother caught sight of the post, next thing I know I'm being questioned by my family about this and.its.getting me stressed. In an attempt to get this to stop I message my Gf asking her to take it down and explain the reason. She refuses and says it wasn't her who put it on. I ask the guy involved and he says it was a joke and refuses to take it down.
Now they're both mad at me and I tried to fix it by apologising for noticing the joke and asking them to take the joke down. But now I just feel like a twist and my family is still shooting about the events and my Gf is mad at me. Am I the Asshole in this situation?

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your advice and oppinions. I had a think about this and actually decided to break up with her, it's not the first time she's treated me like trash so I thought it may have been better to find someone who cares about me.

144,Not the A-hole,"*names changed for privacy
So, this one was a little hard to title. 

My husband and I decided long ago that we would follow his family’s tradition of naming the first boy in each generation Michael. It’s my husband’s name, my FIL’s name, my husband’s grandfather’s name, etc as far back as we can trace. 
We decided then that his middle name would be Anthony, after my father.My father and I were always VERY close growing up (single dad, raised me and my sister by himself, always put us first) and it’s very important to me. It also happens to be my husband’s grandfather’s name.

We tried for 3 years to get pregnant, suffered several miscarriages, honestly didn’t know if we’d ever have a “take home” baby as my doctor called it. But finally, we hit the 18 week mark and it’s our baby boy, Michael Anthony.

We told our dads at the same time and we thought they’d be thrilled. My dad was over the moon excited, can’t wait to be a grandfather, feels so honored and appreciated. My FIL is angry that we’ve chosen the middle name Anthony. Apparently (unbeknownst to us) my FIL had a difficult relationship with his father (Michael Anthony) and asks us to change the name. Bear in mind, because of fertility challenges this will likely be our only child and we’re damn lucky to have him. So we discuss this that afternoon and we agree, we’ll name him Anthony Michael if it’s so important to him, or choose a different name altogether to replace Michael. He starts screaming at my husband that I’m disrespectful and dishonoring the family and destroying a centuries-old tradition (which we didn’t do, actually, because his cousin already had a son and named him Alex). He’s now essentially shunning us and refusing to speak with us until we name him Michael *insert inoffensive middle name here* *lastname*. 

So, reddit, am I the asshole for refusing to change my son’s name to suit my angry father in law and take all that joy and pride from my own father (who, if I did, would not mind at all and would be an excellent sport about it, one of the many thousands of reasons I will not do it.)",162,986,0.95
145,Not the A-hole,"I’ll try to keep this short - basically I won a football signed by some semi-famous ex-football players and was really excited to win because 2 of the signatures are club legends in the club I support. It’s a cool ball too. 

I work occasionally in a supported living place for people with mental illness. I told some of them about the competition before I won it because I was pretty excited about potentially winning and then some of the staff and patients there started saying I should donate the football as a prize for their upcoming darts tournament.

146,Not the A-hole,"This happened years ago in undergrad. 

There were three of us in a four-person dorm that had a kitchen. My friend and I shared one room, and another student had the other to herself. She ran track and one Monday left to go on a week-long track trip. She’d told us about this the week before.

The only issue was that late on Sunday night she’d cooked a huge meal (roasted chicken, rice, vegetables) and left all the dishes in the sink, taking up the entire thing. And she was going to be gone a week. And she didn’t even scrape the food scraps out of the dishes, and the sink didn’t have a garbage disposal. And this *wasn’t* the first time she’d done this. 

I had no way of contacting her until she got back: we weren’t exactly friends on FB and I didn’t have her number.* So I put all the dishes and food waste inside a garbage bag and slipped it inside her room. 

When she returned, she flipped her lid, telling me that I had *no right* to enter her room. I told her that I was sorry she felt I had invaded her space but that I didn’t even enter the room, just opened the door wide enough to place the bag inside, and she shouldn’t’ve left her dirty dishes in the kitchen for a week in the first place.

So, Reddit: AITA? (WITA?)

149,Not the A-hole,"I currently live with someone who's a couple years older than I am. I'm a full-time college senior who's also a TA and a tutor for my department, I'm also currently working on grad school applications, and I deal with some chronic pain problems so basically I don't have a lot of free time or energy to spare at the end of the day. But I've recently learned I really like cooking. I don't make anything fancy, just some of my mom's recipes so it's stuff I really like. It can be hard to find the energy to cook sometimes but I've found getting to have real food even if mine is never as good as how my mom makes it is worth it in the end. I cook with the fact I have GERD in mind. Basically, that means the muscles that keep stomach contents and acid from coming back up my esophagus don't work super well, and there are foods I can avoid to make this less likely to happen. So I don't cook red meat because I don't eat it since I've learned I'm less prone to reflux incidents if I don't eat red meat, so instead I cook with turkey or chicken. Sometimes I make exceptions because one of my favorite dinners has a lot of tomato in it and tomato is not great for me. I share what I make with my roommate. She doesn't cook. She lives almost entirely off of ramen, takeout, and the food I give her. I don't think I've ever seen her eat a fruit or a vegetable. She's expressed recently that she wants some more red meat in her diet to which I said I won't be cooking anything with red meat because I don't eat it, but she can feel free to cook with red meat. She doesn't know how to cook and keeps telling me times she's free for me to teach her how to cook. Our mutual friends seem to think it's a good idea for me to teach her. I wasn't taught how to cook by anyone. I figured it out myself and texted or called my mom whenever I had specific questions. WIBTA if I told her I won't teach her?

150,Not the A-hole,"EDIT: Thanks y'all! I'm not going to talk to any higher-ups unless something like this happens again. I've read many helpful comments and many ridiculous ones, the only thing I feel I need to clarify is that I keep my joking about religious iconography confined to ranty posts on the internet. In fact I just avoid talking about religion in general unless it's with my husband, since most of my nearest and dearest are Christians as well. Some of you also got the reference, so thanks for not immediately accusing me of being one of ""those atheists""! 

So last night at work, it was pretty clear that my manager was stressed out/in a bad mood. During our startup meeting, she was discussing how much work we had to do, improvements we needed to make, and the fact that no one was meeting production goals. Next week is the beginning of peak season, so essentially she was telling us to get our shit together. After her speech, an older lady who was working overtime and from another shift, said, ""After all that we need some good news! I've got some good news for y'all!"" 

When my manager asked her what the good news was, she said, ""Jesus is coming back!"" Now, I found this pretty annoying, but it has less to do with the fact that I'm an atheist and more to do with us being at *work*. I'm used to people inappropriately inserting jesus into random conversations or assuming everyone around them is a Christian (born and raised in Georgia), so I rolled my eyes but knew there was no point in voicing my opinion. Plus, my manager responded with, ""Amen,"" along with one of my coworkers. Safe to say there were more people on the older lady's side than mine. 

This is where it gets worse and where I actually got offended, or rather uncomfortable. After the meeting, when we were all getting our equipment out and getting to our various stations, the older lady came up to me. Only me, from what I saw. She stuck out her hand to give me some Jesus propaganda, and when I tried to refuse (nicely, all I said was no thank you in a pleasant tone), she insisted and said that I needed it. I'm assuming she saw me roll my eyes at her comment during startup. 

I really did not appreciate this at all, and her singling me out like that changed my mind on the whole ""no point in voicing my opinion"" thing. My husband, who works at the same place in another department, was also pretty pissed about it. 

I don't think there's much point in asking my manager to talk to this lady, because she is very much a Christian judging by her southern curly-scripted bible verse T shirts and her lowercase T necklace. My husband says I should bring this up to HR so that someone can tell this lady how not okay it is to confront someone with religion in the workplace.

Me and my ex broke up 1 and a half year ago. It was more or less mutually and we went no contact at first. After 2 month we unintentionally met up pne thing led to another and we ended up being FWB. My decision was clear if I would try dating again, then i would stop the situation. She agreed, but didn't tell me she was tyring to date. I later found out that I was ""the other guy"". She told me that she wasn't serious with them that's why she didn't tell me. It was still a problem for me because to that point we didn't use condoms.  Lucky I didn't catch anything. I know i should have stopped there, but to tell the truth, i was horny and the sex was amazing. So we continued, till I stopped it again, because I met someone who I liked at that moment. She told me she is dating someone too so i thought it was mutually. I later found out that she was dating him for 2 weeks already.

So here comes the ""guy"". He is strongly religious and told her that they would have to wait till marriage, even only for holding hands. She asked me if that was normal because I grew up in the same religion, and i told her no, I never heard of that. And despite everything she married him and suprise suprise he forbid her to be friends with people from the male gender and slowly showed how he really was. He tried to intimidate me because he saw our texts, not anything nasty only frindly texting. I only took screenshots and send them to her. Then i found out that she supports that behavior and willingly gave him my contact infos. After some more belittling from her side i was fed up and told her that she is dead for me and if they ever try to contac me, that he will learn all about our FWB time and all the other man she screwed around. I know it's something on the past and doesn't really define your relationship but still I know that he cares about that. In total they contacted me 5 times, every time trying to blame/accuse me for something. The first 3 times I ignored them completly, the 4th time i gave an angry response and now i just wrote:
""Since you don't seem to understand that i don't want to be contacted by you, go ask your wife with how many men she slept last year and who was the last one. Just to know, if she isn't sincere, it was after she met you.""
I am pretty sure that they will get a divorce over this. AITA for thelling him that, even though i knew they would break up over it?

Why am I asking this, it just didn't feel satisfying. It somehow feels like I did something wrong.


Edit: So yeah I am TA. There are things I didn't think over. But still what I dont get it is the part with the sexual history. If the genders were reversed, most people would definitely write that she needs to know that he cheated on her. So why is it different in this situation?",54,55,0.87

Jade has had a 'boyfriend' for 3 years now. He is a devout Christian (no sex before marriage) and spends most of his time away on business trips. I met Jade 2 years ago and we started full blown dating. When she told me she had a 'boyfriend' (she did the air quotes irl) she told me it was just to keep her parents out of her private life and keep them happy. This was about 4 months into us dating because i found a photo of Jade and Mark on the side and freaked out (obviously). Mark has gotten used to me as a 'best friend' (im almost constantly around) and he's pretty oblivious to our relationship. She never kisses him/does PDA.

I know she's cheating and i'm wrong for partaking knowingly but i love her and i do see myself with her in the future. 

Ill cut to the chase now you have some context. A few days i got sick of the situation and told Jade she needs to tell Mark and leave him so we can be together normally.

My sisters family came by my place on the way to a pumpkin patch with a corn maze. They live a few hours away, so they stopped at my house for a pee break. 

It had unexpectedly gotten a bit chilly outside, so my niece, Elsie asked if she could borrow a jacket.

So I got her one of mine. She ended up saying never mind and that she didn’t think she needed it anymore. I didn’t really think much of it after that. 

My sister called me the next week to tell me that I really upset Elsie. Elsie had just come out as transgender a few months ago and is still dealing with some of the fallout from friends and other family members. 

By offering her a masculine looking jacket I had really upset her and caused her to be hyper focused on her appearance and question herself.

She said Elsie had seen other more feminine looking jackets in my house and Elsie was sure I was going to offer her one of them. My sister says I should have because I should have known how much it would mess with Elsie.

The thing is those jackets are my girlfriends jackets. I didn’t think it was my place to offer them up to someone else.

161,Asshole,"I know my best friend and when she started fawning over lesbian relationships because they were so cute on Tumblr and girls in general are all just angels I didn't mind but when she told me she thinks she likes girls I simply didn't believe her.

I have nothing's against gays, plenty of my friends are, I just don't believe she's a lesbian.
I feel like she's idolizing lesbian relationships.
Not only because Tumblr is full of them but also because she likes to be special. 
Just like she thought she had mental health problems because it was trending on Tumblr...
Anxiety and panick attacks are sooo cool!

I should note that her family is really conservative and she struggles with them quite some times.
But I think being a lesbian is one of the silent revolution she has against her parents. (Her parents don't know, or rather they do kinda know they just don't want to believe it/ignore it)

I'm aware that everyone expresses his sexual orientation differently and of course I have no way of really telling what's going on inside her but I have a hard time believing her.
I totally think she is bi-curious, and even if she were a lesbian I would have no prob with it.
But at this point I think she's just saying it to prove a point...

I didn't just tell her outright I didn't believe her. I assessed the situations that happened and what really and mostly bothered me was the way she glorified lesbian relationships. They are just normal relationships afterall but I guess not in her eyes.

AITA for telling her what I really thought about it?

The dog is large and high-energy, and she needs a lot of supervision.  I knew that, of course, but I missed her and wanted to help him out so no problem there.  I just want to clarify that she's not an easy dog.  So it didn't take me long to kind of question ""why am I doing this again?"" which led me to ask a couple people if it was even possible that he was expecting me to do it for free.  I wanted to nip it in the bud, so I texted him last night to gently ask if he was planning to pay us anything for watching the dog.  He responded with a lot of passive-aggression, told me that he was annoyed that I bothered him on his vacation because he did assume I would do it for free since he ""has never paid anyone to watch her before"".  Ultimately he said he's willing to pay and he offered $10/night because that's what his girlfriend pays her neighbor to look after her cat when she's out of town.

Nobody blew up, and the correspondence ended on a pleasant note but he's still miffed at me for asking and I can tell he's not totally comfortable paying $10/night, partly because I didn't bring it up beforehand, in which case it sounds like he would have tried to find someone else to do it for free.  IDGAF how much he pays, so maybe IATA for asking, but I honestly think it's kind of insane to assume someone would care for a dog for 8 nights as a friendly favor. So now I'm miffed, because he seems super ungrateful and I was primarily doing this to help him out, which is why I tried not to be too pushy about the $ (which was definitely a bad idea on my end).

So... AITA?

Edit: it's looking like IATA, but a couple clarifications:

* We have no dog-sitting precedent.  I've never asked him to watch my dog and this is the first time he has asked me to watch his.  All the more reason to talk details beforehand, yes, but still I think it's unreasonable to assume that 8 full days is a friendly favor.
* I've never asked him to do anything as a favor.  *\[redacted because it's too personal for reddit\]*
* I didn't demand anything, in fact I even said if he doesn't want to pay me that's fine.  I just asked him because we hadn't talked about it.  I was, and still am, fully willing to watch the dog for free.  I just assumed he'd offer something and wanted clarification when he didn't so I asked him.  I'm very direct, and he's an old friend so I thought it was appropriate to text him and ask for clarification.
* Not a clarification, but for those who object to my inconveniencing him during his vacation: consider that he's my friend of 20 years and we text regularly, and that 8 full days of watching a poorly-trained 100-lb dog, for free as many of you suggest, is also a great inconvenience.",92,66,0.88
164,Not the A-hole,"I am 18F. I live with 4 people, for reference we are all 18-19 and go to university. 

One flat mate [19m] has a habit of getting up early, putting clothes in the washing machine and then leaving the house for uni/work for 12 hours+. We do not have a dryer so the washing just sits in there until he gets back and removes it.

I asked him nicely if he could do washing when he’s in the house so he can remove it from the washing machine when it is done. He said sure.

Next week, same story. This time I said “there are 4 other people in this house who need to use it, can you please remove your washing from the machine promptly.” 

Obviously he didn’t listen because yet again I came in to find washing in the washing machine when I really needed to do a wash. This time I got a (clean) black bin sack, put all of the wet washing in the bag, tied it up and put it on his bed and forgot about it. 

What I didn’t know was that he would be staying at his girlfriends a couple of days and now he’s come back he says the clothes are ruined and smell mouldy and I’m going to need to pay to replace them and there was at least £350 worth of clothes in there. He asked me why I didn’t hang them up to dry.

From my perspective I have asked him respectfully twice, I am not his mother, I am not going to hang his washing. If it was a one off and someone texted me asking to hang it as a favour I would but in this situation I feel like he had it coming and I am not going to pay for the clothes. He can take me to small claims or whatever but I’m not just going to hand him that sort of money for something he had been told not to do.

AITA here?


Edit: Some people have asked why a bin bag, why not a basket. I’m going to be honest, we’re students and don’t have a basket to our name. If there was a more appropriate receptacle in our house I probably would have used it. My main concern was that the clothes were wet and I didn’t want to get his bed wet because that would have really been a dick move. Also, on putting the clothes in the bag I assumed he’d be back in a few hours, rather than a few days.

Edit 2: I’ve also enjoyed the discussion over how different cultures dry their clothes, I didn’t know how much knowledge I’d gain from this!",320,836,0.96

166,Not the A-hole,"I'm \[21M\] in college and sharing a 3 bedroom apartment with three of my roommates. Over the weekend, my roommate (Mark) car pooled up to a city about 3 hours away to see his girlfriend at her college and on his way back picked up two German girls who were in the US as tourists and brought them back to our place. He met the girls on campus and Mark and his girlfriend spent two days with them showing them around and stuff. The girls were our age and they were staying at an Air-BNB but decided to leave because the host refused to put on clothes while they were staying with him. So my roommate (Ben)  and I felt bad and agreed to let them stay in our place for a night while they found new accommodations.

Although the other Ben and I were a bit annoyed that he didn't ask before promising them lodging we agreed they could sleep on our couch for one night as they were in a bad situation. Also the girls looked nice and trustworthy so we didn't think much of it. Well the next morning the girls are gone and so is my laptop and camera lenses that I keep in a drawer in the living room. They wouldn't have found the items unless they were going through our stuff. Ben had some of his things stolen as well. We filed a police report and gave the best detail we could, but we didn't have any way of reaching them and we didn't even know if the names they gave us were real.

Anyways, in total I lost about $2,000 worth of stuff and Ben lost about the same. We unfortunately don't have any renters insurance so we decided that Mark should be at least partially responsible for the theft. Ben and I asked Mark to reimburse us for half the damages and we would be responsible for the other half as we did ultimately agree to let them stay. Now Mark is saying he thinks its unfair as we agreed to let them stay, so once we did that it was no longer his responsibility. Ben and I are arguing that if we had not been put in a position that Mark put us in (bringing the girls three hours from their original lodging to our place) then we wouldn't have agreed. Mark thinks it was just a bad situation all around, but he shouldn't be responsible for paying for the damages as he had some stuff stolen as well. AITA for asking Mark for partial reimbursement of the things that were stolen?

UPDATE: Thanks everyone for your input. Ben and I never had any intention of suing Mark for damages, we're all good friends and don't think $1,000 bucks each is worth ruining that. Mark spoke to his parents about the situation and they thought it was the right thing to do to reimburse Ben and I so they offered to pay our rent for one month. It's not half of the stuff that got stolen, but it was a very nice gesture and we've accepted in lieu of Mark reimbursing us. Mark has been beating himself up about this so we're taking him out for a beer tonight.",34,142,0.94

We got randomly assignment partners, and I got assigned with a classmate who has a really thick accent. Like I can pick up 2-3 words for every sentence she says. I tried to work with it for a couple days, but ultimately I can not understand her. I tried asking her via email if we could communicate through there because I couldn't understand her, but she got offended and said that I was being prejudiced against her. 

I spoke to the professor and he confessed that he also has difficulty understanding her at times, so I'm not taking crazy pills. I switched partners with someone who speaks her mother tongue and the project was completed.

169,Not the A-hole,"Hey All,

My (F22) Boyfriend (M24) and I got together a couple of months ago and things are going great. This is his first relationship and, while I have been on several dates before, this is my first real relationship as well. We are currently having a financial dispute, which worries me as this is how most couples break up.

My boyfriend is in law school, which costs $27K a year in tuition, which his parents are paying for. His parents also pay his rent $1K / month (including internet and utilities) (it's a basic studio 55 mins from downtown - rent is pricey here). He is however responsible for the rest of his expenses including textbooks, groceries, etc. He has substantial savings from his various part time and summer work over the years. His parents are middle to upper-middle class.

I am in a Masters Program, so my tuition is covered and I get enough of a stipend to cover basic living expenses. For all practical purposes though, my parents are fully supporting me paying for everything. My family is well off, making around $450K a year.

It is also worth noting that if this relationship becomes serious and he lets his parents know about me, they will cut him off (as I am of a different religious background).

Anyways, we originally started splitting the bill equally on dates, but later moved to an 80-20 model, while I paid 80% of the costs. We are in a dispute over which model is more fair.

My boyfriend suggests that 80-20 is fair since my family is a lot more richer than his is. I think that 50-50 is fair, we are equal partners, each of us has resources, so we should split dates. It's not like he is destitute or anything.

AITA?

170,Not the A-hole,"  

I teach college English. I recently used Service Learning (SL) as part of my ""promotion portfolio"" to earn promotion to associate prof. I shared this at a SL meeting. A math prof from India asked me to share my portfolio with her via e-mail. 

Flash forward 3 months: the math prof asked me to ""edit"" her portfolio for her. I said I didn't edit for free, but I'm happy to skim the SL section & give my thoughts. She sent her whole 70-pg portfolio. I did an MS Word compare and found that she plagiarized a LOT of my wording (whole paragraphs of direct language) for the SL section. The rest of her portfolio used my data charts, organizational pattern, page design, etc., and even some of my language in areas not related to SL.

I replied: ""Hello, At a quick glance, I'm concerned about what I see here. It looks like you plagiarized my portfolio."" I then explained what was plagiarized and that people have been fired in the past for submitting plagiarized portfolios, since this is academia (this is true)

She replied at 2am: ""Wow, I am shocked. I will revise and send it to you for you to edit."" At 4am, she sent me a new version: ""Please edit new version."" Around 5am, she sent another copy: ""Made more changes.""

I teach from 9am-12:30pm & don’t check e-mail first. She found my classroom and came on in while I was teaching. I said, ""I'm teaching right now!?! We can talk later."" 

Immediately after class, I was with my boss in my office when she stepped in and said, ""Can we talk now?"" I snapped, ""I'm in a meeting!""

Around 2, I checked my e-mail. The revised version was slightly improved. I went to her and explained there was still plagiarism and that I built my portfolio from scratch and she should do the same. I encouraged her to visit the college Writing Center for more help understanding plagiarism or writing her portfolio, but that I didn’t think I’d have time to help anymore before it’s due. 

Later that day, I got another e-mail from her: ""I completely rewrote the portfolio here for your review. Please send grammar edits by noon tomorrow. Portfolio due by COB tomorrow.""

The part where I may have been an asshole: I didn't open her attachment. I sent the promotion committee chair an e-mail with context and asking them to compare our portfolios when she submits hers. 

My side: She works at a college and should be aware of plagiarism—but at least theft. I put a LOT of effort into the design, writing, and ideas in my portfolio; as an academic, my ideas are my products. She needed to use other resources (paid or available free on campus) once I basically said I was out.

Her side: she’s a math prof from another academic culture, so likely less familiar with plagiarism than someone in humanities/US education. She's probably insecure about her writing skills and anxious about the process (which I already did successfully), and likely saw me as someone she trusts who can help.

171,Not the A-hole,"Let me preface this by saying I try very hard to be the best person I can be.
I went out on a date with a boy I met online and we decided to go to Cracker Barrel. Things started out normal. We met our waitress and she took our drink orders. After awhile she brings them back and takes our meal order. We end up waiting for our meal for over half an hour, which normally would be okay except the restaurant was almost completely empty. She never came by to refill our drinks once and I even had to flag down another staff to get us more. When our food did finally arrive, my date’s order was incorrect. We almost ended up missing out movie and only saw our waitress twice. 
I’m not entirely sure if my date tipped her, but I suggested not to because of the long delay and nonexistent service. I later told my mom, who is a former waitress, and she was livid. She went into a series of arguments and tangents that didn’t make sense to me. She said “maybe she was having a bad day” and “she probably didn’t serve you well because she thought you weren’t gonna tip regardless.” The former isn’t an adequate excuse for not doing your job and the latter is blatant discrimination if she didn’t perform well because she assumed I was stingy with money. My date and I ended up having a good date, but we both feel content with not awarding an absent server who let her responsibilities fall on other staff members. I understand the food being late may not have been her fault, but still. She could’ve at least expressed some sort of apology for the delay. AITA for being mad that over the course of a meal close to an hour we only saw her twice and so didn’t offer an standard tip?

174,No A-holes here,"I want to preface this by saying I love and respect my wife. She's my better half in every sense, and I don't know what I'd do without her. I absolutely do not think of her as a ""trophy"" or object.

Since before our wedding day we've had an inside joke.

When we first met I was unemployed and she was a waitress, but she did some modelling for her boyfriend at the time, a photographer. Within a couple years we were dating and after we got together I'd gotten an internship at a company that turned into a full time, well paying job, while she had started working as a teacher in a public school.

Since my internship turned into a full time job I earned more than her, about 2.5x what she does on average. When we were planning our wedding she said we should start saving for x, y, and z, and I said I could pay for all of it right now. She said something like ""oh my god I'm a trophy wife"" but she laughed when she said it and she found the situation funny.

It's become a recurring joke whenever our income is mentioned or I have a work event that she comes to that she jokingly refers to herself as a ""trophy wife"" due to the difference in income and the number of events where she ends up being my plus one. I've made the joke myself in private more than once, and she's always found it funny.

Then last night I had another work thing, she got dressed up and came with me, and I made the joke in front of a female coworker I was friends with. I don't remember the exact phrasing now but my wife offered to get us each another drink while we talked, and I replied in a way that used the phrase ""trophy wife"" in a way that was clearly joking, and my wife laughed and explained ""it's an inside joke"" plus a summary of the joke to my coworker, but the coworker looked a bit put off.

She waited until my wife left and then gave me a verbal beat down over how I referred to my wife. I repeated that it was just a joke when my wife came back. My coworker glared at me for the rest of tonight and again today but it's not had any further repercussions, and I told my wife what happened and asked if she was alright with my joke and she said she thought it was funny.

176,Asshole,"We don’t give our kids soda at all unless it’s a special occasion then we only do a little bit of sprite.


We recently hired a nanny that brings a Coke with her daily. Most of the time she accidentally leaves it in the fridge. 


It’s caused a lot of back and forth with me and the kids because they question why she drinks it if it’s so unhealthy and obviously it can’t be that bad if she drinks it. 


I really wanted to not frame soda as a big evil, just something you drink on occasion but it’s kind of hard when they see their nanny drink it constantly. Not to mention, after she leaves, my oldest will beg to have a sip of her leftover drink.



I reminded her that she keeps leaving her soda and to please take it because we don’t like having soda in the house at all. 


WIBTA if I asked her to just stop bringing it and drinking it all together?



EDIT: well this blew up way more than I expected! There are way too many comments to reply individually so I want to address some things.



First: “just tell the kids no”. I understand that and I DO just tell my kids no but I have never been a “because I said so” parent. My mom was and i hated it. I don’t make up rules for fun. I make up rules for a reason and I plan on telling the kids this reason.


I do not want my kids blindly following a rule about something as simple as soda “because I said so”. I want them to grow up understanding why we don’t drink soda so when the time comes for them to make choices, they can make that choice from an educated viewpoint. 


When they go to school and a friend’s house I don’t want them to automatically accept soda because “mom’s only reason for not drinking it is because she said so and she’s not here” 



So that brings us to my second point. The reason we don’t allow soda is because it’s unhealthy if you drink a lot of it. Yet they see their nanny drink it every day. This means their nanny is unhealthy(in a child’s mind). I don’t want them to see their nanny as unhealthy because she is one of their role models. PLUS I feel like a dick for saying such a thing about her. I have no doubt that my kid would blabber to the nanny about how mom says she’s unhealthy. It makes me look bad to the nanny and it makes the nanny look bad to the kids.



“Tell them it’s an adult drink” no. That is a lie. It is not an adult drink. It’s a drink for everyone that we choose to not drink. 



I fully understand that I’m the parent but she is our nanny. She’s supposed to make our lives easier and enrich their lives while she is here. This is just causing unneeded arguments and disputes after I’ve had a long day of work.

He’s been making a big deal over our minor mess-ups which is usually something like scissors left on the table or a piece of clothing that fell from the laundry. He picks it up and announces to the whole house, even if nobody is in the room, “OH LOOK, someone left the scissors out, let me get THAT for you.” And then complains how he’s sick of us. He’s told me on multiple occasions that I suck as a human being and how I need to “fix myself”. 

This all comes back to what happened on Friday. We were all getting ready for my grandpa’s ninetieth birthday and we were cleaning up for the dog sitter. I vacuumed, I cleaned the shower, my room, the living rooms, the mirror, and the table. Everything that was asked of me. It was 10:00pm by this point in the day, because we took some people to dinner and had just got back. I was tired. So I went to bed. I was woken up to my parents yelling at me because my volleyball uniform wasn’t packed. No need to pack it because my volleyball tournament came first in the day. So I went back to bed. 

I’m unsure how much longer it was but my dad comes in the living room singing the same line of the same song over and over and over again. My ears hurt and I rolled over, but I didn’t say anything (I sleep on the couch). He then yelled at me for my volleyball clothes and how I’m so irresponsible and that I needed to do more around the house. And then he said to me, “Stop being so goddamn lazy and put down your fuckin’ phone.” When I was asleep-ish. I went back to bed. 

On our way to the volleyball tournament he brings up his technology cleanse. When I ask why, he hits me with how I was so irresponsible because I didn’t pack and because it’s all because of my phone and my computer. I didn’t argue, expressing your opinions to my dad just makes him get more angry and makes him punish you even more. So I don’t say anything anymore, I just “mmhmm” and “yup”.

178,No A-holes here,"My sibling and I share a mother and have different fathers. Our mother is dead, and sibling's father suffers from depression and has a lower I.Q, making it difficult for him to cope with situations. He loves and cares for S (sibling,) but it doesn't seem to be even close to enough.

&#x200B;

I have pressure from spouse's family to take S every weekend. I can't/ won't do this anymore. I work, school, and have my own toddler and spouse. Week days and ends are very busy. I am dealing with my own mental illnesses and require times of solitude to recharge for the next day/ week.

&#x200B;

S is a good kid, they aren't rude or violent. They are in grade school, but poop their pants regularly and lie about it. If you ask S if they've pooped, they will tell you no. You have to force them to change underwear and shower. Toddler and S play together very nicely, very rarely any fighting at all. But they both get rowdy and need to be told to quiet down multiple times, which really isn't an issue most times.

&#x200B;

S has issues eating and requires redirection back to every meal. S gets distracted and leaves the meal, and needs to be told to please continue eating at least 10 times during a meal. S's doctor has informed the father that S needs to eat more, as they are very underweight. S is very picky, refusing to eat anything that isn't pizza, tacos, wonder bread (very few fruits and veg,) so when S is here, I make whatever I know they will eat and gently push a fruit or veg with each meal.

&#x200B;

I have not been taking S regularly, averaging about once per month. My spouse's family will go and pick S up and S will stay at their house. S and spouse's family are close. Spouse's family puts a LOT of pressure on me to go and pick S up every weekend. 80% of the conversations I have with spouse's family are about  how I need to take S for more sleepovers. While spouse's family has a good heart, they are not taking into consideration all of the factors when pressuring me to take S. I am not S's parent. When our mother was alive, I took S as much as I could because I knew our mother was a poor parent.

&#x200B;

This is the part that I struggle with, as I know it is very selfish. I do not want to be S's parent or caregiver anymore. I cannot do it without neglecting my own child. S requires a lot more attention and redirection than my toddler. I have my own family to take care of, and S's father needs to learn how to take care of S. Spouse's family does not feel this way, as ""S is my sibling, and I have an obligation to care for their well being, and it's selfish of me to not take S because of the slight issues occur."" I have taken S for several straight days, and by the end, I am exhausted and want to get drunk.

179,Asshole,"My parents are somewhat well off and purchased me a flat for me to live in whilst I work in the city 4 years ago. I make a good wage and could most probably have bought it myself with a mortgage so most of my wage goes into my savings now. I've been with my GF for 3 years now and she was looking for somewhere to move to when I suggested she move in with me. The average rent for the area I'm in for an en-suite bedroom is about £1000 so I told her to just pay £500 and we'd be good.

This of course made her question how I'd be able to afford the rent if she was paying such a low amount and she questioned whether she'd have her own room. That's when it came up that I owned the property out right and I'd essentially be her landlord. She seemed okay with this until she asked how much my mortgage was when I explained that there was none and it had been bought by my parents.

This led to a huge argument where she accused me of never mentioning that my parents were rich and that as I didn't need the money I shouldn't be charging her rent and she'd only contribute to bills. I retaliated that she's more than welcome to find somewhere else to live and just because she was my GF didn't mean she could live for free.

Now,  I have a wife with some health issues.  She looks really sick. She's skinny, blind from one eye and she's dealing with depression and a severe eating disorder. 
It would shatter her if someone purposely let her know that they're making fun of her appearance, plus, we have a 2yo daughter so I must admit I may be overly sensitive about that. 

Back to the supermarket queue.

There she was yet again laughing at my face literally.  That's not what upset me. I was blown away,  how can this mother try to pass on this kind of behaviour to her own daughter?  I approached her and said, ""  do you want me to buy something for you to eat?  Because tbh you really look like a crackhead and that must be hard on your daughter having to see her own mother looking like that. I noticed you laughing, are you high right now?  Tss tss what a shame"" 

Her face turned red as there were more people eavesdropping by now , but said nothing.  I finished with "" you know what,  real men might not wear pink, but I'm pretty sure I would never teach my daughter to make other people feel bad about their appearance"" . 

Was I out of line? I kinda feel guilty for the kid but,  I honestly don't think I was in the wrong. AITA?


Edit: thank you guys for really letting me have it.  I agree with most commenters . Also , great suggestions on how to handle it better.

182,Not the A-hole,"Like the title says, I went in for a pap test this morning and it was a really bad experience. 

To start, I thought it'd be my family doctor doing it, but when the nurse showed me to the room she said ""[woman's name] will be here in a few minutes to get started"" and I was like who? She explained that this woman (I don't know if she's a gyno or a general doctor) does all the pap tests. That's not a huge deal, but it would've been nice to know beforehand.

So the woman comes in and we get started, everything is going fine for a while. 

Something important is that she had me in a position where my legs were bent with my knees facing left and right, and my two feet touching, to make a kind of diamond shape. I've never had a pap test where they had you positioned like that.

The reason it's important is because after a while one of my legs started to cramp really badly from the position I was in. So I said ""can you stop? My leg is starting to cramp badly and I really need to stretch it out.""

She just said ""we're almost done here, just power through it.""

She didn't say it in like a mean or mocking way, just kind of brushing me off.

I asked her again to stop because at this point I was biting my lip from how painful the cramp was, and she said no again.

I couldn't take it any more and involuntarily stretched my leg out, and she immediately pinned my leg down to the bed/table with her free hand and told me not to do that.

The thing is I don't know if I overreacted after that. I had a traumatic experience happen in the past, and when she pinned my leg down I just kind of shut down. After she finished the test and left the room so I could get changed I felt like I was outside my body, if that makes sense? And then I just sat in my car feeling like I was going to puke until I felt okay enough to drive home. 

Writing it out it feels stupid. She didn't touch me inappropriately, but she also didn't stop when I asked her to and pinned my leg to the bed/table thing. 

I don't know. I kind of want to report her for that, but I can't tell if I'm just reacting so badly because of the thing that happened in my past. And I don't know if her stopping to let me stretch my leg would've made her have to start the test all over or something. I feel like my normal meter is broken and don't know what to do, but if I wouldn't be overreacting by reporting it then I want to do it today so they don't ask why I waited to speak to management.

WIBTA if I made a complaint about this?

**EDIT:** I feel like I made it sound like I had an issue with the position, or found it unusual. It didn't bother me that she had me get in that position for the test. The reason I mentioned it in the post is because it explains why my leg would be cramping (which is way less likely to happen with stirrups) and why she was able to pin my leg to the bed/table (also not as easy to do with stirrups). I mentioned that I'd never been positioned like that before for this kind of test because I'd never had my leg cramp during a test before, almost certainly because all my previous tests involved stirrups. **The position isn't really the issue here, it's just the thing that caused the issue (the leg cramp).**

**EDIT 2:** Thank you to everyone. I'm off to make a complaint with the clinic.",351,1948,0.96
183,Not the A-hole,"So my SO is an extremely picky eater. He only likes to eat chicken, rice, fries, and carrots which has a pretty big impact on my own diet considering we live together. I'm extremely adventurous when it comes to food, and having had the privilege to travel to various parts of the world with my family I've also been lucky enough to have eaten a lot of unique and weird things not found where I live. 90% of the time I don't mind shaping what we eat at home around my SO's preferences, though sometimes when it comes to restaurants we have disagreements on where to go but it never becomes a big issue.

Here's where the problem is; we have a trip planned to go to Spain, specifically Madrid, Barcelona, and Bilbao. As food is naturally part of visiting another country, my SO began to bring up his concerns and asked we go to places that offered stuff he liked to eat, which I found out was way more difficult than I thought and turned up mostly fast food joints. I told him that this trip was something that we should use as an opportunity to explore other cultures as in-depth as possible, and part of that includes trying new foods that he may end up loving or hating and never having to try again. My SO said he refuses to try things he is unfamiliar with and was worried that he'd be unable to eat at all during the 2 weeks we'd be in Spain, which I said was a silly concern if he'd be a little more open to eating other foods; nothing wild like barnacles or cow tongue, but maybe paella, jamon iberico, stuff that wasn't crazy but also cuisine that was generally attributed to Spain and not easily found where we live. He didn't budge from his position, and in fact said that if it comes down to it we would simply eat separately at different restaurants to compromise. I told him I'd prefer it not come to that, as I want the trip to be a shared experience and having to eat alone because of my SO's pickiness makes me sad and would kinda kill the vibe of the trip in general. 

AITA for encouraging him to eat new things in a foreign country?",296,266,0.91

188,Not the A-hole,"Alright, time to try to consolidate this complicated and shitty situation. If there's anything that needs clarification, let me know.  
  
Cast of characters:  
  
**Sister** - 27F - In a relationship with her boyfriend of over a year, also lives with me as my roommate and pays rent
**Me** - 31M  
**Friend** - 37M  
  
So, to preface this weekend, I've been dealing with the very slow death of a friend of mine who I've known for 19 years or so. On Saturday, his pancreatic cancer finally took him at the age of 31. I've been taking it sort of harshly. I let Friend know, since the two had met at a few of my cookouts and he replied immediately with ""well, if you need to get out and get a drink, let me know and we can get your mind off things.""  
  
Great.  
 
So, quick flashback. About 2 weeks ago, Friend and I met up to go to a show. While we were chatting, Friend casually mentioned matching with my sister on Tinder a while ago, but told me that he would never do anything with her ""out of respect for me and our friendship.""  

I had already texted Sister and invite her out to join us. After a few drinks she brings up the friends of mine she's hooked up with, and she just wouldn't stop talking with giddy excitement about how they'd talk about the risk of being ""found out"" by me while they were in bed together. The show is a lot of fun, but my sister ends up staying at Friend's house for a while to ""chat"" after we get home. I don't think much about it because she is fiercely protective of her boyfriend.  
  
Ok, back to the present. Friend and I have a few drinks at the bar, head home, and have a few more at my place. Sister comes in from work and hangs out with us. It gets late and I end up dozing off lightly on the couch. I wake up to the sound of lips smacking and look over. Just a few feet from me, in the kitchen, the two of them are making out. They hear me get up and shoot apart. I get up a few minutes later and don't say much of anything, just tell them that I'm going to bed.  
  
The next morning, I ask Sister if she ""had fun with Friend last night,"" she lies and says ""oh, yeah, we just played with the dogs."" I texted Friend and asked him what was up the whole ""out of respect for you I won't get with your sister"" thing, and he told me I was absolutely right and apologized profusely.  
  
Now, my family is very close and open. I went over there last night, on Sunday, and when they asked how the night out went I told them pretty much everything. I mentioned that I felt pretty hurt and betrayed by all of it. I was a bit surprised by my mom's reaction. She basically told me to ""get over it."" That they were adults making adult decisions and that I was being petty for feeling the way that I feel about the situation, and for thinking about bringing it up to my sister and confronting her on why she feels the need to constantly seek sexual thrills with my friends, especially since this whole ""risk of being caught"" seems to be the thing she focuses on.",58,75,0.94
189,Asshole,"**Background:** my friend (lets call him Nick) and I live in the netherlands, and we both recently moved here, although each one of us lives in a different city. I stayed for the weekend in his house, and he has given me breakfast, although every time we go out we always split the bill.

**The actual question:** when I came here, I brought three boxes of truffles for us and two friends of him (we were gonna divide the three boxes for the four of us). In the end, neither of his friends wanted to trip with us, so Nick and I ate a box each and we got a spare box.

We then found out that another friend (Mark) was on vacation in the city we were in, so we met up with my Mark, and I sold him the extra box of truffles. Neither I nor Nick were planning on eating any more that weekend.

During the weekend, sometimes I offered to pay for him when we were buying cheap things (i.e. soda or water) and he did the same thing.

The thing is that both Nick and I are college students, so we have tight budgets. I spent 42 euros on the three boxes, expecting Nick and his friends to repay me for what they ate. So, WIBTA if I asked nick to pay me back 14 euros for the truffles he ate, or should I just let it slide? (I know that for some of you 14 euro might not be much, but to me it is a lot, that is what it costs for me to eat a whole week when I budget, so letting this slide means that I have a lower monthly budget)",24,30,0.92
190,Not the A-hole,"I was at my in law's house yesterday, alone with their god daughter (we'll call her Ashley, she's 28), while my husband was out doing stuff with his parents to discuss important family matters. I was already feeling pretty stressed and anxious about how their conversation was going to go. I don't really have a great relationship with Ashley, so I was just keeping to myself in one of the guest rooms on my laptop with a large glass of wine. About an hour later she comes in, panicked, asking if she can borrow my car. Apparently, her high school aged sister got in a really bad fight with their extremely dysfunctional father and needed to be picked up.

My car is a new Mercedes that cost me around 80 grand. I absolutely did not want her taking my car, especially somewhere that was almost an hour away. I asked her if their dad got physical with her sister in this fight and she said no. So, I told her I would rather her wait until my in laws got back and see if she could take their car. 

She starts yelling at me that they probably won't be back for a few hours and she needs to get her sister ASAP. I told her that unless she believes her sister's safety is at risk, I don't feel comfortable with her taking my car. She asked if I could drive her to get her and I told her I had too much wine to drive. She then proceeds to shit on me for being ""irresponsible"" for drinking and not anticipating I might have to drive, as well as ""selfish"" for not letting her take my car.

When they get back, she asks to take their car and makes a huge deal about how I wouldn't let her take mine. She goes on about how my ""fancy car is more important than a child in crisis"". I told them she said the girl wasn't in any danger and she tells me to fuck off before she gets in their car to leave. 

My in laws said she's just being an overprotective big sister and not to worry about it. When my husband was driving us home he told me I made the right call because Ashley is a very reckless driver, and totalled a car a couple years ago after driving too fast. However, the next morning my in laws text me that Ashley was incredibly upset and I should have just let her take my car.

191,Not the A-hole,"

My friends Jess, Megan, and I rent a house. We're all recent college graduates, young professionals, and we're decent roommates to each other and decent neighbors, as far as I can tell.

The house we rent is part of a homeowners association, and the way the laws work is that the HOA has a legal contract with the homeowner. And the homeowner who is leasing out a property has a legal contract with his tenants. But the HOA has no authority over the tenants legally; it's on the landlord to include the HOA rules in his lease with the tenants.

Anyway, some of the HOA rules were in the lease, like only having cars parked in the garage and driveway, none on the street. And like no political signage in the front yard. But there were relatively few; the lease was pretty much your standard lease. 

Anyway, neighbors have come over several times to tell us about HOA laws were breaking. Not just the same few neighbors, there have been like 8. For example:

They said we could not have junker cars in the driveway, and I was like ""it's not a junker, it runs, I drive it everyday. Plus you should be taking this stuff to Landlord, he's the homeowner in your association."" The guy went off on me about how having car's like mine around lowers the property value and I was like ""my agreement was with Landlord, my lease says nothing about what cars I can have.""

They don't like how my roommate has astrology wall tapestries over the windows instead of curtains. Or how we have a fire pit outside. Or how many friends we have over even though we never break the rules about cars. Few of our friends drive.

They told my roommate it's not allowed to do DIY projects like woodworking or car maintenance in the drive way. And told me about noise rules that do not line up with the city noise ordinance. They told my roommate her friends can't lock their bicycles up to the deck railing.

Anyway, every time, we tell these people, that their contract is with the homeowner. And our contract is with our landlord. We're following our contract, their contract is between them and Landlord. And they've complain that The landlord is hard to get a reach of, he travels a lot, he's not communicative. And we are the ones living in the community, we need to follow it's rules.

AITA for blowing all them off?

--

Edit to everyone saying ""read your lease, it should say this or that..."" We've read the lease. It doesn't say a thing about HOA, even indirectly. 

My roommate also had a local lawyer look at the lease and the local laws; that's where I got the info about the laws in this post. I'm gonna trust a lawyer who knows my area's laws over what Reddit thinks the law should or might be. 

We can't get fines passed down unless they're for violating our lease agreement, we can't get evicted by our landlord if we pay rent and follow the lease terms. The HOA can't evict us either.",493,1458,0.96
192,No A-holes here,"My boyfriend and I have been happily together for over 6 years. When it comes to sleep, I am an incredibly light sleeper and find it difficult to sleep, however my boyfriend is the complete opposite.

He likes to watch videos to fall asleep. For some bizarre reason, the sound of middle aged men shouting about The Witcher really soothes him. The noise and the light keeps me awake, so he bought headphones and I wear an eye mask. The problem is that my brain can't switch off knowing his phone is on and that he is more than likely going to pass out and have videos playing all night. This happened the other night and he didn't have his phone on charge. His phone died and he was late for work as his alarm didn't go off. Suffice to say, my anxiety brain does not like that. 

He wakes up for work super early (first alarm at 5:30am, second at 5:40am, leaves at 6am). At the latest, I can wake up 50mins after his first alarm goes off. About a year back, I was getting up earlier (6am) just as he was leaving so I could get to work early. I realised that I could have an uninterrupted 20 min snooze once he left so I started doing that. He got his night time YouTube, I got my morning 20 min snooze.

Recently, he has realised that he also doesn't have to leave until 6:20am - the end of my snooze. So he still wakes up at the same time, has a 10 minute snooze, plays on his phone in bed for 15 mins, then gets ready for work. He is now leaving when my snooze is supposed to end. As I am a light sleeper, Ive now ended up waking up at his first alarm and have not been able to get back to sleep. As someone who needs a full 8 hours a night, this is not working.

I asked him this morning whether he could get ready for work earlier, or not play on his phone so I could get my snooze in, but he just replied in an aggravated tone ""fine I'll just wake up earlier than I already do then"". I said he can interrupt my sleep at night or in the morning, but not both. 

AITA for wanting some god damn sleep at some point in the night?

Edit: we talked, he downloaded SleepTimer, I listened to white noise before bed, I will be purchasing Calm, he didn't go on his phone for too long this morning, and I got my full 20 minute snooze. Thank you for all the great tips, we greatly appreciated them.",779,2363,0.94

He's originally from Germany, but he's been living in the Netherlands for over 10 years now. No one in his family speaks Dutch, he's expressed disappointment about never being able to being friends or girlfriends home, or inviting his family here because of the language barrier.

I started to learn German about 6 months ago, I suck at languages and never took any in high school, but I figured it would be nice if we continued dating, and even if we broke up I'd have learned a new skill. I can speak or understand it pretty well, but I can't read or write it. 

My boyfriends birthday was a few days ago, I invited his direct family (mom, dad, brothers and sisters) and some of his friends, paid for their train tickets, and baked a cake. We had a surprise party for my boyfriend when he came home from work. 

The party itself was great. He was very happy to see his family (they skype, but only visit a few times a year) and everyone had fun. 

The problem came after the party. We where cleaning up when he asked ""So where's my gift?"" I felt a bit hurt, and told him that me learning a new language for him was my gift this year. He got quiet and went to bed soon after.

197,Asshole,"Hi, so recently I had a bit of a situation with my co-workers that made me wonder if I've been acting rudely towards them without realizing it.

First off, I (23f) should explain that I'm quite a private and generally more quiet person. It takes me awhile to open up with people and I don't like casually discussing my private life at work in any case.

I think the main issue here is that I'm currently working at a really small firm, with only my boss and two other (female) co-workers. There's another woman at the office, a bit older, but she's only renting one of the rooms for her own business.

Another issue is that I personally know the other two girls, because we studied at the same uni. I don't know them well, mind you, I only took 2 classes with them throughout the entirety of my studies. However, they're a lot closer and friendlier with each other.

So the three of us obviously work in a small environment together, have lunch and coffee every day etc. During breaks, my co-workers often start talking about something that's obviously a private topic between them; e.g. recently, they've been talking about some guy one of them met on Tinder. I feel uncomfortable listening to that because I feel like I'm eavesdropping, but if I just get up and leave whenever they start talking to each other a bit more, I'll come off as impolite. Therefore when that happens, I tune out respectfully (at least I think so?) and browse through my phone until they switch back to a more general topic.

However, they caught me off guard the other day, when one of the girls asked me for my opinion about a specific situation with her guy from Tinder. I didn't know what she was talking about, because as I said, I didn't listen to their private conversations since it seemed inappropriate for me to eavesdrop. But my co-workers were kind of surprised, maybe a bit offended, that I didn't listen to them at all. They said they wouldn't talk about that in front of me if it was a terribly private topic. I personally thought they just organically started talking about something between them since they're close, and that didn't necessarily mean I should participate in the conversation. Not to mention I don't really want to.

199,Asshole,"Hey guys 

On mobile, so excuse the formatting.

I really don't know what to think here... So I'll ask you guys of I'm the asshole.

Basically.. Me and my wife have been together for ten years, married for 5. We have a daughter together who turned 4 a couple of months ago.

Now.. I really love my wife, and can't imagine life without her. But in terms of our finances I've always made a bit more than her (not a ton, but around 30-35% more). And I've always said that I'm more than happy to pay our bills and then we can live off her paycheck. My entire paycheck usually goes for bills every month, and I'll be left with around 10%. The only thing she'll regularly pay is the kindergarten bill, which is 15% of her paycheck.

This month I had to push some of our bills forward to next month, because I've started two businesses and needed the extra cash for an investment that might come up in a week or two, but I'm still only left with maybe 20% of my pay. I didn't tell her about this, mostly because I didn't count the money as expendable due to the potential investment.

Anyways.. She's going on a holiday tomorrow and is leaving me and our daughter here (which I'm looking forward to because it'll give me and our daughter some good bonding time). So I thought I'd take my wife out for a quick lunch before a meeting I had scheduled with my business partner. I didn't tell her this as I wanted it to be a spontaneous treat for us as we don't have a lot of time to spend together. So I ordered something a bit pricey off the menu which led to her asking if I have money. I said yes, but I don't want her to worry and ensured her she can order whatever she wants. She then said ""well if you have all this money, then you can pay for all my stuff "". 

I don't know why this hurt me so much.. But I've not got a clear head as I'm under a tremendous amount of stress with my two startups (a marketing company and a fish mongering business). So because I can't think clearly here... AITA?",55,45,0.86

201,Not the A-hole,"TLDR: Friend asked me to do couples costume with her, I agreed. Party arrives, she decided to go with someone else without mentioning it to me. So I decide to not show up without mentioning it to her. 


This past weekend, there was a Halloween party that I, my husband, and two of our best friends (Sally and John, a couple) were going to go to. We’re all early 20s.


Sally originally was planning on a couples costume with John, I was just going to do Halloween themed makeup, and my husband Paul wasn’t planning on dressing up at all. 


Early last week, my husband and I took Sally and John grocery shopping (they don’t have a car and we do), and then we stopped at a Halloween store for Sally to grab a last-minute thing for her costume. On our drive there, John mentioned that he didn’t want to do their couples costume anymore, and he’d rather be something simpler by himself. Paul agreed with John that simpler was better, and decided he’d dress up as the same thing as John (because it was easy) and they’d have their own bro costume together. 


Sally wasn’t happy, as her costume worked better as a couple—think something like salt and pepper, it just wouldn’t be as good alone. She asked if I’d like to dress up with her instead of just doing makeup. I agreed, and at the store that night I spent a decent amount of money (~$40, not much but a lot for us) on a Halloween costume. 


Fast forward to Saturday. I wasn’t feeling well at all***, but I’d have felt bad ditching her after all of that, so I got ready to go to the party anyway. John arrived at Paul’s and my apartment. Sally wasn’t there. I asked where she was, and John said she’d gone to the party already with another friend, and it would be just the three of us. 


I pulled my husband aside and told him I wasn’t going, please leave without me, and I took my costume off and went to bed. I checked social media and Sally had already posted something with her friend. I wasn’t ~jealous, per say, I was hurt that Sally (after asking me to dress up with her) had disregarded my time and effort and instead just went with someone else—without ever mentioning it. After a few minutes of Paul trying to talk me into going anyway, John and Paul left, and I put my phone on DND and went to sleep. 


This morning Sally texted me asking why I didn’t come. I avoided the question and ended the conversation quickly. My feelings are hurt. 


AITA for not going to the party? And WIBTA if I told her how much she hurt me (rather than just letting it go)?


***when I say I wasn’t feeling well, I meant physically (bad headache), but I feel it’s also relevant to include that I was experiencing anxiety as well. I’m not as much of a party goer as I used to be, because last year I was attacked at an after party. Since then, going to parties has been a source of anxiety. All that wasn’t consciously a part of my decision not to go, but it does still affect me, so I’m including it.",15,63,0.93
202,Not the A-hole,"Hello reddit,

So my girlfriend of over four years has a best friend (we'll call her Mary) who happens to be born on the exact same day as I am. This leads to collisions for her and my birthday parties but so far it hasn't been a problem. The first two years, one of us celebrated on a friday, the other one on saturday. Thats a bit stressful for my GF but we're still young so a weekend of partying shouldn't be that much of a problem. Also, my GF never said something about it and I know that she would tell me if it was an issue for her as we communicate stuff like that very openly.

Last year, my birthday was on a weekend and I was well aware that Mary's plan would probably be to do the party on the evening before her birthday so that she's basically partying into the day of her birthday. Pretty common where I'm from. I was like whatever and just set my party up to happen on the weekend after to avoid the issue all together, much to the appreciation of my GF.

To make it easier to unterstand, we'll just assume Mary's and my birthday is November 20th.

So a few weeks ago I found out that this year's 11/20 would be a sunday and right there informed my GF that this was the day I wanted to do the party and my GF told Mary. Now this weekend, Mary informed my GF that she would do her party  on 11/20 and that if I wanted to do it the same day, ""seems like this will be the first time they are gonna collide"". My girlfriend is pretty upset about the situation as she says we are both very important persons in her life and she doesn't want to decide which party to go to. Going to both (like starting at mine and then going over to Mary) is not possible because we live quite some distance apart.

My point is, Mary is showing zero interest in finding a compromise, she basically says ""thats how it is deal with it"" and tells my GF to just go to my party it a passive aggressive way. I was very unconfrontational last year and made a compromise and I would expect Mary to do the same this year, but she's not having it.

Its not a huge issue for my but I think my GF is pretty upset (in general, not with me) and I would like to know if I could handle the situation better.",186,988,0.96
203,Not the A-hole,"Alright.

I'm a European woman in her mid-twenties who recently moved to San Francisco for a fancy-pants internship. It was a huge culture shock, but in a way, a welcome one- I'm gay (the very girly type people don't really clock as gay, but still) and this is the first time I've ever been out at work.

There is one co-worker who we shall call Linda. She's a trans woman (MtF).

Linda's position means that me and she and I don't really interact at work often. Therefore, I was told about her before I met her. One of my co-workers told me that she existed, I was due to meet her next week, and that she was a trans woman who uses she/her pronouns. I met Linda, didn't even ask for her pronouns and just used she/her, everything went alright, I thought that was the end of it.

Now, Linda does not pass as a cis woman.  She's still a woman and I'd never misgender her, but it is objectively visible that this is probably a trans woman, not a cis one.

This now caused an issue. A few of us had a Halloween get-together and invited Linda. At some point, she and I were alone at our table. We got talking about what it was like for me being this very girly gay woman in a male-dominated field in a conservative European country. At some point, I made a remark along the lines of 'but of course, you as a trans woman probably faced similar experiences'.

Her face just fell. She started hissing at me about how dare I presume she's trans, she hasn't been misgendered (I did NOT misgender her, at no point did I use 'he' or anything like that- I just said she was trans, which...she is) in years, and no one at work has ever had to ask for her pronouns etc. Drunk idiot I was, I blurted out 'but...we all know?' Which we do.

I was extremely confused. Apparently, out of the younger group of co-workers, no one ever actually asked her for her pronouns or gender identity because we all, just like me, got told by some colleague who'd been there longer that this was a trans woman who uses female pronouns. This somehow led Linda to believe that we didn't 'clock' her, which was a huge source of self-esteem for her.

Linda now, and I say this without a hint of exaggeration, hates my guts. She confided to another coworker that she's extremely hurt by me pointing out that she doesn't pass and that it was invasive and rude and how dare I judge her. I, on the other hand, don't really know what the hell happened here. She is trans, that is a fact of life, everyone knows and it is clearly visible.

AITA for saying what I said?",769,19962,0.87
204,Everyone Sucks,"I was best friends with this girl... lets call her Nina. We've been friends for over 10 years. We weren't SUPER close like emotionally but I think she especially trusted me more than anyone else because of how open and non judgmental I was towards her and she would always open up to me a lot more than anyone else. 

I got a boyfriend at one point and me and her hadn't talked in a while, but I eventually started hanging out with her again and she had a boyfriend as well. Fast forward a few years, we both got married to our boyfriends and continued to hang out and had more friends in the group. A few years later, she started cheating on her husband with one of her ex boyfriends. She was very conflicted and needed to vent so she told me about it one night and I tried to be supportive (not encouraging her to cheat) and listened to her. She has a lot of friends and is fairly ""popular"" but I was the only person she spoke to about her affair.

Fast forward another 2 years, my husband and I got divorced and I was in a pretty dark place. She was still with her husband but also still involved with that affair. I told her that I had found a reddit post that my ex husband had made about our divorce and was upset and I asked her specifically not to tell my ex. Two days later, my ex husband calls me, absolutely furious because he found out that I had found his reddit post and accused me of spying on him. She was the only person I told and she is a known gossiper so I knew it was her. I confronted her about it and she didn't even deny that she told him. Instead, she accused me of being a bad friend and not hanging out with her (I was super depressed and dealing with a lot of post divorce crap) and said that I was a lazy person, which I don't even know what that had to do with anything. 

I asked her to apologize and she refused, basically blaming me for being a bad friend to justify what she did. I simply reminded her that I knew about her affair and hadn't told anyone and she had the nerve to gossip about something I told her in confidence and she couldn't even keep it to herself for 2 days and told the one person I didn't want to know. She took that as a threat that I was going to expose her affair and basically stopped talking to me and got everyone that I knew through her to stop talking to me. 

I fumed about it for a long time and eventually out of revenge, told a bunch of the people that we were both friends. She was also a huge coke head and I knew her parents and considered telling her parents that she had a drug problem but decided not to. I'm pretty hurt that she let that one little thing ruin our friendship. I had a few friends tell me it was wrong to 'subtly' threaten to expose her (I think her husband eventually found out) and that we could have still been friends if I hadn't but I felt really betrayed by her. AITA for hinting that I could expose her secret for her exposing a small thing that I told her that she refused to apologize for?",43,117,0.89

208,Not the A-hole,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for 3 years and live together. My parents are divorced and my dad travels a lot for work so when we have the chance to see each other, we always make an effort and a plan to see each other. GF's dad wanted to host a party for his birthday sometime this weekend but couldn't decide on a day meanwhile my dad made plans with me for lunch this Saturday. I confirmed with him and then my GF says it's her dads birthday on Saturday and I must cancel plans with my dad.

I said no and explained I'd like to see my dad as I haven't seen him in a while but she was not taking no for an answer. One of the main reasons her dad is hosting it on Saturday is to watch the rugby world cup final which kicks off at 11am. I said I would come to her dads party and watch the rugby then go to my dads lunch at around 2pm. She was not willing to compromise and I feel kind of forced into giving her what she wants, which I'm not keen to do. I've offered a compromise and she just wont entertain it.

This isn't the first time I've experienced something like this with her in our relationship and I'm starting to question if we should carry on. But the main thing is I offered a compromise which she does not seem keen on listening to.

209,Not the A-hole,"Back in May, I (27F) found out that my husband and I were expecting our first baby together. This was a pretty exciting time for me as it was something I've really been looking forward to since hubs and I got married a few years ago.

I told her I wanted to announce my pregnancy in my own time, but she went behind my back and told pretty much everyone on my side of the family, so when I did get around to actually announcing it, my family were all pretty much saying the same thing, ""your mom already told us."" Which kind of sucked.

She made an excuse that didn’t make any sense, but like I said, I let it go. Maybe a week later, she went to a birthday party and shared the news at the front of the room (I wasn't there) but when she told me the story of how it happened, she said she was sitting at a table talking quietly and someone overheard and shared it though this wasn’t true.

Weeks later, I shared the gender news with her. She asks who knows and I say no one. Minutes after leaving my place, she calls my sister and others and tells them what I'm having. She also even SAYS she's not supposed to say anything. At this point, I'm beyond frustrated and it's starting to feel as if she's making my pregnancy all about her.

Now, when it came down to planning the baby shower, no matter what I said, if she didn't like it, she would shoot it down. (Ex. I wanted to invite one of my aunts, but since my mother and one of my sisters doesn't like her, she said she won't send her an invite and she's not going to have fun if my aunt’s there. And if I do invite her, I need to tell them first) (Ex. 2, the original day of the baby shower was on hub’s mom's b-day and she asked if we could change the date as she would be out of town that weekend. When I brought it up to my mother, she said ""It's a lot to change the date for one person"" and ""I'm making a lot of concessions for HIS family"".)

I call my mother after a phone call with my sis and express to her why I'm upset about what she's doing and that I feel like I can't even enjoy my pregnancy, she tells me ""nobody ain't did nothing to you"" and then hangs up in my face. At this point, I just said I'm done and just won't involve her anymore.

Since then, I haven't spoken to her. Well, when my sister got her invitation to the shower, she texted and asked if I had invited our mother and I told her no. She then told me that ""in the grand scheme of things I should be grateful that she (our mom) is excited"". Not even a day after this conversation, my mother sends me a text along the lines of ""God bless and I'll love you always despite you excluding me from your life and I'm sorry for whatever it is I've done.""

For me, it was never about the excitement, if that's what they want to call it, it was about her refusing to respect my wishes when it came to anything I was saying. My sister also stated that I should invite her because ""she's still your mother and she hasn't caused your baby harm""

So, WIBTA if I still choose not to invite her?",85,476,0.95
210,Not the A-hole," Okay I'm new here.

 My boyfriend and I are invited to a Halloween party. Early on this year,I decided to lose weight and I did. In result of that,I got new curves and actually feel really confident and have a better body image of myself. Since I lost weight and I feel better about my body. I kinda want to dress abit sexy for Halloween. I got a vampire costume, it shows off curves and I got fishnet tights with it. My boyfriend is being a vampire too. But when I showed him my costume,he literally called me a slut and I should change it. I got mad and we argue for a hour. I want to show off my new body.


So AITA or should I get a new costume?


Edit:

But I can't find the costume on the website but it's like that but a bit shorter and more lace ((sorry that I can't find it))

Update 2: OMG thank you for your supportive dms. I'm hurting because I was with him for two years and honestly I don't see myself getting better anytime soon. Time heals and I'm going to the party with friends. Honestly I can't believe you saw toxic relationship before I did",89,87,0.88
211,Asshole,"One night after quite a few drinks at a night club. I met a girl who had mutual friends though I'd never heard of her before and ended up taking her back to my place (Was living with my mum at the time) for a one night stand.. Unprotected... Stupid I know but at the time I was drunk and just wanted to smash. The next morning I made up some excuse for her to leave and intended on never seeing her again.

A few months go by and I've now rekindled a previous love, we're living together and things are going great. Then we find  out my partner is pregnant and we're escatic planning for the future. Next thing you know I get a message from an unknown number, and its that girl I had a one night stand with saying we need to talk. First thing I did was let my partner know what was going on. We talked things through before I messaged the  girl back and letting her know I was in a happy relationship and I didn't want her to go through with the pregnancy and would prefer she got an abortion (As politely as possible). She was unsure what she was going to do but assured me if she was going to go through with it I wouldn't have to be involved and it would be her child alone and wouldn't expect any form of involvement or support from me. I agreed and that was the last I've spoken to her even to this day.  We live in a very secular country so early abortion isn't nearly as frowned upon as other countries. 

Weeks go by and my girlfriend and I are attending a scan and everything seems fine, we're advised the heart rate was low and asked to come back in 2 weeks for a follow up. When we returned for the follow-up the baby was gone. This was extremely emotional and traumatic for the both of us, especially my partner and she dealt with a great deal of depression following. Especially when her body failed to eject the remains and had to go in for an abortion surgery to manually remove everything. 

Months go by and we've moved countries to start a new life together. Within a month of arriving 
I find out the one nighter had turned up at my mother's to introduce a 1 month old child. My mother is happy and excited. My girlfriend is heartbroken feeling like she failed in providing that grandchild. 

 I say to my mother look, I'm in a whole other country. I have no interest in being involved in this child's life, I'm not even listed on the birth certificate, but if you want to be involved in this child's life.. So be it. I just ask you respect my partner and I's wishes by keeping it to yourself. 

She agreed initially, but over time things changed. Suddenly my mothers bringing the child to family gatherings, plastering photos and statuses all over Facebook. I can't help but feel like it's a huge kick in the teeth to my partners feelings and my wishes. 

So, AITA for hoping she'd keep it to herself?

Edit: I should probably point out my girlfriend has Polycystic ovaries and had been advised by a doctor prior to the pregnancy that she wouldn't be able to have children without medical assistance and a stroke a luck - Hence why the baby meant so much to her and affected her so badly when she lost it.",1555,3290,0.93

Im a 22f in retail, and I am the only one out of all my coworkers that communicate in Spanish, I’m not fluent but I’ve learned enough to keep my Spanish speaking customers happy and comfortable shopping in the store I work in.. My coworkers and I are ALL Latino (family’s coming from mexican heritage), and whenever a Spanish speaking customer comes in I usually take over and help them. 

Today a father and son duo came into the store and I go up to them to try and greet them and before I could even say anything the father stopped me by putting his hand out, says “no” and proceeds to wave me away. After that I left them alone, and helped out anyone that needed help. At one point I heard them trying to ask my coworkers for help but they don’t understand him and my coworker obviously doesn’t understand them. I go around helping out other customers and completely ignored the father son duo looking around not being able to talk to anyone else. They left the store and although what the father did was totally rude, I can’t help but feel I should’ve just gone back up to them and tried to help. 

AITA ?

Edit 1: Wow. Thanks everyone so much for your opinions. And also thank you for the silver random stranger ! Reading everyone’s opinions has definitely been a learning experience and I’ll definitely be looking at things a different way before completely writing someone off who didn’t want my help. 

Also, for those who wanted to know, the type of retail store I work at is a street wear store.

Edit 2:  so I guess I used the wrong term. Sorry! For those who want clarity. Not mexican, but Hispanic, our family’s are from Mexico.

Edit 3: because some people are asking, and because I didn’t clarify at first..I didn’t go directly up to them as soon as they walked in, they were looking around for a while and the son started pointing at a sweater, I went up to them to greet them and see if they wanted to see the jacket and try it on. The father saw me walking up to him and that’s when he put his hand out to stop me and to wave me off

218,,"So one of my best friends loves to cook. 

She makes these elaborate dishes and she really puts her heart and soul into it which is great for a hobby and myself and all her friends always supported this hobby completely. 

The thing is her cooking never exactly tasted very good. In fact it was kind of awful. I’m convinced she’s actually not able to really taste food as well as she thinks she is (she has a severely deviated septum and has been known to have an impaired sense of smell). 

I thought maybe I just had an unsophisticated palate because my friends seemed to really enjoy her cooking. Everyone always complimented her and ate her food with a smile, and if something to do with food came up said “Oh you should ask her, she’s the chef of the group, she cooks all the time.” So I always wondered if everyone else was just being nice like I was, but didn’t care as long as my friend was happy. 

Two weeks ago she invited us all to a big dinner and announced she was quitting her high powered job with benefits to strike out on her own as a caterer. She has two kids and is the sole provider of the home. 

Afterwards we talked separately (without her present) the rest of us friends and someone kind of uneasily said “So, Trish is becoming a caterer huh?” (not real name). And basically after beating around the bush for a bit it came out that we all felt she was making a huge mistake and was not a good cook. 

We talked for a while and were starkly divided over whether or not we should say something in case it wasn’t too late to get her job back and not spend too much more money on launching a catering business — half of us thought we had to speak up the other half thought her mind was made up and doubting her would only make her resolve to prove us wrong. 

So I was with her yesterday and she was talking  about how she’d spent a significant portion of her savings and was now considering taking out a second mortgage on her home to kickstart this catering business. I couldn’t believe it. I had no idea it would require this much money of her. 

So, thinking of what I would want if the tables were turned, I sat down and explained we were trying to be supportive when it was a hobby but it was not restaurant quality food and she should not take a financial risk for it. 

She listened silently then firmly asked me to leave. I haven’t heard anything from her or my friends since.

TL;DR SIL always tries to mess up my birthday as it on the same month as hers, and next year she decided to get married on my 40th birthday and wife hasn’t said anything to her about it.

Bit of a back story here. My (39M) have been married to my wife (35F) for five years this November. My SIL’s and my birthday are 4 days apart. Since we got married there have always been issues with my birthday celebrations caused by SIL. She likes the attention and was used to making the whole month about her, but now my wife has to also pay attention to me her husband, you know like normal couples do. So anyway SIL began creating issues with my birthday, at first it was little things like keeping wife busy on the day of my birthday celebration so she would get home a bit later then planned which would delay our already made plans, and then she moved on to keeping wife busy the days prior so she could not get anything ready for my birthday, until last year when she basically hijacked my birthday celebration with MY friends at a pub (she got there with other family and began basically trying to dictate what everyone had to do, drink, etc.) My SIL and I have different tastes in music and she decided she didn’t like the pub and convinced everyone to move to a different venue which I didn’t like. My wife decided she wanted to go and all my friends bailed because they didn’t like the other place and got annoyed with SIL’s attitude. I didn’t want to go home yet so I ended up going to the other place and not enjoying myself the rest of the night. Next day I sat my wife down and told her that I didn’t appreciate my SIL hijacking my birthday celebration since she had hers the week before like she wanted, and that it hurt me that she didn’t support me and was so eager to change venues when I wanted to stay. That it had become a habit of SIL to cause issues on my birthday and a habit of my wife to let her and not put a stop to it. That I’ve never asked her to chose between her family and me but there are times where she needs to put her husband first and this is one of them as I believed I wasn’t asking for anything extraordinary. 

Cue to recently my SIL and her boyfriend have decided to get married. They had chosen a date five weeks before my birthday and they’ve just begun planning and looking for venues. Today we went to my inlaws for lunch and while we’re there SIL says to my wife “OP’s wife we’ve decide to follow your advice and change the day to later to have more time planning, we moved it to X date (my 40th birthday which is a Saturday)”. Record scratch. I was expecting my wife to say something about it and that it was my 40th birthday. But she just sat there agreeing and talking. I got really upset. When we get home I sit down with my wife and ask her if she had realized that the new wedding date was not only my birthday but my 40th birthday. She looked at me and said she hadn’t but that it was out of her hands now. I got upset so I walked away to cool off. I get that it’s SIL’s wedding but she can choose any other date that’s not my birthday and I only turn 40 once and I had been talking with my wife about it and that I wanted to do something special (nothing big just special) and now just because SIL decides she wants to get married I have to once more give up my birthday. Now I’ve decided that this is the hill I will die on, but I want to hear it from you if I WBTA if I ask my wife to talk her sister into changing the wedding date? She’s just begun planning and doesn’t have anything booked so she can still change her mind. I also have to admit that I’m starting to feel like this is personal.

Edit 1: for info. I want to go over certain info for clarification purposes. 

1. I well aware that the date will probably not be changed. I’m not kidding myself with this. But I do want to let my wife know that this is a big deal for me. 

2. I’m well aware that a wedding trumps a birthday. If there hadn’t been any previous history I wouldn’t have complained but given that every year it’s been escalating I really don’t want to go quietly into the night even if it means I’m TA. 

3. Also I’m not only losing just this milestone birthday I will probably lose them all. My wife’s family is big on wedding vows renewal every five years, and being the faaaaaaamily driven clan they are every year I will have to listen to how it’s my SIL’s XX anniversary.",403,842,0.94

So recently I went to this one day engineering camp. We went to a bunch of activities, one of which was sort of about building foundation. We watched a person put a long stick in a tube, then fill the tube with sand. After that, he challenged each of us to pull it out. Most kids spent maybe 10-20 seconds Pulling it, but when I got it I tried really hard to get it out. I twisted it and pulled until it finally got out. I was the second to last kid and there so there was a kid who did not get to try. A while after we left, a teacher pulled me aside and asked me to apologize to the kid. I asked why, and she said it was because the kid felt left out about me getting it out. I apologized, but honestly I felt it was no big deal. It was just a pole in some sand, and I thought the kid was making a big deal. Yesterday, I was talking about the camp to my friend and I just mentioned Pulling the stick out and my friend said that was an asshole thing to do.  Now I'm wondering if it was.

It’s one sided as far as I know and I have confronted her about it but I get guilt tripped sometimes when I express my concerns. To start, she’s a devout lesbian but did an inappropriate thing to him at a party once. She but her butt on the back of his head and was twerking on him while looking at me and our friends. We were all pretty horrified, especially him he was frozen and didn’t know what to do. He was confused because she doesn’t like boys. I pulled her aside and told her it wasn’t cool and she apologised because she thinks it’s fun to get under her friends’ skin. 

Then she wanted his help with her biology project (he is a bio major and she’s taking an intro bio class as an elective) and told me she’d take him out as a thank you later. It was pretty clear I wasn’t invited. I said yes and that we will come over after he gets off work. Then she started telling me that I didn’t have to come because it would be boring... right not suspicious at all. I talked to him about it and he agreed that it was really weird and that we’d go together but then she messaged me and said she was getting help from a friend in her class. Later I found out that friend never went, and before it sounds bad on my part, it’s because she told me when I asked how she did on her project not because I was spying or something weird like that. 

Then break came. We all live in the same city but not like close by. My boyfriend and I live together. She went out clubbing with some friends from her old job. It was getting late and she message my boyfriend asking if he could pick her up if she needed him to. Then she messaged me after and only told me she was out clubbing on the strip. This made me really upset because I’m her close friend. I’m the one who would be going to pick her up and worried about her if something was wrong or I knew she went out and I didn’t hear from her not my boyfriend. 

I let the last one go because my boyfriend felt like I was overreacting when I talked to him about it because she and I are so close and she probably did it in case I didn’t get her message. It’s still eating me because why?... it doesn’t make sense to me especially because she asked if he could get her.

I've been married for 12 years and we started trying for kids 2 years in. In the ten years that we've been trying I've had six miscarriages, two stillbirths, and two failed surrogacies. Naturally, my husband and I have been pretty devastated by all of this but try to move through it. My younger sister got married six years ago and now has three kids with no troubles. I try not to be jealous, and I genuinely love her kids and her, but I'm human and every time she announced a baby my heart broke a little more. We can't foster or adopt, my husband has a felony charge from when he was 18. He was stupid but he turned his life around and is a law-abiding citizen now.

We had stopped trying for a while but decided to try one more time this year. It took and I'm now five months along. We didn't tell anyone for fear of losing it but our doctors and ourselves are incredibly confident that this will be the winning pregnancy. The one person we did tell was my mom. She was planning my dad's 70th birthday bash and she asked if I wanted to use the party to announce it, since it would make my dad, who adores his grandkids, incredibly happy. I agreed.

The day of the party I'm hiding my belly when my sister and her family come in, and I can just tell looking at her that she's pregnant again. I take her aside and tell her in secrecy that I'm also pregnant. She was happy for me, we danced around, I may have peed a little. I told her we couldn't wait to tell everyone.

Couple hour later the party is in full swing, my husband and I find my mom and we go to find dad so we can make the announcement. My sister runs up to my dad and delightfully announces that she's eight weeks along with her fourth child. My dad was so happy, he adores kids and babies. When the excitement died down a little he came up to me, mom, and my husband said, ""another niece or nephew for you, Jess, isn't that nice?"" I said, ""yeah it is, especially now that MY baby will have someone to play with."" My dad was happy but, and please forgive me, not as happy as he would have been had I been able to make a big announcement.

When my sister announced I felt crushed. I know I'm nothing special and in the grand scheme of things, who really cares about another pregnant person. But I've got two babies in the cemetery and several miscarriages that lead up to this, and damn it, I just wanted one moment to celebrate. My sister has had three previous moments, I just wanted one. This will probably be the only baby I have. I took my sister aside and explained to her how hurtful it was to have her announce her baby when I've never got to do it before. Basically she told me to get over it and that the world doesn't revolve around me. I told her to fuck off and we haven't spoken in the week since. I know this is a trivial matter.

AITA for feeling like she stole my thunder and getting upset?",1124,7520,0.92
226,Asshole,"My sons are 4 and 7 right now, and we aren't having any more.  My wife and I have a very strong bond.  We do, however, come from very different financial backgrounds -- I came from a blue collar background while her father was a very well off attorney.

My younger sister just had her first kid, a boy, and money is tight, as it almost always is in that situation.  We had all of our baby clothes in a storage bin in the back of our garage, neatly labeled and organized.  A few days after my nephew was born, I was in the garage, saw that bin, and decided to drive it over to my sister's house and help her out in that way.  IMO baby clothes are cheap and disposable since they're prone to getting messed up anyway.

Well, a month goes by and my wife noticed that the bin is missing and flips out.  She calls me at work in a huff, demanding to know where I ""hid"" them.  I told her that I gave them to my sister and didn't think anything of it.

Well my wife demanded that I leave work early, drive to my sister's house ""before any more damage is done"" and take the clothes back.  She goes into a rant about how in her family, they keep baby clothes forever as keepsakes, how her mom still has her and her sister's baby clothes, how their grandma still has all of theirs, etc and how she NEEDS them back.  This was news to me.  I personally think it's ridiculous since they're just clothes that she got at Target etc and that they're much better served in use.  In my family, we pass baby clothes down to the newest baby that's born, passing them to siblings, cousins, or even friends who have had kids.

Well I was pissed off at how she came at me on the issue, like I did something terrible to her, and she wouldn't even look at how much they'd help out my sister and brother in law.  So I told her no, I wouldn't ask for them back and she told me that I HAD to and I said no.  

I admit that I should've asked her first but like I said, everyone in my family shares baby clothes around.  She refuses to call my sister because she ""shouldn't have to."" 

I haven't been home yet, it's 6:30 here and TBH I'm just gonna work late to push the argument and hope she cools off.

TLDR: Gave away my sons' old clothes, wife demanded them back, I said no.  AITA?",1101,2280,0.94

229,Asshole,"Final Edit: I showed this thread to my wife, which resulted in a very fruitful discussion. Apparently she has never liked the trips my sister and I took with my mom, even prior to our marriage. I was completely shocked, as she’s never even alluded to feeling this way. We discussed where these feelings were coming from, and eventually she stated our yearly trips remind her of her tumultuous relationship with her parents. And whenever I’m gone, it makes her abusive upbringing all the more apparent. My wife and her parents haven’t spoken in years. I won’t go into detail, but there’s some unprocessed trauma there. I’ve encouraged my wife to seek therapy for this in the past but she’s always insisted it wasn’t an issue. During our conversation we identified other areas of my wife’s life that have been impacted by her past experiences. She now thinks it’s a good idea to seek therapy to reconcile the past hurt her parents have done. Obviously, I’ll support her through this and we’ll make any necessary changes to facilitate the healing process. 

Thank you to everyone who provided constructive feedback. Regardless if you thought I was TA or not, most of you came from a helpful place. 

For those who used this as an opportunity to tear me down and insult me/my wife/my mother, I hope you’re released from whatever turmoil life has placed on you. 

Have a great day everyone. 

———————————————————————————


Throwaway for privacy. 

Background: My mother (68F) raised my sister (36F) and me (38M) in extreme poverty. I won’t go into excruciating detail, but there were many nights where my mom wouldn’t eat just so my sister and I could have a decent meal. Fortunately, my sister and I were able make something of ourselves and acquire jobs that gave us significant economic mobility. 

As you can imagine, vacations were never an option growing up. However, my mom would talk about the various places she wished we could visit as a family. When my sister and I became more financially secure we began taking our mom to said destinations, averaging about one a year. These trips are very important to my nuclear family and serve as a way for my sister and I to thank our mom for her countless sacrifices. 

This started about 10 years ago. Now my sister is married to a great guy. They have two kids. I also have an amazing wife that has blessed me with three children. 

Current issue: I’ve explained the above to my wife, however she thinks these trips are exclusionary and feels the entire family should attend. Currently, my family takes at least two vacations a year. One that’s just us (sometimes with grandma), and one where we go somewhere with my sister’s family as well (always with grandma). I definitely understand that I’m taking one more vacation than my wife per year, and I said I wouldn’t have a problem with her taking her own vacation that’s to her specifications (e.g. girls’ trip, solo vacation, staycation, vacation with her siblings etc.) She’s never taken me up on this offer and insists the issue is the exclusionary piece of these trips. She feels they should be another trip that includes the entire family. 

The kids are young (oldest is 5), so I don’t think they’re impacted too much, and when theyre older I’ll do my best to explain the significance of these trips to them. Also, my BIL is very supportive and encourages us to go as often as we can. I honestly don’t see myself backing down from the nature of these trips, but I also don’t want them to cause unnecessary conflict in my marriage. 

So Reddit, AITA for going on these trips even though my wife feels excluded? If so, I welcome any recommendations on remedying the situation.

Edit: It seems I’ve conflated “nuclear family” and “origin family”. Thanks all for pointing that out. I’m reading your comments and appreciate your insights.

INFO Edit: My wife and I take about one trip every 6ish months that’s just the two of us. Some are staycations where we get a hotel in our city and explore, but most are true destination vacations.  Our average getaway is about is 7-10 nights, childcare depending. 

Post-marriage the longest trip my origin family and I have taken was 7 nights. That was pre-kids though. Post-children the average trip is 3-4 nights.

INFO Edit 2: No, my mom doesn’t come on the trips that are reserved for my wife and me lol. 

The vacation layout is such (per year):

-One that’s mom and sister
-Two that are wife and me
-One that’s nuclear family (sometimes grandma)
-One that’s entire family (my family + sister’s family + grandma)

INFO Edit 3: The trips are to various destinations. We’ve done camping, domestic travel, and international travel. And yes, I’m willing to re-visit an area that either party would like to travel. 

The trips with my wife are definitely nicer. She’s more into big cities and loves to explore by day and club at night. That definitely adds up lol. When I’m with my mom and sister, we’re typically at the hotel by 7 haha. 

And none of these trips present any financial hardship for my family, whatsoever. I would cancel EVERYTHING to prevent my wife and kids from experiencing anything close to what my origin family endured when I was young.",274,323,0.9

235,Not the A-hole,"Mandatory on mobile disclaimer. Sorry if it comes out weird. English is not my first language. 

So I (20F) work part-time as a cashier in a small shop in a sketchy part of the city. Because the neighbourhood where the store is located isn’t the safest of regions and we deal with a lot of money, cashiers are required to stay behind a bullet proof glass and do all transactions through a small hole cut in the glass. 

Obviously it’s hard to talk to people from the other side, so we have a small two way microphone to communicate with the costumers. For the five months I’ve been working there, there is a regular costumer, we’ll call him A (60?M) who comes in at least twice a day. A usually comes directly to my register and proceeds to spend at least 20 minutes there, telling me random facts about his family and flirting with me (telling me I look beautiful or that he would love to take me out to dinner). 

I usually ignore him, but lately I’ve been getting annoyed, he holds up the line, is rude to other costumers and treats me like I’m there for his pleasure. I started turning off my microphone when I see him coming and I pretend we have been having technical issues so I can’t hear him (and he can’t hear me) and he leaves quicker.

I think it’s a pretty good, non-confrontational way of dealing with him, but I told my friend and he told me A is probably lonely and just needs someone to talk to and that I should suck it up. 

So Reddit, AITA?

236,Not the A-hole,"I have a friend, let's call her B. B used to be a passionate guy who loved Games, Magic cards, playing guitar and working on his car's sound system.

B came out as MTF trans. I was surprised because she had seemed like a content guy before but I know I don't know what's inside someone, so I was happy and supportive, immediately adopting her pronouns and new (anime) name as requested.

I noticed first on twitter that she wasn't posting about her Magic stuff or snippets of music any more. Instead, literally all she was doing day-in-day-out was looking for fights about trans people online. Someone presumed a pronoun? She'd insult and berate them or quote tweet with some petty insult. Several hours every night her feed was full of nothing but toxicity. Her personality changed too. She didn't care about anything anymore except her ""trans rights"". When we talked, we never talked about our hobbies- no matter what it always came back to ""You'll never guess what this dick said to me"".

We were chatting at lunch & I noticed that she was swiping through some trans hashtags. I then realized that she wasn't just coming across fights in her feed, but actually hunting and starting them. I asked if she was okay because I had noticed her twitter blowing up. She said she was fine and that she was just fighting for her rights. She then asked if I had a problem with trans people standing up. I was confused and said of course not.

I followed up by saying that she had changed a lot recently. We had always had fun and talked about stuff, she was very involved with her guitar and her car but now all she ever talked about was people she was fighting with. She got extremely angry and ranted at me loud enough that people were staring. She said that as a ""white male cishet"" I wouldn't understand what a trans person goes through and that I'm either an ally or an enemy. I agreed with her that I wouldn't understand fully what she was going through but told her that picking fights with everyone about it wasn't healthy for her or comfortable for anyone around her. I told her that it just wasn't fun hanging out since all she did was talk about drama that she was starting. She left angrily and I had to call my partner to pick me up.

Later on, told me that if she was acting weird it was because it was ""that time of the month"" for her. I didn't even know how to react to that but I ended up saying ""the way you spoke to me was really rude and you basically embarrassed and stranded me at the restaurant. You don't have a period so you can't use that as an excuse.""

She absolutely lost it and called me a TERF and a ""CIS white boy"".

I told her that I still wanted to be friends and that I was completely supportive of her being trans but that I wouldn't talk to her until she sorted out whatever had caused her to become so toxic.

AITA here? I said some things but she's essentially being a jerk and using nonexistent biology to justify being really awful.

**Edit: Just to confirm, B has not started any kind of hormone therapy yet. If she had I would accept the symptoms of hormone withdrawal as an excuse.**

**EDIT 2: Thank you everyone for your replies! I'm trying to get through them all. Personally at this point I feel it's a case of ESH. I shouldn't have invalidated her like I did, but she shouldn't lash out at her friends. I also shouldn't invalidate her battle to fight about it, but she perhaps shouldn't put herself in combative situations. Basically a big ol' shruggy from me as well as an apology to her, because I really want to go to lunch again this week and not just because it's her turn to buy!**

237,Not the A-hole,"I have an older biological brother (G) and a younger adopted brother (M). 

M was adopted when he was 5, I was 10 and G was 12.  Growing up M always would steal our things and 'lose' them or sell/give to kids at school. So we were never were really close growing up. And yes, I understand he is adopted so he could have underlying issues that cause his behavior as a child. So I did not cut him out while we were kids. 

Fast forward, I am now 26 and have not spoken or acknowledge his existence in  years. When people ask if I have siblings I only mention my older brother. And I can tell this does bother my Mom, when she tries to talk about him I ignore the conversation. 

Here is my reasoning. M has always been ungrateful. He has stolen from my mom and dad as well as my Grandma who had dementia, just caused alot of stress on my parents. He was brought into a loving family and completely took advantage of my parents.  Taking money from them, lying, even hitting my mom at points. What caused the breaking point where I just can not accept the fact that he exists is my Dad unexpectedly passed away. Me, G and my Mom where all there to hold his hand while he passed. M was not. A family member offer to pay for Ms flight so he can come to the funeral, and his response was ""I would rather have the money"" and did not show. That was it. I am done. 

He has since knocked up his girlfriend and has reached out to me via text and facebook to apologize and say he has changed. I block him with no response. I am guessing he needs money since he has gotten himself into a situation.

Either way, my mom brings up how I need to be nice to him, and he needs people in his life. But I refuse to acknowledge him.

238,Not the A-hole,"The people with me were my mum, my mother in law, my best friend and my fiancee's sister. We had plans to go one bridal shop and if we didn't find anything then to go to a second and then lunch, at which point my fiancee would be joining us for more wedding stuff.

We get to the first store. I tell them that only thing I don't want is a ballgown. I tell them my ideal dress is a little more form fitting, maybe around knee length, and I like fit and flare (where it's tight up top but the skirt is looser) and ask them to stick to that sort of thing.

I think I brought too many people, because it was like trying to herd cats. My mum, mother in law and sister in law try to get me into whatever ballgowns they can. I humour them and try on a couple, but I don't like any and tell them so, trying to steer them towards something sleeker.

My best friend tries to help me out by picking out some dresses decidedly more ""me"", and closer to what I had in mind when we started looking. There's a favourite but still not quite what I'm looking for. My mother and mother in law tell me that they hate it, and suggest yet another ballgown. I say let's keep looking and please no more ballgowns. They pull out another ballgown.

Eventually I ask my friend to help me out. She then suggests they all go to see if they can find bridesmaid or mother of the bride/groom dresses, and while they're trying on dresses I put my clothes back on. I come out and tell them that we'll try the second store, but let's get lunch first.

We start to head to the nearest cafe, with them up front talking about dresses and me and my best friend behind. We walk past this clothes shop owned by a local designer (not a bridal shop), and there's this dress in the window. The main colour is white, with a little bit of blue and pink on the bottom. My friend sees that it catches my eye and points out that the others are about 30 feet ahead of us and we probably wouldn't be missed. We duck into the store, I try the dress on, and it's perfect. I get it then and there. We're gone maybe 15 minutes.

I get a call from my fiancee asking where we are, and we head over. She sees the bag and asks to see inside it. Without thinking I say ""you can't see it before the wedding"". Next thing I know I'm getting wrung out by mum, MIL and SIL for buying a wedding dress once they were gone.

Me and my friend told my fiancee what had happened at the dress shop and she said to her mother, sister and my mum that it was up to me what I got and when, and said they should have behaved themselves, but the mothers/her sister got really upset and said that they got carried away but I never gave them a warning or a chance to ""fix it"" and that I shouldn't have slipped away.

241,Not the A-hole,"My mom and I were shopping at American Eagle yesterday, and when we got to the cashier to pay for our items he asked her if she wanted to apply for a rewards card with AE (AEO Connected, I believe) and get an additional 20% off our purchase. Since I was already a member of AEO’s rewards program, I had my suspicions that he was asking her to apply for AE's store credit card (a similar tactic was pulled on me at Ulta). My mom asked him if the card was a credit card, and he said no. She then asked me if I wanted to get one, so I searched for the rewards card online and it popped up as a store credit card. I told the cashier that he shouldn't blatantly lie to his customers about the nature of the card just to get a commission, and he just proceeded to silently ring up our items. I believe that he was probably told by his higher-ups to disguise the charge card as merely a ""rewards"" card, which is a rather disgusting business strategy, as charge cards usually have 20-30% interest rates that start accumulating immediately. In addition, hard credit pulls stay on your record for two years and can affect your credit score, and if you try and complain that you got tricked into opening a card there’s not much that can be done. AITA for calling this retail cashier out? My family is well off and my mom could've paid off the card as soon as she got home, but I could imagine how others could get bamboozled by this predatory tactic.

Edit 2: A lot of the commenters are mentioning that AEO has a rewards program that is also called AEO Connected. You’re right, and I was already a member of their rewards program for about a year and the cashier already knew this because I gave him the phone number to my account before he gave the additional 20% off sales pitch, which aligns with the sales offer that they give online with their credit card. It wouldn’t make sense for him to advertise a rewards program to someone that he already KNEW was a rewards member.",158,904,0.94

Then Friday it was my turn. My parents are Christians and rather conservative. I don't agree with many of their POVs but I don't bring it up.

We sat down to eat and my parents asked her normal questions. They then asked her if she goes to church on Sundays. My gf says that she is an atheists so it would be hypocritical. I squeezed her hand a little because for me a simple no would have sufficed. But now my mom was ""debating her"". I managed to make them drop the issue.

But then my dad made an offhand comment about how he agrees with something trump said and my gf said that she saw that statement as offensive. Soon they were discussing it all. I tried to make her stop but she wouldn't drop the topic.

Obviously the title makes me look like NTA but a couple of my colleagues (who are aware of the situation because very few people are) have come up to me by text to tell me I’m TA.


So this happened on Friday morning. I work at a very large marketing company. We work in teams of 4 where we receive tasks to come up with ideas on how to advertise for client companies. A task usually takes 4-6 months then the group is dismantled and we are put in another group of 4. As you can imagine, just like in high school, there’s only one group leader, one who does the work, one who watches YouTube all day and one who never shows.


I see myself as the group leader and one of my coworkers Eva is the one who does a lot of the work and loved doing it. This system was put in place to boost our creativity and has helped me connect with a lot of people of and make friends in a city where I knew no one 2 years ago. Currently, we are approaching the end of our project with my team so it is stressful for all of us. We have to present in two weeks and we are far from finished with our presentation. It’s closer to looking like the template than the finished work. So we separated the work into 4 parts. Each person having about 2 sections to do. I got the last part which coincidentally falls after Eva’s (fake name) part. 


Now Eva and I have never been friends because we just don’t connect and we probably never will be after that but we have only had small disagreements, never actually fought.


Anyways. Fast forward to Friday morning, I asked a colleague if he could send me the first version of the presentation so that I could update it with the work I had just finished. He told me that Eva had it but that she took the day off because one of her parents had passed away. I decided to give her a call anyways because the presentation is very urgent. I was only able to get a ""hey Eva I know you’re sick I was wondering if you could send me-"" before she cut me off and said ""My mother just passed away do you really think I’m gonna deal with this bullshit right now you stupid n-word"" before hanging up violently. 


I was rather shocked by her tone and not at all pleased with the last word she had used. I‘m white and she’s black, but that is still completely out of line. If she had simply said ""you stupid bitch"" or ""you dumbfuck"". I would have understood but I feel like this took a racist turn rather quickly. 


So I reported her an hour later to HR and they have said they will look into it and are taking it very seriously and will get back to me. I have yet to hear from them or Eva but am now scared to go back to work tomorrow. 


I understood Eva lost her mother and that’s very hard for her but I still feel very insulted. So reddit, AITA ?",474,851,0.83

249,No A-holes here,"Hello!

Recently (\~1.5 month and a half ago) I moved across the country for a job opportunity. I'm 25 and it's the first time I'm living a good distance away from my parents. I've got a few friends from university who live in the area, and I'm settling in pretty well to the changes. However, I'm worried that my mom isn't. She texts me every day, sometimes multiple times a day, about updates and general stuff. I didn't mind in the beginning but it honestly has started to bother me, makes me feel roped down, etc. I love my mom, but it was getting to be a bit much as I'm adjusting to things here. Then I feel guilty about feeling annoyed. Awkward cycle.

She and my brother have a different relationship where they text pretty often, and that's fine, but I don't feel like we really have/had that. I told her this over a phone call and feel guilty that I may have made her upset. I'm thinking I want to compromise where we have a phone call once a week might be good? It feels weird that I want to suggest boundaries with my mom lol but also I'm genuinely worried that she has attachment issues.

This led me to calling my daughter and she saying her plans changed with her friends and she‘s spending night at her boyfriend’s parents house and she wouldn’t return until 9pm sunday (today), even though plan was for her to return by 10am so I could take car to have afternoon with my friends.   In past I’ve lent her the car to visit her boyfriend on weekends. I trusted her to be smart about things. She never asked to stay overnight.  If my daughter owned her own car and payed her share of bills I’d refrain from thinking about punishment. But because I lend her the car I feel I have some say and control. It’s essentially my car.  Honestly with my mind in full anger I’d prefer if she moved out and lived on her own without my support to realize how difficult life is.  Tuition is a lot and her father doesn’t help much.

&#x200B;

I rent a place close to the downtown of a major city and my daughter and I share one car.  We’re essentially roomates but I pay all the bills, and car insurance, and 95% of tuition.  My daughter covers her fuel costs.  One car is all I can afford. I give her priority on days she has school.  I take the public transportation since it takes similar time by car, about 15 minute. I sometimes use cars on friday nights to visit with friends.  If I take her car away I’ll be forcing her to change her roundtrip commute from 30 minutes to 3 hours or I’d be limiting her travel on the weekends.",94,37,0.88

The topic of Christmas came up and someone asked me if I still wanted a specific NFL jacket as a gift. It was just a casual exchange, but I noticed my mom roll her eyes and my sister said something to the effect of “Don’t bother getting him clothes unless you just want to give “Jessica” (my gf) a second present. 

I was a little taken aback and asked what she meant. Basically everyone in my immediate family chimed in saying how annoying it is that my girlfriend wears my clothes all the time - especially when it’s things they gave me as gifts. 

She does wear my clothes a lot. She’s small, she’s cold all the time, her clothes aren’t as warm or comfortable as mine, so I offer her my shirts and jackets. I even pack extra clothes of mine for her when we go out of town. I like when she wears my stuff and didn’t realize it would bother anyone?

Also, we’re in our 30’s. We have a child together and have been together for years. It’s not like this is my high school gf parading around in hoodies she’s stolen from me. 

I asked if it bothered anyone that I use the coffee maker they gave HER last Christmas, but they all said that wasn’t the same thing. This seems stupid to me, but it turned into a big argument with the general consensus being that I’m an ungrateful ass.

We even called ourselves engaged even though he had never proposed. I am a very simple, no-frills type of person so this never bothered me.

--The Proposal--
I was proposed to this weekend in a way that I dreaded. It was an incredibly public, expensive and cringey moment, nothing resembling what I wanted at all. I would have loved to have been proposed to at home or on a hike together. Something free, private and meaningful. I still said yes because we had decided long ago to spend our life together.

--The Ring--
The ring is honestly ugly, it looks like something from Claire's even though I know he spent a lot of money on it. It's a custom rose-gold ring with an incredibly high setting. He said his mom picked it out, who I've only met twice. It's custom. Cannot be returned.

--The Aftermath--
The next day I sat him down and told him how I honestly felt. He was so offended that I didn't like the proposal or the ring. He called me spoiled. I told him I didn't even particularly want a diamond, something cheaper and simpler would have been delightful. 

He said he had never heard of anyone he knows getting the woman's input on an engagement ring. He said I made him feel like an asshole and told me to just take it off. 

Honestly, I just wanted something I would have been proud to wear for the rest of my life. I am a pragmatic person and would rather have had a low-key, private proposal coupled with a cheaper ring I love. I see the ring and I cringe at how embarrassing the proposal was and how ugly the ring is.

259,Not the A-hole,"Kind of a weird situation, and I hope I'm not just being obtuse.

For some background, one of my main hobbies is studying conlangs, or constructed languages. I can understand about half a dozen of them (some better than others), but the conlang I know best is Esperanto, which I first started learning as a teenager and have been speaking for more than half my life. I have several online friends I speak with exclusively in Esperanto, and I also go to an Esperanto meetup in my area once a month to get some extra practice in. I know it's a kind of a niche/nerdy hobby, but it's something I really enjoy. There's an awesome community over at r/Esperanto for anyone interested in learning more about it.

Anyway, as you can probably imagine, there aren't a lot of native Esperanto speakers out there. It's not totally unheard of, it's just not common. So I thought it would be really cool to teach my 3 year old son the language to give him a head start. A few weeks ago I started talking to him in Esperanto, just simple stuff like names for household objects. He's picked up a few words already, and I'm excited to see how much progress he's made in such a short amount of time.  

Well, my wife was really annoyed when she found out and told me to stop. She doesn't think it will be useful for him to learn a ""made-up language"" and she's worried other kids will make fun of him. She claims she'd feel differently if I taught him something like German or Spanish.

I admit I should have talked to my wife first before attempting this, and I accept I may be the asshole on that front. But I don't see teaching my son Esperanto as any different than teaching him a lesser-known language. I get that Esperanto is not the most conventional choice for a second language, but our son is learning English too! There are tons of benefits to growing up bilingual. Still, I don't want to dismiss my wife's concerns outright, and if I really am being dense here, I hope the commenters here can let me know.",161,238,0.91

Now I’m not sure why, maybe he did it to be funny or teach him a lesson I’m not sure, but my husband pushed our sons face into the ketchup on his plate. Now our son is obviously upset and has ketchup up both nostrils and all over his mouth and starts crying (duh!).

My gut reaction was to say (in a stern voice) (sons name!) because sometimes we mix up the names, my husband said “no no he didn’t do anything, it was me” and I said “I know.. it was an accident I meant to say YOUR name”... so then I say “daddy, that was not very nice and you need to have a time out” my husband looks at me like I’m ducked in the head but I look at him and say “please go, we’re teaching him bad behaviour is met with a timeout”.

When he came back I said “can you please say sorry to mikey for pushing his face in the ketchup?”. 

Now my husband is pissed because he says he’s an adult and he shouldn’t be humiliated like that. I disagree because we’re teaching out son that bad behaviour is met with a time out. So reddit AITA? 

I see his point of view... we are the parent and he is the child... but like he did something mean to our son? I dunno...

While I agree, there was one guy who I met a while back, that really changed the game for me. I'll call him John (M/24). Not to sound like a young adult novel, but he was literally everything I wasn't, and we worked really well together. The story there is, things moved too quickly...we both got scared and agreed to put distance between us, work on ourselves, and be friends instead. Aka not talk anymore because being friends with someone you have feelings for is hard. Overall, he was everything I would want in a life partner.

So, last night he texts me outta the blue. We were just chatting and catching up when we began talking about how we were both staying in, not doing anything. He proceeded to ask if I wanted to come over and watch a movie, and I said sure.

I texted my best friend jokingly and said ""I'm going on a date with John right now,"" and she responded pretty negatively and said that she is done talking to me about guys and how I will ""do what I want"" and how she doesn't care anymore.

Disclaimer: im not a very social guy, im not great with interacting with people especially at parties, but i do beleive that im in the right here.


Last night at a party i was taking an uber home with my friend. We were going to take the standard sized uber, just the two of us, for $70. Another friend, ill just call him X, who threw the party told me to upgrade it to an Uber XL to bring alot of people home and he would pay the difference. I told X that i didnt want to do that since i didnt know any of the people, and that if the charge was too big on my credit card my parents would freak out. X started speaking loudly to call attention about it infront of all of the people and forced me into calling the Uber Xl, saying the whole time that if i didnt do it then i would be allowing them to be mugged or worse since the party was in a bad neighborhood (the people who he wanted me to bring were these 3 girls).

Halfway into the uber one of the girls starts throwing up, and i mean THROWING UP. The back seats of the uber were soaked in vomit, I turned bright red with embarrasment and I couldnt even speak. The initial friend who i was taking looked at me and started applogizing for it, i just sat there the whole ride, i didnt know what to do. When we left i tipped the driver $40 in cash. I called X and told him that they could charge us additionally but he didnt do anything besides laugh at me over the phone.

This morning i woke up to an additional $150 charge on my credit card for the cleaning fee, i was furious. I texted my friends who had thrown the party and they said they had no money to pay for it and to try to contact the girl who threw up. The girl who threw up told me she couldnt afford it and venmoed me $30. Nobody else was helping out. Finally, X, the person who had forced me to take them with me snapped me and said that he would pay for some of it. I told him he needed to give me the $120 left by monday. He said no.

Im extremely angry at X right now, i was put into this situation against my will and now i am literally paying the price for it. This morning my dad saw the charge on the credit card and is pissed at me.

AITA for making X pay for the uber cleaning fee?


Update: after reading through your comments, i have concluded that you guys are right, I let X manipulate me. This is for sure a lesson learned, and my goal at this point is to drop X as a friend. My only issue going foreward is that i go to a small school where i am likely to become a loner. X is much higher up in the popularity food chain then i am, which means he could turn my other friends against me.

I feel like I’m always conscious of her feelings and try the very best I can to make up for the fact that I’m gone a lot. Ex: she was stressed from work and wanted a vacation. I had been on the road 8 weeks and wanted nothing more than to sit at home with our dog and relax. But acknowledging that she’s usually great about my trips I booked a week vacation for us on the beach and left the day after I got home from said long business trip. She’ll have a break and I can work remotely from there. 

I recently mentioned to her that my buddies that I rarely get to see (a couple in almost a year) have planned a golf trip for December down in Florida. Trip is essentially free as we are staying at my buddy’s place and playing at one of the CC he belongs to down there. It would be a 4 day long weekend about 8 days after I get back from Russia. She’s busy with work but just happens to have those dates off. I asked if she could switch and because we don’t have kids and medical people have to make their schedules absurdly far in advance she tells me it would be very hard if not impossible to change her schedule.

We live together, and let me tell you our dog is well taken care of. Spoiled beyond belief lol. Also, referencing the day to day responsibilities. I know it sucks that I’m not there a lot to help with cleaning, laundry etc (although I help whenever I’m home). To compensate for this I hired a housekeeper that comes in weekly. This helps take the pressure off her and who doesn’t love coming home after work to a freshly cleaned place? She definitely likes that.

The problem being, they want me to pay the deposit tomorrow and then drive them around gathering more experience while sharing a ride with a coworker who lives not far from me as they don't think I'm ready to drive alone across the distance. They also feel I'll be distracted by Google maps even though it is set to audio and I'll be too tired after work.

I don't want to be a burden and feel embarrassed to have to ride with my coworker when I have a license and means to a car. I also have to means to pay for fuel for myself. So I said I'll withhold the deposit until they let me drive alone, however the rego is due and they don't want to pay for it if I'm not contributing.

He has no friends and the only socialization he got was from our mother and her friends. I've invited him to family events (meaning the ones with my wife and kids like dinners or soccer games) and he always declines with some lame excuse like he's too tired, he's too fat, no one will talk to him, I'll ditch him, people will think he's weird, etc. AND that's IF he responds to his emails, text messages or voicemail.

289,Asshole,"I work in an office with 9 women and one restroom.
It's a single room with a locking door. If someone is in there for too long usually what we'll do is hold it like adults or walk the 50 feet to the grocery store next door and go there.
    
We can all see the bathroom from our desks and know if its occupied or not. You don't need to line up and wait. 
   C
So on Thursday, I had to pee. I got up, walked to the bathroom, locked the door, and peed. Then I hear high heels clacking and around and someone knocking on the door while I'm sitting there. My coworker is knocking on the door in a panic going ""Girl, move your ass I have to go! Hurry it up!""
    
I'm sure you all know that sometimes people do things in restrooms besides pee. I like to pick my nose. I just got over a sinus infection and I've got a lot of boogers right now and I don't like digging for gold or blowing my nose at my desk because it's an open office and that's rude.
    
Someone knocking at the door and telling me to move my ass really annoyed me. So I stayed in there and picked my nose and washed my hands a little longer, because fuck you it's my private time, act like an adult and wait your turn.

I was in the restroom for like a maximum of 5 minutes, the whole time my coworker was outside doing a peepee dance and knocking on the door. When I unlock and open the door to exit, this girl like HURTLES past me and grabs the door and slams it shut, knocking me out of the way. I hadn't even gotten all the way out of the bathroom door yet.

I asked her ""what the fuck is your problem?"" while all this is going on, the door slams in my face and I walk back to my desk.

15 or 20 minutes later she comes out and I get an IM popup.
    
""Sorry for brushing past you, I really had to go!""
    
I respond with:
    
""Girl, that was not a brush. Do not ever knock me out of the way to get past me again. It is rude and we are all adults here. What people do in the restroom is their private time and you should not be knocking on the door telling someone to ""move their ass"" whenever you're in there for hours at a time, the rest of us act like adults and walk over to the grocery store to use the restroom. If you can't hold your bladder long enough to do that, maybe you should be working somewhere that its ok- like a daycare or nursing home.""    

I get back:    

""No one knocked you out the way, don't be so dramatic about everything. You knew I had to pee and then got up and went before me anyway, so yes everyone is entitled to their privacy but I didn't have time, I couldn't wait.""
    
I didn't respond.
    
I should also now probably point out that this girl is notorious for being in the bathroom multiple times a day for 25+ minutes each time, its such  a problem the boss has had to send out ""share the bathroom"" emails before and it's a running joke that if you have to pee when this girl is in there ""you better hope she didn't take her phone"" because she just sits in there on Facebook.     


AITA for how I handled this?


Edit: I get it, I'm an asshole. But here's a little other info: 

1) in the time she was knocking and telling me to hurry and move my ass and doing a peepee dance, why couldn't she walk next door like the rest of us do daily?

2) we know she sits in there on facebook because she used to have us added as Facebook friends and we could all see her posts while she was in the restroom, until another coworker brought this to the boss. We all got removed as Facebook friends and that's when the first ""share the bathroom"" email went around.

3) she has made it a point to harass others in the office while they are in the restroom. No one else has done it to her because we all think it's fucking weird. A week or 2 ago I got a knock on the door asking me when I'd be done because she had a client on the phone wanting to talk to me. BATHROOMS ARE PRIVATE. TELL HIM I'LL CALL BACK.

This bathroom hogging stuff has been going on for a while, not just with me but with other coworkers as well. Multiple ""share the restroom"" emails have been sent around, as well as the suggestion that if you have to go and its occupied, walk next door to the grocery store. This person is at the center of all the bathroom drama because she's the only one that will stand outside the door and knock and tap her feet until you finish. I finally snapped and went full petty. Am I proud of it? A little. Will I do it again?  Probably not.",242,375,0.82

I find out about this and say give the guy a bit more time or I’ll pay to board the cat. Saturday approaches and the guy says he was here and couldn’t reach my brother. My brother might have slept through it or the guy is lying. I don’t know. . Anyway to the point my brother tries to drop the cat off at shelters but they are all full.

so he leaves it in front of my door. He doesn’t even ask me or talk to me first. I live in the desert where coyotes etc will just eat the cat if unattended.

294,Not the A-hole,"When I (21,f) was 18, I got into a relationship with a guy who was practically picked out by my mother. (I am south Asian).
 A month after we got engaged I broke off the entire thing, for I had to sacrifice so much for him and his family (who were my family to, we were distantly related)
Basically everyone in my family except for 2 cousins stopped talking to me and I was accused of being a slut, because I broke up my engagement. 
My mom's brother also sent very hurtful messages to me. 

My mom still is in contact with them, but not as much, for she is embarrassed.

I have a new boyfriend now, we've been together for a year and I love him dearly.

My mother hates him.  She doesn't accept him, has insulted him a lot of times. When I talk about him, she doesn't engage in the conversation,  when I'm with him she starts little fights with me when I come back home. She hasn't supported our relationship and has said some very nasty things like, my bf is just using me to fuck me. That I have already had a failed relationship and this one will fail too. I'm bound to end up alone, no one can be with me because I am broken , my ex is making so mich money I will regret breaking up with him etc.
We fought a lot, and I got kicked out twice in the span of 6 months.
I am back home now and I forgave her but this is my current struggle:

My mother has a partner  who she has been with for 5 years. A few weeks ago he got into a pretty bad accident. Because he lives in another country she couldn't visit him and due to our culture I am the only one she has ever told about their relationship (not even my siblings know) I was there for her, I held her hand I cared for her, it was upsetting to see her sad so I tried to do as much as I could for her.
She was so sweet to me for a few days but then her comments started again. 
Whenever I wanted to go out , she would say that she doesn't go out, she can't afford clothes like I do, if I'm only happy with my bf I should go back to him, I am wasting my life etc.
And then a few days ago I went out to meet my bf at 4 am. She flipped. She screamed and insulted me and said a lot of hurtful things again. She said :,, You wanted to be good for your ex too ,but you failed, I don't care if your bf dies or lives, if you're so obsessed with getting it on with him you should stay with him,  only whores go out in the middle of the night."" When I pointed out that I had supported her a few days ago, she just said it wasn't that big of a deal.
Something just died in me.
I had been there for her struggles with her divorce and her new partner.
And this is why I think I might be an asshole:

My mother came to me today, and said that her partner was dying.  
I'm not proud of it but I said I don't care, that all the things she has put me through and the way she spoke about my relationship  just showed how little she cared for me so why should I care now? 

She went off into her room and I just don't care anymore, so am I the asshole for not being there for her at this moment?


Edit 1 : just to clear some things up.
When I found out about her partner 4 years ago, I didn't accept it at all. My parents were still married and living together and my father always doubted her but I defended her. I don't really blame her for finding someone who she could talk to. But I wasn't nice either when I found out about her bf. But as soon as she divorced my father I accepted their ldr relationship.

Edit 2 : I still care for her , and I would not call her bad names. She has had major hardships of her own and hasn't really healed from all the abuse since childhood.  She has gone through much and although I don't think her behaviour is good , I wouldn't insult her either.",128,708,0.94

298,Asshole,"Posting from throwaway account for obvious reasons...

So my wife has these two male cousins around her age and they are total slobs. They drink a lot, eat junk food, fart/burp often, smell like they don't shower much, often have food stains and ripped clothes, and have no sense of personal hygiene. Their house is disgusting and has urine all over the toilet flood, dirt everywhere, etc.

The unfortunate thing is that physically they have features which remind me of my wife, like you can definitely tell they are related and from the same family.

Although my wife bears no similarities to my cousins with hygiene, whenever we all hang out I find myself seeing their features and mannerisms in my wife, like they laugh in the same way and make similar facial expressions (being family obviously).

I can't help it, but this makes me feel way less attracted to my wife. After hanging out with her cousins it's hard to have sex with her for a day or two because I find myself reminded of her cousins and their disgusting hygiene. I've really tried but I can't push the unease out of my mind. I'll see my wife laugh, and just think of her cousins, and then feel completely sexually turned off.

The thing is her cousins are both really friendly guys, and I have no personal problems with them. Their grubbiness doesn't effect my life in any other way, we don't live together or anything, so it feels like it's not my place to comment on it.

However, in order to preserve my sexual attraction to my wife I've found myself avoiding her cousins and making excuses not to be anywhere I know they will be. We all live in the same city and while my wife is not ""super close"" with her cousins they do catch up at least 1-2 times per month through normal socialising in her family.

Last night my wife kind of confronted me and said ""You always have a work trip or some kind of commitment which coincides with any family event where my cousins will be, do you have some kind of problem with them?"".

I was really scared to tell her the truth that I'm avoiding her cousins to maintain my sexual attraction to her. I'm generally very honest with her, but this felt like dangerous territory to step into. So instead I just made played it off like it's unfortunate that my schedule clashes with theirs so often.

Now today I find my wife wants to set up a day trip for me to do with her cousins, to make up for how little I've been able to see them recently.

Am I just being an asshole here? What should I do here? I can totally see how unreasonable this whole thing might seem to outsiders. Her cousins have done nothing bad to me, and are not bad people. But I can't help feeling so turned off my wife when I see the various similarities between them and her",134,536,0.94
299,Not the A-hole,"I'll make this quick.

I'M 16, my mom is 54.

My mom got a divorce not too long ago. She cried, and had a rough time. I was always there to support her. 

She then started going out with her friends. She went from not going out at all to going out almost every night.

One day, I started crying because she went out almost every night, and it was hard for me to cope with sudden events. 
She said she was sorry, and she'd be more careful.

Then, she got a boyfriend. He's lovely, and his children are too.
(We'll call the boyfriend ""S"").

So, my mom said i'd always be her priority, and I said that was okay. I didn't have a problem with my mom going out with S, or doing whatever she wanted. But what bothered me is when she'd bring him home.

My home is like my sanctuary, and it's an important space for me. I understand my mom has a boyfriend and they should act as such, but I just can't cope so quick with the fact that now he's coming over to sleep almost every day.

When it started, it literally went from not coming over to sleep to coming over to sleep 3 consecutive days.

Today, I had a breakdown in front of my mom (bear in mind, I told her yesterday why it bothered me. She then proceeded to get angry at me and she ignored me at night and the next morning).

When I tried to justify my feelings, she said I was being a brat because I ignored them (yesterday, I was feeling hurt after my mom got mad at me so I ignored them when I passed by them), and that she now had a boyfriend and she'll do whatever she wants to.

I told her I didn't mind if she brought over her bf, but doing it so sudden and so many consecutive days was hard for me to cope.

She told me she'll continue doing it, I was being a brat, this was her house, and I was stopping her life.

Obviously, this made me even more hurt and mad. She said she understood where I was coming from (which, she clearly didn't, seeing as she wasn't considering my feelings at all) but told me to get over it.

Then, I basically went to my room to cry. She followed me, and saw me crying on my bed. Instead of wanting to talk this through, she asked:

Mom: ""Do you want to go to the beach?""
Me: ""No.""
Mom: ""Ok.""

And she left.

Honestly, it was fun. One big problem though, he's a 'bad' tourist. Taking off his shoes on the plane (it smelled bad. It was only a 1.5 hour flight). Listening to music without headphones on the plane. Keeping his luggage on the bus seat when it's so full other people have to stand. Listening to music loudly when walking though a residential area late at night. Causing a scene for things 'he could do at home so he didn't know he couldn't do them here' (after being told he couldn't). Getting very drunk right before our flight and ""flirting"" with a stewardess. He was a few euros short when buying something and took them out of the tip jar. People where glaring at us for most of our stay there. 

That's just off the top of my head, there's more. It was uncomfortable and awkward. 

After we got home to our mom, he said something like ""it was fun. Let's do it again soon"". I thanked him for the vacation, thanked him for taking us with him, but told him I'd prefer not to travel with him again. After he asked why I just said ""X Y and Z made me feel uncomfortable"". 

My dad is very pissed. My mom thinks I'm right (but anything negative I could say about him she'd agree with, so that's not reliable) and my brother is torn between the two, he felt embarrased with my dad but doesn't want to complain either.

My wife and I are planning a trip to Disneyland and we want our kids to really enjoy the experience. My wife thought of going to the makeover booth in the park to get our 2 y/o daughter a princess makeover. When our son heard about this, he wanted to get a princess makeover also. My wife happily agreed but I don’t think it’s a good idea.

Now before everyone starts attacking me for defending gender norms, I want to clarify that I have nothing wrong with my son dressing up and expressing himself. I just don’t want to set him up for failure. I don’t think a 4 y/o is emotionally ready to handle people in public shaming him for not following their beliefs. 

It’s easy to say “screw those people!” but the reality is they exist and letting my son dress up as a princess is opening the door for that kind of criticism and hate.

Just to give a little more background on my reasoning, my wife and I recently went to “build a bear” for a birthday stuffed bear. My son picked out a pink stuffed kitten and when we got in line this rude guy in front of us huffed and said “glad I didn’t have a boy so I don’t have to deal with THAT”. I told him to mind his own business but my son was visibly upset. If we put him in a dress around Disneyland I’d expect there to be at least one asshole to make a scene and ruin the day for our son.

I’m a 23F living with my mom, and I just recently started working two jobs to get out of the debt I’m currently in. When I was around 19, i got my mom a new car under my name because her credit was crap. She agreed to make the payments, which amount to $480 a month. I also opened a JCPenney credit card, and shes used about $500+ of my credit. She also needed a phone so my gf at the time got her an iphone under her plan, which is about $130 a month (phone+data). Last year my mom had enough of her job so she quit and got a new job but a lower paying one. She stopped making the car payment, earlier this year and didn’t let me know. It was about to be three months behind. I found out and we agreed that I would keep the car and make the payments on it (there’s about $12000 left on the car loan). She also couldn’t afford the phone bill so I’ve been left paying it every month (it’s a contract with Verizon). So I’m paying about $710 a month for the car and phone bill and it’s been a lot for me to handle considering I have other bills to pay.

To me, it’s not fair that I have to pay an additional $200 for rent when im already helping my mom out by taking over the car payment and when she left me and my ex hanging on the phone bill.

When we have to talk to partners, she's my partner. Everything went fine until these past two weeks.

She has been grossly flirtatious with me and I have kindly asked her to tone it down about a dozen times. She never really listened. I try moving seats, and she follows me around. I notified the professor but the dude gives no shits. I try and survive the 4 hours a week I have that class, and I'm fine like that.

But, she has been popping up everywhere. In the library, she finds me and sits like two seats away from me and gives me death stares that make me want to melt, and not in a good way. She would come up to me and ask for my number and social medias, and I try and tell her nicely that I do not feel comfortable giving her these things, and I would like for her to stop talking to me while I am busy with work, and to kindly leave me alone.

In class on Friday, she walked in and sat behind me because all the back seats were taken. She kept whispering things I could not understand in my ear, and making slurping noises. We were turning in worksheets, and when she turned hers in and came back, she started poking my arm super hard. I couldn't handle it anymore and yelled that she has to leave me the fuck alone.

Now my boyfriend’s brother knows the situation his brother is in, but after learning his brother is getting his unemployment check soon, he is asking for a cut of it.

To my astonishment, my boyfriend told him he will give him a cut of the check when he gets it. I just don’t understand why he is willing to give his brother money each time he asks when his own brother has turned him away when he was struggling in the past. 

I asked my boyfriend at what point will he decide enough is enough and stop giving his brother money entirely. He told me he couldn’t as long as his brother’s children are involved.. 
He said he hated his brother because of how badly he has scammed him in the past and how cruel he is to him, but he will continue to give him money because his brother has kids to feed.. 
Now he has given his brother’s family food on numerous occasions, but his brother is only concerned with money. 

On the other hand, there is a good possibility his kids needs aren’t being met. I feel awful for this, but I still don’t believe its my boyfriend’s responsibility to continue to help take care of his brothers kids. I hate to know that his brother’s kids could possibly be in that situation, but he shouldn’t continue to give his checks away to support another family when he doesn’t even have enough to make ends meet himself.

315,Asshole,"TLDR:  Am I the a**hole because my fiancé wants to wear a kilt at our wedding, and I told him his reasoning for wanting to wear it doesn't make sense to me, people would make comments about it and I'd rather the focus of the wedding be on, well, the wedding? 


I (23f) am engaged to my 25m partner and we've started to discuss wedding logistics. When it came to plans for dress and tux, my partner stated that he would like to wear his kilt during the ceremony and reception. I was really taken aback because although he does have Scottish heritage, from my perspective it's pretty distant (one parent on his mother's side) and no one from his immediate or extended family engage in Scottish traditions, live/have visited Scotland, ect. He became interested in his Scottish heritage in high school, and his great-aunt helped him research the family tartan and gave him the kilt as a graduation gift, custom made in Scotland.  



From my perspective, just because he identifies strongly with his Scottish heritage doesn't mean that it's appropriate to wear the kilt at the wedding, which is not in Scotland and has no Scottish connection other than his heritage. Very few of our friends and family members on my side even know that he is Scottish, so it's going to get a lot of looks and comments on the day of. He's only worn it twice in the four years we've been together. My parents already think he's eccentric and I know I'd never hear the end of it. Plus, I'd have to see it in pictures for the rest of my life. 



His argument is essentially that his Scottish heritage is important to him, this is one of the only occasions that he'll ever have to wear it in public, and the people who knew his great-aunt (who has since passed) will be surprised and disappointed he's not wearing the kilt. He was really hurt when I told him I'd rather him wear something a little more traditional. He also said the only argument I could make that makes sense to him is that I, as the bride, probably want the focus to be on me and how I look, and while like yeah, he's right on one level, I feel like that's not really the reason I don't want him to wear the kilt.",231,128,0.81

319,Not the A-hole,"Hey Reddit,

I'm not particularly proud of what I've done but at the same time I feel as though my actions were sort of justified. 

To provide some background, my parents are immigrants who moved to Canada in the early 2000s and own several businesses in rural Saskatchewan. We are fairly well off and I am extremely proud of my parents achievements after years of hard work.

So here's where it all goes wrong. I have a friend who I've known for many years now and for a while now, he's been acting extremely disrespectful towards my parents. Due to my Indian heritage, he often pulls some stereotypical comments such as calling me a streetshitter, and saying I should get an arranged marriage. 

I've endured these types of jokes from him for a few years now and mind you, he says them often in the presence of other people at times. Lately though, I've been getting fed up as these jokes have been getting repetitive. For example, the one ""joke"" he pulls most often is by telling others that my parents are homeless working at Walmart. The joke itself doesn't make me bad but the fact that it's the only thing he does is what gets me going. Additionally, he also makes fun of how my dad looks. I will say, my dad is not a looker but I find this a step too far.

So tonight I snapped. In a group chat with some of my buddies (unfortunately him included) he felt the need to post a picture of my dad with some touched up edits. I retaliated by saying his jokes were played out and he needed a new schtick (?) to which he replied that it was funny. 

At this point, I did what I was ashamed of and said that the Walmart jokes about my parents may have been his own insecurities about his financial position coming out. I added on saying that it must feel bad to have a streetshitter who grew up with nothing to earn and become successful while he watched.

At this point, there's been no reply from him yet but I already feel bad. I'm usually one to endure through these insults and keep my head high but today something changed.

So I'm asking ya'll whether you feel my actions are justified or if I should apologize. 

Thanks.

Edit: I also drive him to his place after school and was wondering whether I should just say no from now on. I don't want to leave him stranded without a ride but at the same time, he definitely deserves it.

Edit 2: I sent a text in the group chat saying he shouldn't be making fun of Walmart workers or making racist remarks. He later left the chat and still hasn't responded.",43,34,0.88
320,Not the A-hole,"I work in an office with lots of collaborative projects, usually in groups of 5-10. As long as I've been here, there have been three guys with the same first name (let's say ""Mark""). As a result, to distinguish them, we refer to each by their last name in any group setting. Just an easy way to disambiguate quickly. Probably half the people in the office are referred to by their last names, fwiw. I usually go by my last name, despite not sharing my first name with anyone else.

We recently hired another ""Mark"", who I've been working with over the last month. We originally referred to him as his last name, but he commented that he doesn't like his last name, and would prefer to go by ""Mark"". We tried this, but it was mildly inconvenient (every time someone said ""Something something Mark something something"" someone would stop and ask ""Wait, which one?) and also was irritating the other ""Mark""s a bit. There have been discussions about this, with multiple e-mail chains, and I honestly can't believe how much time has been wasted on this stupid non-issue.

Anyways, I've started referring to the new coworker by their full name everytime we're working in a group, and in e-mails (So, for example, ""I think Mark Cooper is working on the graphics still""). This has really irritated the new employee ""Mark"", since he says it makes him feel like he's not a part of the team. I offered to call him a nickname instead, but he really wants to go by his first name. I was over it at this point, and just continued to refer to him by his full name. 

Anyways, yesterday I learned that he filed an HR complaint against me (and three other employees) over the name issue. I don't think we did anything wrong, but my supervisor thinks I'm being an ass, and should have just done whatever to end this issue. So, AITA?",41,50,0.89

322,Not the A-hole,"I have a female friend who I have been close with for quite sometime now; I've noticed weird things about her but we have a great time talking so I generally ignore them. However recently, friend got into an accident, just a small rear end collision with no rollover or any sort of considerable damage, the bumper was busted up, and I thought all was well.

This friend texted me 2 days later saying she's taking a medical withdrawal from school because she is in ""extreme pain and can barely move anywhere."" Her younger brother who's about 17/18, is in ""horrendous pain and can barely function."" I was stricken back because they were able to ambulate fine, and today they went out to a buffet dinner. In addition, friend told me she is doing a medical withdrawal from classes because her lawyer advised her too. 

I thought the situation was a bit weird and was skeptical until I saw her posting a video of her dancing with her little brother. I haven't been replying to her messages, but I feel a little bit uncomfortable with it. I am not involved at all but I think she is planning on suing the driver who rear ended her, and she's using that as an excuse to get out of all the classes she is currently failing. 

Friend and I are quite close, I am one of the few people she talks to daily, and I haven't brought it up to her about morally unjust this is. Of course, I could totally be wrong and the accident could've like hurt her muscles in an unknown way. Just wondering if I am the asshole for starting to cut her off.

327,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway. We are both 18, for context.

My bf’s mom left when he was 12. There was no warning, she never said goodbye. It really devastated him and sent him into depression to the point where his health began to decline due to the sadness and stress. When we were 15, we started dating. Everything got a lot better until his dad got sick the next year. After that, it’s been good. No problems until they moved into a new apartment that year. It ended up being a bad place & now that their lease is up, him and his dad decided to move out and into a new place. And my boyfriend has agreed to let his mom move in with them.


Here’s the issue though. She’s been on drugs ever since. She left them to live with her drug dealer/boyfriend and meth. She’s not in a good place at all. Neither of them had any clue if she was even alive until last year when they moved in, and only because her bf lives down the hall. His mom is always sitting on the stoop with the bf. For a while, she consistently taunted them by whistling for their attention, yelling at them when they’d come home, stuff like that. He had a talk with her and I was under the impression that that’s the only time they’d talked. Anyway, back to the lease almost being up. For multiple reasons, he decided to move out of that building and find a better one. His dad will live with him since he’s sick & can’t work. I helped him apartment hunt and we found a good one. We were talking about me moving in once they’re settled (which was fine, his dad loves me & thinks it would be great having both of us there), but nothing was set in stone. 


But for the last few days, we haven’t talked (unrelated). This evening, we facetimed for about thirty minutes when he was on his work break. At the end of it, he said “oh btw, I told my mom she can live with me. Love you, bye” and hung up. I instantly texted him and asked what he meant and he told me he was serious. We fought for a few minutes until he really did have to put the phone away and go back to work. I got pretty upset. I’ve been firm about my dislike for his mom since we met and he seemed to be on the same page in literally every way possible, especially with the taunting stuff earlier in the year. So I asked him to explain why he thought it was a good idea, and his justification is that she promised she isn’t on drugs anymore and only needs a place to stay for “as long as it takes” because she broke her leg and is falling behind on rent since she can’t work until it’s healed. She didn’t offer to pay part of the rent to him or help with bills. We kept fighting and it ended with me saying “When this backfires, I will feel absolutely nothing for you. She left you for drugs and now she’s using you for her own good now. You’ll regret this.” He said he was sorry but it was already done, that I can text him when I’m ready to “drop the attitude & be a grownup”. 


So, AITA for not wanting him to let his mom move in?",35,69,0.88

330,Not the A-hole,"For some context, I (20)  work at a local chain grocery store as a supervisor. My boss respects me, as I respect her. My younger sister, D, (17) is wanting to get a job. The first time she put in an application, I told my boss. She warned me that we’d have to work opposite schedule simply due to company policy and me being a supervisor and all, but I told her we were both fine with that. We were in the middle of a remodel and my boss forgot about it while I kept quiet, not wanting to press the issue. I eventually reminded her again and she asked me why I didn’t remind her before, but it was no big deal, she set up an interview that night for my sister at 7.
So it was set. 7 pm, interview. I told all my coworkers how excited I was, and they were excited as well, saying she’d get the job no problem.
My mom calls me and tells me she has an interview for another restaurant earlier that day at 5pm SUDDENLY. And she goes to that interview and decides to start working there.
My sister then calls me and asks ME to tell my boss she won’t be making it in for the interview. And I do that, because I guess it’s no big deal. My boss is a bit miffed, and we go about the rest of our work lives.

Now recently my sister is sick of the job that she’s at now (the one she took before at 5 pm interview). She asks me if she can come work where I work. So I’m going through this in my head and I just see it being disastrous again, where she chooses another job instead of the one she originally wants. My mom also asks that I put in a good word for her again and I tell her that it might be a bit difficult considering she 1. Didn’t show up for the last interview and 2. Made ME tell my boss she wouldn’t come in instead of herself.
Then it became a huge argument that I’m standing up for my boss more so than my family, and I’m acting like it’s the end of the world and so on and so forth. 

I actually did tell my boss that my sister was looking into working here again, and she told me she’d need to think about it because of last time, and that it was sort of a waste of her time considering she never showed up for the last one.

I’m not saying I don’t want her to have a job. But I am a bit embarrassed from last time and I do see where my boss says “I need to think about it.”  But my mom is telling me I’m putting my boss over my sister and tbh, there’s no real side I’m choosing. My mom is telling me I should forget about it and she’s going to start shopping elsewhere since she thinks “this is all bullshit” and stuff within those lines.

AITA for being reluctant about putting in a good word for my sister again???

335,Asshole,"So in 2013, I was at a college debate conference with participants from all over the world. I met a girl that lives and studies on a different continent, there was clearly some attraction and we hit it off. That was the only time we ever met in person. Since then we have maintained contact via instagram and there is a varying intensity of flirting but nothing to the extent that there would be a romantic relationship and we came to terms that it would just be mostly a friendship. In 2016, she solicited nudes from me, and we exchanged some. We haven't talked much since 2016 but she texted me via instagram congratulating me for recently gaining a professional license and we started catching up. My temptations got the better of me and I started shifting what was a catching up conversation to something more sexual( I had no reason to beleive that she was seeing someone), and i started dropping hints. She did not give me any clear indication whether she was interested or not. Finally I bluntly asked for some nudes. She told me I would not be getting any and I responded that that is fair and that i will respect her decision. It felt a bit awkward but I couldnt help feeling a bit like Harvey Weinstein or a sexual harraser. She is still trying to keep a conversation going but I suspect its because shes trying to wear off the awkwardness.  I only felt that it was ok  to ask because we had done this in the past, but I don't know if that is even a valid excuse and/or something that women would not want to deal with.

336,Not the A-hole,"I have a 14 year old cousin. She's super into makeup and watching makeup tutorials and trying out new looks. She's also in theatre/dance so she wears stage makeup pretty often. Her parents bought her first 'high-end' makeup palette for her 13th birthday.
She loves hanging out with me and I often buy her makeup for birthdays or Christmas which she loves. For her latest birthday I bought her a gift card to a makeup store and offered to take her on a shopping day. I organized it with her parents around her various classes and recitals and we made a day of it.

While her parents didn't give me any limits to what I could buy for her I didn't want to get her anything too crazy. She's still pretty young after all. She bought some eyeshadows and new brushes but said she really wanted something for her eyebrows and asked the makeup store employees for their recommendations. I didn't want her to end up with sharpie or 'instagram' brows so I asked them to recommend more brow 'gels' or tools, rather than pomades or pencils. My cousin specifically asked for vegan and cruelty-free products. The employee recommended a clear eyebrow gel by the brand 'Milk' which is known to be a 'natural look' makeup and are very vegan and natural. The employee told us this particular product was made with hemp oil. I didn't think anything of it. The employee pulled out a tester, put it on my cousin and all 3 of us agreed it looked great. The employee told us the price, we agreed again. The employee said she'd put back the tester and grab us the product and meet us at the register. We had our other products rung up she added the eyebrow gel and we left the store.

Now here's where I screwed up. The eyebrow gel was part of an entire line of hemp products called the 'Kush' line. The product was called 'Kush Fiber Brow Gel'. The box and tube with the product in it are plain white, it's not like there are marijuana leaves all over it or anything. I fully didn't notice and neither did my cousin. I saw the employee put a white box in our bag.

My cousin left her receipt in the car when I dropped her off at home and when I read the word 'Kush' on it I quickly googled and figured out what was going on. I quickly texted her mom and said ""Hey one of the products is an eyebrow gel with hemp oil but it's called Kush Brows."" Just in case she saw a tube with the word kush in her teenage daughter's room and assumed the worst.

And she lost it. She said she didn't appreciate me buying her daughter 'drug themed' makeup or exposing her to drugs. Now both of my cousins brothers smoke weed, one of her brothers works at a dispensary. They smoke at the house and we live in California. It's legal! Now her mom doesn't want me hanging out with her daughter alone because I'm a 'bad influence'. I feel like this is the equivalent of buying a lipstick with the name 'Merlot' but did I screw up by buying her a 'drug themed' makeup product? AITA?",54,227,0.94

I stood there dumbfounded by the audacity that this man showed. I then said to him yeah I've got more, but I'll give it to you if you return the dollar.

338,Not the A-hole,"Lemme just start off by saying I'm extremely high-strung. If anybody or anything startles me, I'm guaranteed to at least yelp or jump, probably more. Not my favorite thing about myself, but I can't really change it. It also makes me really fun to scare. Usually, I'll laugh along, I know I'm a huge weenie.

My boyfriend loves to scare me. At this point, it's probably his main hobby. It started when we were first dating and it was annoying, but whatever, he is (was) pretty great overall. After we moved in together, it escalated. He's spooking me probably three or four times a day. He jumps out from behind doors. He grabs me from behind when I'm not expecting it. He pops up in the dark. Every single time, I jerk and scream, and he laughs his ass off. And I'll be real: I'm fucking sick of it.

I've asked him to stop so many times I can't even count. Asked him to stop when we were dating. Asked him to stop when we moved into this place. Asked him to stop every single time he did it for a while. I explained how much I hate it. He laughs, apologizes, says he's just having fun and it's not his fault that I'm so easy to scare. He suggests that maybe I should relax. Motherfucker, you think I haven't tried? I'm walking around with my shoulders up to my ears in my own home.

Another thing: I have epilepsy. I'm medicated and have been free of major seizures for four years, longer than I've known Boyfriend, but stress is my main trigger. About a week ago, after he scared me, I told him, half-joking, he was gonna give me a seizure. That freaked him out. I got a whole blissful day when he didn't scare me...and then he was right back to it.

So today, at work, I made a decision.

Get home. Boyfriend hops out at me with a loud ""BOO!"" And I go down. Pull a figure-four position, shake, tense, the whole nine yards. And Boyfriend flips his shit. He screams, starts crying and apologizing, and runs to call 911 (which, unrelated, but he HAS BEEN TOLD NOT TO DO THIS, *by me*, MULTIPLE TIMES, *unless* it lasts longer than five minutes or I have one seizure right after another). I get up and stop him before he does, explain I'm fine, and tell him why I did what I did.

Well, he's pissed, and still crying. He says he's never been so scared in his life and that I'm a huge douchebag for faking that kind of medical emergency. I almost gave him a heart attack, he thought he might've actually killed me. I told him now he knows how I feel and that did not deescalate the situation. Whoops.

He's threatening a breakup over this and honestly, writing this out, I should've broken up with him before this. But I'm starting to think that maybe I'm an asshole. Seizures are terrifying to watch and to have, and I faked one. Watching somebody have a seizure is not the same as somebody shouting ""Boo!"" at you. Maybe I should've tried talking to him again before I did this, brought in another person, suggested counseling...hell, maybe I just should've tried to calm the fuck down and live with it.

But, yeah. Am I the asshole?

Edit: So, yeah, was not expecting this to blow up the way it did. But just to let everybody know, as of right now, I've dumped (Ex) Boyfriend's ass. I spent last night at my parents' and I'm moving out today (it was initially his apartment, so he can keep it). Up to this point, I didn't exactly think of this as something to break up over. Writing it out helped me see how shitty the situation was, and the comments I've gotten just cemented it.

We definitely both suck here, I agree, but I'm okay with that.

340,No A-holes here,"So this has been a thought for the better part of 2 years. I've finally reached a point where I'm not really sure what to do. Asking reddit for judgment on my possible decision.

My (25m) girlfriend (22f) have been dating for almost 5 years. We love each other very much, and are doing very well for ourselves personally and financially. In fact, we're currently in the process of buying a house. We don't fight often, and when we do, it's always a good learning experience and we better ourselves through it. Except for this reoccurring fight.

About 3 years ago, she developed an intolerance for lactose. No biggie, we adjusted and we both changed our diets to work with her. But shortly after, things got much worse. Like IBS, but on steroids. She is literally sick and pooping 5 days out of a normal week. She has seeked medical help, and spent a lot of money on labs and appointments without any answers. We were both extremely disappointed and frustrated and have been trying things to help her and her situation. She refuses to go to the doctor, despite my constant concern. I've even offered to pay the bill out of my own pocket. She denys and says that my money is just as important as hers (I make 3X more).

 She has restricted herself to potato based meals, crackers, and water or light sodas. Very little meat, very little veggies. It's still unclear as to what makes her sick, but it is almost every day she complains about her stomach, eventually ending in multiple trips to the bathroom.

I can't take her out, ever. She literally can't eat anything from restaurants, I've tried everything from vegan to vegetarian. We were at a family gathering today, and had to leave hours early because she got sick. This is commonplace. I'm missing out on time with family and friends because of her illness that she now refuses to treat. I'm not sure what to do anymore. This has been an ongoing fight of ours for 2 years, and I can't take it anymore. Something needs to happen.

WIBTA if i told her that she needs to do something, or else?

***UPDATE/INFO:***

First of all. I have to say, some of you guys are relentless. No, I do not want to end things with her at all. Not even a little bit. The vulgarity of some of your private messages  is also classy.

""or else what?""

I should have worded that better. I would like to, in essence, put my foot down on the matter. Somehow make her go, push hard in an uncomfortable way. Show her my frustration, but also remind her that this fight is for both of us to endure.

She has already had a colonoscopy, endoscopy, and numerous labs on certain specific illnesses. I cannot remember them all as they took place soon after the symptoms originated, 2 years ago.



I've decided to take some of the comments from folks who are dealing with this simaler scenario, compile different ideas and information that can help her and I out in our battle, and present her with it later this morning. I appreciate all of the redditors that were willing to share their knowledge with this type of illness. I'd also like to thank you for putting me in my place and giving me the self check I needed to go at this with the right intentions. I'll update again after our conversation.

Update:

Late as hell. But whatever, life is busy for me, and I'm not online often anymore.

Anyhow, the conversation was super positive. We talked about it for a long time and I was able to really listen to what she goes through every day. We cried. We laughed.

In the end, she agreed to try again at working to a diagnosis, with my help financially. We'd like to keep the percentages private.

She read through most of the comments, even the hateful PMs from you trolls. And she is thankful for all the help and support from the people who are suffering as well and want to help her.

He recently just got a job at a local grocery store and my parents gave more of a reaction to him getting that job to me getting my dream job. Like, I didn’t even get a good job. They completely bulldozed over me and my exciting news and it hurt my feelings a bit. 

My wife and I were surprised by the reaction to me vs. my brother and I was curious if I was the asshole for being hurt over this? I AM happy for my brother. I just didn’t understand why my hard work was thrown to the side and his “finally getting another job” was celebrated as if he just became president.

344,Not the A-hole,"I live in the U.K. and love Halloween. It’s my favourite time of year and although we don’t celebrate as hard as the US, there’s some decent events where I live that I go to every year.

One of those is a haunted house attraction and, whilst it’s not the best, I love it because I think the dedication of the actors etc. is so admirable. I’m not exactly easily scared and generally stoic as I know that it’s not real, but I like to play along and have fun because that’s what I’m there for!

Last week, I went to a house with my friend. As soon as we entered, she was laughing and acting incredibly disrespectful and arrogant. She kept asking the actors whilst they were in character (and often non-speaking) ‘how are you?’ and going ‘god how can anyone be scared by this sort of thing?!’

Yes, whilst I agree it’s not exactly terrifying, the least you can do is play along! It ruined my experience in there and left me pretty sour afterwards. I think it was just so rude and completely tone deaf. We’re very close friends and I honestly didn’t expect it from her, it really got on my nerves.

Later on, they did a game of ‘what’s touching you?’ where they put various objects into your hand and you have to guess what it is. It was just things like ‘this cotton is actually spiderwebs!’ and other ‘tricks’ that were, to anyone who wasn’t a child, very obvious.

But instead of playing along and going ‘ewww!’ or whatever, she just had to declare what each and every item was in reality - ruining and spoiling it for the kids who were next in line. She actually got scolded by one of the staff who said something like ‘No it’s not (what it is realistically), it’s (spooky thing)! There are kids nearby, come on!’ Which was justly deserved.

It was genuinely embarrassing for me to be with her as I felt sorry for the staff. It’s like going to Disneyland and pointing out that all the characters are just people in costumes. I tried to have a word with her about it but she didn’t get it and said that she loves ‘being logical and brave when everyone else is just scared!’ Like it’s not brave, it’s just socially unaware. 

All these things eventually culminated in me not inviting her to a Halloween event in a few days, which will pretty much be the same sort of thing. She was upset that I didn’t invite her, but just did not understand at all why she was wrong. I genuinely do not want her ruining one of my favourite things to do just because of her arrogance and ego.

346,Not the A-hole,"Me and the lady (both 28) are expecting our first and we’re quite excited, needless to say. She’s at around 22 weeks now and so she’s getting quite large. Obviously this presents with its own problems, she has trouble balancing herself properly and she also says it’s tough to sleep cause she just can’t get comfortable (she tosses & turns a lot). We’ve been trying out all sorts of things to help her; I got her weighted blankets (which were super expensive but anyways), tried getting her fluffier pillows, got her a hot pack, etc etc. None of those worked for her. And since I’m an avid reader of AITA i tried getting her one of those large body pillows, but it wasn’t comfortable enough for her either.

So around 2 weeks ago, she had an idea and asked to cuddle me throughout the night. This has worked wonderfully for her, she’s finally able to get a good night’s sleep which I’m happy about, she says that it comforts her and puts her mind at ease which I’m obviously very happy about. Problem: Now of course I’m good with cuddling In bed, but to me it’s totally different than cuddling while sleeping throughout the night. The latter makes me hot and uncomfortable and generally I’ve been struggling with a lack of sleep since we started doing this. Usually I can deal with a lack of sleep but since this has been every day for 2 weeks I’ve gotten offhand comments from my colleagues asking if I’m okay, that I look dead. It hasn’t yet affected my work but I’m sure that eventually if this continues then it definitely will, which isn’t tenable because although I do make more than enough for us all to live off comfortably and we have a good amount in savings, we are still on just one income because she recently quit her job and will be stay at home for ~ 1yr.

So yesterday after I got home from work I raised this issue to her, I asked her if we could please try to find another solution because this one isn’t really working for me. She was quiet for a minute and she voiced her objections, said that she’s carrying our child which is a huge task and if she’s doing that then I can put up with not sleeping for a few weeks. I got defensive, said that this could put our livelihood at risk and I’m not willing to do that. 

I’m on good terms with her family, today we went and visited them and while she was out of the room her mother briefly brought it up (I assume that my gf told her) and said that it’s not much of a sacrifice and that I shouldn’t be stubborn and do it for the greater good.

349,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend and I recently had one of those ‘what if’ talks. He asked me if I’d take his last name if we got married, and I was honest and said I would prefer not to.

The thing is, I have never really liked the idea of having to just adopt someone else’s last name, I feel like it’s a bit old fashioned. To make things worse, his parents are South Asian and so he has a really long last name with around five syllables. I really wouldn’t want to have a last name that long, especially when he’s always having to spell it out for people. 

He then suggested we double-barrel our names, which seems like a fair compromise, but I’ll end up with an even longer last name. I asked him if maybe we could shorten his last name to just the first part and both have that, but he said no because then that wouldn’t be his last name. I then suggested I just keep my name and he keep his, but he said if we have kids it will make things difficult at airports and stuff if we don’t all have the same last name.

352,Asshole,"tl/dr - kid keeps hurting his fingers playing ball and doesn't believe that the doctor will just do what I'm doing.

I have a 14 year old son who likes to play American football, but keeps catching the ball weird and hurting his fingers. The first time was during practice for his Junior High School team where he jammed his ring finger. I taped it up and told him to try not to use it too much. About a week later he hurt his pinky finger and claimed it was broken. I bought a splint and made him wear it for a month. 

He keeps bugging me to take him to a doctor, but I know from experience that the doctor would have probably taken an x-ray and then told him to wear a splint if it's still hurting and to stop using it for a while. A few days ago, he did the same stupid bad catch thing (I swear this kid is made of glass) while playing with a friend and says his other pinky is broken. This is the first time it has possibly looked broken (a little swollen) compared to the other times when I'm pretty sure he just jammed it or sprained it. 

I still don't want to take him to the doctor, because they're not going to do anything other than x-ray it and then put a splint on it for 4 weeks, but then charge me $1,000 because we just moved out of state and my insurance through work doesn't cover the state we just moved to. He keeps asking me to take him to a doctor, but he still keeps using it and, although it hurts a bit, it hasn't stopped him from teasing the other kids, playing video games, doing schoolwork, or playing catch with his friends. 

I feel like he won't believe me that they will only do what I'm telling him they will do and he thinks they're going to say he needs surgery or something. I'm almost to the point where I feel like taking him to show him that I'm not stupid, but then I might be proving that I'm stupid by taking him and paying the dang bill!

Edit: It is not misshapen or obviously broken (bones sticking out, bent at an abnormal angle, bruised, etc.). I'm not a neglectful parent. I take my kids to the doctor. When I say he's made of glass, I'm referencing that he keeps hurting himself and complains a lot more than any of my other kids. He's very whiny.

Edit #2: I'm not looking for validation to my opinion by posting here. I posted because I was hoping for other people's thoughts to help me broaden my decisions and feelings about the situation. I appreciate the responses and you all have allowed me to see that it might be a good idea, not just for the possibility that it is broken, but because it might be worth it to look into why he keeps getting hurt (which I wasn't thinking about) as well as to validate his concerns. I'll report back if ITA or not.",46,25,0.78

He completely lost his shit because he doesn’t think I should interact with anybody on the internet and searched my gmail account and found my PayPal account. Inside the account was $150 that I had made off of selling graphic design to others on twitter. Since I already knew my dad would be even more mad, I said my friend paid me to make graphics for *him*. He decided to go as far as going to that kids house at 9 PM with me to tell the kids parents. Luckily no one was home but the next day my mom came to the school and told the counselor to contact my friends parents to tell them he gave me his own money. They never responded (thank god) but I got my computer, phone, and Xbox taken. Then my dad spent four hours on my computer searching everything and shouted at me for having Instagram, ESPN, etc. It was crazy and I only got back my TV privileges in April. Then I got my Xbox back in May. But I had very limited time on it. Finally, in June my dad announced I was getting my phone back. I was so excited and...it had heavy parental controls.

358,Not the A-hole,"UPDATE: Waking up to this was amazing, I can't thank you all enough. I spoke to my husband about this over breakfast and he said that his decision to agree last night was inconsiderate (He hadn't even quite realised that I would realistically have to sacrifice my job) and out of guilt. We're going to talk about it more in the upcoming days, figure out some alternative plans, and then approach his parents about it. 

I'm not mad at my inlaws since I know they've been shafted by social work a lot of times. My husband does treat me equally (We separate chores based on hours worked, and we currently work the same hours) and I've inherited a large sum of wealth to afford having a not as well paying job since my parents passed away. 

As for my sister, I should've mentioned this but she has a child with high functioming autism and I suppose she thinks that if anything happened to her that I wouldn't take care of her child (which I mean, she has godparents? But I would watch out for her regardless). I also think she sees both my BIL and her child as just ""disabled"" and doesn't quite understand how much of a spectrum it can be as she's hardly interacted with my BIL. So I suppose she wasn't the best person to ask in the first place. 

------------------

My husband and I have recently gotten the rights to our own house and both really want to raise our own kids, have pets, the general nuclear family I guess. 

I am very close to his family and enjoy spending time with his brother, who's now in his 20s (we are a couple years older). His brother is severely intellectually disabled, however is still 6'4 and quite strong. He requires constant supervision and isn't at all independent - he cant cook or shower or figure out which clothes he needs to wear. He just doesn't seem to know that he needs to take care of himself. He is very prone to meltdowns, and he can't be left alone without freaking out. 

His parents have made sure to take the best care of him he can, and have gotten him social workers and therapists and everything they can afford. However, they don't want to send him off to a care home, because he freaks out so badly without his family. 

Now, I enjoy spending time with him and even whilst dating would ""oversee"" him and take him out on trips myself. My husband loves him dearly as well and is always looking out for him.

However, recently his parents have brought up that they want my husband (the only other child) to take care of his brother when they pass away. They want his brother to live in our house and care for him the way they did. 

My husband was not very happy with the idea, and jn bed started crying out of guilt for ""not being a good enough big brother"". He said he felt trapped and conflicted, but that he had an obligation to his little brother and was going to accept their demand. 

Personally, I absolutely do not want this for us. I do not like the idea of a frequently violent adult man that needs constant supervision around any future children. Both of us intend to work mostly full time, but taking care of his brother would mean one of us (read: me) would have to stay at home. We would have to sacrifice our lives the way his parents so bravely did. It would, frankly, ruin our future plans.

I spoke to my sister about this in confidence, and she said that I was being selfish and I had no right to decide. She said that I'm being ableist and that ""he's human and deserves love to"". I mean I agree, I just don't want to be his primary caretaker. 

Im planning on sitting down and speaking with my husband about this, but my sister is adamant that it is solely his decision and that saying how I felt would only serve to hurt him since I ""don't love his brother"". 

AITA reddit? I feel completely lost.

Tl:dr: husband and i are expected to become primary caretakers of his severely intellectually disabled adult brother, I dont want to as I feel it would destroy our future aspirations.

Note: We did discuss it before marriage and we agreed to financially support his brother, but that we would prefer to make him go to a care home nearby so he can get all the help he needs, and we would obviously come visit and take him out regularly like we did with our grandparents.",125,545,0.96
359,Not the A-hole,"My husband took me to dinner last night. It was a new Korean fried chicken restaurant. They were super busy, so it took a really long time for our order to come out. While we were sitting at the table waiting, the server brought out some Daikon for us as a nice thing because it was taking so long. My husband took a piece of the Daikon and then offered some to me. I said no thank you because I don't like radish. 

I truly thought nothing of it. I feel like as an adult, I should be able to decide what I eat. I know what I like and don't like. However, it really upset my husband that I wouldn't eat it. He pushed the issue at the table. He told me I needed to at least try it. I told him I didn't like radish. He said I wouldn't know if I liked it, I've never tried pickled radish. I told him that I'm not 5. If I don't want to eat something, I don't have to. He went on to say that if I'm an adult, I should act like one. An adult would eat it. 

At this point, I felt like he was just insulting me and I was mad about it. So I told him to drop it. We spent the rest of the meal in silence. When we were walking out, he pulled me in for a little hug and attempted to say something. I told him that I didn't like when he insulted me and compared me to a child. I felt it was completely unnecessary. This started the argument over again. He told me how impolite it was to decline the food. ""Everyone in Western civilization understands this.""

I got my work done, and whenever I had an issue, suggestion or complaint he'd always find a way to accommodate me. I helped him, he helped me. I did everything I could to keep him out of trouble, and he was lenient if I ever needed something like a day off or an extension on something. Even on a personal level we clicked. I helped him move once, I was the best man in his wedding, he watched my cat when I was on vacation.

About 3 months ago new management took over and my boss was demoted. Still works for the company but I no longer report to them. They hired this new woman to replace him. With the management changes, she now manages me and 6 other people (my old boss only managed me and 3 other people)

My new boss and I do not have the same relationship that my old boss and I have. That part doesn't bother me, I know the days of getting away with things are now over.

About ten minutes into the bus ride (which is now even more packed with people), I saw the girl unzip a side compartment on the woman’s backpack and start reaching inside. The woman didn’t look up from her book at all. I genuinely thought the kid was trying to steal something from her.

369,Everyone Sucks,"Context:  during Christmas of last year I (M26) purchased my wife (F26) three gifts.  A makeup set, a light purple bathrobe, and a Scentsy oil diffuser.  When she opened them I noticed an obvious lack of enthusiasm.  She opened them quickly, simply said thanks, and moved on.  After Christmas on our way home I asked her about it.  She stated outright that she didn't like them.  While these were things she had asked for I had missed obvious details on what she wanted.  Yes she had stated  she wanted a robe like her sister had gotten but that her sister's was neutral tones and that she wanted something white or light gray instead.t Yes she had asked for a diffuser but had told me to get a small model.  The one I bought was to big.   She said it was lazy gift giving.

I was pretty upset.  After a heated argument on the way home she left the gifts in the car.  they sat there for a week.  After a week I boxed them up and sent them back.  I asked her if she wanted them before I did and she said I could do what I wanted. After I did we fight about it again. we both end up angry and agreeing no more gifts for birthdays/Holidays.

Fast forward to valentines day.  I plan a dinner out and a walk through a light display in a nearby park.  My thinking is to replace gifts with events.  Nothing material.  I honestly thought it would be a nice compromise. During dinner she is obviously upset.  I ask her what's wrong and she tells me that she was one of only a few women at her work who didn't receive flowers.  I told her we had agreed ""no gifts"" and instead we were going to spend time together and do things.  She said flowers aren't a gift they are a show of love and that I was just being petty.  She stated \*Quote\* ""I'm sorry I made you feel bad during Christmas.  I didn't mean to.  But I want flowers on valentines day."" After that she says that she apologized and that this no gift thing isn't working.  I told her that apology wasn't very genuine and that I was holding to it.

During my birthday I'm to busy to do anything.  On a trip to the liquor store a few days before she asks if I want anything.  I tell her a Band I like and she buys me a bottle.

Her birthday rolls around and I plan a trip to a local festival she's been talking about and then an evening out.  The day comes, she enjoys the festival, we have a delicious meal and come home late.  When we get home she asks for her gift.  I tell her we agreed almost a year ago no gifts. She says I'm not showing her love or respect by being so spiteful.  I point out the agreement.  She states that after valentines day the agreement was off. From her view she had apologized and we should move one.  She yelled ""haven't I paid for Christmas enough yet"".  She reminded me about the bottle of liquor and how I had asked for it.  It all ended with her calling me an asshole and saying I'm holding the fact that she didn't like my gifts against her.

For context I live in Serbia, and for a few years I had a neighbor from Brazil who came there to work temporarily. He and his wife were both black, I don't care about that at all and nobody else gave him trouble, he made a lot of friends, but my town is pretty small and a lot of people especially older are kind of ignorant... So apparently they gave him a nickname that basically means ""overburnt"" in Serbian, it's a mean joke, I didn't even think that was true until we were talking with another neighbor one day and the Brazilian guy said, in broken Serbian, that his name is [This, That] but here people call him ""overburnt"" and he doesn't really understand. My other neighbor was almost laughing, I just felt bad but I didn't want to be the person to tell him what that means... So I told him I don't know either, it's probably a dialectal nickname, and changed the topic.

373,Asshole,"My brother seems to think I was an ass, but my sister says otherwise, so I want some input on this situation.

I (32M) went to a birthday party my sister (28F) was having for her daughter with my little brother (17M) and all of our family. We're a really big family, so there were a ton of people there. 

It was my nieces birthday and she was turning 3. For a game, my sister bought a bunch of canvases and paint for all the kids and held an art contest. Every adult (who had cash) had to pitch in at least $1 for the prize. First place would get $15, second was $10, and third was $5. All the adults would vote on the best piece.

My brother wanted to participate because art is basically his main hobby. Him being the oldest and most skilled, I knew he'd win and just beat all the other kids. So while everyone was voting, all the kids had to go away so it was a surprise to them. During this, I told everyone to not vote on my brothers piece because he's the oldest and most skilled, which isn't fair to any of the other kids. (Mostly) Everyone agreed and we all decided to vote for all the little ones.

After everyone came back, birthday girl won first place, my nephew (7) got second, and my cousin (11F) got third. 

Once we all left, my brother told me he overheard me telling everyone to purposely not vote for him and he said it was an asshole move. I told him he probably only wanted the cash prize and participated only because he knew he'd beat all the other kids. He said whatever and called me a douche. I told my sister about this and she said it was fair, and our brother was just being greedy.",541,2411,0.93
374,Not the A-hole,"My son, S, is 10. I take him to this swim group at the YMCA, which has a range of different ages of kids. One woman brings her son A, who has Down’s Syndrome. 

S is friends with another kid, C, who is a bit of a troublemaker. Last week, A’s mother came up to me and said that C told her that S had called A “a retard.” A’s mother was very offended by this, of course, and demanded that my son immediately apologize to her and to A.

I am not a “my kids can do no wrong” kind of mother, but I always want to make sure I understand the situation. I spoke to S privately about what was going on. S seemed really surprised and said that C had been the one to call A the name. I pressed him several times, and he always had the exact same story. I’m disappointed in him for not standing up for A, but I believe it’s true that C was the one who called A the name. S is very, very shy and reserved, this behavior would be extremely unusual for him. 

A’s mother called me and demanded that S apologize. I said that he did not do it and asked if she’d spoken to C’s mother. She said there was no need to because she already knows who the culprit is. I asked her if A had told her himself what had happened, which I would understand and accept. A’s mother told me that he was not capable of recounting the story and didn’t really remember what happened. I basically told her I was not going to force my son to apologize for something that he didn’t do, and she got furious. She spoke to the rest of the mothers in the swim group, who are now mad at me for not forcing my son to apologize.

My husband says that I should just have S apologize, since it wouldn’t do him any harm. I feel like it would demonstrate to him that I will not stand up for him and I won’t believe him no matter what, which would set up a very poor dynamic in our family in the future.

376,Not the A-hole,"Long story short, I’m a barista at a particular location and I hate my job. I hate working at this place, I hate my coworkers, I hate the people I serve and I literally just can’t do it any more. This job is destroying my mental health.

If I leave right now, a barista will be by herself at 1 PM. There’s already another barista that is working but she leaves at 1. I don’t like both baristas so I wouldn’t feel bad about leaving them. The night shift barista will be by herself until someone is able to come to the store to work with her. 

Nobody likes working weekends and I’m the only barista that pulls doubles every weekend. Then on top of that my manager has done really shady things like giving everyone raises on the low and couldn’t even give me a raise. When they hired me I had three years of barista experience and gave me the entry level pay. But then my manager turns around and hires her best friend who has no barista experience and pays her $3 more than me. Then she gave several other people raises because they claimed they worked too much but they literally do nothing. 

I really can’t do this anymore. I can’t keep working like this. I don’t have any kids, I’m a college student, and I live with my parents at the moment. So me walking out won’t affect much. I can find another part time job soon.

377,No A-holes here,"Just recently I(29m) got back together with an ex girlfriend (29f) who I had previously been dating for 4 years, after a break of a bout a year.

When we began dating we were both 24. Within our first year together a lot of shit went down, the heaviest of it is that both her mom and brother passed away in a terrible car crash. He dad survived but he is disable and has trouble walking etc, he’s pretty much apartment bound. She has no other family in the country.

I have a huge family and we pretty much took her in. She came to all our family events and I made sure to make it clear that my family was her family. My cousins loved her, my sister looked up to her, everyone was very tight.

We broke up last year because I didn’t feel ready to commit - I wasn’t quite sure about myself or the relationship anymore so wanted time to figure those things out. I did - I did more work on myself and feel more mature and actually ready to commit (I want to propose eventually).

My girlfriend however took the breakup really hard. This is where the asshole part comes in. She reached out to my cousins and family a few times to say she cared for them and wanted to still be in each other lives. My family asked what I wanted and I said I needed space, and unfortunately this got miscommunicated in the sense that my cousins and sister never replied to her.

Now, our relationship is better than ever but my girlfriend can’t really let this go - she said she felt abandoned and that I was an asshole and could have done things differently given the scenario. I think that is was a breakup and they suck either way.

379,Everyone Sucks,"My sister (27F) and I (25M) have a rocky relationship. There have been numerous  arguments over the years and, put simply, we’re on speaking terms but in no way close. This will be important later on.

After finishing University, I convinced my family to get a dog under the promise I would front the bills. I moved in with the folks to save up money from my new job and we got a beautiful Labrador pup. It was great. Eventually I found that my career path was wrong for me so instead looked to start teaching English abroad. It meant moving away from home but my parents knew I wanted to go and agreed to look after said dog providing I continued payed all her expenses. Of course I said yes.

Here’s the problem; there was a discussion before I left as to if she should have a litter. In my mind, it felt like the right thing as to continue her family line the once before getting her spayed. My father especially was keen on having another pup ‘to keep her mother company’. Due to my work, however, I emphasized that depending on my term time I might not be around. They assured me this wasn’t a problem. Fast forward to today and we have 10 beautiful puppies. Nine of these pups will be sold to close friends or a good family for a one time fee and one will be given to my father (for free). All is well and good except… my sister just decided that she wants one.

My argument: I said from day 1 that my sister wasn’t having a puppy. She’s a first time single mum with a two year old son looking to start working soon for several days a week. That means there will be days she physically can’t look after said puppy. This and she already has a year old kitten in her house that she doesn’t have insurance for. Added in that she previously had several cats that she gave away because she lost interest then it’s my firm belief she only wants this puppy because she thinks it’s ‘cute’. Puppies, however, quickly grow up. A dog is suppose to be for life and I don’t think that will be the case here.

Their argument: Her and the puppy have already bonded. If I don’t give her the puppy then I’m driving a wedge between us, breaking her sons heart, and will also be causing further problems down the line as she has said multiple times that she will hold a grudge against me unless I change my mind. I’m also apparently putting my parents in a bad spot as I’m making them say no to their daughter.

Just as a last word, I’ve stressed to my father I understand how everyone feels but I physically own the mother dog, I’m paying for all the fees, and until now I had the final say on to which homes the pups were going to. They seem to think the decision is theirs to make and that I’m making it difficult for them just because.

AITA for not giving in and insisting the puppy goes to a different owner other than my sister?

&#x200B;

Edit: A lot of YTA decisions are because I've abandoned my dog. Just to add some INFO, I teach for a few months then come home for a few months. Looking at maybe 8/9 months teaching, 3/4 months back at home. It doesn't change the argument that I'm not around as much as I should be, but I can assure everyone the dog is well looked after and happy.

&#x200B;

Final edit: So lots of comments and the post is super divided but there's a few common threads. I accept the judgement of TA for breeding my dog in the first place, although just for INFO she has had all the medical checks and was safe to do so (the pups are the KC registered and healthy). The second part is a bit more difficult as although some people said to just give her the pup because I lost the right when I moved away (another fair criticism), I still feel as though doing so wouldn't be in the best interests of the pup. As it was suggested, I'm going to make a list of criteria that my sister would HAVE to do beforehand although I fear this might make me come across as controling or whatever. Either way, thanks to all the comments. I tried my best to respond to them all without coming across as a butt and they did help even if it wasn't what I wanted to hear. I'm going to stop responding now because because I seem to be causing more problems than anything else with some heavily downvoted comments which I should apologise.

I am in a very loving relationship with my current boyfriend of almost 4 years. We have already been discussing about marriage and deciding small things. We decided on a very small wedding and choosing only some close people to come.

Both my parents and his mother are excepting of this. My Grandmother and other extended family are very angry at me though.

Why? 

Because I am decided not to invite 3  certain people.

My aunt and uncle who are very snooty and treat my parents like crap. Due to taking their grandkids side, 1when he tried to screw my parents out of 8,000$ dirt bike my dad owned.

Demanding it'd be given to their grandson for free. My parents told them hell no and left with the bike. So there relationship has been dead and I have no respect for them. 

The third person is my older female cousin. She is very bratty and spoiled. My grandmother and her parents always spoiled her. She also has this huge obsessions with weddings. And always boasted that she'd be the first of us cousins to get married.

She has a boyfriend.

(Who was a husband of her former employer that she seduced into leaving his wife for her.)

But her boyfriend have been together for 6 years and he has no intentions of marrying her and has said so.

So my cousin is very spiteful at the fact that me and my boyfriend are going to get married sooner than her. And is very vocal about this. 

So no I don't want her around.

While I was helping, she started talking to my sister and her friend about her son Charles 'problems'. I was semi involved in this conversation, and I heard the stuff she said, and it was basically this: His grades were good, but he got a 75 in one class. He was caught at a party where people were drinking alcohol. He hangs out with his friends sometimes to '11 at night' which to her must be insanely late or something. He plays violent video games. He skateboards and bikes all day (why is this even bad????) Then she nearly burst out into tears at one point, saying she was so worried that he was going down a wrong path. I went to her and tried to comfort her by saying that the things she said hes doing are totally normal at his age, they aren't strange or abnormally bad at all. I told her that going to parties with alcohol at 17 is not weird at all, and that most kids do stuff like that and end up fine. I told her that she shouldn't freak out about this stuff, its not abnormal, and he will end up fine.

I kind of thought she might like... apologize for freaking out or something.

386,Not the A-hole,"Longtime listener, first-time caller.

My BF and I went out for a dinner date last night, to a decently upscale small plates restaurant--the type where you order multiple plates over the course of the evening. 15 or so minutes after we're seated, the bartender comes over and asks if ""R,"" our waiter, had gotten our drinks order. Not yet, which in my mind isn't a good sign. We put in our drinks and appetizer order, and continue to wait.

30 minutes later (45 total), R finally comes by. We've noticed that since then, he had seated and taken the dinner orders of two other couples who came in after us. Feeling completely ignored and very hungry, BF and I are displeased.

Over the course of our two hour meal (service was very slow, but I don't know how much of that was R's fault), R comes by a total of two more times. As service had felt completely mediocre, when our split check came, I wrote 0.00 in for the tip and wrote a note at the bottom: ""dreadfully slow service."" Once we left, my BF expressed him being upset with me doing this. His rationale was a) a 10% minimum tip would've been sufficient without hurting R's livelihood, and b) if I was so annoyed, I should've said something in person.

Is that true? AITA?

The kid wasn't planned but he still loves him to death, and since coming into the family i've grown a love for the kid aswell.
We have him over every weekend (except if something comes up) and i sacrifice alot of my free time for family time.
We take care of eachother like a family.

Things have been stressful lately.
My fiancé has been taking alot of shit at work, i'm in college and has a big test coming up, things like that.

Yesterday the kids mother said that he had thrown up during the day and had a high fever.
He caught the stomachflu.
So i assumed that he wouldn't be coming, since it's not very wise to spread the disease to begin with, but apparantly they agreed to ask him if he was up for it tomorrow.
I told him i didn't think it was very wise, since its very contagious and we can't really afford to get sick right now.
Then he started accusing me for not letting his son come over because he was sick and i didn't treat him like family (wich isn't true, he's been sick and treated here by me loads of times).
So i told him that ofcourse his son should come if he really wants to, but that i needed to spend the night somewhere else as i didn't want to risk it.
Then he started to accusing me for making him choose between me and the son and didn't want his son in our lifes etc.
Wich is so off, none of these things have ever been true.
I'm always the one who encourages him to spend time with his son.
And it's only one night because i'm sensitive to the stomachflu virus and can't afford to miss this test.

390,Not the A-hole,"1 (25f) am a primary school teacher (for those who don't know how the UK school system works, kids attend primary school from ages 4-11, and then high school from 11-16) and I usually teach kids who are 4-6. My class at the moment is 4/5 year olds. 

There's a kid who started with the class last month. He is 5 years old (just turned) and his parents are currently working on getting him a getting him evaluated for autism. He has a mental age of about 2, and has many needs that his other classmates don't have. He is completely untrained potty wise, does not speak very well, and does not attempt to do class activities. As a result of this, he has unfortunately been picked on by numerous children. 

Of course, I have reprimanded all of the children who have been bullying this kid, but as soon as one child stops, another starts. Kids are brutal. We have tried to make arrangements for him (such as not having to take part in PE so the other kids won't see his diaper. We tried having him change in a different room, but this did not help the picking on) but nothing has really helped. 

He does have a teaching aid here, but she only does mornings (budget cuts :( ) and he just isn't making much progress. This, along with the bullying, makes me feel like he would be better with more help, and kids who also have special needs (he is the only special needs kid in his year group). There is a great special needs school not far away, that I'm sure he would be able to go to and flourish in.

Last week, I pulled his mother aside after school and explained what was going on. She blew up, screaming about how we shouldn't allow her son to be bullied out of school (I've explained to her a few times about this issue before, but she said he will be fine) and that he is 'not that delayed'. It's not my place to tell her her son IS that delayed, so I just gave her the information for the school and she stormed off. 

She left a complaint with my boss. He said that he agrees that the child would be better somewhere else, but also said it's not my place to tell the mom how to parent. I didn't think I was telling her how to parent, just recommending something. I never said her son was being kicked out of school or anything. AITA?",485,2225,0.97

396,Not the A-hole,"So basically this story requires a lot of background info, so bare with me. 

I have kind of a strange family dynamic. My dad is 71 and has been married 3 times, I am part of the second batch of children. I have an older half brother and sister from my dad’s first marriage who are in their 40s now. I am 24 and have a 26 year old brother, and I have a step brother who is 21 from my dads current marriage. 

When I was 11, my dad left my mom, my brother, and I to be with his current wife and her son. He just packed all of his stuff one day while we were at school and left. I didn’t hear from him  or talk to him for about a year, until my mother made me call him because “he’s your father”. My brother kept in touch with him and would occasionally go over to his house. This is not something I was comfortable with and I always felt unwanted because he never was the one to reach out to me. My mother was very resentful (understandably so) and would tell me about the awful things my dad would say about me, that I was fat, etc. This obviously made me not want to see him even more. 

 My dad is very well-off, but when he left we struggled a lot. We’d go days without food often.
My mother struck a deal with my dad that she wouldn’t go after him for child support if he put us through school. He did pay for all of my university and I am extremely grateful for that. When I became an adult, I started visiting him more because I felt it was the adult thing to do. I also would call him occasionally. I’m a very introverted person so it’s not unusual for me not to reach out for months at a time, not even just to my dad. 

Lately, every time I call him I end up crying because he makes me feel extremely inadequate. I am the only person in my family to have attended  university and I am (was) proud of that. I work in a field that I love and have always wanted to work in, but it’s not the most lucrative. Meanwhile, all three of my brothers do the same thing that my dad does and it is extremely lucrative. He is very proud of all of them. I don’t feel that same pride from him and it makes me wonder why I even chose to further my education at all. 

I carry a lot of emotional trauma from what my dad did and I struggle in relationships because of it. I have never received an apology and that really hurts me, because although I’m grown up now, I was just a kid when it happened and I didn’t deserve to feel unwanted by my father. At this point, I call him maybe 2-3 times a year out of obligation, and feel crummy every time I do. 

My brother just recently confronted me about this saying that my dad is very sad about me not reaching out more, that he’s seen him cry over it, and that it’s not fair for me to do this to him as he’s getting older and won’t be around forever. I think if my dad actually wanted to mend our relationship he would reach out to me and maybe apologize. But he doesn’t. So I’m not sure here...Am I the asshole?",20,27,0.97

403,Asshole,"I (21 M) moved back with my family (mom, 42 and 6 yo brother) from a larger city because of better job opportunities (my mom was very happy with it). Yes, i drink, a lot, just because:
1) i am very tolerant to alcohol, it takes me a bottle of vodka to be just talky and act funny
2) i like the feeling of calming down and  I read a lot, so alcohol for me personally, makes reading even more pleasing because of my OCD
3) i have never acted weird because of drinking, i am in general very patient and calm person and avoid any conflict possible. If two drunk dudes are in a fight, i am the one who makes them hug each other 10 mins later. All i do when i am even really drunk is reading / doing work for my job / just sleeping if i suddenly get hella drunk

I pay for my part of an apartment, because i own 1/3 of it (just my room), cook my own food, but every day i have to put on earphones and just ignore my mum screaming and waving her arms impatinately for “awful smell in our apartment”. I leave my room about 4 times a day, and never had such remarks from people or romantic partners with whom i’ve lived with, i dont even mention the reaction. She just stands and screams for 10-20 mins even tho i just dont look and react, then leaves, screams to herself how is she done with me and calling me names for amount of time, and then comes back. Over and over.

Today she came to my room and said that i MUST move out and if i don’t, she’ll call the cops.

I get that i drink a lot, but no bad words, no bad actions were given by me to anybody because of that. 
But the shame she puts in me having this habit is making me think that i am mad and this is inappropriate from my side. The fact that each one of our siblings dont drink (no, not religious at all, not even close, just don’t like it) and that she always is making up that i am drunk af every day (which i am absolutely not bc if i am i stay at my frends/bf place to not make her more upset than she already is) does make it worse, cause everyone thinks i am pure evil and disgusting. 

Dear reddit, i really don’t know what to think and what to do. I love my room and i want to stay in my beautiful room, not renting some greesy and not even decorated disgusting apartment for 3x times more that i am paying rn. I have my plans for saving money. I really love my family. But everyone around are shaking heads and saying mean things to me. I can deal with most everything, but i really need a fresh and honest opinion from the side.

405,Not the A-hole,"I'm 16 and my mother has a chronic disease that impacts her movements and makes day-to-day life harder. My mother's sister (my aunt) really doesn't want to hear anything about my mom being sick saying that she isn't a doctor. That makes my mother turn to me.

-
The problem I have is that my mother constantly asks **me** about what to do with her various problems around her illness. I really don't know - I'm only 16, not a doctor. I get so frustrated because she asks me hard questions every day and she get angry/saddened when I answer with ""I don't know"". She's talking to me like I know everything when in reality I don't know shit.

EDIT: 

Thanks for all the kind and wise words Reddit. This evening I've (with your help) had a real sit-down heart-to-heart with my mother. 

She told me she didn't think of the effects that looking to me for advice could have on me and my mental health and from what I could see she seemed ashamed of her behaviour. I don't really put that against her, if every one of my days was a challenge progressively getting worse I sure as hell wouldn't be thinking of everything.

In this conversation I've also helped her reach out to a support group on Facebook and she's now seeming more positive about to going to a therapist - actually seeming ""exited"" for her first time next week.

 As for me I think I'll go talk to my school therapist/counselor or maybe if that doesn't work go visit a youth guidance center with other therapists at hand for free and totally anonymously. I'm actually pretty happy right now even if stuff may not be ideal at home, great friends and finding going to school fun really makes a lot of difference.",31,157,0.96
406,Not the A-hole,"Two things to note at the top of this post: this is an alt account, because I'm fairly sure my sister monitors my main lol. Also, I know my sister is an asshole in general and that's not what I'm asking for here. I wanna know if it'd be a shitty move for me to grass on her. 

So, as I said just there, my sister is not a very nice person. She's very entitled and spoiled, and is honestly just kind of a fucking bully. She was known for it at school and it definitely hasn't stopped in her adult life. She's also getting married soon, oh joy. 

We were both at mum's house the other day and she was talking about her plans for her bridal party. She said she's having six bridesmaids: our little half sister on dad's side, four of her close friends and our cousin. I was pretty shocked that she wanted the cousin to be a part of the bridal party. She's a really awesome person and everything, but I didn't think she and my sister were close. In fact, I didn't think she and my sister had even spoken for at least a year or two. Turns out I was right. Seeing mum and I were confused, sister laughed a bit and said ""imagine how pretty we'll look in pictures with her!"" 

Cousin has a lot of scarring down one side of her face from an accident when she was a kid. She used to be incredibly self conscious about it as it is rather obvious but she's more comfortable with herself these days. However I know her appearance is still a pretty sore spot for her. Case in point, some rude arse man in a pub made a comment to her about it a few months ago and she got really upset and went into a depression for a couple of weeks. 

I don't want to upset her or make her feel shitty, but I'm also totally disgusted (though not surprised) by my sister and hate the idea of my cousin being in the bridal party while the rest of them are all laughing about her behind her back. However, I'm scared that if I tell her she'll have the same reaction that she had to the knobhead in the pub. Plus she'd inevitably tell my aunt what my sister said, and it would definitely cause family drama. Would it be a dick move for me to tell her? Or is it the right thing to do?",145,683,0.98

We're 19 years old and in university if that matters. So Alice has been complaining about her crappy laptop for awhile and it finally died this past weekend. Now she complained about having to do all her assignments at the library because she hates going there.

I asked her how come she didn't get a new one, because I can't imagine not having a laptop, at least for school, and she said she doesn't have the money saved up right now. So I asked how come her parents didn't buy her a new one and she was surprised and said her parents wouldn't get it for her anyways. I thought maybe they're strict and that's what I asked, but then she was offended I implied that and said, ""no, it's just that not every family has money to throw around"". My other friend Adam laughed and it made me feel embarrassed. My family isn't super rich like she implied, we're fine, but I feel like she was being mean to me because I asked if her parents were strict. So I don't know if I'm missing something and what I said was ignorant or if she was unecessarily offended.

I like him and if he would've told me he was in love with literally anyone else that would have hurt too but not nearly as bad as knowing that its her again. 
 
With ""ending the friendship"" I dont mean flat out telling her to fuck off or ghosting her, just hanging out less when we are out partying or generally aroubd guys. I like hanging out with her when its just the two of us or with friends

416,Not the A-hole,"ok so this is pretty big for me.  I am 17 and a senior in HS this is my final year of football and this offseason I put a SHIT ton of work to give it my best and honestly I've had a blast this season.  The coach that was the coach for my first 3 years resigned and so we got a new head coach and coaching staff.  I was down for that cause I didn't have the best relationship with that coach.

The season went and its been good but about a month ago before a game they had me doing this drill where I basically just get tackled over and over and over till we switch over to offensive time.  I never outwardly said it but I didn't like the defensive coach I think he's too hard on players and his style of just yelling at kids and telling them they are worthless without telling them how to get better flawed and ineffective.  But I was the tackling dummy and after (and my dad counted) 25 hits of players going 100 percent while I am I just fell to the floor and started spasming out.  I got helped up and WOW I have a stage 3 ER recommended concussion.  So I left the game and got it checked out.  I was fucking PISSED at that coach for having us go 100 percent on that drill and then never got a sorry or anything once I got the concussion all I got was a ""don't lower your head next time"".  My mom and dad were PISSED at that coach for having ONLY me do that.

I am better now and after I was out for 3 weeks with a head splitting concussion I was cleared to play and I could run without getting a head ache.  My FIRST game back that same dip shit coach had me do the EXACT same drill that injured me before.  I tried to protest but he just said ""stop being a bitch and get in here"".  So I did it and it was whatever, but I could feel my head pounding and got another motherfucking concussion.  This one wasn't that bad and I was back in 2 weeks.  This time my parents said if I get another one I'm done with football.

During the next game back he finally got the idea that maybe just maybe having the same kid in for 25 times is absurd and had ME (of course it had to be me) and the smallest kid he could find to switch off.  I could feel a head ache creeping up but not a concussion I know what a concussion feels like and thats not it.  After the game I was PISSED that this coach in my eyes is literally trying to kill me.

I asked my friend why he doesn't like me and he said after I got my concussion where I had a borderline seizure he said to one of the captains.  ""god dammit that pussy is hurt"".  I was completely shocked when he said that.

It is a friday night and I am THIS close to marching right into the HC office turning in my gear and walking away cause I will NOT stand for that fucking guy to get me killed out there.

419,No A-holes here,"My roommate and I moved across the country this past July. We settled into a one bedroom apartment because of convenience/ timing and the nature of my roommates (RM) job at the time. Originally, RM was going to be away for months at a time. When she would be back home, I would sleep in our living room so she could have much needed privacy. Her job would have had her on a boat surrounded by people constantly.

That job fell through and we had already signed a lease for a one bedroom so right now I sleep on a mattress in the corner of the living room. We are both making this work and it's not too bad.

RM's dad wants to fly over here to visit for a week. This I wouldn't have any issues with except he wants to stay with us... in our one bedroom apartment... which we still haven't really furnished...

I think it is kind of rude to visit right now because we are still getting really settled in. RM is still looking for a job and we will both be busy during the week he wants to visit. This whole plan was made by him two days ago and he plans on visiting in two weeks. We only have two beds, no couch and nothing really saved up to buy extra furniture at this time. 

I complained to RM about how inconvienent it is and she seemed upset about my reaction. She is very close to her family and was sad about not getting to spend the holidays with then this year. I am pretty distant with my family and will rarely spend holidays with mine. 

Overall, I think RM's dad is being inconsiderate to our current situation and he should either postpone his trip or get a hotel room.

TL/DR: one bedroom apartment, roommates dad wants to visit and stay with us. Two beds no couch, we moved across country this past July.

AITA?

Edit for Info: We plan on getting a two bedroom at the end of this lease in a couple months (only a 6 month lease). She is open with talking to her dad on speaker while I am present and will even I'll invite me to talk too but I usually decline. He is aware of our living situation but I dont know if he knows about the lack of furniture. RM always talks about how her family visits each other and the assumption is always that they all stay together at someone's house. No one does hotels apparently. 

We will have things better put together in the next 4-5 months (better housing, more furniture, we can take time off to host guests). Right now is just a bad time.

I have no problem with her seeing her dad. I even encouraged her to take time to visit them instead so she can see her whole family. Her dad is insisting on coming here to visit.",44,75,0.97
420,Not the A-hole,"Hi reddit! 16F here!

My aunt on my mums side lives in a little country town that’s a 5 hour drive from where we live, near the city. They’ve come down for this weekend. My Aunty, my uncle and their two little boys (6 and 8). 

My Aunty and uncle came, dropped our cousins off, and left within 20mins. My parents said that this was okay and they would be willing to babysit, as my aunt and uncle came down to catch up with some friends. 

Now, I have exams in two weeks, so I have a lot of assessments sure next week. I told my parents I was fully intending to study for both exams and all of my assessments this weekend and she was aware of this. 

However, for the past three hours I’ve been babysitting. She had a nap, and my dad has been sitting on the couch playing on his phone. I have a party tonight, for one of my closets friends as he is moving countries, and my mum is using that as an excuse to make me babysit. I generally stop studying around 6 anyway, which is when the party starts. 

She knew that I needed to study, as I had assessments to complete (a 3000 word history essay, two practice Philosophy exams, 10 politics articles to review and analyse, an English story to write and a math test to write notes for). Most of these are halfway done or almost fully done, but I also need to prep for exams a bit more. 

I just told her that I would not be babysitting anymore. My cousins were welcome to come talk to me if they liked but I wasn’t going to be actively caring for them. She agreed to have them so they’re her responsibility. She’s now calling me selfish, as she does a lot for me.

425,Not the A-hole,"So for the details I've been in this band for a little bit and we're about to record our first few songs for an EP/album thing, I play drums and was very upset when the member who is also the amateur audio engineer who's going to be recording and mixing basically told me we're going to use programmed drums because of expenses and ease of use and stuff like that. It's something I would understand except there's no reason we shouldn't be able to collectively put in the effort and money to record at a local studio or for mics to actually record drums with. Because they also constantly spout that real drums only sound good when done on a multithousand dollar level and professionally, and most bands smaller to medium popularity use sample replacements anyways, which I think is not true but I'm also wondering about that too. And when I mentioned someone who's a friend that offered to record for free and how much I really want to actually play on our record I was basically told that from an engineer's perspective programmed drums just sound better so that's what we're gonna do, no questions asked. There wasn't even really a conversation when we talked recording about even trying real drums they basically just went straight to ""oh yeah we're just gonna program it cause it's easier and sounds better"". So I don't know, am I taking things too personally and getting too upset over this or should I keep fighting to have real drums on this record? Also to clarify I'm the drummer for the band like I wasn't asked to be a live drummer only or whatever, I am an equal member of the band and I just want to be treated as such.

426,Asshole,"To start with, my gf and I have a solid relationship and have been together for 2 years. 

Around the beginning of our relationship my gf grew more friendly with this guy that openly has expressed how infatuated with her he is, in fact it became almost a joke among her family. He’s now apart of her friend group and one of her best friends. 

Throughout our relationship there have been times where I have asked my gf to tone down the level of physicality she has in her relationship with this guy and to not exacerbate the situation with him. Some of these things include swapping clothes with him at parties, and grabbing at his underwear/ass to mess with him in front of people. 

I mentioned this to her after seeing him openly talking about her and him being in a relationship  and she realised how it was making me feel and told me she would lower that part of their relationship. Since then there has been no issues until tonight.

My gf and I go to uni in two different countries so at the moment I don’t get to see her often. Most of her friend group are in uni in a city close to hers and she went to visit them. This involved going out and drinking and partying etc which was all great until my gf had to leave early because she felt too drunk.

Her friend told her he would take her back to where she was staying but according to my gf she felt like she couldn’t make it that far and they ended back at his house where she was then sick and got into his bed.

My issue with this situation came about when I then found out she had gotten into bed with him and I was then sent videos by him off of her phone showing her cuddling him while they were lying in the bed.

Due to the way this guy has felt about my gf in the past and possibly currently I felt upset at this and thought it was crossing a boundary. I told my gf this and she claims she can see my point of view but says it bothers her because she doesn’t want it to ruin her relationship with her friend.

I asked her like I have before to not do stuff like this with him as it makes me quite uncomfortable, but she is now acting like it’s my fault for feeling this way.",52,50,0.93

432,Not the A-hole,"Full disclosure, I don't get along with my half sister.  She's 40, single, and with no kids.  I had been living with her rent free when I moved in with her years ago and got my gf pregnant.  She's always wanted a kid and refused to talk to me when she found out and then kicked me out.  She even admitted it is was due to her own issues.  Ever since then I haven't been a big fan.  I understand she was definitely helping me out by letting me stay there for free and having a kid in there wouldn't have been good.  The way it went down left a bad taste in my mouth and there have been some other issues in the past.  I mention this so that I don't come off all innocent and I know stories can be one-sided.  I definitely have bad feelings about it all and I'm just not the biggest fan.  

To get to the AITA.  For some reason every year she wants to pay for a photo shoot for my daughter on her birthday.  It's very weird to me but I go along with it to keep my parents happy who want her involved in everything. My own father can't even send a photo of my daughter without her being included in the group chat.  If she's left out when I send something he always says, ""why isn't your sister involved?  You know she likes these photos."" Everything from him has to have her included in the family group chat. 

Anyway, this year I didn't think we were doing it because no one said anything.  Whew!!  Wrong.  I got a text a week or two ago asking about it.  My babies mama and I normally go with her on these photo shoots but this year she's requesting to do it on her own and surprise us since it can't be on a weekend.  She had originally mentioned a Friday and I told her fine.  Now today she says Thursday and asks if that would work.  My GF and I don't live together right now and I always pick her up on Thursday and get to spend time with her after being away.  

So, I said, maybe we should do it next month when there's more availability.  After all, she did ask.  I told her she'd get home too late since it's starts at 4pm, she'd pick her up at like 1-2pm which is when I get her and make sure she's ready by 4pm and by the time she got here(7-730pm) it would be time to put her to sleep.  I'd get one hour.  After not seeing my daughter for 4 days Thursdays are my favorite because I get to see her after her being away.  

Well, apparently saying that made me a horrible person and I have both of my parents telling me I'm trying to keep her from my daughter.  Apparently her mother called my father saying she cried all the way home.  So...now I'm the horrible person. To be honest, I don't even like these photo shoots.  I'd love for them to stop, but I do it to be nice.

To preface: I am currently studying for the CFA with my test in December. Long 6 hour sessions of studying at night and on the weekends.

I (26 M) work a 9-5  in finance while my GF (21) works mid morning to 8pm as a personal trainer with a non set schedule.  She also brought her dog up from her parents which we do allow to sleep in the bed with us. We live in a tiny 1 BR in NYC.

As a result from her working later she is usually the first to go to bed and brings the dog with her. I find myself trying to crawl into bed around 1:30 -2am after studying. While I’m at the table studying, I can assume that when my girlfriend falls asleep, she begins to starfish out on the bed. By starfishing I mean taking up the entire queen bed and allowing the dog to hang out near the edge. 

Now when I attempt to get into bed, I’m usually still buzzing from the 4 cups of coffee and it’s hard for me to fall asleep as it is from the caffeine. On top of that I have to try to move the dog around who tends to hop in and out of bed he is a 80lb yellow lab. Sweet dog but chonky and super cuddly. Last comes the hardest part of settling in: moving a tiny 130 lb woman to her side of the bed.  She will talk in her sleep and swear at me telling me to “fuck off” and “shut the fuck up” when I say move over. (Sometimes I have to physically push her over.) It has become a routine and quite frankly I’m sick of it. The few times I decide to sleep on the couch, she wakes up to find me not in bed and gets upset and disappointed that she couldn’t “cuddle” and slept alone. (She swears that she never remembers these conversations as she is a heavy sleeper and tends to talk in her sleep) 

I don’t need to have someone next to me to sleep comfortably and honestly it’s easier for me to fall asleep quicker without the 2am hassle of changing everyone’s position in the bed. 

Am I the asshole if I tell my GF I’m sleeping on the couch until I’m done with this test and needs to just deal with it while I’m trying to push my career forward?

438,Asshole,"Hello, Reddit! Longtime lurker here. My dad asked me to post this on his behalf bc he knows I have a reddit account and he doesn't know how to make one/doesn't want to. This is long, but I'll give a TL;DR at the end, ok? thanks! <3 Post below is written by him.

\--

I drive a taxi for the sole airport in my state. I got a fare yesterday to a town in a neighboring state, 22 miles away. A few miles from the destination, in that state, there’s a stretch of road where the speed limit is 50 MPH except for a few hours on school days when it is 20 MPH for a stretch where there’s a school and the obligatory school zone.

Not knowing this, being a non-local and having missed any signs regarding it, I went through it at 42 MPH. Later, I got pulled over, holding up my customer. I told the cop that I didn’t know about the school and had missed that sign. As he left with my papers, I also told him that I really can’t have tickets on my record because my job requires me to have a clean record, to which he sarcastically responded, “We’ll see.” He practically threw my papers back at me upon his return and said “Slow down, \[or\] you’re getting a ticket next time.” in a punk-ass tone.

My taxi clearly says “AIRPORT TAXI” on it and has plates from my state. There’s no way he didn't know that I’m not from here and therefore not familiar with the area/local speeding guidelines. I’ve already forgotten exactly where it is. I’m glad I didn’t get a ticket, but I feel like he wasted my time because 1) I’m not from here, 2) I’m unlikely to be in this area again, and 3) He held up my customer, who did nothing wrong. 

By the time I went through there on the way back, the school zone hours were over.

TL;DR: A cop pulled me over in my taxi for speeding and held up my customer. I'm not from this state, so I don't know what the local restrictions are. I can't risk getting tickets because my record needs to be spotless so I can keep my job. He didn't ticket me and I'm grateful, but I feel like he wasted both of our time over this.

445,Not the A-hole,"So the title sounds bad but bear with me. My across the street neighbors just got a new dog. He’s a little terrier-poodle looking mix . Everyday when they leave for work/school (they’re typically gone from 8-6) they put him outside to run around the neighborhood. 

They don’t put him on a leash, they don’t keep him in a fence, he doesn’t have a collar or any kind of identification. The whole day he runs around the neighborhood unsupervised in people’s yards, on their porches, and I actually witnessed him go into someone’s garage the other day. We’re also next to a major highway. Naturally all our other neighbors are pissed because a majority of the people in the neighborhood have dogs that stay outside on leashes or fenced in during the day and are constantly having to chase him away from their food. At least one person has said something to them, but they don’t care. 

I personally have three dogs that aren’t allowed outside without supervision. One of them walks off leash, but she never leaves the yard. She only goes outside if I’m directly beside her, does her business, plays with her ball for a bit, then we go inside. All three dogs HATE the neighbors dog. Multiple times a day they go crazy because he’s in my yard/on my porch/peeing on something of mine. Multiple times a day I have to chase him away just to calm them down. 

Everytime I go to walk my dogs now I have to go outside and check my entire yard and make sure he isn’t outside, because my lab is incredibly territorial. She’s not dog or people aggressive and we frequently take her to the dog park/on hikes. But she goes crazy if someone comes onto our property that she doesn’t know. 

Yesterday I was outside with two of my dogs when he showed up. I tried to scare him away but he kept coming towards my dogs. The off-leash dog was in the woods at the time and had her hackles raised and was growling so I tried my hardest to get him out of my yard but as soon as he got close enough to me, my lab shot out of the woods and attacked him. It wasn’t a huge fight and I immediately broke it up and he took off back to his house. I didn’t get to check if he was actually hurt, but my dog had a cut above her eyebrow so I’m sure he had wounds. My next-door neighbors witnessed the whole thing and said that I shouldn’t worry about it because he’s on my property. I feel bad if he IS hurt or injured somehow, but I don’t think it’s my responsibility to pay for their dog when he came onto my property and provoked my dog.

446,Not the A-hole,"I recently started a new job as a caregiver. I was told I would be sitting with an elderly man with severe depression and that was his only issue. 


This isn’t true, he has many issues. Mostly Nonverbal, doesn’t walk. I like being with him a lot though, he’s a cool dude. He gives me thumbs up when he’s all good and even will say “cigarette” when needed. He’s got the important words down at least. 

My first day I was asked by his wife if I would take his vitals and blood sugar and give him insulin if needed. I said I wasn’t sure how but I’d be willing to learn. After talking to my supervisor I am strictly forbidden from doing that. I am not home health. I am not even allowed to give him a dose of cough medicine or a vitamin. It’s company policy. 

Today I was asked by his wife if I wanted to learn to do blood sugar. I told her what my supervisor said. She launched into this huge rant that included things like “do they just hire anyone on the street who can pass a drug test?” (Yes basically) “how do you know if you’re suppose to call 911” (I don’t know. I didn’t make the rules. I just follow them) “all the other aids did it!” (All the other aids could’ve killed him giving his insulin when they didn’t know how, apparently) “you said you’d do it the first day!”(that’s before I knew it was illegal)  She eventually said she wasn’t mad at me, just mad at the policy. 

She has a good point with the 911 thing. That’s why I think I may be the asshole. I’ll ask my supervisor about that Monday morning. But I don’t think she’s suddenly gonna let me take his blood sugar and administer insulin.

They always get compliments on their eyes. Peter and his girlfriend posted a picture on social media of their baby girl today saying she was born on the 23rd and I decided to give Peter a call to congratulate him. When I called he was with his girlfriend and the phone was on speaker. I congratulated both of them and said their baby was gorgeous and that they’ll be great parents. I then asked Peter “did she get your blue eyes?” (in the picture they posted on social media the eye color wasn’t visible) Peter and his girlfriend’s tone completely changed and his girlfriend said “Jesus, why are you so concerned by the eye color of my baby. It’s fucking weird” I was pretty taken aback by her reaction. I didn’t mean anything by it I was just curious. I thought this was a normal conversation point. I tried to say I didn’t mean to offend her and apologize but she kinda cut me off and said they were really busy and they had to go.

I told my mom what happened and she said that Peter’s girlfriend is a new mom and is probably just emotional and thought I was insulting her baby but that I didn’t say anything wrong. However my sister said I was out of line and that the fascination people have with blue eyes is weird and there were racial implications since Peter’s girlfriend is biracial (half Jamaican). This didn’t make sense to me. I never said not having blue eyes was bad. My eyes are brown! I was just curious!

AITA here?

Edit: Yeah ok Peter called our family to thank my mom for a gift and we talked a bit. I apologized again for offending them. He accepted my apology but said his girlfriend is was really mad at me but she’ll probably calm down in a day or 2. he explained that they’ve been harassed by family members from even before the baby was born about whether the baby would have blue eyes and his girlfriend is very annoyed by people’s fixation on eye color and feels there’s some racist undertone to it since blue eyes are “white features” and that people think her baby would be any less beautiful if it didn’t have blue eyes. Apparently his mom said during her pregnancy “too bad she probably won’t have blue eyes” and his girlfriend started crying and refused to talk to her for weeks. I feel really bad now.

Before he died, he left money in his that pocket. nothing much at all, only like $40. Something came up where I needed cash, we usually keep some in the house but I needed the cash as opposed to using my debit card

so I just took from there. I took that $40 and used it. I don't think it was a big deal. I needed the cash quick and we had no money in the house. 

I was gonna put money back in there, in case she checked. But for some reason with my luck she checked for whatever reason lol.

452,No A-holes here,"Today at school (I’m a teacher) a student support teacher (SST) came into the staff room to discuss a student’s lunch with me. It has been part of this student’s intervention plan for him to eat more healthy food, and less sugar, because he has a complex constellation of learning issues, including (Autism Spectrum Disorder). It was determined by consultants that an improved diet would help this student to better manage his sleep, and his regulation issues. 

The encounter consisted of the SST showing me a lunchbox full of very cheap, very sugary snacks, (including “fruit” snacks, skittles, chocolate dipped granola bars, etc.), and her saying that we have provided him an alternative lunch from the cafeteria, and that he could have these snacks back in last period, so the sugar wouldn’t rile him up until the end of the day. I agreed, said thanks for letting me know, and went back to eating my own lunch.

(For the record, the cafeteria lunches at this school are fantastic, and are essentially home made. Our food service lady is literally a little old grandma who makes amazing soups and mains for the 100 kids at this school.) 

Here’s the AITA part: after my conversation with the  SST, some of the educational assistants (EAs) and I talked about how sad this situation is. Despite his autism, this kiddo is actually very open minded about food. It’s not that this guy will only eat sugar, but it’s the case that his mom keeps sending a lunchbox full of what is essentially candy for his lunch. We all thought it was so sad that his mom hasn’t been able to get on board with the nutrition portion of her son’s intervention plan. Like any family with kids, they don’t have a lot of extra money, but they’re not the worst off family in this school. 

One of the EAs on the other side of the room got really defensive and grumpily stated that she only feeds he daughter stuff like that for lunch. The example she used was wagon wheels (it’s a marshmallow and chocolate cookie covered in chocolate, about 4 inches across). I said “all she eats for lunch every day is wagon wheels?” And she barked at me about how her daughter won’t eat anything except wagon wheels and at least she eats something ... I don’t know if that is exactly true, but that is disturbing. It’s ALSO really sad. Like, if that is true, her daughter is in for some bad health outcomes. I said the school division and the health region has access to nutritional counselling. She got up and left. 

Anyway, AITA for saying that it’s really sad when parents send only sugary junk in their kid’s lunch, and implying that the offended EA take her kid to see a nutritionist?

453,Asshole,"I'm from an european country and so is my mother, but my daughter and her father are both born in the United States, which is where the three of us live. My husband's grandparents are from the same country I am from, so he also speaks the language.

My mother has been a shitty mother my whole life, the type of mom who fits right in with r/insaneparents. I'm not gonna go too much in detail to her shit when I was a kid, what really matters to this situation is that she is a major conservative, and I am not. She is not even american, but acts just like a extreme Trump supporter. She is very extreme, the type that licks Donald Trump's asshole, that curses at LGBT couples on the street (yep, I unfortunately witnessed this), and most important: she is extremely racist towards hispanic people.

Now, my daughter just turned 5 years old a couple weeks ago, and we decided to celebrate it by going to my home country and bringing her to meet her grandma and the rest of my family for the first time. My family does not speak a single word of english, so I've been slowly teaching my daughter my language so she can communicate with them, but since she is still pretty young I'm trying to focus more on englsih and then enroll her into a language school when she's older. She is old enough to talk and have conversations.

The problem arised on the first day that she met my mother. While my mom was very happy to meet her granddaughter, it only took a few hours until she started trying to force her morals into her. It started because of a photo my husband showed my mother of our daughter and her favorite friend that always stays with her waiting for us to pick her up from school. He is from a Mexican family and looks as a hispanic person, and my mom threw a tantrum. She was shocked that we would let out daughter near him, and started telling my daughter how she should not talk to the boy or a hispanic person ever again. My daughter started crying because my mom was making a scene, so then my husband and I took her outside for a moment. I was pissed. I told my mom she should keep the topics purely superficial and not try to teach her these radical morals. She said she is her grandma and she can tell her whatever she wants.

The whole week we stayed in my mother's house incidents like these kept happening. I broke when my daughter told me maybe she shouldn't talk to Mexican people in her school because she's been listening to what her grandma tells her.

I told my mother that I was gonna stop teaching my daughter our language, since she is still 5 and without practice can easily forget what she learned. My mother started crying and said she was just gonna take my daughter to live in our home country since it was gonna be best for her. I left that night and stayed at a hotel the remaining days.

454,Not the A-hole," 

For  some context, I realized last year that my stepdad never liked me as a  family member. I then had some resentment towards him for it, because my  biological dad was a shitty dude and left when I was about 2. I've  always been upset when I saw my other siblings being favored, and the  only difference I could find was that I wasn't related to him. My mom  tried assuring me that that was not the case, but I always had a hunch.

During  a fight in September last year, my stepdad was talking over my mom,  which bothered me because he was repeating himself. I tried to(nicely)  tell him that I wanted to hear what my mom was saying, and he took it as  disrespect.

""Fine, don't ever talk to me then, don't ask me for things, nothing""

And   that was it. We haven't had a normal conversation since. The one  conversation we had, I asked him why he thought he was right with what  he did.  He said that since I'm not sorry for telling him to shut up(I  didn't tell him to ""shut up"", and I have a habit of not apologizing for  things I'm not sorry for), he thinks what he did was right. He also said  his life is easier because I'm not talking to him, that it's easier to  just fight with me then to fight+talk.

I  grew up most of my life with my mom telling me this man was now my  father, and he'd be my mentor and the one walking me down the isle. I  don't know if my parents don't understand how it hurts me, or if they  just don't care if it does. I've had my biggest childhood insecurity  confirmed, and I can't help but feel stupid because of it. Am I the  asshole for not wanting my stepdad to be an important part my life  anymore? My parents think I'm a monster for it. If it matters, I'm a  sophomore in high school(15 years old), I realized the differences  between me and him in middle school, and its a little over a year since  we've spoke.",14,38,0.93
455,Everyone Sucks,"Posting this for my parents. And sorry for the rambling, I’m just trying to get as much information as possible out there.

My stepsister is 28 years old and has 7 kids (pregnant with number 8). The oldest one turned 9 in September and still wears pull ups. My step sister doesn’t like children but loves babies. So, once her child gets to be about 10 months old, she just discards it essentially and gets pregnant again. 

Her kids aren’t in school regularly and the oldest one is still in 2nd grade. She can’t move on because of truancy issues. Her mom doesn’t like having to wake up early so if she doesn’t wake up early enough to get them to school, they just don’t go. 

If you go to her house (which is only 3 bedrooms), it’s a complete mess. The kids don’t have beds and they just sleep on the floor or the couches. There’s trash and old food everywhere. She doesn’t cook or clean so the kids live off of fast food, Little Debbie snacks, chips, and soda. 

The kids get their clothing from Dollar General, but she constantly has the latest phones, designer bags, and name brand clothing. 

All of the kids have very unconventional names that will make both childhood and adulthood frustrating to say the least.

Recently, she moved her family about 3 hours away from my parents and they’re all staying in 1 hotel room for an indefinite amount of time. 

It’s gotten to the point where my parents want to call CPS on her, but if they did, she would absolutely get all of her children taken away. The only thing stopping them is that they don’t want to be stuck raising 8 young children in their 50’s and they know that if the kids were put in the system, they’d get separated. They are more than financially capable to care for them if that means anything.

So, would they be the asshole if they called CPS and let the kids get put into foster care?

EDIT: I haven’t called CPS myself because I live about 15 hours away and haven’t spoken to my stepsister in about 12 years (since she moved out of our family home). I don’t know her phone number, her address, or anything along those lines. Everything I know has been passed along by family members who are still in contact.

UPDATE: I shared this thread with my mom and she’s been reading everything as it’s come in. She wanted me to let everyone know that a CPS case has been open for a while on my stepsister. The agent assigned to the case never does unannounced visits so my stepsister always has enough time to clean and tell the kids what to say. The whole point of the thread was to see if she should call the agent and tell her that my stepsister moved her family (without telling the state), but she knew that if she made that call, the kids would be taken from her since they’ve been on a development plan for quite a bit. She emailed the agent with where they’re staying and called the 1800 number provided since their office is closed.

To answer a few questions:
- My stepsister is married, but she’s very abusive and manipulative. Her husband has an old school Nokia phone because she doesn’t want him to have access to the internet. 
- Her obgyn has mentioned getting her tubes tied multiple times but my stepsister refuses. It’s gotten to a point where pregnancy significantly affects her health and the health of the unborn child.
- My family isn’t very close so my parents didn’t know that her situation had escalated until she moved closer to them about 2 years ago and they saw it first hand. 
- My two younger brothers have children of their own to care for and I’m very much child free. Dispersing my stepsisters children amongst us would just create financial stress and burden on us.

I have significant issues with the children's mother, but I don't believe it's their fault that their mother is empirically terrible. So when we visit, I often (but not always) like to bring each boy a small gift. Nothing too outrageous - a book or a small toy, in the five to 10 dollar range. 

One child, no matter what we bring him is delighted and surprised that we got him a gift. He thanks us and is quite effusive in that thanks.

His twin brother, no matter what we bring HIM, complains that it's not right. He's already read it, or it isn't something that interests him, or some sort of issue. Never ""thank you,"" never ""appreciate the effort,"" nothing. Just whines that it isn't a good present.

So, I don't enjoy picking out or getting gifts for the second boy. It's nothing but complain, complain. On the other hand, the first boy is such a joy to give gifts to and I don't want to stop giving him little gifts because his brother is kind of a jerk about it all.

So, WIBTA if I stopped bringing a nice small gift for boy two?

Edit: Many of you have suggested that I talk to him about how it isn't appropriate to react this way when someone gives you a gift. I have. We have had that conversation several times. I have also asked him, multiple times, what interests him. He says ""Nintendo and youtube."" Those are the sum total of his current interests. I'm trying, I really am.

Additional edit: in the interest of full disclosure, I have had increased difficulty in dealing with the twins (both of them, but in particular this other one) since my husband and I had a stillbirth last year. I am trying not to take this out on the kid, but I get so pissed at the mother. I know I would not be a perfect Mom, I know that - but holy shit, I would do better than this! Anyway, I don't know if this is playing into it at all, but I figure the more information you guys have, the better you can provide constructive advice. Look, I really do want the best for this kid. He just pisses me off.

FINAL EDIT: I have been judged TA. I will continue to give the children gifts of approximate equal value and work on getting things more aligned with his interests. I will also make sure that if he complains that I will simply take the gift back and politely remind him that these gifts are not a requirement.

I take an allergy pill, but living surrounded by dander is quite different than visiting dander.

Before we moved in together, I mentioned that I would like the cats out of the bedroom to contain allergies. He didn't want that. So, my compromise was offering that the cats aren't allowed in the bedroom during the day, but can visit when we are home at night. He didn't agree to that either. 

It has been two months and my allergies have gotten worse. This week, I brought up the 2nd option again, he said no. I mentioned that I'm waking up gasping because my nose is completely shut and it's affecting my sleep. He replied that he  ""felt like I was looking for something to be wrong"".

I am highly aware of this, as is every bartender/gas station attendant/liquor store clerk I’ve ever encountered. I start getting my ID ready before I start ordering, and though I’m used to it, bartenders do treat me with suspicion, if not flat out hostility. The ones who don’t either already know me, or arouse MY suspicion that they’re used to serving underage drinkers. 

I have plenty of funny stories stemming from my looks, but today I’m writing in from the bar area of a popular pizza chain named for the state I live in. I used to be a semi-regular here, but over the past few months I’ve been bringing food from home so I can save up more and eventually move out of my mom’s apartment, so today is a rare “treat yourself” splurge. When I took my “usual” seat at the bar (with full food service), I encountered a new waitress, ordered my usual and let her know I’d be waiting a few minutes until happy hour to put in a drink order. She immediately looked me up and down and said she’d need to be seeing some ID immediately “because you look like you’re 12.” 

I hadn’t prepped my ID yet because I was not ordering alcohol yet, so I was a bit flustered, as usually I can bypass the awkward comments by beating servers to the punch by already presenting my ID. Long story short, am I being overly sensitive or WIBTA if I dock my usual 20% tip down a bit for the rude comment?

 I genuinely get it- no two ways about it, I look young and I very recently chopped my hair to chin length, which I’m hearing makes me look younger or older. But since I still live with my mom, I already feel like an adult with training wheels on, so it bums me out when people I do not know treat me like a trouble-making child (imagine going on a first date with someone just for the bar tender to check my ID TWICE because he also expressed I looked 12) 

Thanks for reading!

Edit/update: I noticed the waitress/bar-tender looking quite upset throughout my meal (not with me, just the generally despondent look of someone working in food service in a predominantly white + wealthy area) so we started chatting about random stuff and she warmed up to me.

Anyway...

My (F25) mom’s (F53) birthday just passed earlier this month, and because she just got back in town her good friend decided to throw her a surprise party tomorrow. She texted me about it today.

For context: Recently my mom has been going through a tough period with my dad. They divorced years ago, but then got back together and are falling apart all over again because my mom is never intimate with him anymore. 

My mom’s friend is a homeopathic store owner, so she thought it would be a great idea to get a sex therapist to come have a private seminar/workshop/surprise party for my mom and her family friends. 

I really really do not want to go. It will be 3.5 hours long in the middle of a Saturday. I work abroad, am in town for my own bday, and want to see my friends. On top if that my grandma, aunt, and bf’s mom (who I’m close to, but not THAT close) will be there. I don’t feel comfortable talking about my sex life in front of the woman who birthed the person I have sex with. 

I feel bad not going though, because I’ve talked to my mom extensively about her self esteem issues which cause her intimacy issues, and have been part of the process in talking her through forgiving my dad for things he’s done. But I can only do so much, and as much as I’ve been my mom’s rock, because I’m also the only child in the picture, sex is just not one of those territories I want to deeply explore with her and the others.

471,Everyone Sucks,"I’ve asked my friends, and they are genuinely divided, so I thought to ask Reddit. I (31F) am childfree, and I work with Chloe (40?F). We’ve become good friends over the past year or so, and we hang out most weekends. We are both into knitting and wine, and we are both really chill.

Ideal friendship, right? Well, she has a 15 y/o son (Braden), who is really unclean. He stinks like rotting meat and BO, and he also has this awful metallic odor that makes me gag. I know it’s not a neglect issue, because Chloe’s younger daughter (11F) has never stunk. Lately, I haven’t even wanted to go over to Chloe’s, and I don’t want to invite her to my house in case she brings her son. 

Lady week was the last straw. We decided to go to the craft store together, and Braden wanted to come. I drove them there, and my upholstery stank for a good three days after. The next day at work, Chloe asked if I wanted to come over for dinner, and I had to tell her no. She really pushed me for a reason, and I told her her son smells like ass and I basically can’t be around him until he works on his cleanliness. She sent me a text later (pasted here): “Hi yall-need-weed, the things you said about Braden were really uncalled for and I don’t want you to talk about my kids in a bad way. I am a good mom. Don’t talk to me until you apologize.”

AITA? Should I apologize?

Edit for more info: yes, I did unfortunately phrase it that way. We both cuss a lot, but I definitely could’ve been gentler. 

No, I won’t be calling the authorities on Chloe. Their house is clean, he has access to washer/ dryer/ shower, this kid just inexplicably reeks.

472,Not the A-hole,"My GF is a very introverted person and truthfully I used to be her only friend. A new girl joined our friendship circle a few months ago and my GF liked her so I encouraged her to be be friends. They bonded quickly and she drew my GF out of her shell, I was really happy for her at first. Said friend started dating someone and insisted we go on double dates together. This seemed fine with me until I realised how unbearable this woman is.

\-EVERYTHING is a humble brag. Every single sentence that she utters is somehow a brag and drives me nuts. When we we were talking about universities her reply was ""Oh well I went to a good university you know"". When we talked about finding a flat to live in she said ""I don't think I can recommend anywhere, I live in XXXX and its definitely out of your price range, though I can afford it. 

\-Every conversation has to be about here. We were talking about Germany? ""Oh that reminds me of this time I went and did this. We were talking about my GF getting a promotion? ""Oh that reminds me about how my boss said I'm the best employee"". if the conversation isn't about her she will steer it to be about her. 

\-She sends the most inane and annoying messages. I usually ignore them but then she'll say ""You're on-line, why aren't you looking at what I sent?"" repeatedly. When i do read them it's about the most pointless stuff and will routinely be followed by ""Oh right, I was talking to xxx about this not you""

\-She's dismissive of other's opinions and will retaliate with some sort of insult. For instance we were talking about something political and she disagreed with my views and said ""Well dear you're probably just not informed enough to know better""

\-She's very racist. I'm brown and she'll consistently refer to me as a PoC which i find to be a racist term. If I have any views that aren't critical of white people she'll say ""Oh you don't know better because white culture is being forced upon you"". I essentially can't talk and need to let her defend my race.

Anyway my girlfriend and I have been dating for the last year or so and things have been going good. I'd say things are moving forward at a decent pace in the relationship.

However, about 2 months ago we ran into a problem. She had missed her period and took a pregnancy test and revealed that she was pregnant. We used a condom, but I think I leaving it in the car and the heat most of weakened its integrity or something. Anyway, after a lot of discussion we decide that an abortion is the best option for us. So we go through the process and the procedure. 

There weren't any complications which is a relief. However, the procedure wasn't cheap, so somehow her parents must have found out about it from her bank bill. They lose their shit partially due to their beliefs and being kept in the dark (which was because of their beliefs.) 

Now, her father is calling me talking about how a real man takes responsibility and how I  murdered his grandchild and how could I keep him in the dark about this (can't imagine why). 
Im not sure what would be a productive step at this point.

475,No A-holes here,"I’m honestly not sure if I’m in the wrong here.

I (35F) am getting married to my awesome fiancé (34M) in a few months. We live in a very high cost of living area (think major East Coast city) and knew from the get-go that we wanted a small, intimate wedding with close friends and family only. No bridal party, no huge event, just a good time with our loved ones. 

My fiancé and I crunched the numbers and decided to invite 50 people total, so 25 each. My parents, siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins make up 18 of my half, and I decided to also invite three East Coast friends I’ve known since childhood, their husbands, and my friend Jane (32F), who is single. 

Jane and I met 10 years ago when I was working in London. I moved back to the US three years later for grad school, where I met my now-fiancé. Jane has been very excited about the wedding and tells me all the time that she can’t wait to come and see me. 

Earlier today, I saw that Jane had RSVPed online and written in one of her friends from London as a plus one, and I immediately contacted her to clarify that we weren’t offering plus ones to anyone who wasn’t in a relationship. Jane asked me if I could please reconsider because she is traveling from out of the country and won’t know anybody else at the wedding. I apologized but explained that we really wanted to keep this small. 

She replied back, “I’ll be there no matter what because you’re my friend, but I’m making a lot of sacrifices to be able to attend, and I didn’t realize I would have to come alone,” which made me feel super guilty, and now I’m second-guessing myself.",60,54,0.93

I do not have kids, and live with my girlfriend. I am not really familiar with taking care of kids, so I was perhaps more lenient than is ideal. My sister did not give me any instructions of what to do or what not to do. For example, I asked them what they wanted for dinner and they said McDonald's so I took them there. Then they said they wanted ice cream so I took them for ice cream. Then they wanted to stay up late and watch a movie, so I let them. Other things of this nature included me letting them play video games the next day, taking them to play laser tag, and ordering pizza for them the next night. I did make them come with me to the park because I knew some outdoor activities would be good for them, even though they did not want to do this.

My sister picks them up on Sunday and they tell her ""it was the best weekend ever!!!"" Now my sister is pissed, saying that I spoiled them and now they keep saying things like ""well uncle Infamous_composer let us!""

Then he wound up overdrafted on his account and didn’t spend the money doing the things that needed to get done, like an oil change for his car.

I am a very artistic individual, and I happen to own a set of 50 Copic markers and 10 very fancy liner pens. While I was working on a manga drawing with my Copic materials, I gave my younger cousin a coloring book with some Crayola markers. My cousin insisted on using my supplies because they ""looked cooler than the stuff that she had."" I politely told her no, and she demanded that I share because that's what everyone is expected to do in her Kindergarten class. 

My reasoning for not sharing is because my supplies are extremely expensive, and my cousin is often rough with pens and pencils and doesn't have much respect for anyone else's stuff, let alone her own. It would also pain me to watch my art materials be wasted and destroyed by someone who doesn't have much artistic talent and scribbles frivolously without much thought. 

My cousin started having a tantrum and dragged my aunt (her mother) in to the situation. My aunt demanded that I put my expensive materials away because it wasn't fair for her daughter not to use the same materials as well. I rolled my eyes and complied, because my cousin was throwing such a fit and I didn't want to listen to it anymore.

After the framing was complete and before electric was brought in we went through the house and located where everyhmthibg will eventually go. In the basement I mentioned the M.I.L. suite with bathroom, kitchenette, laundry, etc. I pointed out a ""closet"" sized room and said that's where we will put the AC. The agreed that it was a great spot.

2 weeks later we are going completing our electrical walk through and notice an HVAC unit in the basement, with sloppy ductwork running across floor joist and up through the floor to cool some areas of the main floor. The remainder of the house is cooled from 2 other HVACs in the attic. Let it be known that ny wife and I despise floor registers ( kids, spills, mopping, etc). I tell the builder that basically floor vents are a deal breaker and we need to move the basement hvac to the attic. He tells me that it will cost several thousand in parts and materials to move it. I approve the cost.

A few days later, I meet with the realtor, builder, and HVAC installer a d we walk the house. I know I will have to steal closet space for routing. I agree again. Then as we start to figure out logistics, the builder and hvac begin pointing out things in the way, the long ducts will make the cooling inefficient, the house will be hit in the summer and wont be able to cool it, roof rafters and supports will need to be moved. Now the cost doubles and I cant cool the kitchen or living room.
My wife and I discuss the situation and accept that we will just have to live with something we both hate.

However, neither of us had money invested into the lottery (it costs nothing) and we both saw winning as a long shot anyway. I’m torn.

501,Not the A-hole,"I'm 23F and live on my own. There was a family tragedy recently and my mom started going to church. I'm happy for her but I think that all religions are nonsense and most sects of christianity are harmful. Despite this I'm still interested in how religions work and enjoy studying them from time to time by reading the texts as well as lurking various religious subreddits to see how the followers think. I'm trans. I've seen what the vatican's opinion on us queers is (you guys are sinners but it's ok to be that way so long as you repress your sexualities and gender expressions).

Me and my mom's relationship has been okay up until earlier this year when she graduated from rcia and joined the church proper. Ever since then she has been texting me to go to mass with her several times a week, as well as making comments about how I can change my lifestyle and unite with god. Really annoying and insulting but generally I ignore the requests and just try to have a good relationship with her.

Last week we were at lunch. She brought up mass again and I said I was not going to discuss this with her. She started making a scene and asking why I won't give church a chance (she already knows the answer to this question). People were staring and I was embarrassed so I said I would go, but only on my terms, which I'd think of later. This calmed her down and we had a pleasant lunch. Later I sent her my conditions:

A) Evening only. I'm not disrupting my sleep for this.

B) She drives me there and back. 

C) I will not participate. I'll sit there quietly until it's over but I will not kneel, stand, sing, genuflect or take communion.

D) She never brings it up again.

She protested, especially on C. She wanted me to at least take communion if nothing else. Now in catholicism non-catholics are NOT supposed to do this. I didn't tell her this because I didn't want to make her feel bad that someone outside her religion knows more about it than her. I said those were my terms and she could either accept them or not. She did.

The day arrived. She picked me up. On the drive there I reminded her about our agreement and she said ""Yes yes, I know,"" dismissively. Oh well, so long as she does. When we arrived I was catching a lot of weird looks from the congregants and even saw one kid point at me while talking to their parents. I have an ambiguous gender presentation so I don't pass, nor do I care to, so I'm used to it.

During the homily the priest conveniently talked about how god loves LGBT but we need to be celibate and be happy with what god gave us. The sentiment wasn't new to me but it was still very uncomfortable. I wanted to leave  but a deal's a deal so I drifted off into my head until the mass was over.

It was quiet for a few days but eventually my mother started hinting that I go back. I said that she was going against our agreement and that I am not going to talk to her unless she apologizes. Now my family is bombarding me with texts telling me to just let it go. AITA?",101,309,0.9

503,Everyone Sucks,"Throwaway just in case. I'm (27) 16 weeks pregnant with my second child. My sister (30) is a little more than 17 weeks pregnant with her first. We have never been super close but we've always had a pretty decent relationship. We live in different states (about a 24 hour drive apart) and only see each other maybe 1-2 times a year. We both found out we were pregnant around the same time. I feel like I've been trying really hard to let her have the spotlight because I know how exciting it is to have your first baby. I let her decide when she wanted to tell our family and then waited a couple of weeks to tell them about my pregnancy so she could have her moment. I've been her support during all her appointments and I've been available to answer all her questions and try to help her out as best as I can. (She is in a healthy relationship but she's expressed that she likes talking to me because I've been there before.) I've tried to minimize talking about my own pregnancy because I really want her to feel like the center of attention. I know how it feels to be so excited about something and then basically get shot down and I don't want to do that to her. 

Here's the problem, though. My initial plan was to make a public pregnancy announcement around 13 weeks. My sister told me she really wanted to announce her pregnancy first so my spouse and I decided to postpone and wait for her to announce before we did. She still hasn't announced. I thought of a great idea for an announcement on Halloween and I'm really excited about it. I'll also be over 17 weeks at that point. (For anyone who is wondering people usually announce around 12 weeks.) I told my sister my plan and she, well, lost it. She got so upset saying she was planning to do an announcement on Halloween and I have to wait because she doesn't want to be overshadowed by her little sister and I've already gotten to have a baby so her's is more important, etc. etc. Now, I know a lot of this is hormones because she's usually a really rational person and can discuss things with minimal emotion to come to an agreement. So I told her I would think about it but I was really set on announcing on Halloween. We ended the conversation with her telling me, basically, that if I didn't change my announcement I was a bad sister and I didn't care about her. 

From my perspective, I've tried really hard to make her feel special and not steal her thunder. I've double checked with her before telling any family and I even waited to tell my dad until she said it was okay. I don't want to ""steal her moment"" but also, I've given her plenty of time to have a moment. So, AITA here?",137,406,0.94
504,Asshole,"Brief background, I work for a company that designs highways. My industry is very precise and my job is to take the hard data from the engineers and make it palatable for a general audience - for public meetings and the like, so my brain is trained to take technical data and make it sounds good.

Last night my wife and I were at a trivia event with some friends, the winner would receive $250, and the question was (paraphrasing) ""How many miles of Interstate are in the USA?"" The choices were:

1 - greater than 100

2 - greater than 1,000

3 - greater than 10,000

4 - greater than 100,000

The answer is somewhere in the 45k range, but i couldn't remember exactly. Needless to say, everyone at the table immediately looks at me for an answer.  I could have said ""1 mile"" and they'd go with my answer. Since I couldn't remember the number I said, ""Go with greater than 100  because every other answer is greater than 100. This is a poorly written question that no one should get wrong"".

Anyway, they scored our answer as wrong and said the correct answer was ""greater than 10,000"". I let it slip by (although upset in my head) because we were in the lead. At the end of the night, we ended up tied with another team and lost the tiebreaker. So we came in 2nd place and didn't get any prize money.

I became a little hot-headed, but respectfully said we should have won in regulation because we were correct in our answer for the highway question.  I said ""the number of miles of the interstate is greater than 100, and we put greater than 100, and so we were technically correct."" they argued that the 10,000 mile answer was closer to the real number and I countered that the question was not which is closer.

Anyway, my wife was getting kind of embarrassed. Again, I was not a jerk about it, but I was informing them we were correct and they had no reason to mark us as wrong, and it cost us $250.

when we got home my wife said she was embarrassed and I said you shouldn't be embarrassed to stand up for yourself. Was I the asshole?",351,912,0.91

507,Not enough info,"Throwaway account. Names have been changed for privacy.

I (25F) participated in a study abroad program in Spain my junior year of college and had a fantastic experience. While I was there I became good friends with my host sister Paula, who was around my age. Despite living on separate continents the two of us have remained very close and talk all the time.

Paula (26F) and her husband Rafael (35M) visited the U.S. for the first time last year and stayed with my husband Ian (27M) and me for a week in upstate New York. They don’t speak much English, but they made an effort to use the language as much as possible around us, despite clearly struggling with it, so that Ian could be included in our conversations. 

Before they left, Paula and Rafael thanked us for our hospitality and said they wanted to return the favor. They invited us to stay with them at their home in Madrid for a week and show us around the city. Ian was very enthusiastic about the idea, since he had never been to Europe before, and we accepted the offer with pleasure. 

In the months leading up to our trip, I asked Ian to please brush up on some basic Spanish (he took two years of it in high school but obviously hadn’t used it in a while), because we were going to be guests in another country. I offered to help him practice many times, since I speak Spanish fluently, but he always declined.

Well, we just got back from Spain, and he refused to speak more than three words of Spanish (“buenos días” and “gracias”) the whole time we were there. The rest of the time, he would only address Paula and Rafael (or anyone else we met) in English and I had to keep stepping in as translator. Paula and Rafael were gracious as always and reassured us it wasn’t a problem, but they sounded pretty tired by the end of the week. I translated for Ian as much as I could, which was mentally exhausting, and I felt frustrated that he wouldn’t make more of an effort.

Ian says he felt embarrassed and self-conscious speaking another language and that nobody would have expected him to do so as an American. I say that learning the basics of the language is a basic courtesy when traveling to a non-English-speaking country, and especially when staying in somebody’s home.",211,509,0.95

510,Not the A-hole,"A friend of mine is an artist and has been doing an evening class in textiles. This term they’re making a dress. The instructor said they wouldn’t have enough of those tailor’s dummies and would anyone be able to use a live model. My friend volunteered and messaged me to see if I’d be able to help and I agreed. 

So a couple times a week I’ve been going to his to have this dress fitted and altered and happily being pricked with little pins *its been a learning curve*. 

Anyway, the other night we were at a party. Me, him and friend (B) were chatting about the dress and she exclaimed that she was so excited to have it. Que my confusion. Honestly, I’d kinda assumed that he would want to keep it as a memento or he’d need to submit it or something. I’d have wanted to be offered. It’s literally a dress tailored to my exact measurements and B and I are not the same size. She’d have to get it altered anyway which IMO loses what’s special about the dress. I’ve also given up a lot of my time the last few weeks to help with the project, and we’re only half way there! 

Clearly, I didn’t hide my reaction very well because she immediately said “hey, I asked first!” (INFO - we are in our late twenties, not 12yo). He awkwardly shrugged and agreed that she asked first. 

So when I next went over I told him that I was a little caught off guard that he’d said she can have it. I pointed out her needing it to be altered and that it would mean a lot to me considering we’d worked on it together. He agreed and said it was all mine when finished.

He must have messaged her when I left because shortly after I get two angry messages from her, literally calling me an A-hole. So, what better place to ask, AITA?

INFO - the reason I hadn’t asked for the dress was because I had assumed he was keeping it or would need it for his course. Hadn’t even occurred to me that he’d be giving it away.",662,4720,0.97
511,Not the A-hole,"Both of my roommates have cars and I do not. We live somewhere where having a car is not a necessity but it is more efficient than the public transit  system. I had no problem taking the train on weekdays but they’re doing maintenance on the weekend and trains do not run. My roommate offered that I can borrow his car during these times. I have used it to drive about a 15-20 mile commute twice a week and put more gas in then I use as a thank you. Yesterday he texts me telling me he paid $715 in car payments for the month and “$200 is good” for my share. I don’t think it’s unreasonable to contribute gas but to make me pay for something that’s not even in my name is weird to me. My roommate also works Lyft every other day as a form of income and the gas is usually on empty when I use it. 

My other roommate and him discussed this without me and then brought to my attention I should pay the insurance/loan for it’s day rate which is about $23 each day. I retorted I’m not paying $50 to drive to work and back not including gas AND if we’re getting that technical I should only pay for the 9 hours a day the car is in my possession. I’d rather spent the $5 a day and take the bus for the extra hour. Ubers are even cheaper than that!

I’m kinda miffed this was brought to my attention in this way and feel like I’m being used for $$ so my roommate can continue his lifestyle. But yeah AITA?

So me and my boyfriend (me 23f, him 26m) have been living together for about 6 months. We work roughly the same hours so we've decided to split the chores 50/50. 

Some chores are the same every day, those are no problem (like me doing groceries and cooking, and him cleaning up). The problem is the random things that just pop up, like needing to empty the trash can or unloading the dishwasher. (Just examples, there's more). 

We both lived alone, we both had to do these things when necessary, but he just doesn't know when it's necessary. He just keeps throwing things in the trash can even if it's so full it won't close. 

When I ask him to empty it, or point out how full it is he'll fix it no problem. He just doesn't see it. 

He's asked me to make him a list so he knows what needs to be done, and I refused. Not only is it more work for me, it's not like I can make lists for him forever, and it seems like something you'd do for a kid.

I am a single mom. I was going through a very rough financial patch around Christmas one year so my sister said she’d take care of Christmas presents for my kids and would let me label them from me and Santa Claus. My kids were 14, 12, and 5 at the time.



I was extremely grateful of course. A few days before Christmas she had me come over to look at the stuff and help wrap it. 


14 yo son got books, video games, a nice pair of shoes he’d been asking for, pajamas, and stuff to decorate his room. 


12 yo daughter got 1 book, a bath set, and a pair of pajamas.


5 yo daughter got a bike, clothes,  and 10+ toys. 


The amount of stuff my oldest and youngest got compared to my middle kid was a lot. Not even thinking, I blurted out “is this all 12y got?”. My sister was really offended and laid in to me about how I shouldn’t have the audacity to ask for more stuff when she provided my kids with their entire Christmas. 


I apologized for my bluntness but said there was no way I could give my other kids all of that stuff while my middle kid got 3 things that she didn’t even ask for nor need(the book was ok but she didn’t really need bath stuff or pajamas). And it was just a single book compared to the stack that my son was receiving. 

I asked if we could take some of the toys back because it was way too many for the 5 yo and use that money towards 12y. 


She said it’d be the last time she ever offered to do something nice for me because of my entitlement.



I told her that’s fine and she doesn’t have to buy anything else but some of those toys have to go back period. I’m not going to have 1 kid opening 15 presents while the other is opening 3. 



She ended up taking some of the toys back and didn’t show up on Christmas Day to see them open them like planned. 



Was I the AH for doing that? My middle daughter was hitting puberty hard and was really emotional at the time so I knew it would make her feel bad if she was left watching her siblings opening gifts after she only had 3.",574,3492,0.96

516,Not the A-hole,"UPDATE: First, thanks to everyone who took the time to weigh in and for all of the advice you gave. 

Many of you were telling me to accept it as a loss and not possibly incriminate/alienate my grandparents over $1000. Many others told me to immediately report the car stolen and basically that my grandparents deserved to be implicated criminally. However, i deserve to be paid for the car, and they haven't always been this way. It has just gotten to be this way as they've gotten older, and they weren't trying to screw me over at all. They were just naive. 

So I took the median of the two main avenues of advice and I called the man and gave him one last chance to bring back my car. I was very forceful and not at all unclear that I would report the car as stolen if it wasnt back in my possession with everything that accompanied it by a certain time that evening. He seemed genuinely apologetic, but most likely was just scared shitless. 


Well, I got home from work and the car was not there. He still had 30 minutes left until my car was to be returned, so I contacted him and asked him an ETA. He claimed he was leaving work and had to drive home to pick up the car and thus would be there in 45 minutes to an hour. I was pissed, but I REALLY didn't feel like dealing with police, so I simply waited. 

While I'm waiting, I receive a few text messages from him trying to explain to me how he's a good guy and never meant to cause me worry or concern. I respond only by saying I'd see him soon and we'd talk then. An hour comes and I call him. No answer. I call again. No answer. I send him a text and tell him I'm reporting it. 

I called to report the car and the police said they would be there as soon as possible . Maybe 10 minutes later, guess who decides to text me? Yep. 

Convo:

Me - Alright, it's nearly two hours after the time we agreed. You're not here and not responding, and I've been too lenient. I'm reporting the car as stolen. Good luck.

J - Really, *my name*? I'm on the way to your grandparents house now. I'm on 93 all the way across the county.

Me - I called and texted you and you didn't respond. You've had two weeks, so really *his name*?

J - I'm sorry I was in the shower *my name* 

Me - You could have just let me know. Communication is a valuable tool. Bring the car and I'll call them to cancel the report. Otherwise it stands. 

J - Yeah well I'm sorry I'm not prompt. I've been a lot of things in my life but I've never been a thief

Me - Didn't you say you're driving? Please stop texting while you're driving my car. It is not insured, and texting and driving isn't safe in general. 

Well, he shows up with the car about two and a half hours after the time we had agreed upon. He apologizes over and over, telling me he didn't know the car was mine and going on about his neice who he was getting the car for and how much she liked it and how he used to work with Shelby (who is my father, but he didn't know that). Blah, blah, blah.

He still wants the car, and I told him that as soon as he has the cash, I'm happy to sign off on the title and draw up a written contract for the sale. Obviously, I called to cancel the GTA report. 

This one turned out way better than I thought it would. Thanks again everyone for being awesome and helping me figure this out!

ORIGINAL POST: 

The car title is in my name. 

I have been trying to sell the car, and one of the workers who was helping my grandparents complete a household construction project liked it and said he would like to purchase it. He claimed he would use money earned from this project and another job he was working on to pay for it. I had the car price starting at $2500, with allowance for bartering, but I didn't want to go any lower than $1500. 

Well, the project is completed and for over a month, I hear nothing from the guy, so I assume he is no longer interested. 

I leave for a few weeks to be with my girlfriend, and when I return, my car is gone with the title inside the glove box. I ask my grandfather if he decided to come pick the car up, and he says yes, so I ask where his payment/deposit is. My grandfather tells me he had bartered the price down to just $1000, as a partial exchange for work completed on the house. 

Okay, I'm a little annoyed that he brought the price down so low without even asking me, but they had helped me initially get the car and put down about $1000 on it, so I let that go. However, the part I'm really frustrated about is that they didn't ask for any payment upon him getting the car. No deposit. No written agreement. Nothing. On top of this, they let him drive off with the title in the car. 

The man said he would come on Monday or Tuesday to make a deposit. It is now Friday, and no one has heard from him. I'm so frustrated and pretty pissed, as I was obviously looking forward to having that money to put into savings. 

So, AITA for being so mad? I want to approach them, but they are basically my parents, they practically raised my brother and I, and I want to be respectful and responsible when I talk to them about this. 

TLDR: My grandparents used my car to partially pay a man for construction work he did on their home without consulting me about changing the price of the car or getting a deposit or any form of payment from him. It has now been two weeks, and no one has heard from him regarding payment. I want to approach the subject respectfully but firmly.",188,810,0.95

Our kids were best friends when they were younger and attend the same school. They are like brothers so sometimes they fight and argue. They have the same friends and obviously see each other at family gatherings at my house.

Last week, they got into a brawl at school over talking shit that got out of hand. The shit talking was mutual. The fight was not serious. Just headlocks that was quickly broken up. The teacher broke it up because she actually thought they were play wrestling and not actually fighting. It was not serious. 

As a result, I simply froze out my nephew from coming over. Of course this is seen as my blaming my nephew for the fight. It's not. I couldn't care less about the ""fight."" It's because I can't stand my SIL. She labeled my son as a bully and her son a victim and is still hysterical over the fact that her kid got into a ""physical"" fight at school and I am a horrible parent. She said that if my son ""wants"" a relationship with her son, then my son ""has"" to write an apology letter to HER and him and come up with a written plan on how he's going to be a better person to my nephew. This isn't a case where she's rational and can sit down and talk like a person. She's holding firm. She's not worth my time. Unfortunately, this has damaged my son's and nephew's relationship.

He's 7 weeks old, he doesn't have his vaccines yet, so we don't want him getting sick. I feel like funerals are the type of thing people might ""tough it out"" for, and go regardless of how they might be feeling, so we were worried about this. Our solution was to buy a cover for our carrier, that way he could be covered for most of the day. The cover did have a little flap so people could see his beautiful face, but we weren't going to let anyone hold him or touch him. I didn't want to vet everyone about their recent vaccination history or how they've been feeling lately, so we decided to just strictly limit everyone to a distance. Also, this day should not be about my son, it's about celebrating my grandpa's life and remembering him.

Fast forward to the gathering after the funeral, my wife and I were eating, and the baby started crying because he was hungry. Since my wife and I had just received our meals, my dad, who was sitting next to us, offered to feed the baby (we formula feed him because my wife can't produce breast milk). My dad is up to date on all of his vaccines, we know he's not sick, and he's been visiting the baby almost daily since he's been born, so we were fine with him doing the feeding. After he finished feeding him, he started to try burping him. For some reason, the baby burps a lot more effectively when you do it while walking with him, so my dad started to walk with him, and as he was walking I noticed a couple of my cousins get up to go see the baby, that's when I called out to my dad to come back and bring the baby back to his carrier. Well, this really pissed off my cousins, who then proceeded to abruptly leave the party. I explained to my other cousin (their sister) that it wasn't anything personal, we're just being cautious since he wasn't vaccinated yet and she completely understood but her sisters did not.

Now they're all pissy about it, and have actually uninvited my wife and I to their upcoming Halloween party (we had no intentions of going anyway so I'm not upset about it, but to actually remove us from the invite list on their FB even is a bit petty).

He was a real shithead growing up, he would intentionally hurt himself to get me in trouble, cry when he didn't get his way, scratch up the discs to my games and it didn't help that he was a mama's boy.

He also has a napoleon complex, he's 5'6'' whereas I am 6'4''. He is convinced the world (mostly women) is against him because of his height. I keep telling him it's because of his shit personality that no one wants to date him or be his friend and not because of his height, I remember linking him that bagel freakout video asking if that was him to rile him up, It probably doesn't help that I continuously make fun of his height.

He also makes alot of incel-type comments on his social media, nothing too extreme but it's still alarming sometimes. I mostly poke fun at those comments telling him he will one day regret saying those things, he doesn't seem to get it.

Anyways the past few months I've been distancing myself from him, I've been visiting home less, commenting on his socials way less, texting him less (not that I texted him that much before). Slowly until I cut all contact with him, I have no desire to have a relationship with him, we were never on good terms to begin with and these past few months he's been posting way more cringing incel shit and lashing out at me more.

I wish were cool but his behavior growing up combined with his shitty attitude+behavior now has prevented us from ever getting close, I know I have a hand in that but at the end of day it's always been because of him, there's a chance he may see this but I don't really care anymore.",204,466,0.88

Tldr; sister is demanding use of a phone sent for the purpose of video calling parents with their grandchild, denying them of the opportunity.

Quick backstory: I have a sister, and she adores me more than anything. She has always said how much she looks up to me, and how much I mean to her. For the  past...15 years? Maybe more? Has been a closet addict. Not a very closed closet: we all knew, but not to the extent it is. She has made multiple ""attempts"" to get clean, but all were either a false front for sympathy or some sort of gain, or were a genuine attempt that lasted maybe days. Current attempt is 2 weeks. I'm proud of her for that. She has two children, that she managed to raise; although, my parents did have a big hand in that. She has been living virtually rent free for the past...10+ years (her kids live with her in the basement suite of my parent's house), but hasn't been able to hold down a job. In her defense, she has had a rough go (outside of addiction) with a very physically abusive ex (she is out of that relationship...15+ years ago, and another one after that), so she hasn't had it easy on that front by any means. I'm not going to even touch on any financial details, but let's just say she is always ""needing a few bucks"". Or more than a few.

Current situation: I have lived a considerable distance from my parents and sister (2000+km -- 1250 freedom miles)  for most of the past 20 years (work related). I visit, but not as often as I should. I recently (a few months ago) had a child. With the distance between us, my parents have obviously not met him in person yet. 

The issue: to combat the distance, I mailed my parents a new (to them) cellphone capable of video calling (their old one couldn't). I paid for the phone, they pay for the bill.  Since it's arrival, my sister went into a ""detox fit"" (her words) and smashed her phone. She has no concept of reprecussions for her actions, and has since commandeered the new phone as her own as she ""needs it"", thus denying my parents of seeing their grandchild. My parents aren't happy with that, but are letting it slide for the sake of peace.

can expect no contact from me at all until she does?",17,32,0.94
525,Asshole,"I (28 F) used to work at a haunted house/trail as a clown and basically just scare the shit out of people all Halloween season. I taught myself how to do my own makeup and made my own costume. I'm pretty proud of it. I wasn't able to work the haunt this year bc of my day job, but let me tell you, there are few things more satisfying than making grown adults scream in fear/piss themselves/run away screaming lmao (I would NEVER try to make a child that afraid, though. The actors would purposefully be less scary for children coming through the haunt.)

Anyway, the bf and I are going to his parent's house to hand out candy for Halloween. I mentioned I miss working at the haunt and want to dress up to hand out candy and freak kids out a little bit. Not to scar them for life or anything, just silently and creepily hand out candy dressed in my costume, and maybe throw in a few creepy cackles ever now and then. My bf said I would be a MAJOR asshole to do that, and that these are just little kids and I would scare the shit out of them. He thinks there would be a lot of pissed off parents. I think it's all just in the good natured spirit of Halloween.

We recently watched a documentary about cam girls with my boyfriend \[M30\]. We hadn't really discussed our porn habits before but this opened the discussion. I told my boyfriend that I have a complicated relationship with porn as in my first ever relationship the guy I was dating would rather watch porn than be with me. It really affected my self-confidence and self-worth a long time after that, but over the years I've really tried to improve those and heal from that experience. I've learned to live with porn and event watch it myself on occasion. 

During our discussion I found out that during the year we've been together my boyfriend was looking at NSFW reddit posts from certain subreddits daily while I was sleeping right next to him. Immediately all the feelings of self-doubt and anxiety came back, I guess because of my past. I was hurt because of his behaviour, even though he had no way of knowing how bad it would make me feel.

Whilst the little girl is an angel, her brother is more difficult, and very stubborn. Once he gets stuck on an idea, he’s very very persistant, and he doesn’t have much in the way of boundaries.

This kid is DETERMINED to try coffee. Every time I make one in the morning he’s hanging off my arm making me spill it trying to try some. If I’m not watching constantly he’s over at the coffee machine trying to figure out how to make it, risking burning himself. I literally have to put him in front of the TV and watch his face to make sure he’s totally engrossed before I can sneak off to the toilet whilst he’s distracted, so he doesn’t run straight to the machine.

I have no idea why he’s so obsessed, maybe it’s just exciting because it’s forbidden.

Anyway I’d had enough one morning and just said “sure, you can try it”, and as expected it was far too bitter and he spat it out immediately. I made sure it wasn’t too hot before I gave it to him. He’s given up the coffee obsession ever since.

However, after he told his parents I gave him coffee, they’re mad at me. I explained that I fully expected him to dislike it and never ask for it again, that he ingested none of it etc, but they’re still mad that I allowed him to have caffeine as he’s too young.

So AITA?

Edit to say - his parents were aware of his obsession with coffee, but laugh about it, and every time I bring it up it’s laughed about as a sort of ""that’s kids for you” thing, and it’s never addressed.

I (17F) met Alex (17-ish M) only this year, and he's already unbearable. We go to the biggest coaching institute in our town together, and he creates the most disturbance amidst class there, though he has repeatedly tried to convince me the otherwise. All of my fellow female friends there, and many male friends hate him like me, though the person who hates him as much as I do is Annie (17F). Plot twist? He has an obvious crush on Annie. The boy and I share all the tuitions, and whenever he sits next to me, he *has* to include Annie in the conversation. He was upset once when I hinted to him that Annie thinks he is irritating. He refused to believe me when I said that in a test I had supplied her most of the answers and she still got more than me, insisting that she **must** have solved them on her own - even boasting that he had checked her paper himself (papers were distributed at random for checking) and had given her a few extra marks. And he's always going Annie, Annie, Annie. Annie as of now doesn't know this.

Reasons for hating him? His blatant sexism and high thinking of himself. He's a ""gamer"", and a Call-of-duty ""expert"". He told me that girls, like me, a GOT fan, won't be able to stomach Call of duty, and that's why I haven't played it, even though I told him millions of times my PC is too outdated to play it. When any boy mentions a game, he listens eagerly, but when I asked if he had played Dark Souls, he proudly said ""I don't play wimpy games like that."" When I said that I watch cricket but not enough to name a favorite cricketer, and read cricket reports on the paper, he assumed that ""like any girl"", I had only heard the name of cricket and proceeded to ask me if I knew cricket was played on a field and if I knew Sachin Tendulkar existed. He is apparently a cricketer-cum-footballer-cum-kabaddi-cum-badminton player, *he* always saves the day. He proudly says that he watches ""adult movies"" like Jumanji 2, said since I like ""Forrest Gump"", it must be a wimpy movie and claims that he is not scared of me *only because* I am a girl, even though once I had almost come to blows with him. He wouldn't believe girls could be dirty-minded and know bad language until I swore at him. Still believes Annie is an innocent girl somehow.

My friends are urging me to tell how much Annie hates him just to make him shut up temporarily, and personally (I may be biased), I think it will be better as he then wouldn't make any advance towards her, her hatred + his mindset would only be harmful.

sorry for all formatting or grammatical mistakes, english is not my mother language.

So a bit of Backstory:

My Girlfriend (F21) and I (M23) live together with our daughter (2) in an appartment.

Since we moved in we always were like a hotel for her siblings because we live more in the center of a city where everyone of her siblings goes to school or work. So we have guests like 3 nights a week who would block the living room or just generally eating stuff that they aren't supposed to etc, However i have no major Problem with this. I pay the rent for us and also things like electricity and water but it's not much more with guests over so i'm fine.

So my Girlfriend gave 2 out of our 4 appartment keys to her siblings. My Gf and I have the other 2. I told them multiple times we would need at least 1 spare key outside of the house to hide if someone forgets their key. None of them ever brought a key back and my girlfriend doesn't care. 

Yesterday was the major problem with this. I went to sleep around 9pm because i got the flu and need to get up early because i have an important appointment at work. Noone contacted me about sleeping here. My GF was away working night shift.

Around 11.30 pm the bell rang like crazy. In the first 15 minutes i really didn't notice but when my daughter startet crying in the other room i woke up and opened the door. It was my girlfriend's sister who forgot ""her"" key and wanted to sleep here because she took the last train and at this time there is no more bus home for her. well i let her in and got my daughter back into bed wich took another 20 minutes. 

so my question WIBTA if i just told them to give me back all keys and i dont want them to sleep here ever again?   


It gets pretty annoying with the time and while i don't hate her siblings it's not nice to have 1 room less to live and pay more for all the food and water. My GF thinks i'm TA if i didn't let them sleep here anymore.

I'm paying rent

545,Asshole,"TLDR: I'm booking a group holiday and my friend won't confirm whether her boyfriend is coming because she is too nervous to ask him. So I just asked him myself. AITA?

I’m currently in charge of organising a group holiday and we've got a location and date that everyone agreed to quite a while ago so I'm just trying to get confirmations as the trip is approaching and I'd like to settle payments for the booking. Everyone is allowed to also bring their partners if they are in a relationship but since I'm not necessarily friends with their partners or likely to meet them regularly, I just ask the person in our group to convey the availability of their partner. This worked quite smoothly for everyone except one person. She has not been able to confirm whether her boyfriend is able to come.

I've asked her a number of times and she says he should be able to come just needs to confirm with him. As to what I think she was thinking, at the start of the week another friend told me she was nervous about asking him, and was planning on just dragging it out and avoiding the question for as long as possible. I guess this would be a step in defining their relationship?

Recently, everyone else had confirmed and I was starting to get impatient so I messaged her every day asking for any updates. At which point I found out that she has never even brought up the trip with her boyfriend but again would ""bring it up tonight"". She even offered to pay for his spot, but I said it would be much simpler if you could just bring it up with him and confirm his availability.

So a few of the others are getting impatient and are asking me about progress. Meanwhile she has been completely ignoring my messages so I message her asking if I should just directly message her boyfriend. She ignores this. It's not like I don't know the guy, we talk all the time at events and they have been seeing each other for more than half a year now. He's a nice guy and she seemed intent on him coming but was just nervous to ask the question. I reasoned that if she didn't want him to come she would have just told me earlier that ""he is unavailable"". So the next day I messaged him asking if he was available. He responds like this is the first time he has heard about this trip and that he would like to come but can talk to his girlfriend first.

Anyway she is now really upset at me for going behind her back messaging him. And the more that I think about it, I believe she is right- I have overstepped and intruded into their personal relationship. I didn't know exactly what was going on, heck it's even possible that she was planning on breaking up with him tomorrow. Or maybe she just needed time and I was unreasonably pestering her.

So I guess I would like to know AITA because I don't really know how to respond. I know she is really upset but isn’t it her for fault for not being able to just ask him and holding up progress? If I apologise and accept wrongdoing am I just rewarding her immature behaviour?",77,168,0.94
546,Asshole,"I'm 38M, my wife is 36F, we have two daughters 3F and 1F.

I work longish hours, anywhere from 10-12 hours a day. I'm home for about four hours every day other than sleep. The rest is travel or work. I get no days off except some holidays. My wife is a SAHM, which is fine by me as I pull enough income for both of us. While I'm home, I either hang out with my children, play videogames, or, and this is a big one, clean.

My wife doesn't clean the house. At all. Maybe once or twice a year we get a set of grandparents to babysit and we'll do a deep, deep clean. That's fine, but I mean general day-to-day maintenance, she does none of it. Every night before I go to sleep, I spend an hour to an hour and a half just cleaning. Nearly half of my time at home is cleaning, after a long day of work.

Foodstuff left on the counter, used bowls or plates or cups just sitting on the counter next to the dishwasher (despite it being empty, I make sure every morning). Toys everywhere. Our eldest daughter loves to shred up paper and almost every night I am sweeping and/or vacuuming, some nights I even mop because juice or food was spilled and left. Soiled diapers left open literally right next to the garbage bin. You get the idea.

I've tried to talk to her and she says she's too busy with the children. I get it: she works hard, I'm sure, and that's not sarcasm. You don't get a break with one child let alone two. But she shows zero effort in cleaning. Not to downplay her being a SAHM, because it's *essential* for us. I actively encourage it and this is what she wants to do anyways. But at a certain point it tips overboard to the point of being unfair to me. We've had talks every week about this and nothing. Ever. Changes. I've even plead to hire a housecleaner, I don't care the cost, and my wife takes offense at this idea.

If child protective services were to see our home, they would raise Hell. I can't describe the mess enough but it's unlivable. If I don't clean every night, even just for a couple of days, you are literally stepping over food on the floor, garbage everywhere. 

I've had enough so I want to call CPS on our family. Maybe this will scare her straight. I don't want to fight anymore, I don't want to divorce or separate, I just want my message to get through to her.

My GF asked me to interact with the parents more, for example, come downstairs and say hello and see how their day is going, etc.

Yesterday I left the house to buy alcohol and she told me that a parent is expected soon. While I was out, she sent me a text saying that a parent was here. I replied by asking to let me know when they leave. After 20 minutes she hasn't replied, so I come to the back of the house to check. My GF and the parent are at the back of the house in our kitchen and they see me. I hide the alcohol and come into the kitchen. The parent, her kid and a baby chair are blocking the hallway to upstairs. I say hello and I stand with them in the kitchen. After a few minutes everyone moves to the front of the house and I follow. The parent is leavings and I sit on the couch and look at my phone while I wait for the parent to leave so I can go and get the hidden alcohol. The parent leaves and I go get my alcohol.

I told her that I was blocked in the kitchen. She said that I should of asked if the parent could move so I could go upstairs.

I didn't like this for a number of reasons. She had previously asked me to interact with the parents more. This is my house too, my kitchen and couch and I should be able to use it when I like.

Now I myself am just kinda indifferent towards kids in general. I don't particularly like them, but I don't exactly dislike them either.

She's also never seemed to have any prior issue with my niece, though she's never been quite as involved as I am with her.

So, the potential arsehole situation. Last week, my brother got hit pretty hard and suddenly with some kind of bug.

He and I are similar in that we rarely get sick and if we do we get *sick* so I knew he must have been feeling like absolute hell, and I didn't really want my niece to catch what he had, so I offered to have her stay over at my place for a weekend so he could rest up and not risk infecting her. He accepted, and I took my niece to my place that afternoon. 

Well, the wife wasn't happy about it. She kept it together in front of the kid but hit the roof after she'd been put to bed. She claimed she hates children and I knew that and said she can't believe I'd sprung this on her. I was shocked. She's never told me she *hates* children and has always seemed to like my niece. To make matters worse she complained the whole weekend about my niece being there, even in front of the kid, including going in a full sulk because I put a kid's show on the TV to help settle my niece before bedtime (this was in the living room, we also have TVs in the bedroom and kitchen).

552,Not the A-hole,"Obligatory: I'm on mobile and my thoughts are scattered.

So my husband and I are currently 15 weeks pregnant and we've gotten back on the topic of baby names again. We agree splendidly for a girls name, but he wants to use a name from a video game for a boys name. The name is Farron and I can only think of Dark Souls 3 when I think of it. 

He only wants Farron to be the first name and wont budge and agree for it to be the middle name. The other part of the name will be Micheal, named after my grandpa. So I told him I'd only be calling the kid Micheal. If we end up naming him Farron Micheal like hubby wants I'd only be calling the kid Micheal and it makes me feel like an ass.

But to me having a unique name like Farron for a first name is gonna suck. Plus it doesnt roll off the tongue in the order hubby wants.

So, AITA for not wanting to have a videogame name for my kid's first name?

EDIT: Ok. I get that Micheal is not the way to go with spelling it.",134,122,0.86
553,Everyone Sucks,"My ex husband and I were together for 17 years. We have 3 children together. My ex is an senior Vice President for a major company in NYC. He worked hard over the years and we were graciously rewarded financially. Both of us work full time and our schedules can often run late into the night, not to mention we both make frequent business trips. This led us to making a mutual decision to hire a full time nanny. 

Initially, we hired two young girls to take care of our children. The ‘nanny’ took care of our children during the week and a separate, part timer would do the weekend duties on the occasion that both my husband and I were out of town. Our main nanny was amazing, but after a year, she decided to take a job opportunity to better advance her career. We then decided to promote our ‘part time’ girl to the main nanny role.

A few months in, I began to notice my husband having extra attitude with me. He was constantly taking his stress out of me, which was out of the norm. I started noticing how his mood would change when the nanny was around and I noticed how he treated her much different compared to the rest of us.

Six months later, he filed for divorce. Less than a year after the divorce was finalized, they quietly began dating (SHOCKER) and they were engaged and married within another year. We have joint custody of the kids. They stay with their dad during the week, since he kept our old place, which is within close proximity to their school. They spend weekends and most holidays with me. We both live in the city still so it’s fairly easy to transport them from place to place. 

I have rarely spoken to her since they officially hooked up. The only time I ever see her is when we swap the kids. When I am forced to speak to her, it’s usually a simple ‘hello’ or ‘thanks’. It’s always awkward but I cannot fathom humanizing this woman who played a massive role in ending my marriage.  She’s simply a homewrecker to me, nothing more, nothing less. 

Recently, I’ve noticed my kids have been referring to her as ‘Mom’ while speaking of her and it has infuriated me to the third degree. My ex and this woman are brainwashing MY children into believing this be the norm. Per our divorce decree, neither my husband nor I are allowed to speak of each other in a negative way towards our children. This has been really hard for me to keep my mouth shut and not call her out for what she is in front of MY children.

As I dropped the kids off Sunday evening, I simply told her that she will never be ‘Mom’ to the kids, regardless of what her and my ex try to cram down their throats. Monday morning, I got a text from my ex cussing me out for my comment. He revealed that she’s pregnant with their child and that me yelling at her the way I did seriously upset her and could have done damage with her being pregnant and all. He threatened to take me back to court and attempt to gain full custody.

554,Not the A-hole,"Okay, so my friend (27f) had a baby yesterday. Me (29f) and another friend went to visit her in the hospital earlier today. She didn't tell anyone if she was having a boy or girl and even wanted the baby name to be a surprise. At the hospital, we find out she had a baby boy. As she's cradling him, she says ""You guys, this is English"". I couldn't help it at that moment. It was like a reflex. I laughed. She looked up at me and I knew she was serious. I stopped laughing and it was just awkward after that. She didn't say much but I could tell she was hurt. I tried to make small talk about the labor and what not, but I couldn't wait to get out of there. Right after we left, my friend told me I was a jerk and should have apologized. I do feel bad, but I don't think I was being a jerk. At least that certainly wasn't my intention. I will apologize, but AITA for laughing? I really couldn't help it.

Update: So I apologized in person this morning and all is forgiven. However, I also found out from her sister that I was not the first person to offend her. Her brothers and sister teased her about it a few hours after the baby was born. She said it was her boyfriend's idea. No one likes him and he's kind of an ass, but that's another story all together. When I visited her, she didn't refer to the baby by that name at all. So just maybe she's rethinking things since she's gotten flack from her family members.",237,584,0.94

556,Not enough info,"Hi Reddit,

I (46M) am the father of a wonderful young woman (21F) who is currently wrapping up her final year of college and is engaged to marry her boyfriend of three years after she graduates in the spring. I love her so much, and I couldn't be prouder of everything that she has accomplished. She is my only child. We have a great relationship and talk on the phone or text every day, which is why this current conflict pains me so much. 

Lately, we have been talking a lot about her upcoming wedding. She and my future son-in-law both have huge families and many friends (she takes after her mother in that regard, while I am much more shy and introverted), and the two of them are planning to invite around 200 people to their wedding. A few days ago, she asked me to give a speech during the reception in front of all those people, and my heart immediately sank.

I have had a severe phobia of public speaking my entire life, to the point of having full-blown panic attacks anytime I had to speak in front of more than a handful of people. It made school absolute hell for me. I barely graduated high school because I skipped class anytime I had to give any sort of presentation, and my grades suffered for it. I deliberately chose a career path that didn't require this sort of skill.

I do take prescribed medication for generalized anxiety disorder, which helps somewhat with keeping my general stress levels low, but this specific phobia is so extreme that I honestly don't think any amount of medication will help me overcome it.

I understand that giving a speech is a traditional responsibility of the father of the bride, so I tried to think of a compromise that would show her that I do care deeply for her, despite my shortcomings in this one area of my life. I offered to write a speech and read it to my daughter privately the day of the wedding, maybe during the moment just before I walk her down the aisle, or else write it down and have my wife (her mother) or another family member read it during the reception.

My daughter turned down both offers. She said she has always dreamed about me giving a speech at her wedding and that it was really important to her. She said the father of the groom is planning to give a speech and it will be very obvious and noticeable to everyone if I don't give one as well. She sounded very sad and disappointed when she told me this.

I'm afraid of permanently damaging my relationship with my daughter if I don't give a speech, and that terrifies me because I love her so much, but what she is asking me to do is, quite frankly, my worst nightmare. I could really use an outsider's perspective, and I will accept whatever judgment you give.",121,162,0.96
557,Not the A-hole,"Edit: a common question/sentiment seems to be ""why you you go to a 3rd bar if you were unhappy after the first two?"" The best answer I have is that I wasn't unhappy. I enjoyed my time at the first two bars, and only started questioning her motives for this date on the walk to the 3rd bar. Once I felt unsure, I figured I would simply ask her to split the check at the 3rd bar we were going to. At this point I wasn't trying to get out of the the date or anything like that. I had enjoyed my time thus far and felt like just because I had been paying so far didn't mean I had to keep paying. 
_______________


I (25M) was on a first date last night with a girl (23F) from Tinder where we went out for drinks and ended up hitting 3 bars. 

Bar 1: we each got 2 drinks over the course of 45 minutes, about $35 total before tip and tax. I was having a decent time learning about her; she seemed cool. When the bill came she didn't even reach for her wallet which irked me a little because I like when a girl at least offers, but I also kinda expected this so I just paid and we left. 

Bar 2: we stayed for like 30 minutes and got 1 drink each, ~$20 pre tip and tax. Again, she didn't make any indication that she intended to even split the bill. I paid and we left. 

Pre-bar 3: on the way to the third bar I realized she had asked like 2 things about me in the 2 hours we'd been together and I had really been the only one learning about her, which made me feel like she wasn't interested in me at all. 

Bar 3: we each got 2 drinks over 40 minutes, about $24 pre tip and tax. At this place I confirmed I was just being used when she didn't ask me a single question about myself, said ""let's change the subject"" when I shared my opinion on something (I assume she disagreed even though she didn't actually say so...?), and she legit talked about her ex and showed me pictures of his new boo (HUGE WTF!?!). 

When the waiter came at this last bar I said separate checks because I was pretty pissed at being used and  had no interest in continuing that. But then she dropped on me that she didn't bring any money! I just paid the bill because I felt responsible for it since I'm the guy and blah blah blah. We left, she didn't even say thank you, and we parted ways. 

When I told me female friend about the date this morning she said I wasn't responsible for shit and should've just left. At the same time, I feel like I wouldn't been an asshole if I had said ""figure it out yourself"" and left her hanging since most girls I know do say they expect the guy to pay on the first date and I don't even know what would've happened to her if she couldn't pay. 

What are Reddit's thoughts? Would I have been the asshole if I had just left without covering her?

A couple extra details that may be important:
* I was the one who suggested both times, ""wanna change bars?""
* I do make decent money for someone my age, and she mentioned during the date that she lives with her parents, had to temporarily drop out of school for financial reasons, and is self employed (one of those online fashion consultants that I have always presumed don't actually make that much?)
* We basically exchanged 5 messages each on tinder before meeting, so I'm pretty sure she was intending to use me the whole time",170,443,0.93
558,Not the A-hole,"Yesterday we had a baby shower. Long story short, one of our family friends thought it would be funny to get some baby onesies with offensive things written on them. For example: 

* ""All daddy wanted was a blow job"" 
* ""I'm with the milf"" 
* ""To-do list: Eat, poop, suck some titties"" 

There were like 2 more but I don't remember what they said. When I opened the gift I was humiliated, I thought it was really inappropriate. Before people on here give me shit about not being able to take a joke, I just didn't really think this was the funniest ""joke."" I was mad about the gift because as I was opening and before I could read what they said, I unfolded the onesie and showed the rest of the party. Some people gave let out a small chuckle, some people looked around at each other kinda surprised. Anyhow, at the end of the party, I asked the person who gave it to me if I could have the gift receipt to return them. I said I definitely wouldn't put my baby in those clothes. The person basically called me oversensitive and said I needed to take a joke. I handed the gift bag back to them and said ""Alright, well then you can keep these."" They were super offended by that and thought it was an ungrateful gesture. AITA?",3748,21333,0.91

They discussed moving closer to them when I’ve lived an hour away from my dad my whole life. I see my dad rarely, I could probably count how many times I’ve seen him this year.

561,Not the A-hole,"My kid is 13. She's a good student with good grades and an all around basically well adjusted teenager. Hardly gets in trouble at school or at home.

I keep good inventory on the household stock of dry goods. For example, if we open a new bottle of shampoo, I put shampoo on the shopping list for the next week. It will be there and readily available for the next time we run out.  My husband and daughter are both aware of how to add items to the list and are free to add necessary or wanted items. It's worked well thus far in our household.

I hit the grocery store on the weekend-usually Sunday, but occasionally Saturday due to obligations. The night before/several hours prior to grocery store departure-I remind my family to add anything they need or want to the list. I went Sunday this week, as usual.

Fast forward to today, Thursday. About 7pm-ish I was in the shower, ready to put my PJ's on, watch some tv and call it a night. My husband wasnt even home yet-as he worked a full day and headed off to a cash side job for some extra funds, we are thankful for that!!  My daughter anounced she is out of make up face cleaning wipes. Umm, ok???

Obviously this should have some dire, prompt resonse on my part. I told her that I asked before going shopping on Sunday if she needed anything and she said no, so suggested she just use her facewash in the shower instead until I make it back to the store. That's not acceptable because appearantly the facewash won't get it all off.  I feel like its not my problem.  I told her next time I guess she should do a better job checking on what she needs before I head out to the store-or even go with. She's free to add stuff to the cart. 

I feel like ""lack of planning on your part does not require an emergency on my part"" applies here-although I did not SAY that.  

She is NOT wearing a full face of make up at 13. She is really doing a good job of using make up to accent her features. She's mostly just wearing mascara, and a little bit of power and/or concealer to hide regular teenage acne, and some lip gloss. She doesn't really NEED any of it, but I get the teenage self image. It's within reason, so whatever. I'm ok with it. 

We live rural. So to hit a grocery store its literally a 25 min drive. To hit a big box store-it's about 40 min. There are some local businesses that sell limited items at a larger price (ok with me-small businesses struggle-and we sometimes take advantage of the convienence) and a round trip to make a purchase is about 20 min. Time-whatever. 

I would not run out and buy make up cleaning wipes. I didnt feel it was necessary, and I wanted to reiterate that she needs to he responsible for what she needs.

Had it been something like ""my cycle started early and I thought I had more time before I needed supplies so I need x,y,z"" than I certainly would have taken her or ran out myself to get what she needed.

563,Not the A-hole,"I have a friend I used to work with. She once asked me if I was interested in a side job working in finance, because her company was offering free training. Great! I thought. She invited me to a half-hour presentation to learn about the training, and told me there'd be dinner after.

I sat through a two hour presentation—with NO FREE FOOD, I might add—in which they talked about how poor people are only poor because they aren’t smart enough to invest in risk-free annuities, and the best way to get money to invest in risk-free annuities is to collect lots of commissions by convincing all of your friends to invest in risk-free annuities, or perhaps by persuading THEM to convince all of THEIR friends to invest in annuities and then collecting a commission on the commissions they collect, in a sort of triangular business pattern that is definitely bound to succeed.

I said no very politely, and I said no very firmly, and eventually I just turned, walked out of the building and walked home (she was my ride). The next time I saw her, I didn’t bring up what had happened and neither did she, and we were fine for a while. Then I got married, and she offered to throw my bridal shower. I declined (not really a bridal shower kinda person) and she insisted. I declined again. She insisted. I explained that I was moving across the country in a couple of months and the last thing I wanted was to have to move more stuff. She said, “Then this shower is the perfect thing for you! I’m showcasing these cute totes and bags that will be perfect for a move!”

I declined rather forcefully.

I hear she’s moved on to a new MLM and that this one sells books. My daughter’s first birthday is coming up. She’s been sending me texts and social media messages like, “Hey, is \[daughter\] having a party?” and “Any idea what you’ll give your daughter for her birthday?” and “\[Daughter\] likes books, right?” I haven’t responded to any of them. I probably won’t respond to any of them.

I know she and her husband are struggling financially and my other friends say I should be more supportive of her attempts to sell this stuff, but I can’t afford the products and I don’t want to sell them. I don’t like MLMs and I don’t like pushy sales tactics.

564,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because my sister Reddits more than I do and could possibly see this. 

My older sis and I grew up very close in a dysfunctional household, but naturally drifted apart once she started college and moved away. I began dating someone she didn’t approve of, and while he and I had a rocky start to our relationship, we worked things out and I eventually became pregnant 2 years after we started dating. She wasn’t happy with my pregnancy from the very beginning, didn’t want updates or our conversations to be about the baby, and was just overall uninvolved. 

When I was 5 months along, my family imploded with drama and while I was telling my other siblings about it in our groupchat, my sis began calling myself and my SO out on things that didn’t pertain to the situation at hand at all. She and I began to argue, at which point she started bringing up my SO’s past that had nothing to do with the situation (and that my other siblings had no clue about because I’d only told HER about it in confidence). I left the groupchat and didn’t speak to her again besides sending back a monetary birthday gift she’d sent through Venmo (after publicly shaming me on Twitter for not thanking her btw). When I was 9 months along, she texted me freaking out on me over a conversation I was having with our youngest sibling (who was sending her screenshots of what I was saying) where I spoke about our childhood and my feelings on not having her involved with me anymore. At the end, she said we’d be better off not having contact with each other after all, wished me well with my baby, and we once again haven’t talked since. 

My mother has recently been mentioning my sis meeting my son during the upcoming holidays (sis lives far away and is visiting) and it’s made me uncomfortable. My youngest sibling also sent me a screenshot of their groupchat where my sis says she’s obsessed with him and can’t wait to meet him. Mind you, she and I have not had a relationship since March, she didn’t support my pregnancy or me at all when we were talking, and we do not talk anymore AT ALL. She’s already posted a picture of him on twitter bragging about him (I didn’t send it) and from the way my mother is talking, fully expects to go baby shopping for him and spend time with him. I personally don’t want to see her at all, and I know my mother will call me an asshole for feeling this way, so I’d like other perspectives. WIBTA if I refuse to let her meet him when she’s visiting this December?

EDIT: I just wanted to thank everyone for their comments, both good and bad. I have reported the picture on my sisters twitter, my SO and I will not be attending the holidays, and I’ll be looking into therapy to make sure I don’t continue the cycle of abuse I grew up in with my son. Also, special shout out to a certain someone who has been messaging me very hateful things because I refused to be baited in his comments. I’m neither a retard nor is my boyfriend a criminal druggy.

Now, what they did could’ve been done in a much better way in my opinion. A safer way, I mean. They could’ve set it on me or something with someone standing by, for example.

567,Asshole,"So, using a throwaway but i need to see people's honest opinions. So i currently live with 3 other women. One of them, Mary is an amazing baker and makes about 2 recipes a week and it is always so good.

The problem is because she bakes treats all the time and since theyre constantly available, it is starting to have an effect. Mary isn't a fan of sweets so she rarely eats them. But in the past 6 months because of her constant baking, i have put on about 35 pounds from her treats. I'm usually a healthy eater but when i get home, and i see that chocolate cake or the freshly baked cookies, i can't help myself. The other girls, who even though are eating the same amount of treats i am, are naturally skinny and havent gained any weight. 

To get back in shape, I have been on a diet and been going to the gym but it's hard when they are treats always around. 3 weeks ago, i asked Mary if she could stop baking because it was interferring with my diet. Tbh, i think she was surprised by my question. I told her that the constant treats are just too much and I'm gaining weight. She actually agreed to stop. My other roommates noticed after a few days that there were no new desserts made and asked Mary what happened and she told them what I said. They confronted me about it, quite rudely i might add, and said why should they go without the desserts if she was willing to bake them and they were paying for the supplies. I told them it was unfair to me if the baking kept happening since my health was being affected by it. It ended in an argument and i thought that was the end of it until last week.

Last week, Mary comes to me and says, that she misses baking, that it is one of the few things she can do that make her happy and that she understands im dieting but she wont give it up. What she will do is bake when im not home and whatever she makes, the other girls agreed to keep in their room and if it's alot, she will take it to work and share with her coworkers. Also, everyone agreed to not eat any of the treats in front of me.

tbh, i think this is a copout. This whole week, since she started baking again, has been so difficult. When i come home, i can smell what she has baked even though it's not in the room, which makes me want it more. When i go to talk to the other girls about something  i can clearly see the treats in their room. It's making my cravings so much worse cuz i know it's there and i just cant have it, and when i do break from my diet, it's usually worse than when she wasnt baking because the cravings are so much worse.

I just don't understand why my friends arent supporting me in this. I didnt want Mary to stop baking forever, just for a little while until im back in shape. If it was reversed, i would support them.  I have explained the issue to a few ppl and the opinion seems to be pretty divided. I personally think my roommates should do me this little favor which in the long run, will improve my health. But AITA For even asking?

Yesterday in math class the professor took her phone and left it on the desk, but the damn girl couldn't wait 30 minutes to have it back so she took it from the teacher's desk while he wasn't there, when he came back and asked her if she had taken it because it was gone and she said she didn't have it and surely someone else would had grabbed

The teacher had to interrupt his class to ask who had taken it and we all told him what really happened, she denied it all so I said ""You're brave enough to steal and lie but not to take responsibility for your actions ""

She got very mad at me and stood up, two girls by his side had to grab her before she went against me, what left me confused was that her arguments to defend herself were (and I quote):

""You do not understand me because you do not have epilepsy, you don't know what it is to be hospitalized, take medicine and receive thousands of injections for a disease that is consuming your life""

I've spent nights in psychiatric wards, I have panic attacks that make me faint and episodes of rage that make me break things and hurt myself, but of course she didn't know

I was about to answer but my friend took my arm and made me sit again to get away from getting in trouble

Her friends started telling me all kinds of horrible things and I had a panic attack at recess that made me lock myself in a bathroom cubicle and not leave, fortunately all my other classmates went for me and took me out of there

Later that day a friend of mine (unfortunately also her friend) told me that the girl with epilepsy was angry for what I said, three other girls (The epileptic one among them) approached me to tell me that I had no right to speak because everyone MUST treat her well and say nothing about her actions because she NEEDED her phone to be able to live with epilepsy but I ""didn't understand cause I was healthy and didn't know anyone like"" her so I guess I'm not able to empathize with her or something

I told her I have an autistic and non-verbal older brother and my younger sister has EPILEPSY but that didn't mean she could use it as an excuse to behave like crap and then say it's because of epilepsy

I’m a 19 y/o student that’s unemployed. I’m unemployed atm because my mom wanted me to focus in school. She assured me she’d take care of me until I graduate.  

Since I’m making no income, all my savings got used up on bills until I couldn’t afford it anymore. This month my mom paid and it turned out exactly how I feared. She’s complaining. 

This has lead on to my sister(23, Jess) who is also unemployed but her bf takes care of her, to throw it in my face. Since I haven’t been working and I have more time on my hands, I do all the chores while Jess sleeps in, gambles, and runs her mouth. Every time we get into an argument, Jess brings up my depression, anxiety and tells me the family all hates me and talks shit about me. I’ve expressed that it bothers me to my family but no one cares.  

Tonight the straw finally broke the camels back. I went grocery shopping and unloaded an apocalypse worth of food. My mom helped and Jess didn’t.  As we were unpacking, Jess got up and gulped HALF the jug I brought in and put it back on the ground instead of the fridge.   

I frustratedly said “At least help put it away?”   Here we go again. She’s popping off, bringing up my depression, saying I have no friends or bf and that I’m jealous of her.   

I let out a laugh “He broke up with you and you cried, yet back together. So what exactly does that say about you?”   

Another low blow. “At least mom isn’t taking care of me, at least all my bills are covered. I don’t need to depend on her. Lazy ass.”  

“Please, at least I never stole from her”. Jess’s been a gambling addict since 18(before she had a bf) and it got to the point where she used up all her money and started pulling money out of moms account, my mom couldn’t pay the bills so guess who had to. I never brought it up until now.   

More shit talking, literally got in my face and laughed about me wanting to hurt myself.   

I finally blew up “You never even graduated HS. You eat, lay on your ass or gamble. You depend on your bf. You’re a dumb, fat, ain’t ever gonna be nothing, ain’t ever gonna amount to shit, bottom of the shoe CUNT. If I didn’t have a job we would’ve been fucked, so you’re welcome for that and the 3 times I saved your car from getting repoed. You’ve done waaaay worse shit. Have you ever wondered why you don’t have the code to moms vault? Why you don’t know her card pin? Because she doesn’t fucking trust you! No one in this family trusts you! How does it feel to be pathetic?”  

Then the biggest low blow of it all “how does it feel to be just like dad?”   

I went upstairs and heard Jess crying and our front door slammed shut.  I feel bad. But man she pushed me to my limits. It was almost everyday she was egging me on.",147,649,0.94
572,Not the A-hole,"  

Our circle of friends often gathers for sports/games nights. One individual really likes to host- and by host I mean he offers his place for the event. He doesn't cook anything or provide anything beyond water. It's always BYOB or pitch in for pizza. This is fine- nobody is expecting a five-course meal or free booze. We’re just happy to get together to share something we all enjoy.

The problem is that his place is absolutely disgusting. I'm talking cat litter on the ground, dirty walls, dust on everything, spilled pop dried on the coffee table and wall, stuff everything- he got married like 4 years ago and half the gift registry is sitting unboxed on his dining room table, along with random other thngs he can't be bothered to put away. Place smells like ammonia cause of the cat litter, dust-bunnies the size of actual rabbits… every counter in the kitchen has empties or garbage on it. He hasn't had soap or a towel in the washroom for nearly 2 years. When I go over, I bring hand sanitizer to use after peeing, because everything in the bathroom is just gnarly and we always eat food when we hang. It's a weird situation- we thought marriage would force him to grow up and clean his place but his partner is as bad as he is. 

Everyone in the group has talked about this issue privately and we don't know how to approach it. I thought about just buying handsoap and a towel to leave in the bathroom but I fear that'll be seen as passive aggressive and also for fuck's sake, you are nearly 40- why don't you have hand towels for your guests? I get so goddamn anxious at his house I almost want to stop accepting invites, but he's a close friend and as you get older, you don't have many of those anymore.

A few of us thought it might be depression but he got really angry when I approached him with a “Hey, if you ever need to chat…” thing over beers. We've also tried to offer our places to host but he's very traditional and inists we have it as his place more often than not. I get that different people have different standards for a clean home and I don't expect polished crytsal or floors, but I shouldn't take off my shoes and then immeadly step in spilled cat littler. It's frustrating.

WIBTA if I tell him that it's fantastic he opens his door to his friends, but he's living in borderline squalor and needs to either hire a maid or clean up before he has 10 people over for football? Or WIBTA if I buy a bottle of handsoap and a cheap towel for his bathroom?",19,35,0.95
573,Everyone Sucks,"So this past summer, there was an anime convention at my town. It was only a 7 mins walk from my apartment and my sisters (A- 17 and T-15) and cousin (S-13) wanted to go. So I thought that it would be better if they spent the night at my apartment all though the convention. 

We carefully planned everything, pre registration for the tickets, and extra food for my apartment and money for my sisters and cousins. I was also a volunteer but I only volunteered at night. 

So the day arrived and my nanna dropped them off and suddenly there was another girl. Not my other sister or cousin, but a stranger. Turns out it was S's friend (H) and she just needed someone to walk her to the convention. I was a bit miffed about suddenly having another kid to watch but we all went to the convention and got our tickets. A, S, and He went off for a cosplay thing and T and I stayed together. After like 2 hours, A told me that H was picked up by her dad. So we went to a maid cafe for an hour. 

After we left the maid cafe, we saw Him and her dad. My sisters and cousins went to talk to them while I went to take pictures of cosplayers. My back was turned for like 2 mins and when I turned back around H's dad was gone! I looked around and found him power walking away, almost running with his head down. He never came back. 

After a couple of hours we had to go back to my apartment to eat and charge our phones, so I asked if H could call her parents to pick her up. She did so and I asked if she was okay with being alone until her parents picked her up. She assured me she was okay to wait alone. We left and after 3 mins, S got a text from H saying her parents were so mad she had been left alone. They were blaming her for not making sure she had an adult with her. H then blamed S for not making me wait with her. 

I told my nanna and she said I should have been smarter about it, but I was firm that if H's dad wanted me to watch his kid, he should have asked. 

AITA?

Edit, don't know if anyone will read this but I need to make a few points clear. 

1. I honestly thought she was 14. She was really tall and nobody told me her age until after I left her. 
2. She was stuck waiting maybe 5 mins. We got the text that her parents were on the way, we waited a bit and then left.
3. The reason why I didn't take her with me was because I was scared that if I took her home, then I would stuck with her the whole convention. I didn't have enough money or food to support 4 kids. Plus I would have to pay for her to attend the convention, which would total $70 and buy her food and other things. I only had $60.",114,180,0.95
574,No A-holes here,"Hi everyone! 

I’m coming to you because I don’t know how to reason with my son anymore about college. My son is studying business and when he applied he was very lucky be accepted to two notable business schools in Pennsylvania. However, and I will admit this, one of the business schools is much more well known and I guess you could say prestigious, but the other school has been rising in national rankings and produces great careers for its students. My son was obviously thrilled to be accepted to the former and he definitely did deserve it, and was not as excited about the latter because he had his heart set on the more prestigious school. However, he had applied for a nearly full ride (it covers tuition & fees, but he has scholarships that reduced room and board) scholarship at the second choice school and got it, which I thought was great! In a time when student debt is a serious problem, he has an opportunity to graduate debt free from a good school. However he still had his heart set on the “better” school and I did not tell him that he couldn’t go there but I did tell him that I would not pay more for it than I would have to at the school where he only had to pay a few hundred a year. He is now enrolled at the second choice school and although he says he likes the program and campus which does allow him to access the city easily, he is still upset at me for what he thinks was taking away his opportunity to attend a top school. In my opinion I think that just because a school is “top-tier”, it doesn’t outweigh the benefit of being debt free.

Four different dentists said if he didnt quit he would lose his teeth.

I've offered to buy patches and gum. He joinined me in praising himself and his great accomplishment of 30 days no cigarettes. 
 Until last week I was sure that he had quit. Last week I started smelling cigarettes on and off. I asked him and he denied smelling it and said it was nothing. I asked him again yesterday and he again assured me that he had quit. I had a hunch he was lying so I went out to his car while he was in the shower and found his cigarettes in his trunk. 
  I brought them inside and did the whole ""ahhh hahhh what is this!?!"" bit thing and he was furious. He says that I had no right to go through his car without his permission and its none of my business what he does.

577,Not the A-hole,"I'm going to try to keep this brief, although this is an incredibly long-winded story. I can provide more info if needed.

So my parents were never together after my birth. In fact, I only met my ""dad"" three times in my life. When I was 18, I reached out to him and we began talking. A few months later, just as I was beginning to get to know him, he and my mother got together, breaking up with her then husband, my ex step-dad. Now, a year later, step-dad no longer talks to me, and parents are happily engaged. Mom did a series of things during this time that I'm pissy about, including kicking me out of the house so ""dad"" could move in, getting engaged quickly, refusing to apologize for keeping me from him my whole life, and lying about him. She said awful things about him my entire life and then suddenly let him back in to our lives without reconciling these things with me. I feel like I was brushed under the rug, and that all my feelings about this are being ignored. Now my parents are getting married and I'm meant to act happy and like this whole situation is retraumatizing me. In essence, I'm supposed to act like the abandonment never happened and move on. I have told them countless times how I feel, but they refuse to apologize and acknowledge that they did anything wrong. I feel like maybe they are right, and that I'm just being crazy.

I (20f) have been dating this guy (20m) for about 8 months, but we have known each other for the last year and a half. During the school year he lives in another province for school. I decided to go visit him for a weekend in September. 

I paid ALL expenses, flight, hotel, food. I also took off work, school and practice to go see him for 3 days. My return flight left at 7 AM on a Monday, so I was planning to be at the airport at 5 AM, meaning I had to wake up at 4. When I told him, he said he could drive me to the airport (which was 8 MINUTES AWAY) in the morning but had a hesitant, somewhat sad face. Seeing his face I proposed taking a taxi but he insisted on driving me.

Monday morning the alarm rings, and he turns and tells me he’s really tired. When I told him I was relying on him to drive me, he turns around and YELLS IN HIS PILLOW. At this point I’m kind of scared and I immediately call a taxi, which arrives really quickly. I was packing up my stuff in a hurry and he was just standing looking at me, gave me 20$ for the taxi and told me “you’ll just be mad at me for some reason when you get home”. The bye was quick and I was very disappointed

When I confronted him about, I said we should talk about it and he proceeded to tell me “there’s always something with you, never just good times” and told me he just wanted to sleep, was tired and had a big day ahead. Meanwhile I had to hop on a plane at 7 AM, get to my 9-5 straight from the airport and then practice from 7 to 8 PM. 

During the summer when he had no car, I’d drive him 2h in rush hour to get him to work at 7 EVERY MORNING. I’d also drive back at lunch time to bring him food when he forgot to pack some for himself in the morning. And he couldn’t wake up to drive me 8 mins to the airport because he was tired.

Am I the asshole? Should I have just let him sleep? Am I being inconsiderate?

EDIT: he also said that he “thought it was fine” for me to take the cab because I had mentioned it when I saw the disappointed look on his face once he found out he had to drive me to the airport.

EDIT: we agreed on the dates beforehand. He was really excited that I was coming to see him. There was an option for the plane to land Sunday night but it was 300$ more expensive, and the trip was already expensive for me as it was. He knew I was leaving Monday morning, I even sent him the flight confirmation email with all the details. We did many activities during our weekend together that were enjoyable.",249,853,0.93

 Throwaway   
   
 I (16f) go to an all girls school, grades k-12.  There’s recently been this one girl, I think she’s 7 years old, who saw me one day after school and just kinda clung to me.   
   
 Recently, my friends in the same grade took notice and have started to make fun of me. I told them that I don’t want to talk to her, that she just came up to me one day. They kept making fun of me.   
   
 She’s been getting more and more annoying too. She finds every reason to talk to me, any free time we have she finds me and starts hanging around. It’s embarrassing and I was getting tired of her.   
   
 So, the other day, I was heading to my car after school. I usually park it on a street just outside the school. She found me after school, as usual, and began to follow me this time. I kept telling her to stop following me, but she wouldn’t.   
   
 When we got to my car, I just said to her “I have to go now, I’ll see you tomorrow” and she said “no! I want to go to your house!” And I said “I’m sorry, but you can’t. Go back and wait for parents” and she told me that she walks home.   
   
 Here comes the part where I might be the asshole... I told her “here, how about this: just wait for me here, and I’ll be right back”. And she said okay. Then I went home.   
   
 The next day, I got called into the principal’s office. The principal told me that the girl’s parents had called, because she didn’t go home that day. She said that the girl didn’t go home, and her parents were driving around looking for her. They found her on the sidewalk, and she told them that I told her to wait there. The principal said the girl was standing there for four hours.   
   
 I got suspended for a week. My parents are furious at me, and made me go to her house to apologize.   
   
 To be fair, I didn’t think that she would actually be stupid enough to stay there, not for four hours at least. She said that she walks home, I thought she would just leave eventually.

So I have a good mom friend that I go out with fairly often with our kids. We usually get lunch and take them somewhere they can run around, like to a park or play place or something. Most of the time, I go ahead and treat since I usually am the one to ask her out and feel like it's polite to do. I'd say about 70% of the time I pay for us all.


Well my workplace has been cutting hours, so I don't really have the money for 5 people every time we go out, so I haven't really been paying for us all lately, and most of the time just me and my daughter. 


Well I asked if she'd like to take the kids for lunch and grab a coffee today, which she accepted. I didn't think to tell her I wasn't treating since I don't treat every time. When they came to ask if we were ready for the bill and asked if it was together or separate, I said separate. When the waitress walked away, she said ""oh. I figured you were paying, that's why I said sure. I didn't really want to have to pay for lunch today."" 


I told her sorry but I couldn't afford it this time, and she didn't say anything, but after we got home she sent me a text saying if I wasn't planning on paying, I shouldn't of bothered asking her out, or I should of at least given her a heads up that I wasn't treating, and that I put her on the spot and made her have to spend money she wasn't supposed to be spending.

So my wife (29F) and I (29M) have been hosting dinner parties a few times a year for as long as we’ve lived in our current city. We like to go all out and cook elaborate multi-course meals, so we limit our invitations to just a few close friends, since cooking such a complex dinner is an all-day affair and the food costs add up quickly. We have about four to six people we invite to these events, depending on their availability, and it’s become a great tradition in our social circle. 

Our friend James started dating his girlfriend Sarah about a year and a half ago, and when we first extended her an invitation, we were informed that Sarah was vegan. I thanked James for letting us know and said she was more than welcome to bring her own food so she would have something to eat. He agreed, and the two of them have been attending our parties regularly for the past year. Everything was fine, until now.

During our most recent dinner this past week, we noticed that Sarah was very quiet and looked like she was about to cry. My wife asked her what was wrong, but she told us not to worry about it and kept dodging the question, so we didn’t push the issue. 

However, after the meal, James took us aside privately and told us that Sarah felt hurt because we never provided any dishes she could eat at our dinners and it seemed like we were deliberately excluding her. He added that he thought we were being rude and inconsiderate by not accommodating her, which really pissed me off, and we got into a huge argument over it. 

My wife feels terrible that Sarah was so upset and apologized to her and James profusely, but I don’t agree that we did anything wrong. I like Sarah very much as a person and I don’t have anything against her dietary choices, but I don’t believe it’s fair to expect us to change our entire menu or make an entire separate meal for one person, especially when so much time and effort goes into creating these dinners.

One of my coworkers came in today after her maternity leave to introduce everyone to her new baby.

V cute, all the other ladies went ape shit, etc.

The poor baby was being passed around like a hot potato. I made some basic remarks of ""how cute"" etc and tried to make a quick escape back to my desk, but then mom offered me the child to hold.

I went ""No thank you, I'm good""

And she was like, oh it's okay, he's a good baby!

Me: Ah no thank you though, I don't have my flu shot yet (something I read is important for newborns)

Mom: That's okay! Go ahead!

Me: No, I don't really want to hold your baby.

She looked mightily offended and a lot of the other girls who I'm usually friends with looked at me like I just slapped her in the face. Then she asked me the dreaded question: ""Why?""

I didn't want to tell her the truth that babies grossed me out, so I just lied and told her that I just don't want to get him sick.. I haven't washed my hands or anything and I was just outside.

\*cue lots of eye rolls\*

WITA?? Should I just have satisfied her need to share her baby with everyone and held the baby for 30 seconds and passed him on to the next person? I don't like kids in general, but I thought I was being polite about it. Mommy hormones freak me out and she's being very cold towards me right now.

Super fast edit as this just happened - I am apparently being labeled as ""Baby Hater^(TM)""  and subsequently got uninvited from another coworker's birthday party later this month. Can't say it doesn't sting.

The temptation to be a full asshole is strong.

I mean... I said it was cute??  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: Everyone at the front desk seems back to normal-ish, and the mum is working at a different location today so I won't be dealing with her for a while. Some updates to common comments:

I did not go full AH I just went back to my desk and did my job quietly the rest of the day which really is normal for me anyway.

A lot of you said I should have told them I had anxiety about dropping a baby/I'm clumsy - which would work in other cases, but most of them knew about my family life and that I had cared for babies as a teen and I have helped some of them with their kids before, so it felt like a weak excuse at the time.

I also hear and understand the value of just not rocking the boat and could have avoided the drama but just holding the baby for a moment and handing it back. Lesson learned. Hopefully though this interaction helps the next mom realize that I just don't want to deal with babies unless necessary.

Thank you for all your input. They aren't all bad they just got catty because something in their brains switched off logic with the new baby. He's 8 weeks old btw.

Still not going to that birthday party tho.

Also, I'm not going to go to HR for this unless it gets out of hand.

591,Not the A-hole,"Me and my girlfriend have decided we need to use condoms more frequently since we had a pregnancy scare. She said it's up to me to get them because I'm the one with a dick but she was okay with helping with the costs. Her school gives out free condoms but mine doesn't, but she wont get any from there because she says it's weird and she doesnt want to nor will she go to the store to get them even if it's with my money. We both having pretty bad anxiety problems and buying these things is hard for us. It makes me extremely uncomfortable to buy condoms as well as her but I've been the one to do it everytime in the past. I said its unfair for her to expect me to do something she wouldn't do herself because I feel like it's both our responsibility to get them because sex takes 2 people and pregnancy affects both of us. She got very upset at this but I dont feel I'm wrong for feeling this way and she doesnt think she should have to get condoms at all because she's not the one with a dick. AITA?

Edit: can't order them because our parents go through our mail, were not adults and they're super controlling.

592,Not the A-hole,"Until about a year ago, I have not been in contact with any of my family because of their intolerance of my sexuality. Last year, I got in contact with my mother and she invited me to Christmas dinner to introduce my son and husband to everyone. The party (as you can imagine) was at best extremely awkward and at worst just f*****g awful. The worst part though is that no one (except my mother) made any effort to make my three year old son feel included. His only presents were the candy everyone was given and the shoes my mother bought him. I had to leave to buy a bunch of junk at a convenience store so he didn't have to watch all the other kids open toys without him. 

That's why I have decided not to visit my family this Thanksgiving, even though I have been invited. My mother is begging me to go because unless I do, she can't, and she really wants to spend the holidays with the whole family. The reason she can't is because earlier this year she moved over 1000 miles to be closer to me, and she is severely disabled and dependent on my care now. She can't drive down there, and is too scared of planes to fly. I've also decided not to go down there for any future holidays.",30,32,0.89
593,Not the A-hole,"I am 17 and in school. my mom married a guy who has a three year old son. I also have a twin brother who is 17. 

I feel like I've become the babysitter for my step brother because I'm the girl of the family, my brother is doing football and never has to babysit. But me, I had a job at a summer camp taking care of kids for some extra money this summer and now my mom and stepdad expect me to babysit this kid for free whenever it's just us home.

At first I tried really hard, making him good food, playing outside and helping him with learning to read and stuff. Keeping him busy and playing together. But it was hard because I'm in school and trying to get into college for next year. And I could only study or am do applications after his bedtime and I was never getting enough sleep.

I got angry at my mom for making me the babysitter every day, and her and her husband and my brother not doing enough. And she had so many excuses like she and my stepfather working, my brother having football. And I have hobbies too, but I can't do them because I've become momma # 2. Or really momma #1 because I spend way more time babysitting than her or anyone else

But my mom wouldn't let me go out after school and leave my step brother alone after preschool, I have to pick him up everyday when it ends on my walk home. And I can't join the school play because of it.

So I've stopped being a real good babysitter, I'll do the bare minimum to keep him safe and nothing else. No more games or reading, I do my own homework instead. I keep him quiet with kids YouTube or naps or whatever. I don't cook much but sandwiches and reheat leftovers and leave him alone to eat or not eat, instead of giving into picky eating

And after a while of that, he stopped talking so much, his kindergarten teacher said something about his language learning regressing instead of improving. He's been acting up more around my mom and stepdad, but he doesn't tantrum anymore around me because I just leave him alone to scream it out until he's tires himself out.

I'm doing way better with school and I'm finally able to get sleep but the rest of the family is stressed a lot because of his behavioral problems that started coming up after I stopped playing momma

594,Not the A-hole,"I already feel like a bit of an asshole but I'm not sure what else to do so I wanted reddits opinion.

A little backstory, my GF (28) and myself (34m) have been together for nearly 10 years now. Our relationship has been pretty solid up till the last few years where this problem started and has grown to being a nearly daily occurrence which is driving me mad. We met when I was just finishing university and she was just starting, we hit it off instantly and got serious pretty fast. It was a little weird as she was just starting full time studying and I was entering the workforce but we were really happy together. Fast forward to now and we own a home together and were talking about marriage/children until recently.

When we first met I was at my heaviest (300lb+) as full time studying and bad eating habits had caught up with me, she has pretty much stayed consistent with her weight since we met. A few years ago I decided I wanted to get back into the shape I used to be in, since then I've been pretty consistent with eating/working out and have dropped about 140lbs. this is something we've been doing together and she seemed pretty happy that we were both eating healthy. When I first started losing weight she used to occasionally joke about I would fine someone better looking than her but this has now grown to be part of most conversations we have.

At first I would just joke back that after being with her for so long it would be too much effort to find someone else to put up with me but as it became more constant I stopped doing that. I tried to reassure her how I wasn't interested in anyone else, how I loved her and that she was beautiful but it doesn't seem to make any difference. She will just bluntly state in both private and a public setting how she looks ugly compared to me and that everyone must wonder why I'm still with her and she wouldn't be surprised if I was cheating on her.

At this point I wasn't comfortable anymore with her openly saying that I was the type of person to cheat on her so we sat down and had a serious conversation about what I could do to change how she feels and if there was anything that I was doing to cause this. She said that it was nothing that I had done and this is just how she feels, I suggested that she could go talk to a therapist to work through her issues or we could go together to work on this but she declined that as well.

Last week was was my final straw when I got home from work late and the first thing she said to me was ""Oh so you'd rather spend time with your attractive coworker than come home to my ugly ass"" and I just snapped and replied ""I honestly don't care about how you feel anymore, this has been going on for over a year and you refuse to tell me what I can do any differently or help you work on this. If you don't do something I will actually leave"". She stormed off crying and hasn't spoken to me since Monday. I feel like an asshole for how I replied but I’m just so tired of it.",86,348,0.94
595,Asshole,"So earlier this year my daughters (6) school announced the end of year trip to an amusement park. It was going to cost $200. I explained to my daughter that because it wasn't educational that although I payed for it, I expected her to pay me back by working off the money. We were given 4 months notice on the trip, and aside from her usual chores she has worked her butt off to repay the money. 

None of the extra chores take very long, so we only take off a dollar per job. Things like sorting the recycling, helping with the dishes, checking for rocks before her father mows the lawns etc. She has worked diligently and I am so proud o her dedication.

Well, last week the school sent home a notice to go and collect a refund because as only 3 students had payed they had to cancel the trip. She is obviously very disappointed. I don't feel that the $200 is mine anymore as she worked for it. But I am also not willing to give a 6 year old $200. 

My budget for my 2 childrens Christmas gifts is $200. So with the extra money that my daughter earned I decided to buy her this ridiculous barbie mansion dreamhouse she has been wanting for years. It cost $250 so I see it as only $50 of her Christmas budget. 

I am always the parent responsible for the Christmas shopping and my husband has never asked for input before so I didn't think to ask him about this. 

I buy the gifts early as we run a business and that time of year is chaotic for us. I asked him to hide the barbie mansion in the garage where we usually hide the gifts as it is rather bulky and heavy for me to unload from the car. He asked how much it cost and I explained the above.

He's not happy. 

He thinks it is unfair for our daughters budget to have gone up by 100%, and that this excludes our son. Our son is 3. I honestly don't think he will care, he is getting 'more' gifts, just ones that are not expensive. He has explained that he feels that I should have put the money in her bank account to save for her future. I believe that as she earned the money for something fun it should go towards something fun. If the children were older I would agree with him. But also if they were older I would just give her the $200 to spend on what she wants. 

He is asking me to either return the barbie house or to add another $200 worth of gifts to our sons Christmas budget. He believes I am playing favourites and it will make the children resent each other.

596,Not the A-hole,"Context: boyfriend, friend 1, friend 2 all live together in house that Friend 1 owns.  Friend 1 has his own apartment in the basement, and the other guys were on the second floor. There was a room that no one was renting at the time, that shared a wall with my boyfriends room.

A few months ago the guys threw a party. where they all live. At the end of the party, about 2 am, Friend 1 shows a couple to the room and invites them to use it-- the couple is a coworker of Friend 1, and Friend 1's fiancee's best friend. The couple ended up having super loud sex until 4:30 a.m. and kept all of us up. My boyfriend and I both knocked on their door at different points, asking them to keep it down.

The next day, my boyfriend told Friend 1 about it. He is a positive dude and doesn't really know how to react to anything negative. Think ""ah, it wasn't that bad was it? Those are both really cool people."" Friend 1 is not a great landlord, doesn't fix things, so this was sort of another log on a tense fire of those guys living together. Boyfriend, Friend 2 and I (who are all close friends) joked/bitched about this a lot over the next few weeks when Friend 1 wasn't there. But they did talk to him about it and eventually he admitted it wasn't cool.

A few weeks after that, Friend 1's fiancee was in town, and we all had dinner together at the house. I must have made a joke about that situation, because the fiancee has been mad at me about it ever since (which I just found out last week). I don't remember saying anything, or what I said, but I definitely wouldn't have said anything mean, just made a joke.

After this, Friend 1 and fiancee kind of disappear for a while. My boyfriend and Friend 2 both moved out of the house, and there are other renters there now, but they are still friends with Friend 1.  The other day we are out with Friend 1's older brother. He insisted that we \[edit: specifically just ME and the girl, not everybody\] get drinks and hang out with the girl from the party. I said I didn't really want to hang out with her, but that we were all good, the party was a long time ago, water under the bridge. He pressed the issue and said it was ""a sticking point"" for the wedding-- this was all coming from his brother. He basically said if I didn't go get drinks with this girl and ""be friends"" then my boyfriend might not get a plus one to the wedding, or go to the bachelor party. \[edit to add: we don't hang out with them a lot, and I don't usually hang out with the group. The guys are the primary friends, they are my boyfriend's friends\]

I am not sure why I am being singled out, as Friend 2 and my boyfriend have both also complained and joked about the situation. I don't like that they are holding a wedding invite hostage.

Today my friend (face to face) told me that drawing sexually attractive woman is disempowering them, and making them into a sex object. I was taken aback and obviously I asked what she meant. She explained that since I draw skin tight attractive woman more of the time, I must think of them as a sex object. She also told me that since I’m trans (female to male) I’m trying too hard to be my “real gender” by sexualizing them.

I was in shock. I felt hurt that she used my gender as a point. I tried to sputter some insults at her but I couldn’t get it out, and I’ve been ghosting her since. I’ve been thinking if I actually was sexualizing woman, even when I haven’t meant to.

603,Not the A-hole,"Backup account so my family doesn't find me

 So for context, I (21M) have spent the past 3-4 years or so planning to move out of state. I want to get really far from my parents because both of them have caused me a lot of emotional and physical pain. 

 I have a house, roommates waiting for me, and enough cash to get me there and last until I can get a job. I have been planning this since my junior year of high school. 

 The problem is, my grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, my grandfather is legally blind, and so a lot of caretaking work has landed squarely on my shoulders. 

 Both my parents work and occasionally take care of stuff like bills and home repairs, but it's my job to take my grandparents to their appointments, grocery shopping, manage their spending each month, ensure the house is clean, make sure they take their medicine, etc. 

 I have never been able to get a stable job because of this. (my parents pay me for ""helping"" on occasion and I do freelance work in my spare time) 
Without exaggerating, I can't leave home unless I am with my parents or I am doing something for my grandparents. 

 It's because of this that my parents are heavily against me moving out. They get mad at me for even suggesting moving out and constantly tell me they'll go bankrupt without me because they ""can't afford to take off work.""

 I have no siblings that are old enough to help out, and none of my relatives live as close to them as I do. Others could help with the work, but my parents refuse it because I'm ""conveniently available"". 

To me, this should not be my responsibility. I shouldn't have to give up on my plans to take care of my grandparents. I've sunk too much time and money into moving to give it up.

 I am running out of time to move, I need to be gone by this November. Am I the asshole for not wanting to be a caretaker for the next several years?


TL;DR: AITA for wanting to move out instead of take care of my grandparents?


EDIT: I appreciate the thoughts and opinions given on this ordeal, and I have decided I'm gonna take things into my own hands and go for it, whether my parents see me as an asshole or not. 

Moving out unfortunately isn't going to go down without a fight, but I'm going. I've had my things organized and ready to go for a while so I'm just loading them up in boxes so I can have them shipped, first box was sent to my future roomie's address today.

 As a last favor to my parents I'm going to look into resources through Medicaid to get them a trained caretaker. If I don't forget, I'll update again when I'm in my new home :) thanks for helping me gain confidence in myself


***FINAL UPDATE*** as of Friday the 29th of November, 2019, I officially moved out. I tied up loose ends with my grandparents and they are well taken care of, but unfortunately had to drop moving on my parents very suddenly. So suddenly that they only knew 1 hour before leaving, because i had no other choice. 

I knew the guilting would happen, i knew my dad would be hostile. In fact the last thing he said to me was ""I hate you for this."" I'm heartbroken, but I am happier here in a new state with people who care for me. I still get texts from loads of family members, some who I haven't spoken to in months, guilting me for suddenly moving, but I know it was the right thing to do.

It's been a weird couple of days, but I'm doing well. Thank you again to all the people on here giving me support, i really don't think i could have made this leap had not not been for freinds and strangers on reddit giving me a push in the right direction.",123,823,0.98
604,Not the A-hole,"I (F22) was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease a little over a year ago. Since then I have been stable with minimum medication for the last 5 months, my doctor says its ""remission.” I have also been struggling with mild-moderate acne for the past five years, and after exhausting all my options I made the decision to go on accutane. My sister (29) and I are very close, she lives far away so we text a lot. We are both health nuts, I hate that I have to take meds. The end goal is no meds but I am still processing the fact that I have the disease and I accept the meds because it’s keeping It from spreading to my organs while I devise a strategy to get off them.

My sister is also struggling with acne, and when I mentioned I was thinking about going on accutane she said that I dont need more meds and there are better, natural ways to fix acne. I then said I’ve thought about it a lot and I feel this is the best option, and it was dropped. All was well until last night, my sis is an affiliate and sells is these cumin pills that help with joint pain, which is a symptom of my disease. She had sent me some refills, and I texted her to thank her. She said welcome, and went on to say that she was talking to her facial gal and she was telling her about how harmful accutane can be for long term health, and that all acne stems from gut health and suggested I take a food allergy test to see whats causing it, especially with all the medication I am already taking. (she doesn’t know what or how much I'm taking, shes just assuming I'm taking a lot)

Basically I said “thanks, I appreciate the advice but I know whats best for my health, I’m good :)” she had said ""okay."" and then sent another text later saying ""so I can send you the free curcumin pills but you wont take advice from healthcare professionals that I talk too? okay \*thumbs up\* I found your response very passive aggressive and I dont appreciate it. Goodnight"" I told her I could send the pills back if she wanted, and she said they were $150 pills, and I could e transfer her the money for them. I said I would send the pills back, not send the money though. We started arguing because she said I wasn’t grateful for her help and advice, and that I take her for granted/will regret treating her this way. I did get pretty sassy at the end of it and told her I felt like the bis sis sometimes, and that she was rude/defensive when I didn’t engage in her advice, and that if I want advice I will ask for it.

This went back and forth and ended with me saying, me not wanting to talk about this has nothing to do with her, but with me as my health is a sensitive topic. I said  I appreciate the advice but not all advice is wanted, and please don't force advice on my or make me feel guilty about taking accutane. I said I was sorry we fought, loved her tons but talking to her isnt serving me right now. She hasnt responded.

As a kid, the ""emergency lunch"" at my school were these like cup of ramen things that always had meat but always looked/smelled *so good* (especially as a 7 year old who forgot their lunch), but I couldn't eat them because I was vegetarian. 

I recently discovered a vegetarian alternative thats kind of pricy, but I was really inebriated and ended up purchasing about 3 dozen of these noodles. Since I really don't need that many, I thought it would be nice to leave a few in my desk for emergency meals and also give a couple cups to each of the other two vegetarians in the office, since we are all limited in office snacks. 

One of the vegetarians, Jaime, came by and thanked me for leaving him those as he had forgotten to pack a lunch, and another coworker, Tara, overheard. She then came and asked me if I left her any, to which I awkwardly said no. She said it looked really good and smelled good, and that she likes to eat plant based when she can. She noticed my desk stash and asked if she could have some. I said no because they were expensive and a limited edition flavor, and she's been making comments any time I make one for myself or another vegetarian coworker eats one of theirs. Am I the asshole for not sharing with everyone else?

Edit: I should have included this at first but forgot. Tara *always* shares her stuff. Tea bags, cookies, etc. I never ask for any of these things and find her really annoying honestly, but she is nice enough to do that. She also has desperately tried to ""fit in"" (if thats the right phrase even) with the vegetarians by constantly coming to my desk to show me when she's eating plant based, or making a point to say it loudly in meetings when food is being ordered that she likes to limit meat consumption. She isn't actually a vegetarian though.

Edit 2: So after seeing ya'lls responses I went over to her desk and gave her two packs of ramen and apologized for making her feel left out. She came by to let me know that the ramen was not very good, so to anyone I DMed the link to, maybe try it before buying several dozen of them! Thanks everyone for your insight.",141,605,0.89

I work in a very corporate environment, in a shared office space. I am the only male over 40. Over the last decade, I have noticed that my colleagues tend to be under 30 and mostly women, of which I have no issue. 

However, this makes it difficult because there is oftentimes a culture that I’m too old to be a part of, and I am seen as the miserable old fart. However, my pay is more than my current bosses (ahh old contracts...) and the job is excellent, so although I don’t particularly enjoy my job I can’t see myself leaving anytime soon.

Essentially, I do my job, go home, and have a very strict separation of work/ home life.

We are both in our early 20s and have been together two years.

A few years before we met, my girlfriend was very into erotic fanfiction and wrote some herself, along with plain romantic fanfiction. I was aware she used to write fanfiction but I thought it had been private. I know basic details, like the fandom and that it was apparently very kinky.

Turns out it is still public, and she still occasionally gets comments on it. When checking her emails she noticed she had a new comment on a fanfiction from years ago, and happily told me about it. Apparently the person commenting thought it was really hot. I was shocked. I asked if I could read it, but she refused to let me.

So on my own I started trying to find it, looking for other usernames I know she's used in the past, and into the fandoms I know she was in, but I couldn't find it. I told her I was doing this, and she said she was uncomfortable with me reading it. However, she is comfortable with total strangers reading it. I told her I was uncomfortable with total strangers getting their rocks off to something she'd made, and that she needed to delete it, or I'd keep going till I found it.

She thinks I am an asshole, because she wrote them long before meeting me and is now embarrassed by them. (Not embarrassed enough to delete them though.)

619,Not the A-hole,"This happened a few weeks ago, but it’s really been sitting with me. I’m starting to feel guilty, but my husband thinks we did nothing wrong. Need an outside opinion!

We live on the top floor of an old, pre-war NYC building and have been here for 3 years now. The unit below us is a full-time Airbnb rental. (Totally against the lease, but that’s a different story.)

The last time we sent laundry out (no machines in the building and no nearby laundromat), it didn’t get delivered until 9:30p. We relaxed a little before starting to put it away slash packing for our upcoming vacation. It was probably around 11p. 

Every few minutes we hear a banging noise, but we shrug it off. About 15 minutes later, someone knocks on our door. My husband answers it - it’s a British woman we’ve never met before. She says she’s below us, has to wake up early, and we’re being very loud. She claims she can hear us “running around,” and we are being rude since it’s 11. She “banged on the ceiling and we still wouldn’t be quiet.” She also mentions something about how the woman in the unit next to us is asleep ... not sure why that was relevant or how she would know. My husband tells her we weren’t stomping around but apologizes, and she leaves in a huff.

At first I was mad. She doesn’t even live here, and we weren’t running or stomping, just doing normal things. But then I started to feel bad, because while I don’t think we were unusually loud, we also weren’t trying to be quiet. Plus, we don’t have a rug in that room since our pet rabbit stays in there most of the time and gets hay everywhere, and maybe that’s on us. Honestly, if we had a full time neighbor below us, we’d probably get a rug. But since it’s just an Airbnb (which can get loud and annoying), we cant be bothered.

This is still on my mind a few weeks later. Were we assholes?

Edit: I think what’s hanging me up is the rug thing. It does actually say in the lease that 80% of the floor should be covered with rug. This is pretty standard in NYC leases to help with noise but in my experience most people don’t follow this to the letter. We are good in the living room but our bedroom has no rug.",38,65,0.91

621,No A-holes here,"I work for a wonderful company and I really enjoy my work.  Without getting into too many specifics, it's in the mental health field, and my job specifically is on-the-job training and does not require a degree.  Although we have various offices throughout the region, I am the only person who works in my office.  Fortunately, business has been booming and I have substantially more patients everyday, and it has been a bit overwhelming being here by myself.

My boss (aka the CEO of the company) informed me that he posted a listing for a second position in this office so I can have some relief and get to actually take a break throughout the day.  My schedule fluctuates based upon my patient's needs for when they can come in for treatment, but currently I'm working about 6:15am-4:15pm so it's a bit of a long day compared to what I'm used to at previous jobs.  My supervisor is looking to have me work in the mornings and then have a second person work afternoons/evening appointments.

Now to my sister... My sister is five years older than me, she is a recovering addict, and has been clean \~2 years.  Those two years of sobriety are mostly due to her uprooting herself and moving halfway across the country to Colorado and removing herself from the people and environment back at home.  To say the least, my sister is easier to love from a distance.  Because of her poor choices in the past, my mom has full custody of her son and has raised him for the past four years.  

Nine days ago, my sister drove cross-country and showed up unannounced at my mom's house (with a friend!) and has been living with my mom, my nephew, and her friend since.  The ""plan"" is that my sister will get a job, get an apartment of her own, and be self-sufficient.  I've seen repeatedly through her actions that that may not actually happen.  I try to stay optimistic, but as they say, history repeats itself and I don't have much to be super positive about.

A few days ago, I posted on Facebook about a job opening in my office encouraging people to apply.  My sister commented that she was going to apply and I basically said, ""I can't stop you from applying!""  My sister has a decent work ethic, but as soon as something sets her off, she's done and can turn into a raging monster.

Yesterday, my supervisor asked me if I knew anyone who was interested in working here in the evening and I told her no.  In the back of my mind, I thought of my sister, but I decided that I wasn't willing to go out on a limb for my sister.  I'm not saying that people don't change, but she is very impulsive, quick to blow up, and frankly I don't feel comfortable putting my seal of approval out on her.  I'm not sure if my sister applied (she didn't say that she did, and my supervisor didn't approach me saying that she did), but AITA for not suggesting my sister when my supervisor asked if I knew anyone willing to work here?",31,49,0.92

She said her daughter is going crazy over the balloons and asked if she gave me money for it, if the daughter could have one to keep her occupied during the trip. Well, here’s the thing: I didn’t buy those balloons and the woman who did wasn’t there that day. So I told her unfortunately, those balloons are not for sale and I wasn’t the one who purchased them so therefor I couldn’t let her have one. She scoffed and rebutted with “Really? Well I guess I’ll have to cut my shopping trip short then” and walked off. Turns out she remained in the store shopping for an hour while her child ran amuck. Would a ballon really have helped?

Our date wasn't really planned in advance, but the morning of I got tickets for indoor skydiving and thought that'd be a good way for us to meet up so I invited her for lunch and then skydiving and then maybe a movie after.

I picked her up, we went out for sushi, and during our lunch, she said she was just looking for friends and not really dating. Honestly, it kind of killed the mood because I'm looking to date more than friends. If she wanted to just be friends, though, I decided I'd rather do the skydiving with someone else so in the middle of lunch I excused myself to call my buddy to see if he was down and he was up for it.

When it came time to pay for the meal, I paid for both of us and told her I had fun but this is where we part ways. She got upset as she was excited for skydiving and I told her I'm not looking for more friends, I was interested in pursuing a romantic relationship, and if she's not interested then I'm not interested. I left her at the sushi place to go meet up with my friend and off we went, my phone exploding with nasty texts all throughout.

Was I the asshole? The only way I think I might be is I picked her up but didn't bring her home. Otherwise it's not my obligation to provide essentially a stranger with a fun day.

My question is - should I tell her to clean her own shit up in the future? If she was actually unwell it would be a different matter but she just takes laxatives to lose weight.

630,Not the A-hole,"She and I used to be very close friends throughout our undergrad. We were in one big group of friends, but she was my best friend in that group. She has always struggled with mental health problems and an eating disorder, but it got particularly bad in our senior year.

She stopped going to therapy and became very spotty with taking her medication and essentially started using all her friends as emotional support punchbags. We did our best to be there for her, but it's really difficult. Sometimes we would hang out, and for hours the only thing we would talk about is how awful everything in her life is, how none of us have ever had any struggles in life compared to her. I am always more than willing to be there and support my friends, I understand that everyone has bad days. But with her, all the days became bad, just awful, and hanging out with her became emotionally draining.

On some occasions, I left class and rushed over to her apartment because she would text me that she's really upset. When I'd get there, she'd scream at me for being ""a perfect selfish c\*nt, go back to your perfect little class, nobody cares about me"" then apologize the next day, then do nothing to fix her behaviour and the cycle would repeat again.

The final straw came this spring. I got into my dream grad program at an extremely high-ranked, competitive university in Europe. She got rejected from the only grad program that she applied to. I was now not allowed to talk about how excited I am or how I'm preparing to move to Europe at all; every single conversation was dominated by her ""not going anywhere in life, giving up on her career, grieving her dreams, being a complete failure"". It was exhausting. And then, all of a sudden, my friend and colleague passed away. I was devastated, and all my friends were there for me, except for her. She literally had the audacity to say ""well I'm sorry but you're going to be making so many new friends in Europe and I'm just going to be completely alone because I didn't get into grad school and I'm a loser...""

Anyhow, everyone in our friend group started dropping her like flies. I tried to distance myself without confrontation; I've tried to confront her about this in the past, and it always comes down to her screaming ""well I'm sorry my mental illness is such a burden to your perfect little life. She's been messaging me a lot and asking to skype and I've either been not responding or making an excuse that I'm busy or whatever. I think she finally caught on to what's going on because she sent me a long message saying how I'm an awful person for replacing her friendship with my new cooler European friends and how one day when I'm back home I'll come crawling back to her.

AITA for doing this? Should I have just confronted her and been honest that I need space from this behaviour? And, if I'm being honest, in spite of everything I still kind of feel bad for ditching her when she's so down. So reddit, AITA?",73,327,0.95
631,No A-holes here,"This is a hot topic in my family at the moment, 

I live on an obscure little island near the UK. we have a local quiz show that’s aired on the telly that I appeared on a few years ago. 

The premise of the show is that you can win prizes for doing challenges. Some of the challenges were physical, some psychological, and some requiring problem solving skills. I sailed through a lot of the physical part because I wasn’t a fat bastard back then, and the problem solving skills required a lot of maths which is my career, so I was ok there.

As for the psychological part, you had to enter a clear box ‘room’ filled with something you’re terrified of, and search through to find clues to the next part. 

I thought of a believable lie before I entered the show (we had to list 5 things we were afraid of) and I put down all the things I’m *not* scared of. I listed spiders, cockroaches, snakes, scorpions, and wood lice. I literally couldn’t care less about any of these creatures. I grew up in rural landscape and I’ve had to pretty much deal with creepy crawlies my entire life so it’s not an issue. My actual fear is a bit more obscure and I really honestly knew I’d fail if I was put in a room with it. 

When I entered the room there were cockroaches *everywhere* I was in my boxers and barefoot (which was incredibly gross I can’t lie) and had to sift through and move the cockroaches to find clues for my next challenge.

I did it in the time period ascribed to me and got through to the next part. The rest of the contestants failed.

Now, I won a pretty average car which I didn’t particularly want, so as soon as I legally could I sold it and made a nice profit since it was pretty much brand new and bought myself a rather nicer car.

I told my family this recently on a drunken night when we were all at a get together, and although everybody found it uproariously funny, my family are split into 2 camps- some people think I cheated and was ethically and morally wrong, and other people think the other contestants deserved to lose if they listed their *actual* fears.

I’m obviously in the latter category, but genuinely wondering what others think.",2339,29408,0.93

634,Not the A-hole,"tl;dr \[M\]y son's mother (EXW) asked to meet me for thirty minutes in a public place. I accepted, current wife is very upset, feels isolated.

I've been divorced for three years now. My son is almost 7. I share joint custody. I remarried last year. Been married to the second wife for about 18 months. Ex-wife also remarried about 10 months ago. My son is a happy guy, we have an amicable co-parenting arrangement. Were all Americans except for my wife. She's Latina with old-world customs. I'm sure those old-world values and customs heavily influence the situation here.

About 2 years ago the ex showed ill will and threatened to move my son 1,000 miles away. We went to mediation and hashed out a 50/50 visitation schedule, agreed on a private school, CS, tuition payments, all that. It was very stressful, as these things are, and she ended up with a very generous arrangement. Following these events, I moved from the small town where we divorced to a larger metropolitan area, 40 minutes away (about 35 mi).

My wife is very hostile toward the ex. When we all see each other, we're peaceable, but after we exchange our son to her custody my wife will tell me how long it took to exchange him (5 - 10 minutes) and how can I act so friendly, and basically show her frustration at being in her presence. There is good reason for this. And this is what I'm most ashamed of. When I first started dating my current wife, the ex and I were still having random intercourse. We stopped having intercourse about a month into my relationship with my current wife, but in a power play, the ex told her in an attempt to end the relationship. (I was an asshole in that situation, I know that). Nonetheless, we worked it out. After some therapy, my GF became my wife. But (understandably) my wife still holds animosity.

However, the animosity can make it difficult for me to co-parent. The four of us are in a group chat, and 90% of our communications happen in that chat. However, there are some things the ex and I will discuss privately. Usually CS. In this case, the ex recently asked to change the visitation schedule. By law, it can be changed since the arrangement has stood 2 years, but I told her I'm happy with the arrangement and am not actively thinking of ways to change the schedule.

A few days ago she asked if we can meet for 30 minutes at a public place. I agreed, thinking that it's better to meet in person and let whatever needs to be said get said. Better than stonewalling or ignoring her until she feels her only recourse is to get a lawyer.

My current wife is very upset about this, to the point that we slept in separate beds last night. Current wife tells me that meeting ex is like saying that she's not a mother to my son, nothing more than a babysitter. I think that's a bit extreme, and yet, if I don't comply we're going to be fighting, and I feel that if I don't let the ex speak her piece then I'll be in a protracted fight with her.

Me (23f) and my aunt work in the same office. This morning she came over to me and said “since you’re earning a full time wage, are you doing Christmas presents this year?” and hands me over her 2 kids Christmas lists. I said no and she almost seemed shocked. She asked why and I said “the day they get me a present, maybe I will”. she scoffed, said they weren’t earning (1 of them works part time - this doesn’t mean I expect anything from them, just making a point) and called me a cheapskate for not getting them gifts, loud enough for the rest of our office to hear. 

This has pissed me off for several reasons. Firstly, she is working full time, and has never bought my mum (her sister) or her brother Christmas gifts. I think siblings come before cousins so if they don’t do it, I don’t know why I’m expected to? Secondly, I’m young so I’m saving - I get less than £10 an hour so it’s not like I’m loaded either. Thirdly, not so much about the fact that she called me cheap, I don’t care it saving my money for my future makes me look cheap, but that she did it loud for others to hear to make me look like a dick. Finally, I give my cousins a lot of my hand-me-downs, including new makeup that I don’t want, so it’s not like I never give them anything.

We only have one TV. We live in a small two bedroom and don't really need another. The only thing the kids do is watch TV, they don't play with toys much and we have a lot here for them to play with. 

Everyday when I get home they are watching TV, so I haven't gotten to watch TV in 2 months. Sometimes when they start playing with toys I would change the cartoons to something I would want to watch. Of course they would start crying and my husband would turn the cartoons back on.

She was such a huge burden. She constantly faked illnesses for attention. She constantly over exaggerated her ailments and was very extremely needy.

She would make you feel guilty and like a horrible person if you couldn’t help her with something as simple as bringing something to her room at the very moment she asks for it. 

I felt like her personal fucking nurse and she wasn’t even sick.

Back when we used house phones, she’d listen in on our conversations. Like I’d be on the phone with one of my friends and realize she was listening..

She would pray out loud for God to curse us (me, mom, and siblings). She would just manipulate us so badly to get what she wanted. She would call my moms friends and twist stories to make it seem like my mom is a bad person that wants her to suffer. 

She has like 7 children in the US and none of them have ever let her stay with them because of her ways. Only my mom has. 

I honestly can’t think of one good memory of my grandmother.

Now she’s actually sick forreal and wants to come stay with us. She needs the healthcare because it’s better hear and her condition can be fatal. I’m not going to tell my mom about how I feel because that’s literally her mom.

I just feel like a bad person for not wanting her to stay here.

EDIT: She’s actually been diagnosed by a doctor, so it’s actually real this time. As much as I don’t want to believe it.. it’s true.",24,35,0.89
650,Not the A-hole,"So at university in our halls of residence we have 6 rooms with en-suites and then a kitchen which is shared by all 6 of the rooms. In the kitchen we have one fridge and two freezers. There is 3 draws/shelves in each of the freezers and we’ve adopted a loose ‘one freezer drawer each’ policy. We don’t stick to it religiously it’s just a within reason type of thing. 

So I moved quite far from university because I wanted to be away from home. None of my secondary school friends or friends from home came with me. One of my dorm mates is the exact opposite, it seems that everyone she knows came to this university and she’s not made much effort to be social with our dorm since she’s got her own friends already including her boyfriend - not a problem. 

So flash to the incident. I come home from a trip to the supermarket and bring back a bunch of frozen stuff with me, nothing that would take up more than a shelf. When I go to the freezer I normally use there is a huge Tupperware container on the shelf I normally use with one portion of left over chilli in it. Now this Tupperware box could have easily fit 12 portions of chilli in it, but there was only one portion in there. 

I checked the other freezers and the other shelves to make sure there was no space and then I knocked on her door to see if she was in but I got no answer. Now I had about $30 worth of frozen stuff to put away as I only shopped for frozen stuff fortnightly so I could get a taxi back instead of waiting for a bus. So the only logical thing was to remove the obscenely large Tupperware box, which I did. 

I put it on the shelf with some of my smaller boxes and left a note, since she’d not given any of us a phone number, saying. ‘If you need smaller boxes let me know, happy to lend if you need. If it spoils let me know.’ Then I put my stuff away and left it at that. 

The next day someone knocks on my door and it’s her boyfriend. He says something along the lines of. ‘Don’t touch my girlfriends food’ and tries to give off an intimidating aura. I essentially cut to the chase and tell him that if there is a problem she needs to come speak to me, and that she needs to not take obnoxious amounts of valuable space and then politely tell him to get fucked. 

She hasn’t spoken to me about it again.

653,Not the A-hole,"Edit #2: thanks everyone for your comments, issue resolved by some car swapping so I only have to do one trip not both. Everyone happy, no arguments and kids none the wiser. Just wanted to be sure I wasn't overreacting. Thanks for the support!

Edit: sorry did not mean for this to be so long!

Background: Stepdaughter (SD) is 5. My husband and I have 1 and 2 year old boys together. Not much drama in the whole blended family situation now. I leave parenting of my SD to them but look after her about 40% of the time because I'm home with the boys and everyone else is at work. When not being cared for by me my SD is cared for by a nanny at her Mums house. I get along fine with my husbands ex wife and actively avoid any drama because it's about the kids and not our shit.

We've always had SD Wednesday arvo/night and return Thursday morning. I always used to do the pick ups and drop offs because I was working at home so didn't mind the hour round trip myself. Then I was doing it with a newborn, then pregnant with a baby in tow, then with a newborn and toddler. I got to the point I couldn't hack it and told my husband he would have to work something out or quit the Wednesday night visits because the trip with 2 kids in Sydney traffic was killing us. Many times over these years the Nanny would show up half an hour late with a ""oh sorryyyy"".

Husband arranged to work from home Wednesdays and started doing the pick ups and drop offs himself. Now he has a new job, no work from home Wednesday. I agreed to take on the Wednesday/Thursday pickups again as it'll only be until the end of the year...on the understanding that I'm the only one who can do it. Parents at work and Nanny doesn't have a car.

Yesterday was the first Wednesday. I get there to pick her up, with both my kids in tow to find both the Nanny and SD's mother home with her. I collect her, stay chat for 10, the boys have a run around. Slightly annoyed because either her Mother or THE PAID NANNY could have got in the car and driven her to our place much easier than me towing two toddlers in 30 degrees. Anyway, just dismiss it and carry on. 

This morning I get a message, can I get her home by 9am (sure I'll drive in peak hour, fun!) because the mother has organized a playdate with this social media fashion influencer a**hole who she thinks will increase her social value. I get there at 10 because 3 kids, peak hour and fuck them. Then find the Nanny and mother BOTH HOME AGAIN DOING SHIT ALL. 

They have a car, two adults and no other kids yet they let me drive an hour two days in a row with two toddlers to pick up the 5 year old they're supposed to have shared care for.

I told my husband I'm sick of being played for a fool and picking up everyone's slack. She is also engaged and her partner has NEVER helped with getting SD around.

I've always helped out where I can because I love my SD and my boys adore her and I do it for my husband and our family....but I feel like I'm being taken advantage of. Am I the asshole?",23,94,0.93
654,Not the A-hole,"(Disclaimer: this is a long, detailed filled situation that I can’t fully type out here. If more info is needed for judgement, I will be happy to provide it)

I (32f) and my long term partner (36m) have been together for around 7 years. We BOTH have friends of the opposite sex. It’s never been an issue... except for one.  

She and my partner have been friends since college and she has always had a “thing” for him. Until recently it’s never really played out. However, for some reason lately she has been really aggressive in her pursuit of my significant other. She has been critical of our relationship and myself, has tried to convince him to cheat on me, and when he said he would not cheat on me, she became verbally abusive towards him as well as me. 

They haven’t seen each other in probably 4-5 years, so this all is going down via text message. After the last tirade, she went silent for a few months. He and I talked about her behavior and agreed that she was out of line. However, earlier tonight her name popped up on his phone notification screen.  I don’t snoop. The text tone went off and I saw her name when I glanced over. 

I know if I ask him he will be honest and tell me what she said. He always has been.  My problem is that I don’t forget and forgive as easily.  I’m thinking about asking him to end the friendship, something I would never think to do prior to this situation. Which makes me think that I might be the future asshole...

Edit: I forgot to mention, she recently lost a sibling. And while the pursuit was there, it was after the death that she became VERY aggressive about it. It’s part of the reason I think my partner doesn’t just cut her out completely.",37,72,0.9

657,Not the A-hole,"On mobile. Tl;dr at the bottom.

I shared an apartment with 5 other people who had 3 cats and a dog between them. When we signed the lease together, they chose not to pay the pet deposit and instead said they would just hide the pets. 

This went ok, but now that we’re moving out, the evidence of the pets is pretty undeniable. The place reeks and there’s stains everywhere. 

The landlord is charging us a hefty sum for cleaning the pet residue specifically and my roommates said we could split it between all of us. I flatly refused, my argument being that they’re not my pets and I had no say in having them around or paying the pet deposit. They argue I should pay because I “enjoyed having them around,” which is technically true but not a good argument, in my opinion. 

EDIT: I just wanted to include that my roommates are all nice people with whom I generally get along. Our problems are really just this one issue, which is minor. I've lived with some weirdos and these ain't them.

So, my girlfriend and I lately haven't been able to spend much time together. Last Thursday, my girlfriend asked if she could come to my apartment and we could just chill and hang out. It was really late and I had work in the morning, so I told her no, but promised her Friday. Well, an unexpected family event came up and I had to postpone hanging out with her until Sunday night. 

Sunday night comes up and she comes over. We eat dinner together, then I'm really tired and to try and stay up longer to be with her, I decide to play some video games to help me stay awake. Apparently it didn't help, because I started to get really tired really quick. I told her I was gonna go sleep which set her off and she got mad and said she doesn't understand why she came over if all she was gonna do was watch me play video games. 

I understand this was probably a dumbass moment and I truly didn't realize it at the time, but I wanted to stay awake and resolve the issue with her so I kept playing my video games as we were arguing and she got mad because now I was distracted and it was this whole big mess. Needless to say, she didn't spend the night and has been pretty cold through texts recently.

659,Not the A-hole,"I work for my county in Animal Control and part of my duties, unfortunately, is picking up stray animals. This is heartbreaking work but the alternative is an animal starving or getting hurt or sick. Not to mention becoming danger or feral and hurting someone. We aren't a kill shelter, healthy animals go to the pet foster and sick animals that can be saved go to Habitat for Humanity's animal shelter. Terminal or dangerous animals are put down.

A couple weeks ago we got several calls about some stray cats in this one neighborhood getting into yards, tearing up the garbage, fighting with each other and other animals, making cat noises all night, that ""oh no no no no"" noise fighting cats make.

I went and scoped it out, tagged a few for pick up, interviewed the complaining callers who identified the cats. Then it was time to take them. The cats in question are a youthful female tabby who is declawed leading me to believe she was dumped. The other is an older Tuxedo who is mostly domesticated but still has claws and fighting spirit. However,  other were quite affectionate and the Tuxedo cat was especially vocal.

 As I was caging them up for the truck two little girls came running out of their house crying and screaming, said I had their cats. These cats were dirty and smelly and it was obvious they were strays. However these little girls have probably been feeding them and therefore think they're their cats. The mother came out and asked me to let the cats go. I asked her for documentation that they owned the cats and she admitted to me that the cats were strays but the girls loved them.

I can't just let wild animals go once I tag and catch them. It's against the rules and i could be sued if someone gets hurt or sick and we had report. I told them I was sorry but the cats had to go with me. The mom offered to pay for them but we dont allow that. I told her to call up to Animal Control in a few days and maybe they'd be adoptable.

As I walked away those two girls were hopelessly upset. The neighbors had come out when they heard screaming and they all looked at me like I was evil.

AITA for just doing my job?

There are 2 bathrooms in our apartment, so 2 people share one and 3 share the other. I share my bathroom with my best friend and a new girl that we didn't know prior to moving in.

I made an effort to buy cleaning supplies and make it comfortable despite being shared by 3 people. Unfortunately, it is now being shared by 4 people. This new girl, I'll call her Jane for the sake of anonymity, has a ""boyfriend"". I use the term boyfriend loosely because I don't know if they are dating and we have never been really introduced. That's beside the point. Her boyfriend, we will call him Joe, has been coming over more and more frequently. Joe stays over on average 5 nights a week, and I now feel like I have an additional roommate. His shower supplies like razors and shampoo have slowly made their way into the shower, and I have good reason to believe he is using my soap. He leaves the toilet seat up, and at times there is pee on the seat itself. I've even had times where I am showering or brushing my teeth and he knocks on the door because he needs to use the bathroom.

I don't think I should have to change the way I live because I am paying rent and he is not. The question is, WIBTA if I told her I didn't want him using our bathroom or staying over as much? Sharing with people who actually pay rent is hard enough, and now I feel like I am sharing a bathroom with an additional person. All comments are welcome!

663,Asshole," So little backstory, I (21F) am a Midwestern transplant to the deep south of Georgia. Now I'm not of the the midwestern vein that inherited Canadian niceness, but rather the NYC-meets-Redneck region where quite frankly, no one gives a shit. As such, I am quite blunt and VERY different from the southern women around here. I try not to be rude, but it comes out that way from time to time when I dont say it with a smile, because I have no need to do so at the time. But I've developed some skills to fit in a little better and can usually slap a 'I'm-not-mad-but-fix-it' grin on when I need to.

I'm in a restaurant with my friend, who consistently makes jokes that I'm Karen. So at said restaurant, we're having lunch and it is a SLOOOOW day for this place. Now I normally have absolutely zero issue with food coming out slow, it happens, I get it. But being one of 4 tables on an uncharacteristically slow day with a full staff, I shouldn't expect to wait 45 minutes for two sandwiches that seemed like they'd been done for quite some time. The food was cold, soggy, unseasoned, and their new portion control ideas were taken WAY too far. I realize that the staff working flat doesn't care to do things right that day and don't even bother sending it back because there would be no point; I want to pay for my food that I've pushed away and go.

Waitress returns and asks ""Everything tasting good?"" To which I reply with aforementioned grin, ""No it really kind of sucked, can I just get the check?"" because she ASKED. She got a little flustered and went to go get the manager, to my protest because I really didn't care, it was one meal and I still got to hang out with my friend, who is embarrassed on the other side of the table because I seem to have his offended his polite sensibilities.

Waitress and Manager return, he asks what the problem was, and I tell him all the things I mentioned because, again, HE ASKED. I wasn't angry, I never raised my voice, I never cursed, I just didn't apologize for not liking the food, which here is customary. He rolled his eyes so far back into his head I'm pretty convinced he saw the secret to life, and told me they could comp it if I wanted. I said no because the food is usually decent and didn't want to be hated, and my friend asked ""Then why make a fuss?"" BECAUSE THEY ASKED! And still every time we go somewhere he asks me not to be Karen.

Mind you there have been other instances of such thing happening in different contexts. One such brief example is when I made a guy step away from his own birthday party because his car was blocking me in and I wanted to go home. Did my grin but didn't apologize for making him step away because it's not my fault he parks like shit. Friend didn't like that one either and he thought it was important to mention this event to provide context of my ""karenness""

665,Not the A-hole,"I (19f) have been dating my boyfriend (23m) for about a year and a half.

We are LDR, but he has visited me previously and my family does like him and know him. My mom actually really does like him, and was excited to have him stay at our house for his next visit. 

However, she made one rule: He sleeps in the basement and I will go upstairs to sleep in my room when it’s time for bed. Her reasoning is she doesn’t want us doing anything “inappropriate” and “knows what we will do” and that it’s “disrespectful” and “disgusting” to do while they’re in the same house. 

I was really annoyed by this because I never see him, and this visit is only 4 days. I don’t want to be apart an entire night, and do the routine of calling him on my phone and facetiming to sleep like I do when he is away, but now having to while he is IN MY BASEMENT. 
It isn’t even just about sex, I just want to be next to him at night. We are about 1000 miles apart. I want to use all the time we have together.

So we recently got a hotel for his visit since that rule isn’t realistic. I will respect her house rules, and go somewhere else. She is pissed about it and was pretty excited for him to stay at the house and really likes having him around. She is saying “I just dont understand because you wanted to save money for your visit!” Which we did, but being apart every night isn’t super realistic for us so it was worth spending the money.

I’m sort of pissed about it though, because it just doesn’t seem super reasonable or logical at all. Also I’m a little annoyed I have to buy a hotel over this, but it is worth it to me anyway. 
And I’m also pissed she’s being annoying about us getting one when there wasn’t much of an option here. She did give us the okay originally and said we can do that instead. But after thinking about it, and deciding the rule wasn’t doable, we actually did end up getting a hotel and she’s annoyed. 

She’s also annoyed because I have a brother who’s a decade younger than me (who’s 9) and she says “you guys cant just ignore him and not include him and hang out with him! Your brother likes your boyfriend too” (he does in like an older brother way I guess) and always wants us to plan stuff with him and hang out with him at the house, and is angry we won’t include him in things and is angry he wont be at the house so we can’t include him in as much now. But like, it’s my boyfriend! So I don’t even know what that is about?! 

Also I REPEAT: I did end up getting a hotel because I WILL respect her rules, I however do find them annoying, but she is pissed we did even though she was fine with it till we actually did. Which also sort of pisses me off.

Also another detail: We DID agree to not do a hotel the entire time, and we will stay at my house for the first night and be okay with her rules, then go to a hotel the rest of his stay. Because she was excited about him staying. But after that we have a hotel because I don’t think its super realistic to separate every night his entire visit and spend a whole night away from him.

However, 2 days ago I opened her school.bag and the ENTIRE thing was filled with moldy food stuffs. And in the middle of this was her PE shirt.  It had been sitting there for 3 weeks. I brought the bag to her attention and told her to take the stuff out of it and clean it immediately. She used the excuse of mum putting stuff in my bag that Idont want (but she still leave it in there?) I had to leave for 5 mins to grab something from the store. When I came back she was playing a video game and the bag was still full and sitting by the bin. I asked why she hadn't cleaned it.

Turns out while I was gone she had gone crying to her dad that she was going to be in trouble and get yelled at (by me, her dad and her mum. Though I won't have yelled I just would have very sternly talked to her.) So her dad was going to clean and empty her bag. 

All because she cried. She uses crying to get put of doing things when she's with her dad all the time. She broke her phone a month ago by dropping it and got a new one immediately and didn't get punished because she cried. 

My bf is now trying to get me to buy her a new bag so she won't be embarrassed or yelled at by her mum. He also wants me to try and get the exact same bag so no one will notice.

667,No A-holes here,"My wife and I moved in to a new house earlier this year.  Without fail, ever since we moved in, a driver for one of those food delivery apps has shown up to our house every few weeks with a delivery that we did not place.

The first few times, I didn't pay it much mind and just assumed it was a mistaken address.  I'd turn the driver away without asking for details about why they showed up.  The next time, though, I asked them to confirm what address they were meant to deliver to, as it just seemed weird that it continued to happen.  They read me my exact address.

It continued to happen this way; our exact address on the ticket.  Sometimes I'd mention to the driver that this was happening.  They rarely seemed to give a shit.  Contacting the company amounted to nothing; they can't weed out orders mistakenly sent to the wrong address.

I looked in to possible mistaken address issues.  I don't even have an account with this app.  But according to Google maps, there is only one other address near us with the same house number as ours, but the street name is very different.  There is a street with a similar name, but all the house numbers are different; not even the same number of digits as our streets' houses.  

So anyways, it happened again tonight.  Lady showed up with a gigantic bag of food around 8.  I hadn't eaten all day, had a shit day at work, the kids were driving me up a wall, and it was very difficult to tell that lady to walk away.

To give a little back history... he makes full time wages, for working 5 to 6 hours per day, takes frequent days off for personal reasons, has a discounted rent on the suite, and though he was supposed to ( in lieu of full rent) , rarely helps us with anything that he isn’t paid to do.  3 days before he called in sick, he cost us $1800 and we are just a small family run business.

I congratulated him, and now, a few days later, he texted me and asked if I could run the social media arm of his campaign, for free.

My dad generally defaults to me for anything technology related, and generally doesn't understand the amount of effort that goes into what I do.  As of right now, I am running my own social media campaign to promote a project I'm working on, as well as working on that project, as well as a full time job.  I told him that I was probably too busy to run his accounts, but I would help him set up a website and the related accounts, share my notes, as well as do a little research to help find the best way to reach his base.  He seemed a little disappointed that I wouldn't be taking a more active role in the campaign.

The other reason I don't want to help is that I probably would not be voting for him.  I'm not registered as a voter in his state, and he is running for a different party that the one I support and vote for.  While I have no doubt that he'd make a fine candidate, I have pretty much committed to the party I'm currently aligned with, so even if I could vote for him I likely would not.

She made a big fuss about stopping and then lied about staying in the same hotel room as him for a con after that :/ So I don't know what good reading her texts with him is going to do if they continue staying in hotel rooms together.**

**I guess this thread has made me realize that with my history of being cheated on and her and her ex being disrespectful of our relationship, this problem is less about the romance novels and more about the fact that she isn't respecting our relationship, and if she's not willing to set harder boundaries with her ex this isn't going to work out.**

------------------------------------------------------------------

So I’ve always known my girlfriend likes romance novels, it’s her guilty pleasure and that doesn’t bother me. She is often on her kindle while I’m playing video games or right before she sleeps. One of the things we bonded over at first was our love of books so I like that she reads.

I prefer paper books but occasionally I’ll borrow her kindle to read some ebook I’ve gotten. I did this recently and was flipping through the titles when I saw some weird book that piqued my interest so I started skimming it.

Imagine my surprise when I discovered that not only is it gay romance, like between gay men, but also that the men get pregnant. I wasn’t sure what I was reading at first and thought I misunderstood but then I looked up the author on my phone and indeed the entire thing seems to be books about men getting pregnant.

I understand romance books have appeal to women, and I can see why, but this THIS.... now to be clear, I am not homophobic at all, but to find that your girlfriend reads gay romance where the men get pregnant is a little disturbing. Even the gay aspect didn’t freak me out too much, but it was when I realized these books were all about men getting pregnant that I really started to freak out. The kicker is that the guys are werewolves which is even weirder and concerning because...

She has an ex who was a furry and I always laughed at what a weirdo her ex was, but now I’m wracked with insecurity that maybe there’s more to her than I thought. They’re still in the same friend group and they don’t hang out one on one but they do talk sometimes. I’m not a jealous guy (and come on the guy’s a furry) so I never minded but now I’m wondering.

So I talked to her about this and was like… “What’s up with these gay wolf pregnancy books?” And she immediately got defensive. I told her that I was just wondering if there was maybe something she wasn’t telling me. I ended up bringing up the ex which wasn’t the best idea but I was feeling insecure.

She thinks I’m just being pretentious and looking down on her for reading romance, and even accused me of being homophobic, but there’s so much more that I’m concerned about here. I told her specifically that I was concerned that she was still into her ex but she told me there’s nothing to worry about and offered to show me her texts.

Am I the asshole in this situation? She said I was being paranoid but I dunno, this shit is just too weird. I explored the books more and I just can’t wrap my head around her being into this.

TL;DR: Am I the asshole for freaking out at my gf over her being into really weird gay romance novels where the dudes get pregnant?",226,180,0.86
671,Not the A-hole,"This might sound kind of dumb. My (25F) SO (28M) and I use a petsitter (34F) for our dog because we both work crazy hours. She has been mostly reliable and charges me a really good price, and she’s pretty directly on the way to most of the medical offices I work at so it’s really convenient. At first there were no problems, but then things went downhill.

She started asking me for $$ upfront; for example, I’d ask her on Sun if the dog could come Weds - Fri, she’d say yes and then text me on Mon asking for the $$. Which is whatever, it bothered me a little bit (mostly because I’ve never not paid her, and when we first started using her she just told me to keep a tally of the days he was there and pay her once a month) but she also always has a sob story as to why she needs it. Her cat is really sick and needs to go to the vet, so and so didn’t pay her, etc. Most recently she told me she totaled her car and her wallet was lost in the crash so she needed to get cash out while waiting for her new debit card to get mailed.

She asked me for $$ last weekend. Not for the dog, just to borrow $$ to see her doctor on Saturday afternoon. I wasn’t by my phone and didn’t respond so she texted me and said someone else was lending it to her but thanks anyway. She then hinted at asking me to get her a prescription for Xanax from one of the doctors I work for. She also frequently tells me her personal problems.

My SO wants us to find someone else. I feel bad because she clearly is desperate and struggling and she is great with our dog and doesn’t charge us much, but the money thing is making me really uncomfortable.

672,Not the A-hole,"This is one of those situations where I didn’t think I did anything wrong but it has my friends group pretty divided. 


2 weeks ago I matched with a man on tinder, we messaged back and forth and eventually exchanged numbers. He then asked if he could take me out on a date, I said yes and we established a day that would work best for both of us. He never brought up a specific time or place but I assumed those details would come closer to the date and since he asked me out I thought he would be the one to make the specific plans. Let me add I don’t expect anything extravagant for a first date but every date I’ve ever been on the person who asked for the date has usually planned the date or at least made suggestions for the time and place. I’ve asked a few people on dates and been the one to plan the time and place. 
 
We talk every day leading up to the day of the date. The day before we’re supposed to meet he texts me to ask how my day is going , I respond and ask him about his day. He never replies. The day of the date I hear nothing from him. Around 8pm my friend asked me to go have dinner with her so I do. I eventually here from this guy at 9:40pm asking if we’re still on. I told him no and I was busy now since I hadn’t heard from him since yesterday and we had never established a time and place. He was pissed. 

Now I might be the asshole for assuming instead of confirming , I could’ve texted him the day of and confirmed but since he had not replied to my previous text I figured he was busy or uninterested. This topic came up at a get together and my male friends seem to think I’m the asshole because I could’ve texted him earlier in the day and tried to confirm our date, a few of them had made comments that this is why dating is hard for men. My female friends think I’m justified because 9:40pm is too late to confirm a date the day of and I agree. I should add everyone involved in this story is in their late 20s.",397,1521,0.97

674,Asshole,"Throwaway because my gf follows me on Reddit...hopefully she doesn’t read this sub as much as she used to

My girlfriend (26f) and I (28m) have been dating for three years. We currently live in the same city as each other but not together. (EDIT: We are planning to move in together when our leases end in a few months.) Our “norm” is to sleep together at one of our houses every night. In general, we alternate. However, there are some nights when I really don’t feel like staying at her house. There’s nothing wrong with her house, I just sometimes want to sleep in my own bed even though it’s “her” night. Sometimes she’ll offer to come stay at my house, but I never pressure her to. Sometimes we end up staying apart on these nights. 

The other day she said that she didn’t think it’s fair how often I “opt out” of nights at her house. I pointed out that I never make her stay at my house on nights that aren’t my nights (or nights that are my nights for that matter), but that I think I have a right to stay where I please on a night to night basis. To be clear, I would be fine if my girlfriend also decided she wanted to stay at her place on “my night,” but she never suggests this and always stays at my place no problem. I would say we end up staying at my place about 75% of the time.

I don’t want to be TA but I also think I should get to pick where I sleep. AITA?

Edit: I accept my judgement on this one. I talked to her and told her that Reddit thinks she should dump me. I apologized and asked if we could work something else out. We decided I can still opt to stay at my house when I’ve had a particularly long or tough day, but I make it up to her within a week or so by having an extra night at her house. I think this seems fair, and honestly will disincentivize me to opt out of her nights. I also apologized for being an asshole.

675,Not the A-hole,"I know the title sounds kind of weird but basically this incident happened a little bit ago, but I’m wondering if I would be the asshole if I were to break off this friendship due to this situation

My friend, who I will call Pepper, invited all to come watch a Generic Awards Show (I honestly can’t remember which one) over at her place. My roommate and I decide to come over and hang out with her and other friends she invited. 
The group consisted of 6 people (including me, Pepper and my roommate). I am good friends with basically everyone who was there, so when one person brought a half dozen of doughnuts I assumed that I could take one since there was seemingly one per person.

However this incident unfolded:
Me and roommate: *both about to grab one doughnut  each”
Pepper: “Woah...why do you think you guys can get a doughnut?”
Me and roommate: *both laugh a little, assuming she’s joking*
Pepper: “No seriously? What makes you think you deserve a doughnut?”
*Me and roommate kind of looked at each other in shock, not really understanding if she’s joking or not*
Me: Well there’s half a dozen and there’s exactly 6 people here so I kind of assumed
Pepper: Well you guys don’t get any, me and *other friend* wanted 2
We all kind of awkwardly just continued watching the awards show and nobody really said anything back to her (probably because we wouldn’t want to make a big deal out of it)
I honestly didn’t know what to say because whenever we all hung out sharing food didn’t seem like a big deal ever, and she wasn’t even the person to pay.
Ever since this happened I’ve been noticing that she kind of treats people very selfishly and if it’s not her way then we have to compromise (but only for her, not anybody else from our friend group). I have known Pepper for about 10 years now but I’ve been beginning to see her in a new light. I would try and talk to her about these underlying issues but she usually gets very defensive & sensitive about stuff like this and would probably think I’m attacking her. However this behavior has been making me and others in the group kind  of feel like garage or as if our opinions are “less than” her’s.

676,Everyone Sucks,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 11 months, and my parents are coming to town this weekend (staying nearby). They haven’t met yet. My mom and dad are so excited to meet him and he claims the feeling is mutual. I am VERY integrated into his family, I’m basically the daughter they never had, so we have a strong tie to his family.
My boyfriend has known they’re coming to town for at least a month, but has continuously tried to make other plans for this particular weekend, including plans to head away. Whenever I remind him that this is in fact the weekend that my parents are in town he says “oh, I forgot”. I understand forgetting once or twice but consistently just feels rude. I told him 3 days ago when he tried to make plans with me to go away for the weekend that mom and dad were going to be in town, and then last night he attempted again to make plans. He is usually really on top of these things and puts everything into his calendar, so it seems out of character for him to forget THIS much. I told him I felt sad that he kept forgetting and he said he was sorry and put it in his diary. He said he can be self centred and that because we had no solid plans yet with them (other than hanging out and seeing where the day took us) that it wasn’t at the forefront of his mind as he’s stressed with other work related things at the moment. I’m at the point where I don’t want him to come and i would prefer to spend the day with just my folks and I if it means that little to him to meet them. AITA if I suggest he not come? 

Side note- when I said I thought it was rude that he kept forgetting, he said that maybe my parents were the rude ones for not knowing what they wanted to do with us in stone. (He said this in jest, but it stung and was not a respectful way to approach things) Which is a huge factor in me not wanting him to hang out.",30,44,0.9

678,Not the A-hole,"So recently some of my friends and I \[16M\] decided to go out and see a movie on Saturday night and hang out, screw around, typical teenager-ish stuff. However, when discussing plans, this girl suggested that we invite this other kid (FB) that we were all mutually sort-of friends with. The group was pretty neutral about it since we're all paying for our own tickets anyways. 

However, I (and apparently, other members of our group) think that FB is absolutely embarrassing to be around in public. First off, he's gay. Like, very gay. Like, flamboyantly gay, to the point where you will take one look and make a decision. Hair is dyed Joker green, bright colors, the gayest ""gay accent"" you have ever heard, and (most disturbingly) air-humping random dudes. FB will literally walk up to random guys at school and say, ""Hey daddy, can I have your number?"" One time he walked up to this kid at lunch, who was sitting with his girlfriend, and said, ""I can fuck you better than she can.""

So you get the idea. And the thing is that FB can. not. stop doing this and it's becoming a) very annoying and b) very embarrassing as a group. We've got weird or disgusted stares from all sorts of people including mall workers, fast food workers, old Christian ladies, and a lesbian couple even walked up to us and told us to have a word with him about ""appropriate display of sexuality"" or to reduce his dosage of cocaine.

I was basically like, fuck it, I'm not dealing with FB's shit today, it's far too annoying, and I just wanted to chill with my friends, so I told them to not invite FB. The group, once again, couldn't care less.

However, now I feel really bad. I've basically excluded him for being gay and I know what it's like to be excluded for things you can't control. On the other hand, I feel like you *can* control yourself from going up and hitting on straight dudes.

I currently have a two year old daughter, Mia.  Me and the mom aren’t married but we share custody of Mia. 

When Mia was born, I was already halfway out the door of the gang and the birth of Mia gave me the push I needed. 

I moved away with Mia and her mom and we tried our best to start over. I love Mia with all my heart. She saved my life. 

I have a lot of gang related tattoos. And I do mean a lot. They are pretty prominently displayed on me and are noticeable. 

Mia’s mother has been after me to get rid of them or cover them up with other tattoos. The thing is, I don’t think I want to do that. 

It’s not that I’m proud of them, or like them, it’s that they remind me of how far I’ve come and I don’t want to forget it. I don’t want to forget what happened. I don’t think I should get to just forget it like that. 

I eventually broke down and told her this after she asked me again yesterday about it. She got super upset with me and said that I needed to do it for the “sake of our daughter” and that if I didn’t then that meant I missed “the life.” 

She also said that I was putting my daughter in danger because somebody could recognize my tattoos and cause trouble for me. 

I told her I haven’t been in that life for years and that it’s unfair for her to say that as she knows that I love Mia.

681,Asshole,"Sorry for any grammar mistakes, writing this while multi-tasking and in a rush.

Anyway, I've been contemplating this for a few months, and I just discovered this sub, which I think can help me settle this.

I'm 18M and a freshman in college. Back in May, I was graduating high school, and my school asked me to give a speech at graduation alongside the valedictorian. The basic idea was that I was the school's most improved student: as a freshman, I had a 1.3 gpa. As a senior, I had a 4.6, was a national-level athlete, and had gotten accepted to Stanford, which thankfully didn't count freshman year grades when calculating gpa. 

I was supposed to write a speech about how I improved myself and submit my speech to the principal, who would check it over and give me suggestions. When I turned it in, he told me I needed to talk more about people who helped me achieve success. I feel like he was trying to get me to make the school, or him personally, look good by having me credit them for my success. 

Anyways, I told him that nobody had really helped me succeed: not teachers, not a tutor, not my parents, not my friends, whatever. Whatever success I achieved came from my motivation and my discipline, since I didn't ask for help from said teachers or tutors. I just disciplined myself and worked my ass off. 

This pissed him off, and he told me my current speech wasn't suitable, and that I needed to revise it to make it better. I told him that if I changed it to say someone had helped me, I would be lying. He finally just forbade me from giving my speech because it 'would send a bad message against teamwork'. 

Was I in the wrong here? I don't think I am: I was asked to give a speech about how I succeeded, and I told the truth by stating that I did it without help.",168,70,0.62

I live in the same street than one of my aunts, she has a 9 years old boy. She is a single mother and she doesn't make a lot of money, so I know she doesn't have money to pay a babysitter. 

A month ago when I finished the courses for my degree and I started being home all day, she randomly showed at my door one day and asked me to babysit my cousin for a few hours (no payment of course, just a favor for my aunt). I assumed it was a one time thing, so I accepted. I'm good with kids and my cousin it's not the most restless kid out there.

The thing is, after that she started doing it really often (3-4 times a week), she'll just randomly drop my cousin at my door without any previous notice and expect me to babysit him for several hours, without any sort of payment.

When I told her I don't mind babysitting my cousin every once in a while, but 3-4 times a week it's way too often and that she also need to ask me before hand she cannot just drop him at my door, she started crying.

So a bit of a weird update since my wife actually saw this thread through her coworker. (e: to clarify, the coworker didn't know that it was about my wife, she was just sharing an interesting thread)

She texted me asking if I was looking to buy a new bed and I said yes without thinking much of it. She then linked me this thread and said we would talk later that night (not in a bad way).

We sat down and she apologized for calling me a baby and I apologized for starting a fight over something so small. 

She said that she really enjoys the pillow but we can get rid of it and sleep together instead. I told her this isn't necessary and that I would deal with it but she insisted. 

I've ordered her a new body pillow that just covers one side of her that she could put on the opposite side of me so hopefully everyone can be comfortable. 

Everything worked out and we have been sleeping together for the past couple weeks now. The new body pillow came in and is on the opposite side of her. She switches between me and the pillow every now and then and it's not a big deal. A lot more comfortable to sleep now too haha. 


Thanks to everyone who Pmed me giving me advice as well as those giving advice in the comments. 

I tried to emphasize this as much as I could in the comments but seriously my wife and I never fight and this was extremely out of the norm for us. 

Everything is good now though and we are going to start doing date nights again on Saturday and it's been going well. Feels more like our relationship when it was just starting out in the ""honey moon"" period kinda thing. 

But yeah, everything's fine now. To be honest it was always fine, this was just a minor thing that some how got blown out of proportion. I barely remember but I think we were both just stressed with work that day so we ended up getting into a silly fight. 

Seriously I love my wife so hopefully no judgement by you guys on the one comment she said back then. She's honestly a really good person!

I made an update thread a few weeks back but was a few days early for the minimum and someone commented on the old thread a few days ago so I remembered to repost the update thread today with a few more updates.

I’m a delivery driver for a small local company. Kinda like Uber eats but we’re only in this town. I was working a long shift last night, 3-10, and skipped out on dinner. No big deal, I was planning on pulling over at some point and grabbing some Wendy’s or something. Until I got one dreaded order.

It was an order for 200 wings from a local wing shop. $150ish total for their food. Now on my app I can see how much they paid, how far they live, and how much they tip. They were a 20 minute drive from the place, and they tipped me a wonderful $1. Now I get paid strictly on tips, and I get $3 an hour for gas. This delivery was gonna cost me money to do with how little of a tip they gave me.

Now I understand that happens sometimes with delivery jobs, I was upset but I was gonna let it pass, until the customer called me angry about how long it was taking for them to get their food. I was sitting in the restaurant waiting for the food to be cooked (200 wings mind you). He yelled at me and said he has guests over and they are all hungry, and that he wants me to hurry up or, and I quote, “I’ll call your boss and have him take your tip off my order”.

That’s where the bomb went off in my head. I got off the phone with him, and got his food. On my way to his house I decided that this dick head just paid for my dinner, so I ate a few wings (7-8ish) which nobody would notice from a total of 200. I’ve never done this before, but god did they taste even better than if I would have bought them myself.

Now here’s the fuck up. I get to his house, hand him the food, and he asks “did you eat some of my wings?!”. I told him no, but little did I know I had a fat hot sauce glob on my chin, and he claimed he smelled it on my breath. I sat there while getting yelled at and while he called my boss, and eventually my boss took $20 off of his total to make up for it.

Recently, B called me crying hysterically. She said she’s gotten in over her head with debt. I was honestly a little confused by this. B, despite being an adult and out of school for many years now, still lives with her parents. Which is fine. But I was naturally confused about why she had gained so much debt while not having to pay rent. I asked.

B said that she has “just been stupid” and not really paying attention to how much she’s spending, and now her credit score will be tanking as a result. She cried to me saying that her dad told her that she was being irresponsible, but he can’t possibly understand her position because he grew up wealthy and had a high paying job right out of school.

This is the point where I became the asshole (in her view anyways). B grew up in the household of a wealthy father, which I’m pretty sure makes her wealthy too. Her dad being retired and a roommate of hers, he even helps her with household chores which basically leaves her free to live her life however she wants. Rent free! 

I told her that he didn’t do anything wrong by telling her that she’s being irresponsible, and that she HAS been irresponsible and I really don’t want to hear her crying about it. She knows that I grew up in foster care and never had any financial resources, and I told her that she shouldn’t tell me something like this and expect me to be sympathetic. I said: “you even yourself said that you’ve just been stupid. Why am I a dick for saying yes, you have?”. It came off to me as very self indulgent and irritating. I told her she should respect her father and everything he’s given to her, and she doesn’t really have any right to be mad at him for giving her some tough love on this.

She told me I am “not a real friend” and I’m invalidating her feelings and hurting her mental health. I haven’t talked to her since.

689,No A-holes here,"This happened this time last year which is why I guess I’m thinking about it. 

When me and my then partner had been together a few months there was an accident with birth control, however neither of us thought anything would come of it (because I was younger and stupider) so there was no plan b or anything used afterwards. Then obviously I was three weeks late with my period and after putting it off I finally did a test to find out it was positive. 

I wanted to wait a week at the most before telling him because I needed time to figure out what I was going to do as I still lived at home, and worked at a pretty crappy fast food place, but I knew I wanted this baby. I also put off telling him when I found out because it was so early in the relationship that I didn’t know how he would react as we had never discussed the possibility of children.

About three days later I noticed some light spotting but wasn’t concerned as I knew this was common early in a pregnancy and I carried on as normal. It wasn’t until the night that I began to get sharp cramping and realised I was losing my baby as I was bleeding much heavier. 

Because we were working opposite shifts at the time (I was working 6am-3pm he was working 9pm-6am) I didn’t see him in person to tell him what had happened and it felt cruel to do it over a text or phone call so I simply grieved by myself because the longer I left it the more I felt like he didn’t need to know.

I recently spoke to two friends about it and it was the first time I’d ever told anyone what had happened and both of their reactions was to ask if my ex knew, and when I told them he didn’t they both gave me a look and asked why I’d never told him which made me feel pretty guilty, but obviously it’s too late to tell him now.",37,166,0.91

To clarify, my mother has a tattoo shop in the upstairs part of our house. She makes pretty decent money with her business and therefor can afford to go out with friends about three night a week mostly in the weekends. While she's either working or out I have to watch my brother often more than 6 hours per day. 

I don't get paid for it either except for an occasional 20 bucks every two weeks or so as ""pocket money"" i often spend well over 50 hours per two weeks watching him and I can't really use my days or weekends to spend outside because I need to be there. 

Now I don't care about watching him when she is working. I get that she is working for me as well. I do get annoyed when I want to go to my dad's place and three weekends in a row I can't cuz I she forgot I told her and now she already has plans.

But yesterday I did something pretty fucking stupid and she rightfully got super pissed. She then told me I wasn't allowed out of the house till the end of the year unless it was for school. Which is extra painfull because she knows I spent most of the holidays with friends. 

She basically blocked me from celebrating christmas, new years, Halloween and a few other things with my friends. 

I get that she's pissed but I think this is a bit extreme. She does however except me to take full care of my little brother when she's planning to go out this weekend again. I'm talking morning till late night. No pay. 

WIBTA if I refused?

Edit: I recently turned 18 and I'm in my exam year of highschool.

Update: I just had a chat with her where she in the same sentence mentioned that she does plan to enforce my punishment AND want me to watch the kid both tomorrow night and Friday as soon as I get back from school. 

I read some of the comments and I guess I have the upper hand in this situation, although I don't want to start a fight. I'll try and have a casual calm chat with her tomorrow at dinner.


Final update: 
So It took me a bit of time to collect the courage to do this shit. I finally opened my mouth and got about 4 sentences in before she started yelling that I was ""ungrateful and lazy"" I kept calm and told her I didn't agree with having to watch my baby brother so much. She said I was being hard for no reason as I would be home anyway and might aswell watch him. I got annoyed and said that that wasn't really the problem. She cut me off and told me that if I stopped babysitting I'd have to get a job. I told her that again, that wasn't the problem. The problem was that she treated me as a personal maid and babysitter and then had the nerve to ground me for over two months. She flared up and told me to get my own room if I was going to be this ungrateful about everything she does for me. I finally had it and told her that starting Monday I'd be living with my father. I'm shaking and honestly a bit in shock over how quickly she turned a normal conversation into an incident. I'm not sure what's going to happend but I'm sick of this shit. I love my brother, dogs and even my mother to death, but I'm done giving up my youth and getting spit in the face afterwards. Damn I'm pissed. Can't even have a civil ass chat with this woman.",91,147,0.94
691,No A-holes here,"So my wife of 5 years has two children (15 and 11) from a previous marriage.  We have custody since her ex in the military and isn’t always around, but when he is he gets the kids for the weekends or longer if they aren’t in school.  Their marriage ended on good terms and we are friendly with each other to the point we do holidays and birthdays together. 

Now yesterday was my birthday and my kids thought it would be a good idea to ask me if I would adopt them and they wanted to take my last name.  This was as big a surprise to my wife as it was to me.  I told them it’s extremely disrespectful to their dad considering he’s a good dad and is always around as long as his schedule allows it.  (I didn’t mention how I couldn’t legally adopt them even if I wanted to because their dad would never give up his parental rights). I told them I still consider them my kids and if he was a deadbeat dad that abandoned them I would adopt them in a heartbeat but this is the end of the discussion and not to bring it up in the future. 

They were obviously upset and accused me of not really loving them and not seeing them as my own children.  Once my wife got over the shock of them asking, she managed to calm them down and go to their rooms.  She didn’t take sides initially, but after they were asleep she told me that I was kinda rude to them and should’ve appreciated the gesture and let them down easier.  I was touched that they asked me to adopt them but I told her it would be worse if I pretended to think about it and then told them I wouldn’t adopt them.  

So AITA for immediately telling my stepchildren I wouldn’t adopt them?

Update: So last night my wife and I sat the kids down and told them how much I love them, but that legally I can’t adopt them because they already have a father who is involved in their lives who loves them just as much as we do.  We made it clear that he’s not an obstacle in the adoption process and to never bring it up with him because it would devastate him.  There is still a little bit of resentment towards their bio dad since their feelings aren’t going to change overnight, but they seem to understand that everyone has to make sacrifices when a parent is in the military and his absence doesn’t mean he loves them any less.",173,626,0.96

I switched shifts to accommodate ongoing medical appointments, from 9am to 530am.  When I started coming in early, I noticed that my coworkers would lounge around in the break room, sleep on the couch, or sleep in their car.  No work was being done between the hours of 05:30 and 07:30, though they were getting paid for that time.  It is not as if there wasn't anything to do, just that there was no direction or supervision.  Mind you, all of this behavior is on camera.  It bothers me when people are being paid the same as I am, and I am the only one working, while they relax.  

Edit\ 

This is par for the course here in California at this job, I will be working while they watch movies on their phones.  I never reported up the CoC for this as they were locatable.  The important part is that they are on the warehouse floor, only a shout away if shit goes sideways. 

When they are sleeping on the job, that is my limit of tolerance.  It creates a safety issue when I need help, if I can't find them.  Or I yell and no one comes, as was the case last year when the entire building almost went up in flames.  I got the fire out by the time my coworker came from wherever the hell he was.

One of the supervisors was actively participating in scamming the company, I went up the chain of command and reported the problem, but nothing was done, besides vaguely asking the workers to get off their phones.

Edit/

I told HR about the issue, and the early shift was removed and we switched back to the time clock.  Since then all my coworkers give me the silent treatment.  When I sit down in the break room for lunch, everyone gets up and leaves. They stare at me with a disgruntled look when I wish them good morning cheerfully every day. Yesterday, I think one of them yelled, ""Don't be a snitch.""",60,104,0.89
693,Not the A-hole,"So, my husband recently got a raise, and as a celebration we decided to get a new car to replace his 1998 Honda. It was expensive ($50,000), but we could afford it. We’ve had it for about a week.

So when my friends and I went out for dinner and drinks (not shitfaced drunk, we usually just have dinner and a couple glasses of wine), I said I could be the driver for the night so they could all see the car because they had been asking about it(it wasn’t a humble brag, before you go there, I brought it up once and they wanted to go for a test run).

One of my friends has always had a noticeably weak bladder, she always goes to the bathroom at least once per dinner, usually twice. She’s never said anything about it though, and I’ve known her for 5 years. 

So we all get in after dinner, and we’re driving along, and she starts yelling “pull over”. So I do, and she gets out, says she peed herself, and I look at the seat and it’s completely soaked in piss. Ruined. So I lost my cool a little bit, and yelled at her that if she had to go she should have told me, and not pissed all over my brand new car. I said at the time that I wanted her to pay half the cost of replacing it, and she broke down crying and said “it came on suddenly” (how can you not notice you’re about to piss yourself?!)

All my friends called me an asshole and said she couldn’t help it and I should apologize, but keep in mind she never apologized for ruining the seat.

694,Asshole,"My daughter Jess (28) was every parents dream. She's smart, has a well paid job she loves (accountant), is beautiful and bubbly and a lovely girl. 

Unfortunately she met an awful man. I'll call him Max. Max is a criminal and we all know it, but she's so blinded by her love for him that she insists he isn't that bad. Max was selling firearms, and for some reason got Jess to hold one for him. Both his place and ours got raided. There was a loaded gun in our home and neither me nor my husband were aware until Jess's room was searched. 

Both Jess and Max were remanded and are in prison. Max is looking at serious time. Jess not as long, but guns are a serious offence here and her lawyer has made clear she's not getting out any time soon. They're both intending to plead guilty and depressingly, Jess intends to stand by him and still loves him. They're obviously held in different locations and aren't allowed any contact. 

We visit her as much as we can and her friends do too. The place she's in is safe but overcrowded and inefficient. She's had times when she's spent 24 hours a day in her cell. She's keeping her head down and hasn't had any issues but is still scared and lonely, and only gets limited phone calls.  

Jess's plea hearing is in a few weeks, and she asked us to do her a favour for her next visit. Jess loves fashion. As well as dresses and shoes she also loves suits and workwear, and has a gorgeous bespoke suit that she wears for corporate/professional events. She asked if we could bring it in on her next visit to wear on her plea hearing and then her sentencing after that. Firstly because she wants to remind the judge that she's an educated professional and not a career criminal, but also because she's well aware that she's going away for a while, and it's her last chance to wear something nice. We have brought her a few items of her own clothing but the prison doesn't permit us to bring in many items so most of the time she's stuck wearing the prison issue clothes which she hates.

Formalwear such as dresses, suits, buttoned shirts/blouses aren't allowed on the residential units, but prisoners can change into them at the prison reception and wear them to court, and any other time they are stored in a property box. 

I said no to Jess. We've done her favours already. We send her money and have brought her as much personal clothing as the prison will permit. I reminded her that she got herself into this mess, and also told her that her sentencing hearing isn't a fashion show. Jess ended up crying over the phone to us, saying she just wants one nice thing and that it wasn't fair. I agreed that it wasn't but she got herself into this situation and we can't hold her hand through it. 

My husband Paul was disappointed in me. He thinks I should have said yes to her. To be fair, a lot of what I've said was just my grief and worry for her making me lash out, but even so, I stand by my point that she can't expect constant favours from us.

EDIT: For those saying we should because it will help her case, let me explain. We spoke to Jess's lawyer regarding this. He explained that if it were a minor level crime such as shoplifting or street fighting, then Jess being professionally dressed in the courtroom will no doubt make a judge look favourably on her, and the crime would be seen as a heat of the moment mistake. However, he said that what she did was a completely different class of crime, with even the lowest possible sentence being lengthy. He told us that realistically her courtroom attire will have no bearing at all and that it's the mitigating factors that will make all the difference. If we were told that it would have been of help to her sentencing then of course we would have done it.

UPDATE: OK, so thanks for all these responses. After reading them and speaking to my husband it's clear that I am the AH in this situation. As I said above, if her lawyer had stated there was any chance her attire would help get her a lower sentence, I would have brought her suit in straight away. But we were told that realistically it would have no effect whatsoever on the sentence for a crime of this magnitude. Even so, Jess wanted to wear this suit because it would be her last chance to wear something stylish and professional. I said no because we're heartbroken and hurt and worried about what will happen while she's in there, and I took that hurt out on her by refusing. In hindsight I know I was being vindictive and unreasonable. I think most people will agree that we're not wrong for being angry at her, but Jess is being punished already. She's in prison and she already knows that she won't be coming home for a long time. It's not right for us to punish her any more. She's our little girl and we love her, so it's our duty to do what we can to make her time in there a bit more bearable. While her suit may not effect her sentence, being able to wear nice clothes for just one day, even if it is the sentencing day she's dreading, will at least make her feel a bit more comfortable and more like herself. She'll be stuck wearing prison clothes most of the time for the foreseeable future, so of course it would be unfair for us to take away her very last chance to wear her nice clothes. I'll bring the suit in the next time we visit her and I realise how unfair I was being.",604,1413,0.92
695,Not the A-hole,"So I (18f) turned 18 a few days ago. My parents took that opportunity to told me I needed to start paying rent. 

Bit of backstory, I've struggled with both physical and mental illness a lot the past few years, I still do. I've been hospitalized a couple of times, and because of that I couldn't finish that year of high school (my second to last). 

Because of that I'm now in my senior year, plus doing the subjects I couldn't do last year. I'm at school every day from about 8 am to 5 pm, plus still struggling with the illnesses. Plus working weekends. 

I told my parents I can pay them whatever's left of my paycheck after health insurance (mandatory for 18+ here), but they want me to pay market value. I've asked them to reconsider because my health is still not great, and even if it was I'd have to drop out of high school to make enough to pay rent. They insisted. 

I called my grandma and explained, she's upset with my mom, because in her eyes making sure your kids succeed in life is more important. Plus my brother never paid rent until he moved out at 24. I'm staying with my grandmother right now. 

This is where I might be an asshole (maybe i already was, i don't know). But my parents came over to 'talk about it' (read: convince me to pay rent even if it meant dropping out) and I kind of blew up. I didn't swear, but I think I called them uncaring and cash-grabbing. 

AITA? Some family members (older) think it's totally normal, but I just think it's rude.

697,Not the A-hole,"Went to see Gemini Man last night with a couple buddies. The theater we went to is the more upscale option in our area so tickets are easily $16+. We sit down in the middle of our row just before two young parents come in and sit on the end with their 6-8 year old child. 

Now, I'm not a parent, but I don't really think this was the best movie to be showing a child of that age, but as it turns out she wasn't very interested in watching it. As the movie begins she starts walking up and down the row, talking to her parents and to other people, and the mother takes her to what I assume is the bathroom 3 times before the movie is even an hour in. 

At this point everyone's groaning and giving them looks, but they don't seem to notice. Finally I decide to let out a ""why would you bring a kid to this movie??"" which doesn't get a response. Hoping that did it I try to focus back on the movie but with a few minutes the kid is walking around the aisle again and I let out ""common"". 

That's when the mother stands up and tells me to stfu and that she's just a child, to which I respond ""Yeah, and this is a movie"". Then the dad gets up and gives me another stfu and they storm out. Just before he's around the corner he lets out ""That's what I thought, fucking pussy"" which makes the whole theater laugh along with me.

699,Not the A-hole,"Hi all,

&#x200B;

Need some perspective on this. For the last 3 years, my wife and I have spent roughly 75% of our paid vacation time, visiting her parents in the US (we live in the UK). We spend roughly 2 weeks at thanksgiving and then a week midyear. 

We are yet to go on a transatlantic flight together beyond the above trips. This is something that I empathise with, but get somewhat frustrated by, as I would like to travel the world..with my wife. Some additional context is that she has grown up with the luxury of visiting most continents around the world, whilst I have only been to the US and within Europe. 

&#x200B;

She recently informed me she has spoken to her US based friends as well as her parents, and organised a girls trip for 2 weeks next year to visit the US and Mexico. This would be roughly a month before I wanted us to FINALLY visit Asia for a 3 week mini trip. 

&#x200B;

I immediately blew up - expressing that this is incredibly selfish of her considering she knows how much I've been wanting to travel with my partner and that we have always prioritised our paid vacation to her family which results in me getting the odd short haul weekend trip.  She argued back, saying that she hasnt been on a ""girls trip"" since we have been together (3 years, she's 27), and that I am ""holding her back"" from enjoying a trip with her friends. She also says I would be forcing her to let her family/friends down and would come across poorly if she blamed money/lack of vacation days, only to then vacate with me a month later.

My rational is that she shouldnt have committed to this without discussing it with her partner first. On top of that, I find it difficult to empathise with her when we have to defacto visit her family in the US without question for a minimum of 2 weeks in the year.  I want to experience the world; I work hard to save money for trips beyond this obligatory trip and so I feel like I deserve that.  On top of this, we cannot really afford multiple longhaul trips so it would have to be between her going on her girls trip or us going to Asia together.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So reddit, AITA for ""preventing her"" from going ""living her life"" by asking her not go on that trip?

706,Not the A-hole,"Just to start off with some context I guess, this happened in America in the state of New York. The liquor laws here are a bit odd compared to other states but in a liquor store the seller can reserve to right to not sell alcohol to anyone for any reason really. As long as the reason isn't a blatant prejudice against race/religion/sex. I work part time at a small liquor store while I'm working towards my bachelors degree in college. 

A Muslim woman wearing a hijab and a veil, and a younger man who I presumed to be her significant other walked into the liquor store as I'm working behind the counter. I said hello and asked if they needed any help finding anything, they both politely declined. After they wandered around for a bit and speaking in a different language they eventually pick out a vodka and come to the counter. I scan the bottle and ask for their IDs.

They both pull out New York IDs. I was fine with the man's ID but I couldn't see the woman's face. I could see the woman's face in the ID but I had no way to tell that it was her because of the veil. I told her that I wasn't sure if I could accept it because I couldn't tell if the photo ID was actually hers. The woman then said that she couldn't remove the veil for religious purposes. I then explained that I was sorry, and that due to the law I just couldn't accept the ID then and I refused to sell to them.

The woman seemed a bit disappointed but the man got a bit angry, saying that it was religious discrimination. I apologized again and just told him that I couldn't sell him the liquor unless I knew that the photo ID was actually her. The woman then rattled off her name and birthday without looking while I was still holding her ID card to prove it was her. As somebody who works in a liquor store this proves very little to me because people with fakes learn the names and the DOB on the ID all the time to make it seem like it's actually them. He then asked if she could just walk out of the store and if I could just ""sell it to him"". I told him I still couldn't because I knew she was with him. Then, he tried giving some excuse that they had just met outside and he doesn't even know her. At this point I was more than over it and just flatly said, ""Look, I can't sell this to you. Try a different store. I don't know what else to tell you.""

He kinda huffed and puffed again about religious discrimination and losing business before they both walked out. This confrontation made me feel a bit uncomfortable because I don't think it was about religious discrimination, I simply just couldn't see her face. I get that she doesn't want to take off the veil but how the heck am I supposed to know that the photo ID is actually her? AITA here? Was this actually discrimination?",286,265,0.69

This happened maybe four or three years ago. I’m curious to see if I am TA or not.

For some context, my father cheated on my mom many times. With different women, and unfortunately back then she stayed. One of the women my father cheated on my mom with was my moms so called “bestfriend”. We’ll call her C. My father cheated on my mom with C multiple times.

Anyway, they go through a freaking horrible divorce etc etc. And my father later ends up marrying and having a kid with C. I have no respect for this woman. My brother and I don’t like her at all and we came to an agreement with our father that we don’t have to talk to her when we’re sleeping over but to just not be rude to her. So it goes like that, we don’t say hi to her but we do acknowledge her presence with a small half smile her way and the we lock ourselves into our rooms. She doesn’t make an effort to talk to us and we don’t either. 

Event: My father and C hosted a birthday dinner for one of our family members. They didn't cook or anything, our family just brought the food and cake.

We go to the party, say hi and hug our family all around and then we give a small smile and wave to C. Not a hi, just a small smile and wave to her. I did notice how my aunts and grandma frowned when they saw this interaction. So we go upstairs and hangout.

The cake comes out. We sing happy birthday to whoever it was, eat the food that was brought, and then hangout a bit more. My brother gets up and decides it’s time that we leave so I get up as well.

We say goodbye and hug my family, and then it comes to C. All we do is wave a bye and head for the door. That is until my grandma grabs my shoulders, pulls me towards C and says, “well aren’t you going to say thank you and say bye to C?”

I say, “no, I’d rather not,“

She says, “Well it’s her house and she cooked the food and hosted this.” Which ISNT true all they did was host it at their place. This then has the family staring at us, and my aunt even joins in, agreeing with my grandma that I should say bye as well as thank you. As it’s just the “respectful” thing to do.

I stood my ground and said no, I wasn’t going to do that at all. At this point I was trying to leave but my grandma wouldn’t let go of my shoulders until I said thank you. They were all pressuring me to say thank you, and my dad and C were just standing there, looking at me waiting to see what I would do. It was until my brother yanked me out of my grandmas hold that I left. We walked home.

Later my cousin texted me saying that my family was saying that I was being an ass to my father’s wife, someone I have to respect.

714,Asshole,"My girlfriend and I have been talking about getting a dog for a while now. She wants a tiny little lap dog, while I want a dog that I can actually play with that I don’t have to treat like it’s made out of porcelain. Our house will only suit one dog, so our wants for different dog breeds are quite problematic.

She will absolutely not change her mind about this. It’s either the tiny dog or no dog. I’ve tried to show her breeds like labradors and Great Danes that are super friendly and are gentle giants, but she refuses to even consider them.

I asked her what her deal with bigger dogs was. She told me that when she was a little girl, her cousin’s labradoodle dog knocked her over and pinned her down, while she screamed for help. I asked if it had hurt her, but she said no, that it was only trying to play with her. She told me that it was terrifying for her, and that she’s been scared of bigger dogs since (I did not know this before).

I told her that it’s okay, we will be different dog owners. Apparently her cousin’s dog was untrained and would jump up on people, trying to play all the time. I told my girlfriend that I will absolutely take sole responsibility for its training. I would take it to puppy school, walk it every day and that it can help to overcome her fear of big dogs.

We eventually got into an argument about this. She is very adamant about her decision, and when I tried to come up with different breeds like a German shepherd or a breed that is middle-sized, she said that she doesn’t want a dog anymore and that she’s happy with just the cats, since I won’t listen to her concerns (yet she won’t consider ANYTHING that I’m saying??)

I was very frustrated and told her she needs to get over her past bad experience with a big dog since it didn’t hurt her—it was just being a dog and trying to play with a kid! She has been ignoring me since and I don’t think she’ll let this go.

After three times, it kind of stopped being funny and I was feeling hurt. I snapped at my boyfriend that if he couldn't tell his own girlfriend apart from her friends, he was pretty shitty at making me feel special.

He said he just got mistaken because he didn't realize how many of my clothes Id given away, and he saw stuff I always wear and thinks it's me. I snapped at him ""Am I just a body to you"" and he said he wasn't arguing anymore and walked away

719,Not the A-hole,"This is a throwaway because cousin knows my main.

My cousin is a 20 year old woman who is pregnant with her first child. We are pretty close. I am a Social worker who works for CPS. I am a mandated reporter.

I think she will be a good mom but the problem is her home. It’s trashed! I’m talking no table space due to soda cups, no counter space due to opened cans, no floor space due to clothes and trash(yes even in the kitchen)You can’t walk in their bedroom due to every single bit of laundry being on the floor. Another big problem is their indoor/outdoor cats. They do not have a litter box in the house for 5 cats, which means when they are inside, they have to go somewhere.

WIBTA if I told her she has to get it cleaned up before baby comes home or else I legally have to report it? She knows my job. I would of course offer to help her clean it, but I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. Any criticism over anything makes her throw a fit and threaten to cut off all the “toxic” people in her life. By toxic, she means if you tell her it’s not a good idea to spend 50$ on clothes if that 50 is the only thing she has for gas til the next paycheck. 

I don’t want to be the bad person here. I talked to her parents about it but they think I would be the worst person for making CPS get involved in a family members life when that family member isn’t beating a child.

721,Not the A-hole,"I (27) come from a pretty sheltered/conservative family in a very Catholic country. The last time I joked about getting a tattoo, my parents responded by asking me if I was a ""criminal""/""from prison"". That was a few years ago but they aren't the type to change their mind over time, especially if the topic never comes up. On top of that, my grandparents (who are still the heads of the household [so you can probably guess which country I'm in]) are extremely close-minded and conservative. When I came out to my parents years ago, they told me that under no circumstances was I to tell my grandparents at all, or risk getting entirely disowned.

Now I'm pretty serious about getting an extremely meaningful (to me) tattoo and I would like to get it before the new year starts. Unfortunately, I want to place it on a pretty visible location (inner wrist) which means I won't be able to hide it from the family whenever I visit and it will be too ""tall"" to hide behind a watch strap (for example). I would have normally not cared and gotten it without telling them so that they'd just have to deal with it after it was already done and inked, but when I brought it up to my brother in private, he told me not to because the family is currently in a ""very stressful situation""--that is, our other sibling was caught using hard drugs and at risk of his wife leaving him and taking their son, so our parents have been dealing with this ""crisis"" and trying to help him get/stay clean and avoid people (including said grandparents) from finding out. He thinks that our parents will react negatively to my getting a tattoo and told me to wait until after this was ""solved"" because getting the tattoo now would be unnecessary stress for our parents (and they would find out because I have scheduled trips home at the end of November and December). The problem being we wouldn't know when this ""crisis"" would be ""solved"" or if it was even possible (from what I heard, his wife is pretty set on bailing already). I legitimately want the tat and what it represents to me, and it would mean a lot to me (personally) to be able to get it before I head home in November (so that it heals before December) but WIBTA if I disregarded what my brother said?",37,73,0.92

724,No A-holes here,"My father-in-law passed away recently after a long battle with cancer. We'd had a good relationship, but he never spoke to me about his end-of-life arrangements. Apparently, though, one of the things he wanted done after he passed was to have my mother-in-law trade his vehicle with mine. I would get his much nicer, newer vehicle, and my mother-in-law would take mine as a token trade-in toward something more suitable for her. Great, right?

Unfortunately, it also appears that there was a paperwork foul-up that may leave my MIL in a much worse financial position than was expected. In researching how to handle the vehicle trade, I found out that the vehicle I'd be receiving is literally worth 8x the value of the one I'd be giving up. If my MIL kept it, she could sell it outright, pay cash for something decent for herself, and still have money left over. Which would be a real advantage to her if the paperwork issue does not resolve in her favor.

I understand why my FIL wanted me to have the vehicle, and I'm not ungrateful, but my perspective is that my MIL should be cared for first. I really don't want to go through with the trade unless I'm sure it isn't going to increase her hardship, and I've said as much. But I'm getting some pushback along the lines of it being disrespectful to go against the wishes of the deceased. AITA for insisting that in this case it would be better to care for the living, even if it means ignoring what my FIL wanted?

725,Not the A-hole,"I've never used reddit before (never had a reason to) so this is my first post ever.

My bro is a Freshman (14) and I'm a Junior (16)

I'm a lesbian, and as some of you probably know, theater kids are really, really gay. (EDIT: poorly worded, I meant to convey that Drama clubs often attract LGBT kids, not insinuate that all theatre kids lgbt. Everyone in my club is lgbt) When this year started, I began participating in the Drama Club, and came out to them, and it's been great! I've made a lot of friends there (and a girlfriend!), and I'm finally able to be true to myself for once! Problem is, when this quarter started, my younger brother wanted to join the club. My brother is vocally homophobic at home, and has said things to me like ""Lesbians just need a man to fix them"" and ""if you married a girl, I'd disown you"" sort of thing.

We live with our grandmother, a very homophobic baptist woman (like, I-have-no-doubt-that-this-woman-would-try-to-beat-the-gay-out-of-me homophobic) and he's blackmailed me with this kind of thing before (when I brought up thinking I was trans \[I'm not\]).

So I told him not to join drama last night and he started crying (which I wasn't anticipating) and said I was stealing away the thing he was passionate about for my own selfishness. I feel bad for making him cry, but I don't feel sorry for wanting to protect myself.

Am I the asshole for not wanting him to join?

Edit: Let me clarify: he doesn’t think I’m gay ANYMORE. He’s convinced that it was just a phase, and that he “fixed me” by bullying me into silence, and because I had a “crush” on one of his male friends. My bro can’t do shit, but if my gran finds out, it’s game over for me. Finding out about my GF gives him ammunition. And he’s gotten a LOT bolder since last time.

Edit 2: over my initial panic.

brother may not be as homophobic as initially believed. He has openly queer friends. It’s just that he’s weirdly fixated on not letting ME be gay. I don’t think he’d try to out any of the other drama kids, he just. Doesn’t care as much about them being gay?

I see now that a lot of people think me and him live alone with our gran. We don’t. We live IN her house with our parents and older brother. (Those three know I’m gay, and have accepted it) and my bro and grandma are the exceptions. He has other role models in his life.

That’s probably poorly worded but yea

Edit 3: I apologized for yelling at him,and told him he could join the club if he wanted to. I made this post in a moment of panic, and said panic has passed. i can see things clearer now.

Edit 4: I'm not deleting the account so I can update if he actually comes out as gay lmao",335,1096,0.91
726,No A-holes here,"My younger sister and I have never been close, until recently. I’ve been driving home from college to take her to the movies, or out for dinner, or what have you, nearly every weekend now. I really love spending time with her, and I’m glad we’re friends now. 

I have a hard time connecting with others. So to help us become closer as sisters, I’ve been showing her my music and movies and other interests. 

We used to be completely opposite. She dressed super preppy and bright, and I’ve always dressed very dark and “grungy.” An important thing to note is that she made fun of my appearance and interests before now. 

Ever since we started hanging out, she’s been emulating every aspect of my personality and appearance. She even went out and bought the exact same outfit I have, that she’d NEVER wear two months ago. 

She restarted her social media, and is now using my exact same filter and even poses exactly like me. If I wasn’t worried about anonymity, I’d show you a photo where she literally copied everything (location, lighting, outfit) down to my facial expression in her new profile picture. 

She’s abandoned all of her former interests. It’s not like was just inspired by or genuinely liked a few of the things I’ve showed her. She doesn’t listen to any of the old artists she used to, she doesn’t watch her favorite shows and movies anymore, she doesn’t wear any of her favorite clothes. She’ll ONLY do the things I do. 

I’m worried for her, too. At her age, I was extremely depressed. I had no friends at all in high school, not even a best friend. She’s always been a very popular girl with lots of friends. Her biggest dream this year was to be on prom court. Her sweet 16 had at least 50 people present. Now, she doesn’t talk to her friends anymore and thinks prom is dumb. She’ll go in the library and eat by herself, EXACTLY like I used to. At first I was afraid that she was becoming depressed like I was, but she didn’t know any of this until I told her. I swear, the next school day she had, she drastically changed her social habits. 

I have issues having to do with my identity and control. I don’t want pity or to excuse anything, but it might be important context. I feel the need to have ultimate control over my environment and identity so as to not dissociate. 

This is causing me actual distress, as nothing bothers me more than someone taking aspects of my personality that I’ve carefully curated just for my own personal sense of security. 

Also, this causes me distress because I am a terrible role model. I’m extremely sad and toxic, and she has always been a walking ball of sunshine and light. I feel like I’ve ruined her. 

TLDR; My sister and I were opposites, until I started actually becoming close with her. Now, she’s a mini me and it makes me anxious, as not only do I feel like she’s infringing on my sense of self, but I feel like I’ve passed on negative facets of my personality onto her. I don’t want her to end up like me.",71,338,0.92
727,Not the A-hole,"So I'm currently pregnant with my third child who is due in December. This is a rainbow baby for us after our 18 month old died last December.

As you can imagine it's been a very hard and emotional pregnancy with lots of anxiety for my husband and me.

I've asked all our family to have the flu vaccination if they want to be around the baby. Now normally my sister and her family all get the flu jab every winter. In fact my whole family always get the vaccination so I wasn't expecting that this request would be pushing any boundaries. Non of the family are anti-vax, if anything my sister is massively against anti-vaxers.

Yet today it came up in conversation as her 15yo dosent get the vaccination for free this year. I asked if he would get it and my sister went off at me. She called me a dictator and said I was only thinking about myself. That he was 15 and healthy, so if he got the flu he would be able to fight it off. 

Well no, I'm actually thinking about my nephew,  the baby, and my Sisters elderly GMIL and GFIL. Nephew is healthy, yet you don't only get vaccinated for yourself, you do it to help protect the people around you. Plus his dad (BIL, who gets it free as he is a carer for his grandparents) is due to have surgery in the next few weeks, they will be in and out of the hospital for at least a week. 

She then said ""what if he dosent want it"". I replied saying that would be fine, obviously I can't make him have the shot, and if he didn't want it then that would be a different matter altogether. Yet he has had it every previous year, along with the rest of us. She then said she never asked us to get the jab when her 3 yr old was little (Oct baby), but I said she didn't have to as the whole family had it anyway. If she would of asked I would have done it. 

So after an awkward silence she said if I wanted him to have it I can pay for it, and also take him to get it. That's fine with me. If its just an issue with money I don't mind helping. My husband and other BIL are going to pay for the shot as well. 

If he dosent want to have the vaccination I would never press the issue, I would just be not let him hold the baby. I have said this to the whole family, both sides. It would be his choice not to have it, and my choice not to endanger my new baby. I don't want the baby ending up in the hospital with something that could be easily avoided.

So AITA for asking my family to do something they normally do anyway? Or am I just hormonal?",45,83,0.86
728,Not the A-hole,"I'm 36f, mother to an 11 year old daughter. I have 50/50 split custody with my ex husband.

I'm bisexual. My ex knows this, but I've never told my daughter because it's never really come up. However, 5 months ago I met someone, a woman, and we've been seeing each other. I've not told my daughter yet and I've not introduced them, instead on the weeks she's been at her father's my girlfriend has come over, and the weeks my daughter is with me, my girlfriend stays at her place.

This is my ex husband's week with our daughter and my girlfriend and I went out to get lunch. Around halfway through my ex sees us. He doesn't seem to realise it's a date because he comes up to us and starts making conversation, giving me an update on our daughter, which is something totally normal in terms of what we normally do when we run into each other.

He asks how we know each other and my girlfriend says we're dating, which I'm fine with as we're not hiding it, but my ex asks if our daughter knows, and I tell him she doesn't. He asks how long this has been going on for and I tell him 5 months. He says that it's unfair of me to keep her in the dark and I should tell her ASAP.

He has what he calls the ""2 date rule"", which is that on the second date he, the date, and our daughter, all go out for a meal to introduce his girlfriend to our daughter. I'm not a huge fan of this method because what it's resulted in is him introducing our daughter to these women and then breaking up with them soon after. In the three years we've been split our daughter has met over a dozen women. He says he introduces them early on so he doesn't get into a long term relationship with someone who doesn't get on with his daughter.

I have never introduced my daughter to any of my partners since her father. I have a ""six month rule"" which is after 6 months, they meet. No sooner in case it doesn't work out.

This is where I probably fucked up. I said ""I get where you're coming from but I wanted to be sure about \[girlfriend\] before introducing her to \[daughter\], so we don't wind up breaking up right after they meet""

My ex then looked really annoyed, bordering angry, and said ""low blow"" before walking off. Girlfriend looked confused so I explained to her his history with introducing women to our daughter early on, and she said ""you probably could have phrased that better"".

AITA?

&#x200B;

Clarification: my girlfriend was not upset by what I said. We've discussed at length the timeline of introducing her to my daughter, and we agreed not to introduce her to my daughter until a significant amount of time had passed and we were sure this was long term. I am planning to have the coming out conversation with my daughter soon, and then the introduction whenever my daughter is ready, and my girlfriend has said she is happy to work at our (mine and my daughter's) pace. She said I could have phrased it better after I asked if I fucked up with my phrasing while talking to Ex, which I asked because he got upset and left. She said that in terms of us trying to be civil for our daughter, my phrasing probably wasn't the best thing I could have said to him. She personally was not upset or offended by my phrasing.

We have discussed a timeline for her meeting my daughter. I am going to have the coming out conversation soon, probably next week as Ex now knows and could tell her before I get the chance. In this conversation I will 1) tell her I'm bi and 2) tell her I have a girlfriend. After that, I will wait for her to be ready to meet my girlfriend. She's very open minded and she loves her godmother and her (godmother's) wife, but as her parent this might be a little harder for her to get used to. We are working to my timeline right up until I tell my daughter, at which point we are working at my daughter's pace. I have cleared all of this with my girlfriend, who agrees that we shouldn't introduce them unless we're 1) sure about each other and 2) not blindsiding my daughter.",572,2900,0.96

730,Asshole,"My (18m) sister (15f) is vegetarian, and has been for years. She's the only vegetarian in the house, so she gets her food separate to us. When we go to do the food shop each week mum gives her some money and she goes off on her own while me and mum sort out the food for everyone else. One night a week she does all the cooking and makes a vegetarian dish for the whole house to eat, and the rest of the week she sometimes offers us leftovers.

Last week dad burned dinner. Everyone else went to bed and I saw my sister had made herself some veggie soup and left it on the stove. It smelled really good and as she usually offers us leftovers I figured she wouldn't miss a cup. There was probably about 2 cups of soup left in the pot, so I had a cup, and then come the next morning she's asking me if I had some of her soup, as she was planning on filling a thermos with the (apparently carefully measured out) remaining soup and that was going to be her food all day at school. I apologised again and she said ""whatever, just use your common sense"".

Then the end of last week I got a migraine. Migraines usually leave me chugging energy drinks and craving something salty, followed by something sweet. I went down to the kitchen, saw a bag of crisps out on the counter, and pretty much dove on them. I looked in the cupboard and found a 6 pack of mini rolls, and had 3. Not my proudest moment but I hadn't eaten in about 30 hours, and migraines really take it out of me. I stayed awake long enough to brush my teeth before crawling back into bed.

Later that morning I wake up and find that a quarter of the kitchen is labelled. I open the cupboard, and a multipack of crisps (the kind I ate) and what's left of the mini rolls all have her name on them. I text her asking what is going on. She replies ""I'm sorry I had to get passive aggressive, but my food budget for the week is literally whatever cash mum has on her when we do the food shop. My meals and snacks are all portioned out. I know you had your migraine so I figured you didn't realise the food you ate was mine, but that was 3 days of snacks for me, and you ate it in one hit. Mum and dad said I should label my stuff so it didn't happen again"".

Then today I had my late start at sixth form, I woke up ready to make myself some breakfast before I left, and the cereal that me and my parents share was all out. My sister buys her cereal in variety packs, so she gets several mini boxes. All of the mini boxes had my sister's name on and I knew I'd get a bollocking for it but I had no cash on me and didn't have time to make a bacon sandwich, so I just grabbed a couple of minis and had some cereal before I left the house. The boxes had her name on them. I'm in college, she's gone home for lunch, and she's texted saying ""fucking really??? two boxes???""

731,Not the A-hole," My daughter is 17, and its time to submit college applications. Despite encouraging her to research, visit & weigh out all of the options to come up with a prioritized list, she has decided on a state university (no backups.) This uni is about 2 hours away, so commuting is not an option. The cost is 27k/yr. She refused to schedule a visit to this university and is applying sight unseen.

I am concerned about the considerable financial commitment. My top concern is her ability to adjust. She has a decent GPA, but her high school has a very lenient retake policy which she relies on heavily. I'm also concerned about the financial implication of her long term goals. She decided her dream career when she was about 10 years old by googling ""highest paying jobs"" and just picking one. It requires a bachelors and 8 years of post grad school. 12 years of financed schooling is going to leave her with A LOT of debt.

I can contribute to (not pay for) her education, but I also expect her to make sound decisions with my contribution. At this point, I do not consider entering this uni as a freshman to be a sound decision. On top of this, I have sent her info regarding scholarships and encouraged her at length to research/apply for them, but her opinion is that ""$500 or $1000 is not worth the effort.""

I've given her 3 options:

\- Stay home. Attend the local comm college for 2 years, we will pay for that 100% & continue to support her to the tune of 6-10k a year when she transfers to the Uni.

\- Provide her a place of her own (rent free) near another cc about an hour away that has a transfer agreement with her Uni of choice for 2 years. She would be responsible for getting a part time job and paying tuition/expenses.

\- Attend the university as a freshman on her own dime.

The standstill we are at is she has denied options 1 & 2 because she a) wants to live independently but b) is intimidated by the idea of living in her own place. She wants the ""hashtag dorm life"" which I get. I just don't think 2 extra years of ""hashtag dorm life"" is worth an extra 50k tacked onto her student loan debt, which will be hundreds of thousands of dollars if she continues post grad.

I broke the news to her last night that I won't cosign her loans. Cosigning guarantees that in the event she stops paying, I'll pick up the slack... and I won't agree to that. She of course thinks I'm being super unreasonable because all of her friends parents are happily cosigning student loans.

So AITA for refusing to cosign on her loans because she doesn't want to take the path I think is the smartest way forward? I read other posts where OPs get blasted for trying to ""financially blackmail"" their kids into picking their preferred major or going to their preferred school.

But then they’ll start getting handsy and/or kissing really passionately. This is usually while we are sat in a park smoking or just hanging out.

We had talked about it before, and I explained how uncomfortable it makes me. Mia always promised that she would keep the PDA to a minimum around me and to be more considerate of other people’s feelings of seeing two teenagers tongue kissing in public places.

Not too long ago (about a week), I had had enough. Mia invited me to wander round the town centre with me (we live in a small town so there’s not much to do), and when her current boyfriend (17M) inevitably showed up and they started  getting handsy and kissing with tongue while I’m sat right there, I got up and walked away. I went home and got my dinner.

The next day, Mia was mad at me because I “ditched her”. I told her that she had her boyfriend there and she was doing just fine with him there. She exploded and accused me of being jealous and moody, so I told her that if she wants to hang out with me, it’s either just friends with us or she doesn’t play tonsil tennis with whomever she is with at that time.

I asked my husband explicitly if I was invited to the bachelorette party so I wasn't ""crashing"" it (or sitting somewhere by myself in a strange place) and he told me that yes, the groom made it sound like I was, so I figured that was that and made arrangements for time off of work to spend the weekend \~8 hours away.

Yesterday, the bride called me to ""make sure that I would be okay"" with staying at their house with the groom's mom and their daughters after the bridal shower, because as it turns out, I'm not invited to the bachelorette party (she tried to say it in a polite way, so she basically said ""the house is booked already, all the reservations etc are already made, and we don't have room for another person."")

I’m now 30 years old, my wife recently gave birth to a little girl who we called Rowan Harper we had planned on the name Rosalie but we chose Rowan on the spot because it felt right 

My sister is completely upset with me and is calling me TA knowing that she wanted to name her child after her sister 

Edit; I completely forgot about lil sis intentions until a few hours after naming my baby, I have texted sis to tell her if she doesn’t want her baby and mine to share the name I don’t mind her nicknaming my baby “Ro” “Roo” or “Harper” hopefully that’s a good compromise 


FINAL EDIT; We will rename our daughter to Roan Harper rather than Rowan Harper, the names are similar and I’m happy with that (still upset since you know, Rowan was my sister too, but my sisters feelings are hurt)

740,Not the A-hole,"I (39 f) am engaged to a pretty awesome dude (39 m). He’s supportive and funny and kind and generous. But I need to know if I am overreacting to something. We have two dogs. One dog was mine before we met. She is a medium-sized dog and they are soul mates. They loved each other from the moment they met. Before he moved in, my dog got a treat when we came in from a walk and she would go to the bathroom (morning walk got a dental
bone, afternoon walk got a small chicken treat, evening walk got a small chicken treat). Now, she expects treats all the time because every time she whines or cries for something he goes to get her a treat. She did not do this before he moved in. Before, when she would cry or whine, I would assume she wanted a walk or wanted to play. She has gained 7 pounds since he moved in and her vet is concerned about her weight. I work all day outside the home, and he is home with the dogs all day (he is a disabled vet). Their dog treats are expensive, and we don’t have any extra money for the amount of treats he feeds her. So we have switched to carrots, which her vet recommended. However, she will turn her nose up at carrots, so he will get lunchmeat meant for my lunch and feed her that. I went to make my sandwich last night, and the turkey was nearly gone. It was a half pound package. I made two sandwiches with 1 ounce of turkey each (I’m on a somewhat strict diet so I measure my food) since buying the lunchmeat, so he had fed her 6 ounces of turkey throughout the day while I was at work. I got angry. I told him we can’t afford to feed the dogs turkey that is meant for my lunch when we have bags and bags of carrots for the dogs. He also leaves full cups of coffee around and half-finished cans of pop, and never finishes leftovers he swears he will eat. I have told him repeatedly that we can’t afford to waste things. I am the primary breadwinner, and we are barely holding on between my student loans and other debts we have. I went to bed angry, and I know he felt guilty. But we haven’t talked about it and I need to know if I’m TA for this.

Update: We talked and he is making changes. Only veggies for the pups as treats until I can bake some, pouring pop into a glass so he can see how much he has left, and finishing his coffee. When I got home from work last night he only had the last dregs of a third cup of coffee. So he heard me and he listened and I think we’re on the right track. Thanks everyone!",45,177,0.91

743,Not the A-hole,"First, I’m a 15 year old, and my mother is overly religious. She claims she can “talk to God” and stuff like that.

I get home from school, and set my laptop on my bed, and after I notice a sugary substance all over my bed. It’s everywhere. I think it’s my dog that got on my bed or something, so I shake the sugary substance off my laptop, and get the sheet washed. No major issue.

I talked to my mom about it later, and she says, “Yeah, I sprinkled salt on your bed to draw out negative energy.” What? Okay, that sounds pretty stupid, but whatever, I ask her not to do it again, and she agrees.

About a day or two later, I notice my laptops fans aren’t working right, and there is a super annoying buzzing coming from it whenever I use it. So I take it to Apple and have them clean it out, and they say, “There was a little dust but some weird grainy substance in there, (salt) should be okay now.”

I get home, and I can still hear the buzzing. I can’t even use it because it’s driving me crazy.

I’m 90% sure that this is all caused by the salt she laced my bed with. I’m super careful with my expensive stuff, so I normally would never let any of this happen.

I spent ages saving up for it, and if she’s going to break it like this, and it can’t be repaired, she should at bare minimum help and pay for repairs/a new one. Especially when it’s because she did something stupid. WIBTA?

Edit: it was a $2,000 laptop, which is why I’m so upset over it.

Edit: Just in case someone misinterpreted this part: The salt was on the bed first, I didn’t notice it because my bedspread is white. That’s when I placed my laptop on the bedspread. It was enough to still get in there, though.

Final Edit: I talked to her, she said that she’ll do whatever needs to be done. Try to fix it, pay for repairs, etc. She also said that if absolutely necessary, she’d be willing to figure out how to get the money for a new one.",98,406,0.94

745,Not the A-hole,"My older sister (19) and I (16G) really like watching movies together but unlike her, I cry pretty easily at sad scenes. I will specify, my sister has -100 empathy (she went volunteering at a domestic violence charity once and came back ""meh"" and said ""yeah it was sad and all but it doesn't affect me so..."") which is why she never cries when watching movies. Similarly, my parents never really seem to find any remotely sad unless it is a real-life situation that has impacted them or a loved one.

Every single time I cry during a movie my sister will laugh, call me ""adorable"" for finding a movie sad, and film me. It's pretty irritating since I can't appreciate the scene or let out my emotions with out being teased. Last time this happened I told her to quit it because I felt like she was making light of my emotions. Long story short, she went to my parents and complained that I was being a b\*tch to her and that she was just joking around because she found me cute. 

My family has the traditional Asian age-hierarchy kind of system where the older you are, the more respect and say you have in things. Consequently, it also means that in an argument my sister will 9/10 have the support of my parents because she's seen as wiser/smarter and in general, a person who I should give way to because I'm the youngest. So when I tried to defend myself, my efforts were unsurprisingly brushed off. This certainly isn't the first time this has happened and my parents are now telling me off for being overly sensitive and defensive against my sister.

Now I know my sister doesn't mean any harm by what she does, but it certainly is annoying and I can't help but feel a bit offended when she does laugh and tease me for crying during movies.

746,Not the A-hole,"Moved in a few weeks ago, and the couple in the apartment upstairs has two young kids. I don’t mind every day noises like walking, doors shutting and talking - they’re kind of unavoidable.

However, those kids will not shut up. 6am they’ll be having a tantrum, every sing day without fail, and when I say tantrum I mean full on screaming, blood curdling and high pitched, things being thrown, stamping, doors slamming. This will last *for hours*. The record has been a tantrum that lasted from 6am-2.30pm. The parents won’t do a *single thing* about it - every now and then I’ll hear their voices but believe me when I say it takes a good 40 minutes before they even pipe up. The kids will have tantrums like this that last hours at least three times every single day. Not only that, but when they walk and run upstairs the thumping is obnoxiously loud. 

Basically this is stressing me out no end, to the point where my mental health is declining through lack of sleep and lack of peace and quiet. I’m so highly strung right now that whenever they even run upstairs I feel like angry crying. However, I know they’re just kids... but at the same time even I know no normal, healthy kid should be that upset for such ridiculously long times and so frequently. I feel bad putting a noise complaint in, especially as I’m wondering if those kids might just need a little bit more attention.

Anyway, AITA?

Edit: a little more info. My flatmate and I have knocked on the door of the flat six times now - sometimes when the flat above seems quiet and calm, others when we had heard them up there minutes before. None of these times have they answered - maybe they couldn’t hear us over their children, or maybe they weren’t in when it was quiet. Either way, we haven’t got a hold of them. 

We haven’t filed a complaint yet, and are instead considering writing a polite letter to let them know how the noise is affecting us and posting it through their door with a phone number if they want to talk about it. Not sure if that’s a dangerous move or not though, but considering that the kids may have special needs we feel like we should find out a little more before formally complaining.",221,1063,0.96

Last week he had one of his fits and threatened to punch an operations manager in the face because the manager told him he didn’t know how to do his job. He went around the warehouse telling multiple people. He had texted me and told me as well. Today I come into work and my direct manger asked to take a picture of the text so I let him.

750,Asshole,"Edit2: Thanks for your advice everyone and I mean the NTA's as well as the YTA's and everything in between. It helped me tremendously to evaluate the situation. Apologies to the people who have misred my text, I should have made myself more clear in some points.

Hy, here's the story.

My father died about a year ago. It was a hard time for our family, but we stuck together and helped each other cope with the grief. Understandibly it was especially hard for my mother. My goal is to help her as good as I can with all the tasks that I can take on for her and to spend time with here as we do have a close relationship. (We meet about once a week and call each other every other day)

Here's where it gets difficult for me:

My mother and I talked a few months ago about the future and she told me that she needs time and would not want to date a man in the foreseeable future.
A few days later she tells me that she joined a dating site and that she will meet up with a few guys.

Even though  she told me otherwise and I believe a relationship should not be born out of loneliness I accepted it. I understand that she is dependent on a man in her life to be happy and I want her to be happy.

So she meets a man and tells me that she does not expect him to be a part of our family life and that she does not want to replace my father with him. I agree and I don't have any interest in meeting him.
A few weeks later she suggests that I should meet him.
Again I agree, I feel like a few meetups just to get to know him are fine.

The next treshold is him moving in to the home of my mother. From the get go she told me that she never would want a new man moving in with her.
Yesterday she told me that maybe he might move in after all when he retires.

I honestly don't know what to do.

I respect that it is here life and if she wants to meet a man she can obviously do so. The only condition that I have for myself is that I don't want to meet him regularly.
I thought that my mother and I had an agreement on this. I get that she can change her mind, but am I obligated to change my mind then as well? I am not deciding about here life and she can do what she wants, just I need the opportunity to do so myself and if I don't want to meet those men I should not be forced to.

So again, I he moves in and I would refuse to visit them both, would I be the asshole?

This happened a few days ago.

My sister is someone who litteraly loves her friends and family, and, as she has a passion for cooking, she usually cooks for us.

This morning, I woke up really tired. I didn't think so straight, you know how it is. I went to the fridge to grab something to eat. I found a cake my sister made, took a piece of it, ate it, and went to work.

Later this day, I received some furious messages from my sister :
Sis: ""Hey, did you eat the cake that was in the fridge?""
Me: ""Yes, I took a piece of it, it was good.""
Sis: ""Are you really that dumb? You saw a cake shaped in the form of a ""18"" you didn't think it was for an event or anything? I baked it for my best friend's birthday, tomorrow. I don't have time to make another one. What will I tell her? That I have a fucking idiot of a brother who ate some of her cake???""
Me: ""hey, don't talk to me like that. How was I supposed to know? And I didn't touch the 8 part, so you can give that to her""

After that, she insulted me, told me that I ruined everything, and told me she didn't want to speak to me again. It's been a week and she really avoids to speak to me.

It pisses me off because I was tired and she never spoke to me about that birthday so really I didn't know (nor care, it's our fridge, there's food inside, everyone can eat what's inside).

&#x200B;

I've been working at a job for a few months and while I generally got along with everyone except Paul (fuck you Paul.) However one guy (calling him B) recognized an anime keychain I had and we bonded over that and he kinda became my work friend. We hung out on breaks and after work, brought each other food and shit like that. Things were cool. However eventually coworkers started teasing us in a friendly way about how we were a cute couple, and asking when the wedding was. Here's the thing, I'm lesbian, and B for sure knew that as at one several points I told him about how weird it was between me and my siblings after I came out and he had even met a girl I was seeing. I just let stuff slide because I figured since I'm gay he'd know I wasn't into him.

&#x200B;

Fast forward after a while I'm at a local anime convention and I see a figure of his favorite character, it's pretty pricey but since his birthday was coming up I figured no big deal. The time comes for me to give it to him and I expect him to be overjoyed but he looked almost sad, I asked him what was wrong and he basically gave me some stuff like he wanted to be just friends and he wasn't into me like ""that"" (upon me questioning I found out he meant romantically). I was confused but at the time I just reminded him I'm gay and had no interest in him like that either, he was relieved and I thought we were cool but the more I thought about it and let it sit the more weirded out I got by the whole thing. He knew I was gay, like there was really no room for confusion outside of taking the coworker teasing seriously but the thought of that annoyed me. It made me doubt a lot, like had he been taking everything I had done for him that way?

&#x200B;

Since then I have for lack of better term emotionally ghosted him. If he messages me I'll reply but I'll be very flat in my responses, single word replies. I take my lunches with other people and avoid him unless it's for work. At one point he asked what happened to our friendship to which I responded ""Sorry I'm just not into you like that."" Which was admittedly really petty but I feel like either he was ignoring me being gay to give himself an ego boost of thinking I was into him or just never cared. I just want to know if I'm an asshole for not wanting to continue the friendship after that even if he didn't ""mean"" to hurt me?

754,Asshole,"A number of weeks ago, I overheard my roommate talking about a weekly Bible study he was going to host in our apartment. I knew this Bible study would affect me in a negative way, so I suggested he try to host it somewhere else. He said ""I'll look into it."" I knew he wasn't actually going to look into it, but I didn't push the issue further at this time.

Today, I told him that I'd really appreciate it if he found somewhere else to host the Bible study. He responded ""I'll look into it"" with no guarantee it will be moved. When I pressed the issue a bit further, he said that ""When it comes down to it, I can have people over sometimes, and you can too. It's give and take""

Now, before I ask you guys the question, I'll explain what the Bible study is and how it affects me. 

There are two parts of the Bible study: First, they play the board game, ""Secret Hitler."" I don't know how this game is played, but I know it involves lots of arguing and is loud af. This part lasts for about an hour, and prevents me from being productive in the apartment. Even with noise cancelling headphones, I can still hear them yelling in the other room, and it's difficult to focus. 

Second, they have the ""Bible part."" This is the part where they talk about life, discuss the Bible, and pray. This part lasts about half an hour. This part of the Bible study affects me more than the ""Secret Hitler"" part. I grew up in the church, but don't have fond memories of it. When I hear them talking like people talked at Sunday school and youth group, it brings up a lot of bad emotions. It also makes me really uncomfortable to be in a room full of people essentially talking bad things about my choices (Leaving the church, not reading the Bible, ""living a life of sin"") even though the conversation isn't directed at me.

When I talked to him today, he essentially said tough luck to me if he can't find another spot, because he'd still host it in that case.

So, WIBTA if push the issue further and tell him he has to move the Bible study, regardless of whether he finds a new spot for it?

TL;DR

My roommate hosts a weekly Bible study in my apartment. It brings up bad memories for me because it reminds me of when I was a part of the church. WIBTA if I told him he can't host it here even if he doesn't find a new place for it?

About 5 min later, I got a message from presumably his gf saying that ""he's in jail because he missed his probation payment and I need $600 to get him out or he's there until December"". I already thought this was very weird that someone I do not know at all is asking me for a loan of that amount just to get him out of jail 2 months earlier. She said she would pay me back but I seriously question it from a total stranger.

Just some brief history, this brother of mine has been to prison for a couple years and has always been into drugs, alcohol, and has done crime such as robbery and dealing. I cut all contact with him once I started college as I figured it would be for the best so when I sent a happy birthday I was praying that he maybe cleaned up his life by this point. Apparently not. I told his gf point-blank that I don't have that kind of money on me (last year of college, $40k+ in loans, and barely paying off my rent with my part time job 30+ hours a week), now she's asking if I can at least front $250 and this kind of angered me as I thought she would get the hint. I seriously can't spare that kind of money right now when I'm using every single penny to make sure my own living situation is still stable..

(also parents cant help because our dad isn't even in the picture and my mom is pretty much the same as my brother when it comes to drugs, alcohol, illegal activity. Honestly surprised she hasn't reached out to me yet for money. havn't seen her in 7 years.)

Just to clarify I love my brother so much still even though he's done so much to me like when he stole $500 worth of belongings from me when I was 16. If this was 1-2 years in the future, no doubt I would front up the $600 for him so long as he paid it back. I believe people can get second chances in life and not seeing him for 5+ years I would do what I could to help him but I'm in no position to right now when I'm fronting my rent with credit cards and paying it off paycheck to paycheck.

My daughter Emily and her boyfriend Justin have been dating for about 8 months now. They’ve gotten along pretty well and he’s a nice young man.(they’re both 17 and seniors in high school) My daughter is in the school drama program and she had a play on Saturday. She wanted Justin to come and watch her with us and he obliged. So Justin is a pretty introverted person. Justin’s family is Korean-American and his parents first language isn’t English.(though Justin has been in the U.S. since he was 3 and his first language is English) On top of that Justin’s friends aren’t Emily’s friends and vice versa. Because of those factors he’s not really known among my friends and Emily’s friend’s parents. At the play me, my husband, and Justin were waiting in line to be seated and we come across friends.

We say hi and Lily we get asked who Justin is. I introduce Justin as Justin, Emily’s friend. Then there was a passing mention of Emily’s ex Benjamin. I didn’t know it was important at that time, but one of my friends Lily mentioned Benjamin as Emily’s former boyfriend. Justin didn’t say anything, we watched the play, it was great and we all went back home. An hour after we got home my daughter told me that Justin wanted to ask me about something. He asked why I introduced him to my friends as just a friend instead of boyfriend or he’s dating Emily. He said it would be fine for me to introduce him as a friend, but my friends know Benjamin as Emily’s former boyfriend and they dated for barley a month. He and Emily have been dating for 8 months, but gets introduced as just a friend while Benjamin is known as a former boyfriend.

I was flustered(because I wasn’t expecting the question) and I told him that it was because Benjamin and his parents are well known and connected with my friends and him and his family are not. So it was just more natural for my friends to know Benjamin as a former boyfriend and Justin(who my friends just met) as just a friend. Justin was not happy with what I told him and told me that he feels the connection explanation is a veiled shot at him being Asian instead of white. He also feels humiliated like he’s not good enough to be Emily’s boyfriend and that’s why my husband and I merely introduce him as a friend. I told him to stop being so ridiculous and that I’d introduce him next time as Emily’s boyfriend if he really wants.

I [32F] have been with my husband [34M] for 4 years in December. I have a form of high functioning autism called Aspergers. I got diagnosed as kid and to me, it hasn’t really affected my ability to be or act “normal”. It’s just a word I was given when I was younger to explain the kind of person I am and why I do the things I do. It’s not a conversation topic that ever really comes up probably due to the fact that I’m a really private person.

Recently after coming home from work, my husband brought up how he had a new coworker with Aspergers that reminds him a lot of me in the way I act and go about doing things. Such as how his coworker usually wears noise cancelling headphones at work versus me who gets very annoyed (think of almost a meltdown kind of annoyed) when there’s too much unwanted noise around me. His coworker has to have all his stuff set a certain way on his desk similar to how I can’t deal with whenever my husband moves something of mine. You get the picture. People with Aspergers have similar “symptoms.”

In this conversation, I said something along the lines of “yeah, I also have Aspergers.” He proceeded to quiz me including how long I’ve known, why I’ve never told him, who else knows, etc. He said that this changes things about our relationship and clears up so much things about me. Regardless of my “diagnosis,” I should be treated like a normal person. Giving a name to how I act and why I act like that doesn’t change anything about me.

My little brother, is doing an internship with a large corporation. He organized an internal food drive, in which the floor that donates the most wins free pizza for lunch on a Friday. 

At the conclusion of the food drive, my brother called the pizza place on a Monday and asked about the logistics of ordering 35 pizzas, on a Friday, during lunch hour. They said it wouldn't be a problem, and to place the order Wednesday morning. 

He calls back Wednesday, and speaks with the same manager. The manager tells him they can no longer do the order, as it's too big of an order to do during their Friday lunch rush. He recommends my brother try the middle of the following week, and they agree on the following Tuesday.

Monday rolls around and my brother places the order, and uses the corporate credit card to pay over the phone. The manager then tells him they cannot have 35 pizzas ready at 12:30, but can have 18 ready at noon, and another 17 ready at 12:45. My brother tells him that would work. When asked what to put on the line for a tip amount, my brother responds $0.

Noon on Tuesday, my brother shows up at the pizza place, picks up the first 18 pizzas, and delivers them to the winning office floor lunch room. Then, he returns to the store to pick up the remaining 17 pizzas. 

While waiting for the second round of pizzas at the store, the following exchange occurs:

Manager: ""Are you going to leave a tip?""

Brother: ""No.""

Manager: ""Usually with large orders like this you are required to leave a tip""

Brother: ""You aren't delivering or serving these pizzas. When we talked on the phone yesterday you did not mention a mandatory tip"".

Manager: ""It's corporate policy that orders this large require a 15% gratuity"". 

Brother: ""That isn't what we agreed to on the phone yesterday. I'm not leaving a tip"".

Manager: ""Well then you aren't getting the rest of your pizzas"". 

At this point, my brother and the manager begin arguing, escalating to the point of my brother's coworker pulling him to the side and recommending a small tip (5%). My brother relents. He tells the manager he will leave a tip, but he wants to choose the amount. He hands the manager his card, who runs it and hands him back a new receipt for the order, with a 15% gratuity assessed ($125 instead of $40).

763,Not the A-hole,"I have been dating my girlfriend for just under 2 years. We are in our early 20's. She is very close with my family, to the point where she will hangout with them without me without a second thought. I am slightly less close with her family but still have spent many many weekends there including family dinners for birthdays, Thanksgiving etc, it has always been a great time.  

Last Christmas, I was invited to Christmas dinner by my girlfriend's parents. Once her older sister (10 years older) got wind of this told us that she thought it was very inappropriate to bring a boyfriend to family Christmas and did not think I should come. This took us by surprise and a texting argument ensued. Unknown to the older sister, I did most of the responding as my girlfriend was so angry she would have said something she would have regretted. In this argument the older sister referred to me as ""your boyfriend of less than a year"" and told us that we were only in the infatuation phase among other strange and rather hurtful arguments to back up her position. 

Her parents apologized to me and said I was still welcome but I did have my own family gathering I was going to miss to go to my girlfriend's so I went for Christmas Eve and left before the older sister arrived. I had no trouble going there but didn't want to cause too much drama.

Flash forward a year to now, the sister again makes it clear that she believes boyfriends should not be allowed at Christmas. This year it's getting to me. The more I think about going to Christmas, making polite small talk, sitting across the table from someone that does not want me there, the more that just doesn't appeal to me. It's almost a matter of self respect. 

My options are:
Go to Christmas and pretend like nothing happened and play nice.

Tell them I would loved to have made it but I've got my own family thing so can't make it this year (not technically a lie but my big family get together will not be on Christmas but rather an earlier weekend)

I tell my girlfriend's parents I won't be coming because I don't want to be at Christmas with someone that doesn't want me there. This will cause a lot of drama because her parents won't stand for this and will try to get the sister to apologize which I see as a very slim possibility. 

Am I the asshole for pushing the envelope and causing more drama?",133,400,0.97

767,Not the A-hole,"I do my meal prepping and baking all in one go so I have food to get me through the whole week. I noticed my boyfriend was taking some. I didn't mind, I like that he likes my cooking/baking, so I just started to make double batches. One batch with my recipes usually makes between 10 and 14 of whatever it is (cookies, muffins, cupcakes, ect), which is around 2 a day for me, so double batches means between 20 and 28 of whatever it is. However, I've noticed that I'm still running out before the end of the week, which means he's having more than 2 a day. I've never approached this with him, as I know that when he's stressed he tends to overeat and he's got a lot going on right now.

I decided to make cupcakes earlier this week, and I made a chocolate cupcake base, but then I split the batter in two, and flavoured one with chilli and the other with mint. My boyfriend loves chilli, but I hate it, and I love mint, but he hates it. To differentiate, both flavours were coloured and then marbled. The mint chocolate cake was a visible swirl of dark brown chocolate cake and bright green mint cake. The chilli was a mix of dark brown and vivid red. When I was done there were maybe 10 mint chocolate and 20 chilli chocolate. Didn't actually count, so that's an estimate.

I figured those would last him until my next baking day, a week from that day, but it's been 4 days and he's already polished off all 20 cupcakes. Tonight, in a way that was not rude or angry or anything like that, he started talking about the cupcakes, asking me to make more of the chilli but not to make the mint ones again because he hates mint. I responded that I was going to make both because I don't like chilli. He then realised I made those cupcakes specifically for him.

What happened from there was a conversation where was asking me why I went out of my way to make two different batches of cupcakes, one he likes and one he hates, and eventually I admitted that I made those because I figured he'd eat the chilli and leave the mint chocolate alone. He asked why I did it like that and I said, in the nicest way possible, that he'd been getting through them pretty quickly lately and I wanted to make sure I had some for lunch.

\#He then got upset, saying that if he was overeating I should have said something, and I said, also getting upset, that I'm not about to start a log of what he eats. I said I'd noticed he gets through the baking I made pretty quickly, I wanted to make sure he had something he liked, and I liked that he liked my baking, but I also wanted to set some stuff aside for myself, and I didn't mean for it to start an argument. He replied that I was babying him, especially by making stuff that he would eat and stuff he wouldn't. He said that I might as well have held them out of his reach for all the dignity I left him. Then he said he didn't want to talk about this any more, and he's left to stay at his place tonight.

AITA?

&#x200B;

Info:  

I think he's just stressed. He's got about half a dozen projects all due before the end of the month and they're not exactly small pieces. He only ever overeats like this when he's stressed, so this conversation was probably something he'd brush off any other time, but when he's stressed it wasn't exactly the best thing I could have said.",319,446,0.96

It would be one thing if she wanted to borrow it for at certain times through the day and return it to me. But she wants it 24/7 that whole week. I’d also be happy to give her rides places to avoid cab costs, but she’s not asking for that and she says she doesn’t want to disrupt my day....

I’ve suggested a rental car a few times, she breezes over it. Today we confirmed the rental car for the week would be $130. Again she breezed over it. I really don’t see why she wouldn’t do that; she most certainly has enough money. (It’s not possible she doesn’t have the money, I know everything about her financial situation.) 

I don’t have two cars. Granted- I work from home so I’m not totally tied down to a commute. But I live in an area without public transit.

There’s an elderly gentleman that we see occasionally that I believe is her boyfriend. He’s very nice and polite. 

Last night as I was walking into my apartment, this gentleman came out of their apartment and spoke with me. My Spanish is rusty, but essentially he told me that he’s having issues with his pension and couldn’t make payments on the internet bill. They are now sans internet. He then asked me if I would give him the password to our WiFi so they could watch television, use the internet, etc. He didn’t offer to pay anything, so I’m assuming he means use for free for an indefinite amount of time.

Put on the spot, I told him I needed to talk to my roommate first, which was in fact true. My roommate is also on the fence, which is why I’m here.

1. First, I work from home and use the internet for work. I host webinars so I need a stable internet connection. The internet speed is 100 mbps. I don’t feel as though it’s fast enough to host a lot of devices. 
2. I get an internet stipend for work, so my roommate and I each pay $10/month for internet. I realize that’s extremely cheap so I don’t feel as though them using it for free is a legitimate reason to say no. 
3. They constantly have their adult children over. Every evening there are at least 5 people in the apartment. I’m worried that they’re all going to use it, slowing down the internet even more. 
4. I don’t think I can change the password to our WiFi, so if I give it to them, there’s no way to stop them from using for however long they want.

My house only have has two parking spots. One for me and one for my roommate. Because of the street parking being full all the time my roommate and I have a deal where we always park in the street first if we see a spot. That way our Gfs will be able to park in the driveway and not have to walk several blocks when they visit. They don’t come by everyday, but I also don’t always know when they’re coming by.

Today I got home early, so the street was extra busy. Luckily I saw someone pulling out of a spot just as I was pulling up, so I waited for them and took the spot. As I was opening my door to my house this guy honked several times. I turned around to see what had happened and this angry guy in his car. Seemed like he said “what the fuck” and gestured towards the empty spots in my driveway. I don’t deal well with confrontation so I just immediately went inside my house and shut the door.

So Y lived with my parents. Our mother passed three years ago and our dad gave O and me some of her ashes since we lived across the country. Y didn’t get any since he lived with our Dad. A little over a year later our father passed. O and his wife went out to take care of what they could and set Y up with what he needed to pay the mortgage until the house got sold. 

A few months later we find out that Y moved in with his girlfriend and hadn’t been paying the mortgage, home is foreclosed. O and I can only assume that both parents’ ashes are in there and we’ve lost the ability to spread them as we knew they wanted. Y tells us yes Mom was there but he has Dad. O’s wife, a bankruptcy lawyer, tells him what to do to get Mom. He never does.

A few weeks later I get a letter from the person who got the home. They found my Christmas card unopened and he was hoping to get the ashes he found to someone. Long and short we miraculously got Mom back.

We start trying to get Y to send us Dad so they can be spread back here where they wanted. He makes excuses for months. He finally admits that his car was reprocessed and his ashes were in there. Once again sister-in-law tells him what to do. He’s keeping us updated and he gets the ashes! We ask for a picture and he sends it. Says he will send them on our Dad’s 70th birthday for one last adventure. He then won’t answer our texts. I reverse searched the image and it is actually from a Reddit post asking if they were actual ashes or not. 

O is about ready to fly across the country and find out what is going on. I’m about ready to say he can’t have any of Mom’s ashes since none of us have Dad. WIBTA if I did this?

777,Asshole,"Back in the good old days of high school, I (20f) had a group of friends and we were all what you could call band geeks , if you subscribe to cliche stereotypes I guess. I had social anxiety and although I wasn’t quite what I’d call introverted I did find it hard to talk to other people, on top of that I didn’t take care of myself hygienically and I had cystic acne (yes I was a mess lmao). In our junior year a new guy transferred to our school and he became friends with someone in our group who introduced him to our group and we all hung out together regularly, we went to coffee shops and played video games together and shit like that. Long story short, I fell for him. Hard. Looking back on it, I cringe every time but what can I say? I have a thing for tall skinny guys but anyways. I tried to get close to him, bought him food a bunch of times and I even got him a really nice Christmas gift from my little money that I had saved up at the time. 

In our senior year we were all playing a drinking game and I discreetly asked my friend to dare me to kiss him, which she did and he kinda made a face and said in a snobby tone “tempting offer but nah I’m good”. That really fucking stung, and suffice to say we drifted after that and after grad we all ended up going our separate ways to different schools (or so I thought)

I’m now in my 2nd year at my state university and I was at a party this past weekend and guess who showed up... I was totally surprised, I thought I got far away from him and seeing him just brought back all those hurt feelings that I had and it kinda overwhelmed me. I tried to play it cool but I went over the edge when he spotted me and came to say “hi Shelby, long time no see!” , and I told him to go fuck himself and that I didn’t want anything to do with him.

Now I was almost in tears at this point and my friend saw that I was upset and we left the party. She brought it up again today and we talked about The situation and she asked why I talked to that dude like that. I told her what he did to me, told her that he probably only wants to talk to me cause I glo’d up (I started going to the gym and I went to therapy for my anxiety, and I got a lot hotter or so I’ve been told from tinder guys). She told me that he’s not obligated to reciprocate any feelings and that he did nothing to deserve that.

779,Not the A-hole,"A few months ago I was having quite a rough day. It was an off Friday and Thursday for me and I had an appointment with my doctor. She wanted to give me my updated tetanus shot and the last of my gardisil. Well the next day I was not doing well. I had an allergic reaction to both of the shots. I couldn't move my arm from the tetanus, was in extreme pain, my heart rate was 110 resting, I had a higher fever and I felt like I was going to die. I went to the emergency room where they helped me to mitigate whatever was happening (they gave me something to help drop my heart rate/anxiety) and a few hours later let me leave. At that point I was starving but really didn't want to cook. So I ordered some pasta online and waited for them to come.

I knew I wasn't contagious, but the pain and difficulty moving had spread to my left leg, so I really wasn't wanting to walk far or cook. The driver gets to my apartment complex and lets me know that they can't find the place and asks me to meet them at the front office. That was a big no, I couldn't walk more than 10ft without breaking down crying. It felt like I just tore my acl (again) in that leg and I knew I shouldn't do the stairs. So I asked if they could deliver the food to my door, gave them directions from the office and they were upset (verbally seemed to be exasperated) but agreed. Great. 

I got another phone call a minute later telling me that they didn't want to walk up stairs. I told her I shouldn't be doing stairs today and asked if she could please walk up them as I wasn't feeling well. She told me that she would just leave the food at the bottom of the staircase and call it good. At this point I was annoyed and said fine, I'll meet you. I hobbled down the 3 flights of stairs, limping and having a ton of difficultly managed to make it to the lady after 10 minutes. At this point my fever came back, I'm sweating, shaking a ton (which happened to my leg when I walked too much on it) and have a breathing problem (like where you can't stop crying and suddenly breathe in air, like that but not crying). She then hopped out of her car, offered to help me back up the stairs. I declined saying that, since she couldn't walk up stairs, there was no point injuring 2 people. After all she wouldn't say she couldn't do stairs unless she had a handicap. I hobbled back up the stairs and ate my meal after I was able to calm down.  

Later on I was pissed that this lady decided she was too lazy to walk up stairs and decided to report her for poor service. I told my SO about it and he told me I was acting like a Karen. All I did was write a poor review that said they refused to walk up stairs and wanted to abandon my food at the bottom floor unsupervised. That, I had to meet them downstairs while feeling ill and I probably won't be using this service again because of it (I kept to my word, I have stopped using the service). He told me that review could cause her to be fired and that I over reacted. AITA?

I hand out the Christmas presents for everyone.

I got a new apartment recently. It didn't take long to realize that my upstairs neighbor was extremely noisy constantly. It sounded like they were using a nailgun and I assumed they were doing something crafty as a hobby because this had been going on non-stop for weeks. I submitted a noise complaint and I thought that would be the end of it.

Apparently my neighbor is a blind person and uses a metal actuating device to engage in some form of echolocation to get around. They have been doing it for years and they say no one has complained before. The leasing office said they have to proceed with fining the resident unless I withdraw my complaint and it seemed like they were urging me to do it. The thing is... the sound really is unbearable to me and I can hear it at all hours which is specifically outlined to be not allowed in the leasing agreement. I have a minor form of misophonia and specifically chose this complex because of the more strict lease regarding action on noises. Everyone I've told about this is telling me to get over it and that I'm being an asshole. Its driving me crazy though. I can't live like this and the only other option for me is to move out and I can't do that for another 13 months. I offered the neighbor 200$ towards soundproofing, but they declined and said that it would ruin the effect of the echolocation.


I'm at a bit of a loss here and am going crazy. I'm not usually one to cave into peer pressure, but so far its been very strong. I actually do feel confused about this. I'm normally so sure of myself. To me it really does sound like a less aggressive nail gun. I downloaded a decibel counter phone app and it reads 45 when they do it.

Last year my sister brought her husband along. He went from offering to ""straighten us out"" all the way to calling us dykes within the span of a few drinks. At the time my sister defended me and they both apologised, claiming that he'd just had too much to drink, and we forgave him.

In February of this year we finalised the adoption process on our son.

We confronted him and they, again, said he'd had too much to drink, and asked us to forgive him.

Brother2, who does not live nearby, asks if he and his son could stay with us so he doesn't have to deal with mum and dad's rules, and (in his words) ""that fucker's bullshit"", referring to the brother in law, and we tell him he's welcome to the spare room.

And then I speak to my sister. She starts off asking why we're not coming to Hanukkah this year and I dodge the question. Sister then says she and her husband would like to see us, so can I please figure out at least one day where we can see each other. I give her a vague ""I'll check my schedule, we've got some stuff planned"". She asks if she and her husband can come to my place and stay over. I say that with Brother2 and nephew plus me, my wife and son, the place will be packed.

Eventually she directly asks me why we're avoiding them. I admit that we don't want to be around the brother in law. She calls me a bitch and says I can't hold a grudge when I forgave them at the time. I tell her I don't want him in my house. She says she's not about to damage her relationship with him for her relationship with me. I say I never asked her to.I hear her start to cry and she says ""no, you just excluded me from the fucking holiday instead"" and hangs up.

AITA?

&#x200B;

(To clarify: all the people who might be coming were agreed to by my wife and son before I confirmed it with them. While we wanted to celebrate as our own unit it was mainly to avoid the brother in law, and we'd planned to see my brothers and parents)",61,146,0.94
791,Not the A-hole,"Both 25, married for a year.

Wife is a teacher and needs to be up at 5AM, I don't need to be up till 8AM. She goes to bed every night at 10PM and I grew up a night owl, I enjoy staying up late past that for alone time and to dork around on my PC.

I always go to bed with her because I love her and genuinely enjoy laying next to her and kissing her goodnight, but she has become increasingly aggressive and frustrated by me leaving around 10:30 to go into the other room. She doesn't want to be alone, but typically we spend every moment together from the moment I walk in the door after work.

I struggle with boundaries and I am a people pleaser, so right now we have this unhealthy dynamic where I wait for her to doze off and I sneak out and if she catches me I tell her that I'm going to go get some water or something. It is making everything worse and I feel like I am lying to her.

I need perspective on this. One of my first ever Reddit posts so forgive me for missing etiquette or formatting.

Thanks.

Edit- Thanks for all the comments, I genuinely appreciate it. Surprised how large this got.

I think the solution is to sit down at a time things are calm and have a conversation about my boundaries on this. I want to be there and enjoy that quality time while she relaxes and falls asleep, but she needs to understand that I would rather spend my day with her while she is awake and spend some alone time when she is already sleeping. It all seems so reasonable when its typed out here on reddit but in real life its too easy to get lost in an argument.",893,6738,0.98

So I am going to explain my side of the story. I have a large family and they were visiting, I have literally 12-13 cousins all a similar age from 8-13. I am the oldest. We all went bowling, kids and adults. I am really good at bowling. Tbh I think it’s boring but I always hit strike so obviously I’m like yeah cool let’s do it. We wee bowling and I kept winning with the highest score. 

Now my uncles and aunts are annoyingly competitive and they’re the type to go ‘hey let my Timmy win this next round!’ And if my cousins don’t win they whine and have little tantrums. After a lot of games people were getting annoyed I kept winning, 

My mom and dad and grandma kept asking me to ease up or to ‘let the kids have a go at winning’ and my uncle actually said to me ‘you’re taking this too seriously kid’ and that pissed me off so I refused to play crap to appease him. 

Now my mom and dad and grandma think that because we were the hosts (they all came to visit us)  I should have been gracious and let the kids win. They think I should understand that family time is for the kids and I’m the oldest so I should get it.

I think that they’re ~~dumb~~ wrong for trying to make me cheat essentially just to spare their feelings.",549,2170,0.96

Anyway my other brother is getting married and we were having a pre wedding event, in my culture (Asian) there are many celebrations before hand so my SIL asked me to do her makeup. I said yeah for sure. 

I have LITERALLY IN THE LAST WEEK bought a $42 palette that is limited edition. I kept all my stuff close in my bedroom as I was doing her makeup. My SIL has my step niece in the same room because she is also attending the wedding festivities. 

I asked my SIL to please keep an eye on her daughter while I went to the bathroom to go wet some beauty blenders which are tools I needed for the makeup. When I got back my SIL was on the phone and my step niece had opened the palette (it is pink and has sparkly gems on the outside so I can see why she was attracted to it) and she was actually eating some of the eyeshadows.

Now it’s not toxic and perfectly safe to eat I *guess* ( but like... why would you) and I gasped and said no no no. My SIL was very very apologetic and kept saying sorry. I said look it’s fine but it’s destroyed, so I will need money for a new one.

She kept insisting I should have taken my makeup downstairs if I didn’t want my little niece going through my drawers and said that she is sorry but she isn’t paying for a new palette. My brother and mom and basically whole family is saying ‘OP you have money, just buy a new one yourself’ and yeah that’s true but I only have money because I never freaking spend it because I’m trying to save!!

My girlfriend of 3 years and I were watching a show which involved organ harvesting(family friendly fun right?), and so the topic got onto opt in/vs opt out organ donation She said that she would donate organs if someone she knew needed it.

So, it turns out her sister has some sort of degenerative disease? I don't really know what, but essentially her kidneys are slowly getting destroyed. My girlfriend and her family aren't a match. Apparently she's on the waiting list, but isn't really in risk of dying anytime soon. She flipped the fuck out, saying how selfish I was and that she would donate a kidney for someone in my family(I strongly suspect this is not true but I'll take her word for it here).

I responded essentially that I sympathize with her sister's problem, but I'm not prepared to commit to donating a kidney to her, and that the conversation had sort of spiraled out of control from what we were originally talking about.

She said she was going to her parents house and I haven't heard from her in a few days. I feel bad, but I'm going to donate my kidney to her sister, especially if she didn't even ask? I'm just very confused. I like her but this is just weird.",130,495,0.95

I personally am not happy that she walks home in the dark (seems unsafe and causes her stress) but she refuses when offered help and she will not tell me where she is if I tell her I'm coming to get her.

I didn't know how exactly to feel about his indifference, but I just shrugged it off and went about my day.

My mom got home later in the evening and she had got me a cake and card, which I appreciated and when my mom reminded my dad that it was my birthday, he said that I'm too old to be celebrating birthdays like this. My dad cared more about watching the Flyers game than he did my birthday. And when my mom was talking to me and wishing me a happy birthday, my dad just shouts ""I'm trying to watch the damn Flyers!""

Well when she brought it home it wasn’t neutered or house trained. Peed in the house 3 times the first day so I’m already frustrated that my stipulations weren’t met. 

Well fast forward to last weekend. I had a friend over hanging out in the living room and my cousin came home with the dog after being out and about. The dog cane and said hi and then 10 seconds after started to bark aggressively at my friend and started to lung at his face. My friend was very very uncomfortable and told my cousin to get her dog and once she did he left because he didn’t want to be threatened and now doesn’t want to come back when the dog is there. 

I was furious so I had to cool down and after a couple hours I went to her room and told her that the dog needs to get professionally trained or he can’t stay here as I will not tolerate that kind of behavior. If the dog bites somebody or something I am the one that is legally liable not my cousin.

She is quick to anger and can be extremely demanding to others (especially aimed at her two brothers) and sometimes even just a night out to dinner with her can be hard to get through because of the way she acts. I just wanna give a quick example, we went to my cousins wedding and had to sleep over my sisters house the night before. My son had a blanket on the couch, and left it there while he went to go make breakfast. Laura, when she woke up, looked at the blanket, then asked him furiously ""are you going to fucking pick this up? You're just going to fucking leave this here like some slob? Pick it the fuck up"" at a volume that most of the people in the house could hear. My son doesn't even want to talk back to her for fear of escalating her anger, so he just did it. Another example is that my son left a pan in the sink to soak before washing it, and she flipped a shit and started calling him lazy and a brat and all this stuff. Over one pan. One time she asked my husband to do Yoga and he didn't want to, and she basically started berating him for being unhealthy and making his refusal to do yoga into this big thing. One time my son was having a migraine and had to cancel going to his aunts dinner, and Laura just absolutely berated him and insulted him for not 'sucking the pain up and going'. That is a microcosm of how she acts, not only to them, but to us as well, and her boyfriends and friends. If she finds even the slightest thing wrong with someone, she will point it out, viciously. 

She can also be funny and charming and talkative! She isn't all bad. But she seems to have a problem when it comes to not being able to keep quiet over even slight things she finds annoying. 

We want to have a fun vacation. But the thought of being with her for a week makes us all groan. It only takes one of her 'attacks' at us to really dampen the mood, especially when she starts insulting peoples characters and demeaning them. Me and my husband try to calm her down and tell her she's being irrational but there's no point at all, she just aims it at us and escalates further.

Afterwards, I asked my ex if she had told her grandparents; no was the answer. She told me she hadn't, because it makes her nan happy knowing me and my ex are together (when we haven't been for quite a while at that point). I felt really bad for lying to her nan.

Yesterday I found out my ex was dating again. I immediately thought of her nan, and how she would feel finding out we lied to her for ages...when she sees her granddaughter's new love.

To add, me and my ex are friends. I talk to her as often as she likes, and I understand she will want to date people. None of what I did was in any way a revenge plan or something of the sort.

I let my ex know just before I messaged her nan the truth. My ex was not happy with this, but I told her nan anyway. I could hear over the phone what she was telling her mum; things like ""she's gonna hate me"" and ""she'll never wanna see me again"". I took all into consideration and then some.

I was, whilst messaging her nan, assuring her that I was not gonna make her nan hate her or think of her any differently...but she had to know.

I told her nan that: my ex had cheated on me a while back, but that it was my fault for not seeing that she was unhappy in the relationship; I had broken up with her because of it; we will still remain friends; not to think any differently of her, and that she didn't want to tell her because it made her happy knowing we were together.

Should I go to the salesman's boss (the president of the company) and raise this concern? Other people have driven with him and they say it's ""fun"" but not everyone is the same. I think he just has horrible driving habits that can result in a wreck.

819,Not the A-hole,"So I got a new pet. We named it and then changed it after a few hours. My BIL made a point of saying that their new niece was named the same name that we renamed our pet. The pet didn't look like the original name we gave it. The niece was born before we got the pet, and I did meet her at a party my BIL threw. I didn't remember her name, but maybe it subconsciously influenced our renaming of the pet? They are asking me to change it. To be honest, the new pet is so little that I wouldn't mind renaming it a third time. It's just a pet lol. But I don't want to as well because I think it's outrageous that they are requesting a name change. AITA and should change the name??

I offered the two best options to my oldest which a few days after I posted during dinner.

The first option was work as a salaried employee for his brothers' company for a few years while he learns the trade and then buy in for a partnership in the company. I would've sold him my share for a very fair price. This was the only way his brothers were willing to join the company. He rejected it immediately.

The second option was an apprenticeship I setup with someone I knew and respected. Unfortunately, this was based in Alaska and he rejected that as well, which I expected.

He then said a lot of hurtful things about me and his mother. I gave in and said I would teach him. Some people did suggest this on the first post.

He took all my tools and material the next few days and moved it to his garage. I've been going over to his garage workshop everyday for a few hours to try and teach him.

It's not going that great I have to admit.

I'm physically not in the best shape and he's getting frustrated by it. 

I'm just going to keep going with this and hopefully it'll get easier as he learns more.

I appreciate everyone's input on the first post.",1936,8376,0.96

I have surgery scheduled this spring and there’s a window of time that I won’t be able to fly. MOH chose a date that falls within that window in a location that I would have to fly to.

When I explained to MOH why I wouldn’t be able to make it to that city on that particular weekend, she said it had to be that date. I asked her if she would consider a different city and said I was willing to drive up to 10 hours. We live in northeast USA, so that gives us a lot of options for destinations. MOH said she wouldn’t change the location, but would look into changing the dates despite insisting earlier that changing the date wasn’t possible.

Long story short, she can’t change the date and refuses to change the location, so I told her I won’t be able to make it. Nothing is booked yet, but MOH will be booking airfare and lodging for Bride. As a bridesmaid, am I still expected to help pay for Bride’s airfare and lodging if I’m not able to go? I plan to send a bottle of champagne and some cash to cover Bride’s dinner/drinks for one of the nights that they’re out there, but WIBTA if I don’t contribute to the rest of the expenses when I’m not able to attend?

Edited to add: Bride doesn't know anything about the situation. She knows about the date, but not the location, and I haven't told her that I'm having surgery. The only reason I told MOH was to explain why that particular location and date combo doesn't work for me. MOH is the one insisting on the location.",104,429,0.95

827,No A-holes here,"This is kind of a stupid issue, or at least I believe so. Also please excuse any mistakes in my English.

For some context, I live in an apartment together with my partner of 6 years, we're two gay men. We've been having thousands of problems with our past internet provider so we recently decided to switch to a different one.

There's two different guys who have been coming this month to set up everything. One of them doesn't like to talk, he just does his job and leaves. The other one is older and kind of chatty, the sort of person who stays for a drink and snacks even though you only offer them out of politeness.

When I would be at home instead of my partner, and during the week it's usually like that because we work in opposite shifts, this older man kept calling him my roommate. I'm pretty sure he understands that we're together though, it's obvious, he just seemed uncomfortable to say it. So I didn't correct him, it's not like it mattered anyway or like we talked for hours as friends. We just talked about the internet and maybe some small talk in between.

However, when I told my partner about this he got a bit upset and said ""now the next time he comes over, I'm going to correct him"". I said don't argue with the guy, he's old and you know how older people are. My parents act weird in the same way when anything gay comes up, although they know I'm gay. Like, what can you really do. He doesn't agree though and thinks the guy's being disrespectful. On my side, I honestly don't think it matters what is in a random repairman's head, what he knows or thinks.

A black girl, 19, approached me today filled with rage, claiming that I was culturally appropriating her native bracelets. She said that I shouldn't wear them, specifically because I don't draw meaning to them, they don't serve a purpose to me, so I shouldn't wear them. So long as they actually meant something, I could wear them.

Am I the arsehole here? I get that I'm wearing bracelets that black people wear, but, I'm not even sure.

EDIT: The bracelets look like [this](https://s.put.re/cU29L6Tn.jpeg) and [this](https://s.put.re/fQTVraVQ.jpeg), unfortunately I tossed them afterwards.

EDIT 2: So to clarify, these bracelets, I just wear them, 4 on my right, 5 on my left. The images supplied are really close to what I was wearing, just differently colored, the issue is that I was wearin' them, unaware if they were actually religious in some way, I still think they're not, from her explanation it seems more like it's just offensive that *I* was wearing them, didn't really say anything else other than ""cultural appropriation"".

EDIT 3: I'm propping this answer from u/wobblebase, I think it's quite logical:

>It's a difficult IMO, cause we don't know what we don't know.  
>  
>I  think you would be TA if you were previously told that something had  cultural significance (or knew that as part of some larger social  discourse) and continued to wear it without learning about that culture.  But in this case you didn't know the bracelets maybe have cultural  significance. So this woman's reaction was overblown, but probably  informed by having an absolute shit time dealing with the impacts of  cultural & institutionalized racism. But now that you've been told  they may be significant, it's on you to check if the bracelets have a  specific meaning before wearing something like them again.",184,130,0.85
829,Not the A-hole,"Last night, my gf asked me why I’m friends with a pornstar on Facebook.


I was a little confused at first, but I realized she was talking about a girl from my home town with whom I was close friends (she had moved to the US when she was in her 20s and got in the biz - yes, I did watch a couple of her videos wayback), I'm not going to say who she is cause I know how weird the internet can get, but for the sake of the thread, I will call her Roberta. We aren't as close as we used to and haven’t seen each other in ages. She messaged me when I moved to the US (over 18 months ago) spoke about meeting up - which we never did - and sent me birthday wishes this year.


Anyway, gf starts asking me how I have her on my Facebook friends list and how awkward it is for her boyfriend to have a pornstar as a friend of Facebook. I explain who Roberta is and she says I have to unfriend her and cut all contact or we’re done as a couple.


Am I being unreasonable in not wanting to unfriend Roberta? 

To give some context, my gf and I have been dating for 4 months. I haven't watched porn in ages and have no desire for it, I am friends with Roberta on Facebook just because of our history together, nothing more.

Edit: I found out how she recognised who Roberta was, apparently on my birthday one of her BFFs boyfriends was on my profile and saw Roberta's post. He recognised her and it sort of became a running gag between him and his friends. His girlfriend found out and told my gf in a public group chat where all the female friends post. This is why she is so embarrassed. We spoke about it and she said it's fine she was just pissed off at her friend and lashed out on me :/ still no word on the ultimatum though...

Edit 2: I am getting some pms to give the screen name of the actress. Answer is a hard no.

Edit 3: her page is her normal person page, just images of her guinea pigs, cats. Food she cooks and some other stuff any normal person would post on their Facebook wall. She has no explicit pictures.

Edit 4: gf said she doesn't care if I keep Roberta as a friend or not, she was mostly pissed off at how her friend said it, and I got the brunt of it. We shall speak about it more this evening, and I promised to show her pictures of when we were still teenagers.

We always had a fairly affectionate relationship, but I never really thought much of it. About 5 months ago, John came out to me and I was completely supportive, but to be honest I started to consider some of his actions in a new light. 

For example, he tries to cuddle with me, hug me from behind, etc. I am completely supportive of him being gay, but some of these actions are making me uncomfortable. Also, he is pretty possessive and gets very upset if I ever spend time with a girl over him. He always says things like ""you don't care about me anymore!"", seemingly just to get me to say that I do. It's getting pretty exhausting, and frankly I am starting to wonder whether he has a crush on me based on his behaviour.

I told him about a month ago that I would appreciate if he reduced some of these behaviours, and he did not take it well. He was upset, and again it was about how I am trying to push him away. We haven't hung out quite as much since, but when we do there is just as much physical contact as before, even though that is one of the issues that I addressed.

I feel like I can't put up with this anymore. I want it to be clear that I have **no issue** with him being gay, but I would just prefer if these actions were not directed towards me.

She wants to bring her cat with her and due to various complications needs a place for her cat to stay for a few months.  She had someone to do it but recently that fell through, and she asked me if I could take care of the cat because I had previously said it was a possibility.  After discussing it with my spouse we agreed it would be fine and started discussing the details.  In the process, she said that she would ideally stay with us for ""at least a week"" while the cat got settled - as in literally in our apartment.  As aforementioned I don't know her very well and my spouse has never met her and expressed discomfort with the idea when I explained what she'd said.  I was pretty firm and said that her staying in our apartment wasn't going to happen and that I honestly thought it was a pretty unreasonable request for her to make.  I was under the impression that she would have a hotel room nearby and visit a few times in order to make sure everything was okay, or something along those lines.  In my opinion even if a close friend just invites themselves to my apartment for multiple days without me suggesting it first, that's an imposition.  Well, she is clearly upset with my answer, and doesn't see anything at all unreasonable about her initial request.  She's also stated that if she can't stay with us while the cat gets acclimated, then obviously ""what I'm offering doesn't fit with her needs"" so it seems that's the only option on the table for her, and I'm standing firm on my reply.  Maybe I'm just feeling sympathy because I understand the deep bond between a cat and their human and do wish I could help her out, but was I right or wrong for thinking her suggestion was a huge imposition and shutting it down in no uncertain terms?

Dinner partners or something.  She lets the cat walk on her counters as well.  Normally I would not care one way or another about this as it is her cat/house/life.  However, my friend recently had surgery on her abdomen and was basically out of commission for 3ish weeks.  She asked me to watch her cat so she would not have to bend down to change litter and whatnot.  

I happily agreed to watch the cat.  Now, as I said, I never cared about the cat being on friend's table and counters.  This changed though when I watched the cat myself, specifically when I changed the litter box.  It got me to thinking that the cat steps in this box where it uses the bathroom all the time, some residue is bound to be on cat's feet.  What I did after this was just scoop the cat down from the table and counters when he was on there and put him on the floor.  I also fed him his food in a dish, on the floor.  This was all due to me not wanting litter box feet on my surfaces.  I want to note here that I did nothing other than what I said.  I never rewarded the cat with treats or anything like that, but he did eventually stop getting on things a few days before he was returned to my friend.

He throws up in the morning.  He throws up in the shower. He throws up before bed. He throws up after he eats sometimes. He gets up in the middle of the night to throw up and sometimes doesn’t make it to the toilet. He has a tiny trash can next to the bed that he uses when he wakes up puking. He throws up out his window while driving. It’s out of control. He’s done this since I’ve known him (5 years) and his family claims he’s done it since high school. The problem lies where he absolutely refuses to go to the doctor for it. He gets mad at me when I beg him to go. He doesn’t care at all about his health. He doesn’t think it’s a big deal at all. I used to be bulimic, and when I went to the doctor, they told me all this terrible awful stuff that throwing up can do to your body. I actually had bleeding ulcers from it and it damaged my teeth pretty badly, and that was just after 6 months of it. He says I’m just projecting my past into him. That it’s not like he’s bulimic. He doesn’t understand (maybe he does and he doesn’t care) that this can cause SERIOUS health issues in the future. He literally tells me to “stop nagging about it and let me live my life”. He lies to me about when he throws up like I can’t hear him from the other room. But I don’t let it stop me. The only thing I can do it nag and argue about it in hopes he goes to the doctor one day. We argue constantly about it, more so now than before because it’s just been wearing down on me.

Throughout the years it went from like a once a week thing, to a multiple times a week thing, and now a daily/ multiple times daily thing over the span of these 5 years. It’s not that I was okay dating him for so long knowing this was an issue because I didn’t know for a long time. He hid it well.

So I’m in a 5-year masters program for design that is incredibly rigorous. I’m talking 100+ hours of work per week on one “Studio” class and our college’s program is known for its students staying up all night to complete near-impossible projects. These projects will typically last about 8 weeks at a time. That being said I have maintained A’s throughout my years in this program and am very proud of my work. 

This most recent project was assigned yesterday and although work was normally individual, this project would be particularly difficult, so its a group project. I don’t usually work well in groups, but theres a couple classmates who could really add to my skillset and help create a great project, no big deal. There are also particular students who I feel like I would just be dragging along and redoing all their work to make it my level of acceptable. I’ve always hated carrying people in groups in normal classes, so I wasn’t about to do it in this 5 credit hour class. 

Enter Mia (changed name). Mia is the polar opposite of me and one of those people I knew I would definitely end up carrying. She is unmotivated (always on her phone/watching Netflix when she should be working on her projects), lacks basic design skills, lacks basic presentation skills, lacks basic self care (ie. Washing hair and brushing teeth) and her work/presentation/grade visibly suffer from it. I would never tell her this, but I think she should have switched majors years ago, she’s just not cut out for the pressure this major puts on a student. 

Now Mia was the only one left over with one other student that struggled as much as she did. She comes over to one of my group members with a much softer heart than mine and cries to her about how she cant be in a group with the other lazy kid Because it’s too stressful and unfair. My group member said “yeah, i think you could join our group.” I was silently panicking and approached our third group member quickly to try to quietly convey that I wasn’t okay just tacking on a dead weight group member. And over comes weepy Mia now crying so the whole class (including the prof.) is watching and basically announces “you don’t want me in your group??” And I basically had to try to nicely reject her in front of all my peers and ended up saying “wellllll, I don’t really work well with others and working with 2 people is already a lot, plus I think we already have our bases covered with the people we have.” 

My groups members quickly ran over the end of my sentence to cave to her tears and let her in the group. I expressed my dislike for being railroaded like that to my group members, but they keep trying to tell me “it’ll be fine”. I got so frustrated to a point where I said I’ll throw her under the bus if she’s not going to do her part.

At first she was looking around and then back at me with the most upset face I had ever seen, she looked at me as if I had two-heads.

I just smiled and looked back at my nintendo DS (lol), she covered my screen and said ""um hello, you stuck out ur foot?? You could have killed me!""

I didn't even know what to say to that, my feet were parallel to the two people sitting beside me (I was the closest to the subway door"".

I again smiled and looked back down.

She made a huge fuss and I heard mumbles and groans from the other passengers, one guy even went as far as to tell me ""Dude, just fuckin' apologize""

I kept denying, and she eventually got off, but before she did she said ""Kid's these days have absolutely ZERO awareness for their surroundings because of their electronics""

When she got off the dude sitting beside me told me it would have been easier to ""apologize and move on w/ my day""

850,Asshole,"About a month-and-a-half ago, two new neighbors moved into my apartment building. We live in a complex where each building is a 3 floor set of 12 apartments with a central hallway and staircase and a single outside access door.

Shortly after they moved in, we started smelling it. Our neighbors smoke pot. Now look, you do what you want to do as long as you're not hurting or impacting anybody else. However, they must either have the worst dealer or the worst taste in weed, because it smells so rank. I don't like the smell of pot smoke to begin with, but this stuff smells like some horrendous combination of pot and feet and ass.

Again, you do what you want to do, provided it doesn't impact anybody else. Well, the entire apartment building now smells like weed five or six days out of the week. on the days it's particularly ripe in the hallway, it even seeps into my apartment.

I reported it to the building management and they put a letter in every tenants mailbox reminding them that smoking anything is a violation of the lease and is illegal in my county. I didn't call them out by name because I was hoping in general announcement which is what my landlord normally do would just be sufficient to get them to at least go in the bathroom with a vent or switch to edibles or something.

Nope, it settled down for maybe five or six days and then here comes the smell again.

I reported them directly and I got a letter from my landlord this week telling me they specifically sent a direct communication to that apartment letting them know they need to knock it off. In the letter, they asked us to call the police and report it next time we smelled it.

Now, I don't believe for one second that the cops in my area are going to give two shits about pot smokers in an apartment building, but I'm really sick and tired of having my living space disrupted because they've never heard of gummies. 

So I turn to you. I'm pretty sure calling the cops and having them investigate is my landlord's mechanism of being able to document what they are doing and evict them on the spot.

851,Not the A-hole,"My daughter, ""Lily"", is 2.5 years old. When she was 18 months old my mother in law, ""Sharon"", looked after her alone and she got Lily's ears pierced with a piercing gun at the mall.

I asked Sharon what exactly possessed her to do that to my child and she said that Lily's hair was too short so she made her look ""girlier"", and she called me a hypocrite as I had my ears pierced but wasn't willing to do the same for Lily. I told her that I got my ears pierced at 18 in a professional piercing place and she had no right to do that, but Sharon said that she was responsible for Lily at the time so it was her choice, and that Lily would probably want her ears pierced eventually anyway.

The piercings got infected and the GP advised taking them out after the infection cleared up, so I did. Sharon is still upset that the piercings were removed and wants to get them redone by the same store. I banned Sharon from seeing Lily, and this was upheld for about 3 weeks, at which point my (soon to be ex) husband invited her over. Since then Sharon has been aware that she's on wafer thin ice with me, and has not done anything harmful or detrimental to Lily. However, I am fairly confident in stating that the reason she hasn't done anything harmful or detrimental to Lily is that she has yet to be left alone with her. I've not left Sharon alone with Lily at all in the past year, just in case she tries something.

My husband and I need to go sign divorce papers on Friday. Everything is ironed out and we won't be fighting, it's just a matter of signing the agreed terms.

Sharon has gotten in touch, knowing Friday is the day Lily does not go to daycare, and has said that if we want someone to watch her while we sign papers, Sharon is ""more than happy to look after her"" and has said they can have a ""girls' day"". If Sharon did watch her then I'd need to bring Lily to her an hour before the meeting, and Sharon would bring Lily back whenever (Sharon's exact words: ""I'll bring her back whenever I'm ready"") which does not sound good.

There is no one else available to watch Lily and she's not booked in to daycare during the time I will be with the lawyers. I asked the daycare if there was any way we could extend her hours but they said all changes needed to be 2 weeks in advance, and I only got the time/date for signing the papers yesterday.

The main guy running the team is a 30 y.o guy. Now, I've felt that this guy has always had something against me. And one time, he straight up admitted that he didn't like my etiquette but when I asked him to name specific examples he refused. I remember one time he told me to not wear shorts (they were khaki shorts) to work and when I asked why, he simply told me to google it. And according to google, it seems to be OK to wear shorts to work, so no idea what he was thinking.

So the other day, we were having our daily standup and I happened to be chewing gum (something I do very often btw). For these standups, it's mostly the guy talking and getting updates from us while we listen in. At one point, he asked about how my project was coming along and then he stopped and said pretty rudely ""are you chewing gum? go spit it out"" I was having a bad day and didn't want to get pushed around, so I asked him why I can't chew gum.

My dad informed me that ""they weren't getting a divorce but they were just splitting up for a while"" and that my stepmom and sister would be back soon. I live my baby sister to pieces so the thought of being away from her for who knows how long, without even getting a chance to say goodbye, devestated me. I took to Facebook and texting to message my stepmom and she would tell me how my sister was doing and send me pictures of her. A few months later, my dad made me unfriend my stepmom and block her. I went months without saying a word to her and was beginning to lose hope of ever seeing her or my now 10 month old sister again. About a week ago (Oct 16) I decided to try and text her again.

My husband and I have been trying for kids for a while. He, as it turns out, has azoospermia, which is no sperm. We've been taking about donors, and he's only comfortable with it if it comes from his brother. Adoption isn't something we could possibly afford right now, and I don't love the idea of a 3rd party getting to call all the shots about us having children. Eric has donated before in college and currently has a son with a girlfriend. He's a little smarmy and self important, but not a bad person. So we asked him, and now I have regrets. 

He sent a very detailed email in which he went into excruciating detail of all the reasons he felt we wouldn't be good parents, and what we'd ""need to change"" before he would ""give us"" a child. At the risk of making this post as long as the email itself, there were two main points. 

1. He didn't feel that our income was high enough. He demanded to see financial records. He wanted to see his brother more advanced/settled in a career, and wanted to know my career trajectory as well. Both of us have been in the same companies for 5+ years, and don't have dead end jobs. He also wanted us in a house and not an apartment. 

2. He felt that I and his brother needed to get therapy for ""being different"". Along this line, he wanted his brother to ""act more normal"". We would also need to convert and follow their family's religion and ""not be a heathen"".

864,Not the A-hole,"I made a new friend about 7 months ago from a local crafting meetup. She had a bit of an edge, but we had a good connection and started hanging out. I’ve even invited her to hang out at family gatherings.

About a month ago, she confided in me that she has been in recovery for over a year from a meth addiction that nearly took her life. She showed me a picture of her at a rock bottom moment. I was shocked at the difference between the picture and her now. Her commitment to recovery and staying sober seemed sincere. 

However, years ago I had a childhood friend who fell hard into a meth addiction and it completely destroyed his life and relationships. He was in and out of sobriety over the years and even moved in with my husband and I for a short while after landing a new job and trying to get back on his feet, but he started using again. He constantly lied and was really erratic. It was so hard for us to see him relapse when he was doing so well stabilizing, but we asked him to move out. We saw him a few times afterwards, and it was clear that he’d always be tied to his addiction. 

So when my new friend told me about being in recovery, I immediately knew I had to put up clear boundaries. I told her, “I’m really proud of you for being sober. I know that it can be really tough and you seem so strong and committed to staying sober.” Took a big sigh, then followed with, “I do want to let you know that if you relapse, I can’t be your friend. I can’t have that around my family nor can I support you through that. I can’t have that kind of weight in my life. I’ve been through this before with a childhood friend and got burned. I hope you can understand.” 

She said she totally understood and could respect my position. We moved on and that was that. 

A week ago we had plans but texted me saying “Hey, I can’t lie to you - I used again for the first time in over a year. I’ve been going through a lot. I’m sorry. I know you said you wouldn’t keep being my friend if I used again. I totally respect that. But I just wonder if I could see you and explain why I used again.” 

I appreciated that she told me the truth, but I had to stick to my guns. I told her I was sorry to hear but no I wouldn’t meet with her. I asked her if she had a plan for support - rehab? family support? She said she had no plan, or friends/family. I told her that I thought she was a great person and hoped she got the help she needed to stay sober, but I couldn’t be her friend. That was the last text from me but she has called, texted and emailed me a few times. I haven’t responded (and its making me uncomfortable how much she keeps reaching out).

For background, I (22F) am very petite, fit, and just by looking at me one would not guess I have a physical disability. 2 weeks ago, I had surgery with incisions on my spine and one butt cheek making walking more difficult temporarily. Though, I have a handicap placard not just because I had surgery, but for the overall problem that me to be unable to walk long distances.

I’m not asking AITA for refusing to give up my spot, but because of what I said. My brother thinks I went too far, but I think I afforded the woman the same amount of respect she gave me.

&#x200B;

I was going out to dinner with my brother (passenger seat.) I pulled into one of 4 handicap spots in front of a restaurant and the woman (late 60s) in the car to my right immediately opened her door to block my brother from getting out. We waited a few seconds, and it became clear this was intentional. I got out of the car and asked her if she would close her door.

&#x200B;

The woman immediately started berating me, saying I had no right to use the handicap spot as other people “that actually need it” would be unable to park. Apparently, I am young and skinny enough to suck it up (though she doesn’t know what my disability is) and deal with parking far away. She called me an entitled brat and accused me of “scamming the government to support \[my\] lazy ass,” among other things. I told her a doctor saw fit I get a handicap placard, and when she said I look “fine” I told her that my medical history is none of her business. She continued to insult me, even calling me a lazy bitch at one point, and refused to close her door.

I eventually had enough and let her have it. I told her something along the lines of, maybe if you didn’t eat yourself into debilitating obesity others ‘that actually need it’ would be able to use your spot. She tried to respond by saying her weight was due to medical issues, to which I cut her off to say if she’s going to make assumptions about me I will do the same. I called her a miserable old bitter bitch and told her at her big old age she should have learned to mind her business. She threatened to call the police on me for reasons she was unable to verbalize and I told her to go ahead and pointed to the restaurant we were going to and told her to send them in.

870,Asshole,"So this is a bit of a complex situation.

Around four months ago I (M19) met a guy on a dating app who was looking for a boyfriend. We'll call him Calvin (M23). Calvin is a sweet romantic, and clearly has a big heart. I agreed to meet him. This meeting went well. We had decent chemistry.

My most serious problem however is that Calvin has a girlfriend. Let's call her Brianna (F21). She and him have incredible chemistry and from what little I know about love, they clearly have it. She totally is on board with him having a boyfriend and in fact is totally into it. According to Calvin, she wanted him to explore his sexuality if he felt comfortable about it (he's bisexual, she's straight), and he has done so. Brianna and Calvin have been together for five years and are wonderful people. I think him having a boyfriend would work fine for them (based on they're behavior with me).

Of course it didn't work out between us for more reasons than that, but that was definitely the deciding factor. It's just not a relationship I felt comfortable being in, and I explicitly told Calvin this wasn't my thing. He was fine with that, and we're still friends.

My problem is, he is still hung up on the idea of finding a boyfriend in addition to his girlfriend. He says he still loves her, and I don't doubt that, but every time a date with a guy doesn't go well for him he becomes self destructive (no guy could ever love me, I'm too ugly, etc.) and I have to tell him that he's not and basically build him back up. He lives in a rural area where the only men attracted to men are elderly and closeted.

I've thought about telling him the next time he does this that the problem probably isn't him, it's that the situation he's asking for (a gay/bi man dating a bi man in a LTR with a straight woman) is incredibly hard for an already narrow segment of the dating pool to enjoy. In theory a relationship like that might work, but in practice it can be a different story.

I've had this conclusion for a while (around the time I realized I myself wouldn't enjoy it), and think it might get him to stop putting himself down and focus on the fact that he has a loving girlfriend and just enjoy what he has. I really just want him to be happy, but realize he's asking for might a pretty tall order.

871,Not the A-hole,"Wife gave birth to our first child last week, mom and baby are happy, healthy, doing great. 

The delivery mostly went very smooth, but some comments and reactions from the maternity nurse really rubbed me the wrong way. 

The thing is I’ve never been in a room where a baby is being delivered before so don’t know if my wife’s behavior was abnormal and the nurse was responding to that or if the nurse was out of line. 

For example my wife went in planning on an all natural birth and was really screaming through her contractions. At one point the nurse was doing something and said “Could you not scream *right* next to my ears?” 

When my wife and I first came in we were obviously very nervous and when the nurse went to insert some IV fluids the doctor decided she needed into her arm she pulled away at first and said “wait, what’s that, I’m doing this all natural. That’s written down somewhere right? I want to be sure everyone’s on the same page.” 

And she was definitely frantic and firm about it. But I figured she’d be cut some slack because she was in labor. But the nurse said (don’t remember exactly because I was a bit preoccupied) “Relax, it’s just IV fluids. I can read a chart too.” 

Then when my wife decided she wanted an epidural this same particular nurse said in a mocking tone “but I thought you were doing it all natural? Are we not *on the same page?*” I wanted to request she be rotated away from us but there was no opportunity to go discreetly talk to someone, I had to stay by my wife. 

I was going to have family say something but by the time my in-laws got there this nurse had gone off shift. 

Soon we had a baby and this was the last thing on my mind but it really rubbed me the wrong way and I brought it up with my wife today and she said “Oh I was so crazy, I don’t even remember what I said or did. It’s not worth calling. I wasn’t feeling very courteous.” But in my mind all pregnant women giving birth are kind of loud and frantic. 

So would I be the asshole if I complain about  her or was she just responding to the hostility in the room?",112,161,0.93
872,Not the A-hole,"My child is 2. She’s an easy going toddler who eats, naps well, and plays nicely. My MIL offered to watch all of the grandkids. She’s raised 5 kids of her own, and now watches 2-3 grandchildren, including ours. We both work full time jobs, and I moonlight as a fitness instructor for  3 nights a week. It’s only a few hundred extra per month, but it’s enough to help out, gives me a free gym membership, etc. 

Ever since I went back to work, she’s been in my MIL’s care. And I haven’t been happy. As small baby, she’d be left in my MIL’s 13 year old sons care while she goes off, (she has a small part time job that’s a few hours a week.) which she wouldn’t tell us. Multiple times, she had fallen off the couch napping. Her diaper won’t be changed. I’ll pick her up and she has a rash, or a really saggy diaper. Sometimes, old poop stuck to her rear.
A few months ago, we were at a family party, watching a movie. My daughter got fussy, so grandma said she would take her for a walk. While we were all sitting in the basement I just hear my child’s name and then a series of thuds. My MIL didn’t watch her, and when they came back from the walk she fell down 20 steps into the basement, on the concrete floor. She was fine, luckily. 

My MIL was apologetic, but I was LIVID. My husband said I was an accident. 
I insisted that she be in daycare. My husband wanted to save money. We compromised, and she spends 2 days at daycare, and 3 with my MIL.
Today was the final straw. I got pictures whilst at work of my toddler with a giant black eye. Apparently, the kids were not being watched (by MIL’s admission) and something happened, and now my kid has a giant shiner. Again, she was apologetic, but still, it happened because of negligence. We don’t even know how it happened at all, because she and her cousin, (who is 3) weren’t being watched.
My husband and I disagree completely on what to do. My MIL shouldn’t watch our kid. It’s time to put her in daycare full time. His reasoning for the black eye was “well, things happen to kids, and we don’t know if it still wouldn’t have happened had she been watching.”

It’s not even worth confronting my MIL about. We’ve had the same issues for 2 years. I feel like an idiot and I don’t feel my child is safe in her care. My husband feels as if though we can’t afford to send her full time.
And yes, it’s expensive. But we can try and cut things and make it work, lots of people do this. I even offered to get a third job.
Here’s the thing, my husband isn’t usually like this. He’s currently going through candidacy for an organ transplant, and has been overwhelmed. He works full time in IT, and his reasoning is he’ll have to stop working after the procedure for a while. He isn’t wrong, but I don’t think my toddler is safe. AITA?",181,589,0.96

876,Asshole,"My friend Nick recently started dating Amanda. Our group of friends and I don't know much about her as she tends to keep mostly to herself whenever we're around. The most noticeable thing is that Amanda tends to dress in very revealing outfits but looking at her social media we saw her dressed in different types of styles as well. Nick dresses (or used to dress) like an office dude. 

This week it was my birthday, I decided to have a dinner party as I wanted to invite my parents, my friends and some of my coworkers as well and this seemed like a safe option. This was something I have been planning for a while now and I mentioned said plans in front of Nick and Amanda multiple times. I sent out the invites and didn't think much of it. 

Dinner comes around and to my complete shock both Nick and Amanda showed up dressed inappropriately. Nick was wearing a half unbuttoned shirt with cargo pants while Amanda was wearing a bustier with a deep v neckline and a mini skirt with criss cross straps on both sides. I felt mortified because everyone was staring at them and a lot of people became uncomfortable. Even our own friends. That's not even mentioning the people that work with me.

After 30 minutes or so I decided to pull them aside and try and figure out what happened. Nick then told me that they were going to a party afterwards and it would be a hassle to change before going so they decided to just be ready for the party. I asked if they were aware of the people I had invited and that it was really humiliating for me to have them show up like this. They got upset and Amanda said I hadn't said anything about clothing and I replied by saying that I thought they had common sense. This was when things started to get heated, my boyfriend came to help cool things off but I was so angry at this point that I told them to leave and go to their party because they had made enough damage.

They left but Amanda started crying and Nick called me an asshole. Dinner went on without any incidents but a few people were still talking about them. When I looked at social media I saw that Amanda had me blocked but Nick was making passive/agressive posts about friendship and respecting people's lifestyle/choices. They made enough of a fuss after that some of our friends that were at the dinner party started to mention how I should apologize to them. There's also a joke about who will be kicked out at my next birthday and that maybe I should start a list of requirements now.",66,152,0.91
877,Not the A-hole,"Obligatory this happened a few years ago, but I am wondering if I was TA in this situation. Also on mobile, so sorry for formatting issues. 

My friend’s mother bought a house in a city as a rental property. She wanted some “test tenants” and I moved in with my friend, A, and two roommates, her friend B, and my former coworker from my college job, C. Because A was the daughter of the landlord, she was given the role of “housing liaison.” Effectively this meant that all landlord concerns went through her and all bills were to be in A’s name. 

After we moved in, we discovered a serious pest problem. Landlord had purchased a house that was a foreclosure and had sat vacant for 2 years, but had not brought in an exterminator. We had rats and mice (killing ~10 mice a day). A and landlord said they would resolve the problem soon. 

About a month after moving in, I got a summer job which provided housing/food as part of my stipend, so I spent most nights away from the house. When my job ended, the pests had gotten worse. In addition to rats and mice, the house now had an infestation of two types of fleas and roaches. I also learned that my roommates were filthy. Piles of dishes in the sink, rotting food on the counters, and food wrappers spread throughout the common areas. The dog had peed on my couch and it had stained. The internet was out because A didn’t have enough money in her account to pay the bill. All my kitchen stuff had been moved from the cabinets to in front of my bedroom door because “there wasn’t room for them.”

I asked A to speak to her mother about the exterminator, and she said she would not because one had been called and her mother “had better things to do” than call again.

At the end of the summer, I started teaching. I would bring a lot of papers home when I would spend the night there and not my partner’s place. Despite me asking when I signed the lease, and there being a drug-free clause in the lease, A and B were smoking pot in the house. I made it clear that, as a new teacher, I wanted plausible deniability, but they smoked enough to make the house and my work papers smell. I asked them to chill out on this and was met with “it’s my house too.” 

Things came to a head when roommates decided that we needed a gun in the house, which I was completely against. After 6 months of being in this lease, I had had enough. I tried to break my lease saying things weren’t working out. Landlord said that roommate issues weren’t her responsibility and that I was in for another 6 months. 

Here’s where I feel like TA. After being shot down once, I asked to terminate my lease early again due to the fact that there were drugs in the house and it could endanger my teaching license. Landlord let me out of the lease for one extra month’s rent. A and roommates were livid with me for telling the landlord about the pot, but I felt there was no other way out of my situation.

But what I haven’t noticed until a week ago, was that she has been “mommying” me for the past couple months. I’ll show you what I mean.
 
I stubbed my toe the other day and let out a “fuck”. Then she came to me, and said we don’t use these words in this household. I tried to do my dishes, then she comes along and takes the dish away from my hand and asks me to play with the kids. While we were having dinner, she gave our children some mashed up vegetables. Then she proceeded to give me some too. “Don’t forget your vegetables, honey”. During the same meal, she gave me half her mutton. I tried to give some back to her, but she insisted. While I was doing our laundry, she asked me to stop and watch some Netflix. Then she proceeded to do the laundry. I tried to help her, but she pushed me outside. (Not hard, more of a flirty fighting thing). I broke my leg, nothing too bad, just some crutches. She literally took care of most of my chores for that week. I don’t want to do nothing. 
 
So yesterday, I asked her about it. She hasn’t noticed, shocker. I sternly ask her to stop “mommying” me. She starts to cry. I felt like a total ass. We did cuddle afterwards, and we did reconcile. But I still notice that she is “mommying” me, albeit slightly less.

My wife and I rent my grandmother's old house which is a quarter mile away from my parents house.  We pay minimal rent due to them wanting to be fair to us for being their child.  Ordinarily this would not bother me except for the fact my mother brings it up every time we have a disagreement.  My mother also watches our one year old while I am at work and my wife is at school.

    Our yard hasn't been mowed for 2 weeks and the grass is turning brown and going dormant for the winter. Yesterday my mother mention to my father that she didn't care how pregnant my wife is she should be able to mow the yard. She knows full well we have had complicated pregnancy's in the past and this one is no different.  

    Well naturally my father has been getting yelled at about our yard not having been mowing for 2 weeks.  He calmly told my wife that on my next off if either one of us could mow the yard it would be great because he is tired of being yelled at. He also may have mentioned what my mother said so he could get some support in his own house because she was being a judgemental ass. 

   Well fast forward about ten hours when I get home from work.  My wife has been stewing about the comment my mother made. While talking about our respective days my wife mentions that the our house needs to be sprayed for spiders and other bugs, and while I am down at my parents house retrieving our bug sprayer I should talk to them about how my mothers comment hurt my wife's feeling and explain our situation again.  

   I calmly explain to both my mother and father that we have a high risk pregnancy and my wife did not need to be mowing the yard and more over her comment hurt my wife's feelings, that she care more about the appearance of the yard than the health of her future grandchild.  She didn't really have anything to say about that, but she did launch in a giant tirade about how we are ungrateful that we live in their house, we don't appreciate anything they(she) does, and how nothing they(she) does is every right. For about ten minutes I stood there and listened to her yell at me about how anytime we have an issue with the we march down to their house and jump down her throat.  This is the first time in 5 years that we have been living here that I have mentioned anything to her about something she has said. I did not yell, scream, or even change my stance.

892,No A-holes here,"Recently, I have been eating significantly less for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I've also recently taken up extensively working out and running, so my appetite has been all over the place recently. I snack a lot more throughout the day, and I eat when I feel hungry. I do not abstain from food, nor do I have any eating disorders. 

My friend (who is also my roommate), however, seems to think otherwise. She's previously suffered from anorexia, and has since recovered (at least in terms of weight, she does relapse at times but it's gotten much more infrequent and she's generally doing much better than before). Whenever we're out for a walk or for lunch, she makes multiple comments about my weight, and at times it gets quite uncomfortable. Whenever I ask her to stop, she tells me she's just worried about me and brings up her previous issues of anorexia. Although I appreciate the concern, I feel as though it is incredibly overbearing and invasive.

Recently, however, she's been bringing me food that I did not ask for during the day, or giving me extra portions during meals. I eat them out of politeness, but I always tell her not to do it right after, and that I am not suffering from any disorders.

It's progressed to the point where she came into my workplace today with my lunch, even though I had my own. I took it at the time, but I later called her to tell her to stop, and how unprofessional it is. She didn't take kindly to that, and is now ignoring me.

He married a woman that looked almost exactly my mom, which creeped both me and my mom out. Besides that, she was vindictive, petty, and resented me to the point of trying to get me institutionalization for my developmental disability. My dad went along with it, because he didn’t wanna get divorced twice, and was basically under her thumb. This led to me resenting my dad.

Fast forward to now, we’ve slowly been working on our relationship. He calls me every Wednesday, and he’s a much better person when my stepmom isn’t around. A couple weeks ago, he said he wanted to come visit. I said he could, and politely asked if he could not bring his wife with him.  I didn’t demand anything, I just said that I thought it would be less stress for both of us. He said he’d think about it.

On the weekend of his visit, he tells me to meet him in the parking lot near my dorm. Surprise, he brought his wife with him. We’d planned to see It 2, since we both like horror movies, but his wife hates them, so we have to go see Downton Abbey, which was the most boring movie I’ve ever seen. Then we were gonna go eat Chinese food, but his wife hates it, so we eat at some vegan restaurant instead. 

All my plans I was really excited about got ruined, and I pulled him aside to ask if he could next time, at least warn me about her coming. He got offended at that.

My friends and I usually sit in the first or second row to avoid distractions and people talking. If people are being annoying, having conversations or making disruptive noises, I either shoot them a look or whisper-ask them to keep it down, which they're usually cool with doing. 

This morning, I'm in this lecture and I realize that the person directly behind me is having a conversation with someone.

I’ve never heard my daughter mention this kid before, and I do not know her parents. I asked around, and I don’t know anyone else who knows her parents, either. Furthermore, I find it very odd that the rsvp wasn’t the parents phone number.

907,Not the A-hole,"EDIT 2:
Because this post gained traction, I showed it to Amanda. She’s clarified some information for me, and apparently Kayla had lied to be about a few details. Amanda didn’t officially date Kayla’s friend, but had a crush on him. Also Kayla liked the boy, but the boy didn’t like her back in a romantic way. They stopped being friends over petty arguments. They became friends again during senior year recruitment, but due to the bar incident stopped being friends again. Amanda said they had gradually been drifting apart, and that she was tired of being ‘controlled’ by Kayla. 

Background: I met one of my best friends from college on Tinder. I will refer to her has Kayla for ease of typing. Things didn't exactly work out between us, and we decided it would be best to be friends. She’s a huge reason why I went Greek, and I met a lot of my friends through her. When she wasn't in relationship(s), I was her go-to date to her dateparties and formals. I was also there for her emotionally when her relationships(s) unfortunately took a turn for the worst. Last year, Kayla tried to set me up with one of her friends, whom things did not work out with. Rather, I hit it off with her off-and-on best friend. I will refer to this best friend as Amanda. 

Amanda and I quickly started to become friends with no romantic interest. We just thought eachother was cool as fuck. This did not sit well with Kayla. Kayla got extremely mad at me for ""going around her back"" and ""trying to get with her best friend"" because ""all my guy friends hit on her."" Kayla decided to not talk to me for two weeks until a mutual friend made us meet up at the library to talk things out. Because I valued Kayla's friendship, I told her I wouldn't initiate conversation with Amanda. However, I also told her that I wasn't going to staright up ignore Amanda if she reached out or if we saw each other on campus. Things seemed fine. 

Fast forward 6 months. We're all graduated. Amanda reaches out to me and asks me to come to the bars to hangout with some college friends and tells me she wants me to meet her friend as well as her boyfriend. I'd expressed interest in the friend before, and agreed to go. While at the bars, a group picture was taken and posted on social media. Kayla sees this and goes ape shit on me, saying I lied to her and that I'm a fake friend, that her and Amanda aren't friends anymore, and that all her friends and family agreed that I was a dick for being friends with Amanda. I'm heated at this point because she's not listening to anything I'm saying about going to see old friends, so I tell her that she isn't my girlfriend and cannot control who I talk to. She leaves me on read and blocked me on social media for a few days. 

It's been two weeks and we haven't talked, aside from my asking her for a flannel I let her borrow (she said she was busy and I needed to apologise first). 


: since people have expressed interest in wanting to know why they aren't friends;

Kayla and Amanda first stopped being friends due to Amanda dating a guy Kayla had previously expressed interest in. They made up after things didn't work out between them. 
The currently reason they aren't friends is because Kayla is mad that Amanda couldn't pick her up from the bars when she was drunk. Kayla wants an apology. Amanda refuses to apologize because she was busy, and Kayla is never the one to reach out and initiate an apology. Kayla has told me she wants nothing to do wih Amanda. Amanda has told me she wants the best for Kayla, and feels that they will be friends again when ""the season is right.""


TL;DR: i befriended my best friend's old friend and she flipped out on me. I told her she wasn't my girlfriend and couldn't control who I talked to. Am I the asshole?",88,251,0.93

A few weeks ago my brother just up and left his family to do fuck knows what. He has a wife and 2 kids with one on the way.

I heard about it through one of the cousins I keep more in contact with.

Apparently she’s not doing so well financially now. I’ve had a few calls from different family members saying they’re disappointed with me for not even checking in on them. One of my aunts has said that I should be doing more to help them because I’m their closest family and have the means, but really to me they’re basically strangers. 

My brother and I have never really been close. My dad had primary custody of me and he lived with our mother. So we kind of just lived in different worlds. Since we’ve grown up we haven’t really talked or gotten to know each other better even though we live in the same city.",74,31,0.88
912,Not the A-hole,"Edit for clarity - this happened about two years ago, but due to mutual friends is a lingering issue. 

I (29F) had a best friend (29F) of 10 years. Separate colleges. After I moved home we found a great place, 20 min outside the city center and split things 60/40. I wanted a backyard so I could get a dog and a 3 br so I could have an office since I WFH.

Some mornings she would leave for work after oversleeping, get pissed at traffic, and call in sick. Days she did go she would come home crying because people were ""mean."" Kept saying life would be better if her dad's company would take off so she could be the ""office manager."" Well, she was fired and forced her dad's hand.

At lease renewal, I've accepted a position that that comes with a rent discount. I let her know I'm not renewing and plan to move to an apartment that is in city center, right next to hike/bike trails that I can use to take a dog out on a regular basis. I offer to share the discount (about $150/month each).

We moved in Sept. Things got worse. She claims she developed OCD. I kept any clutter in my room, but occasionally left a dish out, which was always put away before I went to bed. Anytime anything was left out, she sent me a message. I worked 10/14 days at night while she worked m-f 8-5. If she was already in her room, I wouldn't be able to turn on the TV because it disturbed her. On days that I had off during the week, she would either stay home or come home early, giving me no time to myself.

She also got irrationally upset when we both matched with the same guy and him talking to me but not her, me getting to know her close friends from college since they were local and mine weren't and her freaking out when we started to hang out, even if she wasn't available, and telling me that she refused to let me get a dog because she didn't want one. She and I had talked about the issues we were having numerous times.

In Feb I get a ranting message because I left ONE dish on the stove that needed to cool. At this point, I did what I had been thinking of doing for months. I put in my transfer notice to a 1 br apt and gave her a 30 days notice. She was understandably upset but we hugged, said we were going to be better friends now, and I thought we would be able to get through it.

Next day I am not only TA in her eyes, but her parents. She can't afford to live in the area, no notice, she can't find an apartment, and it's cruel because I forced her to move in the first place by giving her no choice but to either move with me or move back with her parents.

She still refuses to be anywhere that I am at and has left friends houses crying and even a friend's wedding because I was invited as well. She claims to now have PTSD because she can't imagine that a true friend would have done that to her.

I'll  admit my dog and I are very happy together, but the fact that this has lasted for 2 years with no effort for resolution or to be civil on her part, despite all of us telling her that we all need to move on and get over it leaves me wondering...AITA?",34,90,0.94

Each day was filled with extra activites and things they like. Nothing was done this year. My boyfriend did everything he could by himself and he got me some nice things but hes not a planner and it was very stressful for him. 

None of my other friends who I thought I was very close to tried to help, or get me a gift, or even just get the day off. I made my own cake and messed it up so i couldn't bring it and nobody cared. It was all so disappointing and I tried my best to not to be bothered by it because its just a day and they shouldnt have to put in all the effort I put in for them by choice. The day just felt like a regular hangout and not about me at all, which makes me feel entitled but I also feel like I deserve to be cared about.

I thought I was over it but then I found out I wouldn't be getting my birthday Starbucks drink because of a stupid rule and I just broke down. Birthdays are important to me and they didnt think about me at all.

It's only the day after and part of me wants to say something.  I'm worried its entitled to expect this from any of them.

916,Not the A-hole,"My wife of 8 years loves animals. I'm fairly indifferent at this point because I'm tired of the mess and cost and we have a baby on the way. So for practical reasons I could really do without the dogs at this point.

Naturally my wife enjoys her animals, as anyone with animals should, and she snuggles them every chance she gets. We have an aussie and it sheds SOOOOOO MUCH HOLY HELL! Sweeping every day (which we don't do) is the only way to not have hair all over everything in the house. I hate hair. Like it hard caps my capacity to relax in my home at like 7/10 if there's hair on everything. I can clean it, but the NEXT day it'll be horrible again. I've talked to her about it and asked her to keep up on brushing the dog (It's ""her"" dog) and she does a fairly decent job but it's not regular. So the shedding issue persists. I've thoroughly shared my feelings about it to her but I usually get the sense of exasperation and annoyance in the conversations. This is likely because I bring it up so much, but in my defense I bring it up when it's an issue. To put things in perspective, we're talking if I drop my clean laundry on the floor (it's all hardwood) it officially has hair on it.

Fast forward to today. Yesterday I bought a new truck. It's clean, fresh, mmmmmm... I love it. My first truck too so I am extra excited. My wife and I go out for a date last night in the new truck. This morning I get in my truck to see just my passenger seat, nothing else, covered in hair. It's not immediately noticeable but it's probably 20-40 hairs. So enough to be considered dirty. I'm pissed. I wanted 1 thing to be clean and didn't even get 24 hours out of it before it's dirty. I'll clean the seat, NBD, but I don't want this to keep happening. I'm not a clean freak, I just hate hair.

At this point my sanity feels like it's tearing apart (dramatic, I know) and I don't even want her or the dogs anywhere near my truck. That's not realistic though so what I want to know is, **WIBTA if I told my wife she wasn't allowed in my truck unless she uses a lint roller before she gets in?** This may seem like a ridiculous innocuous situation but the reality is that if I start down this path I'll need to hound her (no pun intended) about it or she'll forget. And then she'll get annoyed about that, and it'll become a whole thing, and I don't want to press this issue if I'm actually just being an ass hole about it.

Edit: We sat down and discussed it. I used a lot of suggestions here. We bought a Roomba, and a vaccum attachment for brushing the dog to make it easier for her and myself and re-established a floor cleaning schedule and who's responsible which days. And she acknowledged she should clean herself before getting in my clean truck. Solved!!! Thanks everyone!!!",49,97,0.93

So I waited for them to arrive there and i saw through the app where that house was ( so that I could now if they were going somewhere). They spend all Saturday in the house but in Sunday night I decide to watch the app and I saw that my son was very far from his house. I saw the location in google maps and it was a lake, but there wasn’t any building near it.

So I guessed they were drinking in the lake so I text my son, half an hour and he doesn’t respond, I call him multiple times and he doesn’t respond. I get worried and call the father or his friend, I tell him that they may be drinking in the lake. Apparently he had gave them permission to go there but decided to go to the lake to be sure they weren’t drinking and later calls me to confirm that they weren’t doing anything bad.

921,Not the A-hole,"I (32/F) have two younger brothers (30 and 26) and since I have a stable career and more disposable income, I pay for our Netflix, HBO Now, Hulu, and Spotify subscriptions for my entire family. I never ask them to pitch in and have no plans to.

My 30 year old brother has never had a lot of luck dating. His most recent ex is a woman he met while on vacation in the Dominican Republic. I have never met her. They tried doing long distance, but it didn't work out. While they were in a relationship, he decided to give her the password to my Netflix account so they could watch shows together. He didn't consult me about it - I found out when Netflix notified me that my account was accessed in the Dominican Republic. 

According to my brother, the family doesn't have a lot of money. However, they've been broken up for over a year and she just had a baby with another man. 

A few weeks ago, I got sick of it since our account kept defaulting to Spanish even with her having her own separate profile. It didn't make sense to me why someone who I never met has my e-mail address and password to my account. While I don't think she would be malicious enough to change the password one day and take ownership over it, there's always that chance she could. So I told him that this is ridiculous especially since they are no longer together. I changed the password and gave the password to him only under the condition that he wouldn't give it to her. I told him if he feels bad for her, he can open up his own Netflix account and pay for her. 

The other day I found out she accessed the account. When I confronted him about it, he told me that I'm being cheap, she has no money, and she called him up crying to ask him for the password. 

On one hand, I do feel sympathy for her since she's a new mom and doesn't have a lot of money so maybe this is a way to make her life a little easier.

I am a bridesmaid in my friend's wedding. She was originally planning for her wedding to be in early May, which I told her would work perfectly because college classes will be out, and my birthday is at the end of May. I also told her that my husband has already made plans for my birthday, and I don't know what they are, but we could go out of state.

A few weeks ago, I got a message from her asking what I would do if her wedding was on my birthday. I accidentally opened it as class was starting, so I didn't have time to respond.

Edit: From what I'm seeing in the comments, I need to clarify a few things. First, she gave my husband the idea to do something big for my birthday. We didn't get to spend my birthday together last year, so she pushed him to make up for it. She's very aware that I had plans.

 Second, we have talked since. I asked her about something else she'd sent in that message, and she didn't remember sending me anything that day. Her memory is very poor when it comes to texting. She didn't even remember asking me to be a bridesmaid at first when I told her yes. She had to ask what I was responding to.

Third, her venue is a family estate, so it is very flexible. She's been very open about how flexible the dates are at this point, but she has told me that she's really looking into either my Birthday or sometime mid-May.

Update: I messaged her, and she didn't remember the conversation. I reminded her that I may not be in the state on my Birthday, and she said she's still figuring out the date, so she'd let me know.",43,50,0.85
925,Asshole,"Alrighty strap yourselves in, this is going to be a long post.

My friend who I will refer to as X is Non-Binary.

I have been friends with X since Middle School and we're in college now. Honestly we're more like family at this point if anything.

X has been Non-Binary for about 2 years now but recently decided to change up their name since they have a traditional female name. Whether or not they choose to transition down the line, IF they want to transition down the line, I am completely accepting of it. 

My problem is, the name they chose is extremely similar to my name except one letter off. (Ex: Jaiden/Aiden, Mark/Marcus, Gaby/Gabrie)

When they told our group of friends, I was extremely uncomfortable about the name but was silent. I later confessed to my boyfriend that I have issues with it. He talked with me to get down to the real issue of my discomfort and it's deeper than face level.

I have always had an issue comparing myself to X. Intentionally and Unintentionally. I have always felt that X was the more attractive friend, more likeable, more talented etc. We're similar in tastes, hobbies, attitudes but I've always felt like people could approch them more. People always asked me about X and I've always felt like I was 2nd best to X. X felt like a brand and I was a cheap Great Value imitation of them.

I bring this up because, even though in recent years I've tried extremely hard to not compare myself to them, sharing borderline the same name with them makes it 10x harder not to.

I'm also a bit upset because awhile back they brought up the idea if they should change their name and I even half-jokingly said ""If you think about changing your name dont change it to (similar sounding name) haha ;)"" but...that's exactly what they did.

I love them but this name change hurts me. I feel extremely selfish for asking them to consider a different name but I dont think my mental health can handle it. I love them and don't want to distance myself from our 7/8 year friendship but this name is really putting me off.

928,Not the A-hole,"For some context- I am a female in my mid 20's, and ride a motorcycle. This past weekend, I rode out to a National Forest in California, and went to go on a hike. When I ride, I wear Jean's, boots, etc. When I got to the trailhead, I stripped my external gear into the yoga pants and sweatshirt I was wearing underneath, and also changed my shoes. At no point was I anywhere close to indecent. There were also no bathrooms or anywhere to change more privately.

Now here's where I may be an a-hole- I parked next to a car with a family of tourists from a country in Asia that is much more conservative. It's the kind of parking lot where a ranger tells you where to park, so it wasn't my choice, they were just the people who got there immediately before me.

So I'm standing in this dirt lot, taking my Jean's off, and I notice a boy around 8-10 from the family next to me is staring. Like barely blinking, mouth open STARING. It was a little awkward, but I assumed he was just rude. His mother noticed as well, and came over to tell me I was being inappropriate, indecent, vulgar, etc. Couldn't believe I was stripping in front of a child. I was shocked, because I had on ankle length yoga pants, and quite honestly, I thought her kid was the one being creepy.

I responded to her that I was wearing long pants, and that it was fine. She continued complaining, but I was done with my shoes by this point so I just walked away while she was talking. I could also see her giving me dirty looks as I left.

Later, when talking with a friend who is also from a conservative culture, she took the side of the mother. She asked how I'd feel if I went somewhere and someone starting stripping naked in front of my child- which by their standards, is what I was basically doing apparently. 

I said, if that's the norm in their culture and it was not directed at my child (IE the person was minding their own business and just changing, not trying to assault my child), I would be ok with it. I'd recognize it was my responsibility to either explain to my child cultural differences, or to tell them to look away.

I have been living with my girlfriend and her parents after we hit rock bottom and lost everything. We moved and found jobs where we are so we're only staying with them for one more month. That's if her mom doesn't find a piece of dust my girlfriend left and spent an hour yelling at her over it constantly about how she wants us to leave....but thats an entirely separate story

I want to talk about her little 4 year old brother. She has two brothers, and one sister. So, the house is pretty tight with us here. I get that, but her brothers presence is everywhere all the time. He's constantly yelling, being obnoxious and even jumps on you and punches you when he wants to play. He drinks straight out of the milk container EVERYDAY even in front of his mom. He cries until he gets what he wants which he always does. He likes me a lot so he is always coming in and out of the room we are sharing with her other sibling. He makes a mess with his toys everywhere and his mom expects my girlfriend and I to clean so we basically put them away. He is VERY disrespectful and his mom allows this behavior. He cursed A lot, claims this house is his, and says no to his mom alot. she yell at him then give up. she always accepts his no. and while, a lot of the time this stuff isnt directly affecting me, it bothers me alot that everyone, including my girlfriend doesnt seem to care and showers him with more love than discipline.

Fast foward to last week, her mom went to the store and we decided to let our cat roam around a bit since her mom MAKES her live in our room. It's against the rules but we don't keep her out long. He's petting the cat and following her around until then we put her back. When mom comes back, he's jumping at her and snitching saying we broke the rules by letting the cat out and how she was eating one of her plants. (which is true but we made it stop before any damage was done). My girlfriend's mom spent an ENTIRE 2 hours arguing at my girlfriend and saying she wants us to leave and crying because of how mad she was. my girlfriend cried and went into a dark place for the rest of the night. I couldnt even console her.

The next day, I got home from work and she felt better. I was hugging her and playing around and then here comes the little brother, bursting into the room with his toys. I went under the blanket and stood quiet the entire time he was there. He tried talking to me but I honestly was still upset about the night prior and the fact that his mom now wants us out sooner that i completely ignored him. this pissed off my girlfriend big time.  i spent the rest of the day ignoring him, despite my girlfriend being upset. I didn't care. I've apolgized to her about it but I still am highly annoyed by his behavior and while I dont have to live here anymore in a month, the way her mom raises him concerns me a lot. sometimes I completely ignore him still when no ones around.

After he was born all my siblings and in laws came to visit, except for my sister. I didn’t really mind at the time since she was studying and was about 2 hours away. But then later on I started noticing that she never really took to my son. She barely acknowledges that he’s in the room, never holds him, and even once had a look of disgust on her face when he started crying. It was a bit upsetting because she’s about a year older than me and my old sister while my other siblings are boys and a lot of my cousins growing up we’re boys as well. 

Then came thanksgiving (Canada) and we’re all chatting and drinking some wine and I showed some pictures to my SILs of my son walking and running and the usual things since we don’t get to see each other as often. My sister has this big look on her face and just starts laying it on me about how could I think that having a son was a bigger accomplishment than my degree, that my son wasn’t even a big deal, and all he does is drool and do nothing. 

Upset, I tried to shrug it off and laugh because she must have been really drunk right? Nope. She was dead serious. One of my SIL asked if my sister likes kids. She said nope not a single one. Asked if she liked her nieces and nephews. Only when they got older my sister started liking them apparently and when they were younger, she just pretended to like them. So I asked her what was it about my son that made her hate him, then I went on for about about how I gave birth to him and I loved him and I loved my nieces and nephews. She cut me off and said that I actually didn’t do anything during the birth since it was a c-section. I froze for a second as my SILs yelled at her for saying something like that and my sister didn’t care. She yelled back saying that she was never prioritize her degree over a child that could barely hold its own head and said she was never damage her body like that. 

I told her that she was wrong and that the reason why she will never become a mother was because nobody in their right mind would ever want to touch a cold heartless person like her. There were definitely some profanity used and one of my nieces took a video. So now my sisters pissed off at me, won’t return my calls or texts and is now referring to me as a breeder. My dad even said I was being a bit of an asshole and that my sister was going through a lot. I always listen to him and his advice and now I’m just conflicted with everything since she’s my sister.

Yesterday morning my wife and I were in bed and I asked her if it was ok to go ahead and register for the race. I always check with her about purchases because she handles our finances. Her response was “what am I supposed to say? I think it’s stupid to pay money to run somewhere that you can run any other time for free” with a big attitude. I said “never mind, forget it”. I dropped my phone onto the bed and I crossed my arms. Because I was pissed. It feels like she always has a problem anytime I want to spend money or do something for myself, which is rare.

937,Not the A-hole,"My younger sister (30F) has been dating ""Jerry"" for 3 years. He's a loud-mouth who holds ignorant, bigoted, and homophobic views. I have no clue what my sister sees in him as no one in my family shares his perceptions. Here's what the first Thanksgiving was like with him (he was meeting my family for the first time). he brought up the recent election and called me a ""snowflake"" because he knew I didn't vote for Trump ( I guess my sister told him since I didn't know him before this.) He went on about how awesome Trump was and how awesome this country is now going to be. I didn't engage because I thought he was  foolish, how he had no idea who my parents voted for and still thought it was appropriate to run his mouth nonstop at the dinner table the first time meeting all of us. After more than two hours of this, my mother finally asked him to change the subject. 

Fast forward to now. He has, on more than one occasion, brought up that if his kids ""ever decide they are \[insert vulgar word for gay here that begins with an F\]"" that he'll disown them, and other awful things along the same lines. I'm the only one that pushes back, usually asking him why he'd say that, which usually fires him up even more. There's no having a respectful conversation with him. My sister just jokes and laugh it off every time he says something blatantly racist or ignorant. My parents cringe and try to change the subject. 

The final straw came when he went on social media and made comments about my relationship. He tried to call out my boyfriend and me because we both have good careers and split household expenses. He thinks this is wrong because ""you're in a relationship, you shouldn't be nickel and diming each other like you’re just roommates, what's wrong with you two? Doesn't he take care of you?"" Which is hilarious because he's in his 30's, he moved in with my sister who pays for everything after two weeks of dating, only works part-time by choice and has no savings whatsoever. 

I blocked him and called my mother. I vented to her that I don't appreciate any of misogynistic/bigoted/homophobic views and he's a loser. My mom agreed with me but said she wishes we could all get along. My boyfriend and I live a plane ride away and I told her I wouldn't be coming to Thanksgiving this year if he was. I said because they, meaning my parents and sister, just sit there while he talks, that that makes them complicit to the hateful commentary and I don't want to be associated with someone like him. My mom was understandably upset and said I was her priority since she never gets to see me, but that she couldn't tell my sister not to bring him. My dad is sick about this and wants everyone to shut up and get along. I feel I have reached my limit, but some of my extended family members feel like I should just suck it up since it would really crush my parents since I live far away if I didn't see them on a holiday.

For this purpose, I'll call my brother Stef. After going back to our school three times for three talks, he told me he was going on a date with someone 'from school'. I asked who, and he said 'Tom'. I'm like, who is this guy? And he tells me he means our old science teacher. I was shook, and thought it was a little weird because this guy was never a nice teacher in school, Stef always thought he was hot, but he was a douche, the kind of guy who called out students he knew were behind/anxious and would always mark tests as harsh as possible. I realise this stuff doesn't matter anymore, so I tried to put it behind me and support my brother, but I want to explain why I didn't like the guy. For the sake of this, I'll call his bf Tom.

Tom would always compare me to Stef. Stef was a very smart guy, and I am smart too, but not that much. For example, Stef would always get the A+, and if I got an A or B, he would point out that Stef was still beating me. He was also aggressive with giving me detentions if me and Stef both arrived late to class, saying that he wanted to get the best out of me. I just found him to be a dick and he made me really anxious, as I had a lot going on at home at the time and I knew he would pick on me more for being reserved/upset about it. 

So, Stef and Tom and I went out for dinner with our family, and I found the whole thing to be weird. Tom was really similar to how he was in school (stoic and quite posh) that I found it hard to remember to call him Tom, and not Mr. X. The whole night, I could tell Tom was having the same issue being around me, and it was quite awkward. 

I'm getting married in six weeks. Stef is my best man, so he will be sitting at the top table with me. All of my other groomsmen/women are allowed to have their partners on the top table (mostly because they are all good friends of mine too) but I really don't want Tom up there, because it was so awkward.

Could this be considered insensitive? Wife thinks that this is not wrong whatsoever and doesn't think anyone else would even second guess it. I think it could be considered blackface,  seen as offensive, and we shouldn't use the paint. My son isn't even aware it comes with paint, so he won't be disappointed either way.

I'm not sure if this is the best subreddit for this question, but I really want to know, WIBTA.

A) If someone is offended...assuming he is clearly a bear...than they are the asshole.
B) If we paint his whole face brown, we are not technically the asshole, but might bring on some controversy.
C) There should be no controversy if we just do his nose or some design.",189,422,0.87
940,Not the A-hole,"So this happened a few hours ago. Obligatory excuses: On mobile, and this is not my first language

Backstory: I 25 (F) am living with my partner ( F, in her thirties) and her little boy. He's close to 3 I've been around for nearly 2 years of his life and I love him to bits. He accepted me as a parent, and I'm really happy for that. I'm learning each day but I'm not perfect by any means. Also he was a premie baby and he's a bit slower at some things but is catching up to the others his age.

So today my cousin and my SIL visited and met my family for the first time in person (they live abroad).  All was well for some time. I showed them our new place, and they stayed for lunch. SIL was holding the kid and then said why we still allow him to have a pacifier . We just brushed it off and said that cause he's a kid. She did this for 2 more times.   
And well I snapped at the third one that why isn't she minding her own business and just stop acting like she knows what's the best for a child (they don't have children atm). And then she finally said that if I am not strict with these things now, after 15 years I can regret it after he is skipping school and doing drugs , cause this way he will never give me respect.

I was really close to lose it but I only said ""Oh,shut up"". It was of course really tense after that Earlier we agreed with my cousin that they'll spend the holidays with us but I talked with him that we need to think about it. He was really understanding but her wife keeps blowing up my phone ever since and telling everyone how bad I am raising a child.

946,Not the A-hole,"Mobile.

Background: My partner lives 5 hours away by car and my job is flexible so I drive back and forth about twice a month. I use a Canada specific ridesharing website to post the trip and get passengers. It’s a win win because my gas gets covered and I get a little extra if I’m full. The passengers pay half what they would pay for the bus, which is the next cheapest option.

AITA: when I first started, I noticed a lot of people arrived late. A couple of times I waited, which resulted in huge delays. I time my rides to leave right before traffic starts so a fifteen minute delay once added an hour. After that, I stopped waiting. The website policy is you have to wait 10 mins then call the site’s helpline to let them know. I think they help passengers rebook but don’t know. I put in my ride description that I do not wait and when riders are late I text them to let them know I will leave at exactly 10 mins past the departure time. I have left 2 passengers in the last year. 

Why I might be the asshole: Last minute tickets on the bus and train are expensive. Most of the rides through the site are booked by the day of. Also, my partner and one of the other passengers seemed to think I’m in the wrong. When I called the website to let them know I’m leaving, they seem shocked. Passengers pay a small booking fee to the website.

Why I don’t think I’m the asshole: It is in the ride description that I don’t wait. I am following the company’s policy. Passengers don’t pay for the ride and have not yet given me any money. I text them to let them know I arrived (usually ten minutes early), I text them at the departure time with the ten minute warning, and I am not responsible for other adult’s poor time management.

My parents are pretty well off, they live in a suburban area where it's pretty expected to ""keep up with the Joneses"" and show off with nice cars, spending a lot on a house and on entertaining, designer clothes, etc. But they don't have a lot of savings and that stresses me out.

Anyway, I am kind of the opposite. I'm living in an area that's kind of rough right now, driving an old truck, but it's close to my work and it's close to my friends places. I'm saving a lot doing all this. I've paid off my student loans already and I'm saving for a house.

My parents wanted to come visit the city I'm living in, and I said I'd host them at my apartment. But I said to leave the luxury cars behind and take the older sedan that they'd been using as a driving-instruction car for me and my siblings. And I told them to not leave any valuables in the car, instead bring their things inside my apartment. And also, don't bring a large purse or backpack and don't talk to strangers who approach you because they might try and pickpocket you. 

So my parents showed up in their 2018 porche and my mom steps out with a huge designer handbag that doesn't close except for a small snap closure on top. And I'm frustrated they didn't listen but I tell them to come inside, being their things in, and I lend my mom a smaller handbag of mine.

We went out for dinner and when we come back, their car's been broken into. And my dad is freaking out because a bag of his things was stolen. I was frustrated because I'd said to not bring a flashy car and to not leave things in the car... But we go file a police report and that takes up most of the night.

I got snappy at my parents that night for not listening to one of the things I'd said; bringing their flashiest car when I'd said that was a bad idea, etc.

My brother has high functioning autism. Now, I can’t even pretend I understand it, he acts completely fine when he’s in public and the second we get home he’s bouncing off the walls. This has made our relationship strained, to say the least.

Now, his outbursts cause lots of things to be broken, because when he gets upset or hyper, he doesn’t acknowledge damage to other people’s belongings.

In this situation, a couple of years ago he broke my GameCube controllers (2 of them, one of them is completely shattered) while upset at one of my games he was playing. I asked him to replace it, as I’m not the one who broke it,  but my dad refused to allow that because “I never used it”. This is untrue, I did use it and very frequently, but I can’t do that when both of my controllers are broken from being spiked against the wall.

This summer I decided to use my spare cash to replace one of the controllers. Essentially, right when the controller came in I made it clear it was not to be used by anyone other than me without my direct permission. Well, a couple months go by and last week I come out of my room to see him playing my old game with my brand new controller. I immediately told him to turn it off as I do not trust him with my belongings. He still has the habits of breaking things due to an outburst, so I did not see any reason to believe he has changed his anger management in the last 3 years.

Immediately he ran to my dad, who allowed him to use my controller regardless of my position on the matter. He does this frequently with things my siblings want to borrow from me, even though I paid for them.

958,Not the A-hole,"This has been bothering me since Friday evening and I really don't know if I messed up. 

On Fridays, we run a skeleton crew and mostly this is the day people take off anyway and therefore even quieter. In fact two of the five departments close around 3pm because it’s so dead. I almost never get to leave early on these days because I’m the receptionist though. 

So this past Friday its again pretty dead and two coworkers have taken off – so again even more quiet than usual. 

This week Coworker A had some paper work that needed to be signed by clients who would then need to see Coworker B to complete the process. 

Around midday, a client came in looking for Coworker A. I apologized and let him know that she was actually only available on Monday through Thursday as was laid out by the email he had received. He understood and said he would be back on Monday. 

Now. In the past Coworker A has asked me to go into her office and grab paperwork before - but she had not asked me to do that this time. Nor had she told me where she had left it. In addition, the process would not have been complete because Coworker B was also out of the office today. 

The day continues from there and one of the departments that is getting ready to leave around 3:30pm to celebrate a birthday goes and asks Boss #1 if I could close the office early to join them. He says yes because I rarely leave early or take time off. 

Around this time, Boss #1 asks where coworker A is. I tell him that she hadn't come in and I hadn't heard from her. Not a big deal because it is possible she had let Boss #2 (her direct supervisor) know but since Boss #2 doesn't come in on Fridays that the information just hadn't made it all the way up the pipeline yet. 

About an hour after I leave I get a call from Coworker A. She asks if many people had come in to see her. I tell her no. There was one client but he was going to come back in on Monday. I ask if everything is all right and she says no because she just got a weird text from Boss #2. I say “I'm sorry” and she goes silent. I tell her I'm sorry I'm having trouble hearing her because I'm out with other department. She says okay and hangs up immediately. 

This morning she’s been completely cold to me. She’s barely said anything to me. She’s given me the paperwork that she needs signed to me so that they can come see me instead and she’s just like not engaging with me at all.

Without those glasses she's absolutely breathtakingly beautiful, way more than me, but with them on her eyes look weird and distorted and would take all the attention away in the photos for all the wrong reasons.

I brought this up with her but she got really huffy and sulky, told me to try on her glasses so I could see what she would be seeing during the photos if she took them off. I did and it was horrible, but I could stomach it for a few minutes to help out a friend and think she's being really unreasonable. She left early and the rest of the bridal party got at me for asking something so ''horrible''. I don't think it's an unreasonable thing to ask. I'm doing her a favour. Without the glasses she'll easily be the hottest bridesmaid so I would have thought she'd be OK with it.",537,16295,0.78
961,Not the A-hole,"So my husband and I have gotten into plenty of arguments for staying at home drinking together and me falling asleep on him. Usually we drink at night but unless I'm out and about doing something or friends are over while drinking, I tend to get comfy and fall asleep. Or, if we're out doing something we go home I may just pass out rather than staying up and hanging with my husband for a bit which also upsets him. I've asked friends if this happens to them when they drink at home and they say 'yes'. Yet when I try to explain this to my husband he gets upset and says that me falling asleep on him is selfish and isn't normal. He thinks that I don't want to hang with him which isn't true....I just get tired when I drink while sitting and doing nothing.
It upsets me that he gets mad at me for doing so and wonder if it really isn't normal. AITA?",92,191,0.93

963,Not the A-hole,"Let me explain it's a bit of a mess: my biological father and I have no relationship and I haven't seen him or contacted him since I was a little kid. Several years ago, he agreed to give up all parental rights to me so that I could be adopted by my stepdad.


I was recently contacted by this girl, Kate, who explained that my biological father had married Kate's mother and eventually adopted Kate, just like my stepdad adopted me. Kate found out that I am a freshman at the same college she is starting at next year. Kate considers us to be sisters, and wants to use the fact that we will be at the same college to see each other and get to know each other.


I thought long and hard about this and decided I don't want a relationship with Kate. First of all, I can't see how we're sisters by any definition of the word. We're not blood related, we have different adoptive fathers, and are part of completely separate families. Also, it's very hurtful that my biological father would give me up and a couple years later adopt someone else. Kate clearly loves her dad and has talked about him being a good guy, and I don't want to hear about it.


I tried to be nice about it at first, but Kate kept insisting we were sisters and that she would find me at college and talk to me. It's a big school and hard to run into someone by accident, but she seemed pretty insistent that she would find me at school. I warned her that I wouldn't acknowledge her, to stay away from my friends, and that if she talked to me I would tell people she was crazy, then I blocked her.


Now that I've thought about it more, I thought telling people that Kate is crazy might be too harsh. I thought instead that if she approaches me or my friends and starts saying she's my sister I could say something like ""Kate isn't my sister, her dad used to date my mom before either of us were born."" This is technically true, and that way, I'm not actually calling her crazy, but if my friends decide that Kate is a creep or a stalker for lying about being my sister then that's their opinion and not my fault.


I don't want to give any detail about being adopted because it's not something I talk about much and very few of my college friends know about it. If Kate brings it up, I can just say she's lying. I feel that Kate is allowed to say she's adopted, but not allowed to say that I'm adopted, because it's my business. This is a big school, so Kate would be able to make her own friends, this is just a way to keep her from me or from talking to people about me.


I'm asking if I'm TA because I know that some people would feel differently and possibly more sympathetic to Kate if they knew the whole story, but it would mean revealing things that make me uncomfortable. WIBTA if I refuse to acknowledge Kate as a sister and tell others that she is lying?",340,1215,0.96
964,Not the A-hole,"I work at a small company owned by my family; I'm in my mid-30s and all of my coworkers are in their 60s.  I'm frequently still treated like a teenager because of this (just kind of important for the office dynamics).

I left a couple time off requests for my boss this morning and when I put them in his tray, I told my aunt and my other coworker that I was putting in requests for October 31 and November 15.  My aunt winced and asked what I was doing on November 15, because she was planning to take that day off.  I told her that I'm going to a concert at a casino about 90 minutes away that night so I figured I would use the PTO to make a day of it, but that I could withdraw the request.

She proceeded to go on about how she and her partner are hoping to go out of state that weekend but nothing's been confirmed yet so maybe just hold onto the request but she hasn't heard back from the people they would be visiting.  I said ""So wait, I can't put in a request for time off for plans that I already have because you *might* make plans that weekend but you aren't sure yet?""  I then got lectured about how I can't just think I can take time off because I was the first to ask for it and that I have to think of other people in the office.  She also lectured me about how I don't need to take an entire day off just for a night-time concert (but the concert is at a resort casino, and I would like to spend some time there before the show if I can)

She immediately called her partner and told him that he had to call their friends today so that they can book flights if the visit is happening.  She's been on the phone with him 3 times in the past hour trying to rush these plans that she had never mentioned before.  Am I the asshole for thinking she should shift the dates of her trip since it hasn't actually been confirmed and planned yet?

**Edit:**  Glad for all of the validation from you lovely people.  Turns out that it didn't even matter because her friends thought she'd been talking about visiting the next weekend so her trip isn't even happening ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯",28,93,0.96
965,Not the A-hole,"Update at the bottom!


Attended a house party over the weekend & everyone was having a great time. One particular party-goer was really really drunk, much more than the rest of the folks. We’ll call her Susie.     


My husband & Susie used to work with/for the same instructor awhile back, and said instructor was verbally/emotionally abusive towards all his students & colleagues. Apparently the instructor has been making extreme efforts to apologize for his past but Susie isn’t willing to forgive him yet, if ever.      

Husband is drunk too, and the more drunk he got the more he kept thinking about how Susie is still bad-mouthing the instructor to anyone that will listen. He walks up to her, gets right in her face & says “we need to talk NOW”. Susie had NOT been discussing the instructor at all during the night. She was having a fucking great time organizing drinking games & hugging everyone & laughing.    

Husband takes her aside & lectures her for over an hour, and I sent him a text asking him to have the conversation later. I didn’t feel like it was a good time to have this conversation with Susie. He ignored my text, but as it was getting later into the night people were asking where Susie was (they were concerned she may have left or passed out somewhere). I told them where they were talking so folks started going to find them, interrupting them. Which pissed my husband off to no end. He was pissed off at me the rest of the night & I can’t even bring up the party now without him rolling his eyes at me.      

As I drove us home that night he was justifying this lecture saying that it HAD to happen, it was so important to him, and that Susie just kept nodding her head while he talked & not even participating in the conversation. I told him that was probably because Susie wanted to get back to the party and/or not have the conversation when they’re drunk! He was so insistent that I was the reason why Susie couldn’t focus to hear him out, so many people kept interrupting.    

AITA here? I think he’s really wrong for approaching Susie in his drunken state, let alone Susie’s drunken state.        

EDITED TO UPDATE:     
This might be an update sooner than most, but I do want to make sure I let all y’all wonderful people know how things went.

My husband arrived home this evening, we had dinner, watched an episode of a show, and then I brought up the conversation with Susie. I was trying to be casual, not confrontational, when I asked how things went today & if anyone mentioned the party. He almost immediately interrupted me saying that no one (including Susie) mentioned anything at all today at work. I asked him if he thought she remembered anything he said, and I mentioned that if you want someone to receive your message you have to tailor it so that it will be best received. And that you don’t have serious conversations while drinking/drunk. He agreed with me, that it was not the right time or place.

But then I brought up what y’all suggested, that it wasn’t his role at all to try & influence her regardless of how he felt. I asked him “what if you weren’t willing to forgive Instructor, but she was trying to pressure you into forgiveness?” He had a few excuses because that’s what he “wasn’t trying to do”, but I gently mentioned that it wasn’t about what he intended, it was about the fact that it wasn’t his place at all.

We left off at a semi-usual place: kisses & hugs goodnight & whatnot. I still have to broach the subject of him apologizing to Susie. And I want to apologize to her too, I failed that woman, for which I’m ashamed.

I want to thank all of y’all, even if you said I was an Asshole. I’ve learned a lot here. And I intend to follow through with therapy for us both. I already see a psychologist and it’s time for him to process all the abuse he’s been through with a professional (and eventual suicide of his father when Husband was 18.)

I dont use makeup or anything much, but today, because we're going to see my mom, I dolled up a bit and didnt brush my hair out after I showered--the towel dry look gives it more body and more fluffy volume, and it dries in place like that, so I dont feel awful about how it looks. 


My husband knows I dont brush my hair much, and he thought he was being helpful--he came over and started brushing it out. It's pretty short as is, but when you brush it, it dries pin straight and goes right into my middle-part that just makes it look like I'm balding (because I am.) It just conforms to looking like a shitty bowl cut. 


I was really happy with how I looked today, which is rare--and now, my hair is lifeless and straight and looks awful. I'm upset at him for it, and I just feel ugly again and want to just take my makeup off and go plain face under a hat like normal.

972,Everyone Sucks,"So let me start by saying this is a really small petty thing but my gf grandmother is the type of person to moan about everything, nothing is ever good enough for her.

So a few days ago, my gf grandmother come visited for a few hours and when she entered our place I asked if she wanted a drink, she asked for a coffee so I went into the kitchen to make her one. We had only just moved into the place and was decorating. On her arrival she had already told us how ugly our wallpaper was and new furniture. We just brushed it off.

After making her the coffee and handed it to her, she took one look and said ""nope, I can't drink this"" I said ""how comes, you haven't even tasted it yet?"" She said ""it's in a black mug, how am I meant to know if the mug is dirty or not"" I replied saying ""it's full off coffee, you can't see whether or not it's dirty regardless the colour"" she pushed the mug away and said ""take it back, make me a new one in a new mug"" I took the mug off her and said ""no, I'm not making you another coffee because you don't like the mug it's in, don't be so f**king pathetic"" 

I took the mug into the kitchen, poured it down the drain and went out for a drive till she left.

973,Not the A-hole,"This is a slightly layered issue. My boyfriend and I have been talking marriage for a while. He makes a good amount of money, but not, in my opinion, own-$100K-car type of money. We have an apartment and when we get married, we’d like to buy a house. The house would need furniture. I make half as much as he does, and own a car reasonably within my means. 

Two years ago, my boyfriend bought a car for $55K. This year, he decided he needed more horsepower, so he bought a second car for $130K. Then he decided he wasn’t quite rich enough for that, so he sold it after two months, losing $10K in the process. Now, of course I voiced my opinion on this, but every time I do, I get shut down - he knows what he can afford, and I’m way too conservative. It’s true that I am more conservative than he is - I was raised that you drive a car until it dies. I’m not saying he should go that far, but to me, it is extremely excessive to upgrade a luxury car after you have had it for 2 years. 

So now he wants to replace his $55K car with a $75K car. His $55K car is worth considerably less now - about $30K. I again voiced my opinion, but I’m not overbearing with it - we’re not married, and I can’t tell him how to spend his money. It does, however, make me worried for our future (he will likely always have more spending power than I). So we go look at the specific car he wants to buy. And we go look at it, and we go look at it. At this point, I’ve been to at least five dealerships, test driven the car several times, and we’ve gone back to one of those dealerships several times. This car is rare, so it takes a while to find one with the color / package combo he wants. He finds one four hours away. Because of some obligations, we haven’t been able to drive there on the weekend, so we can only go during the week. He negotiated the car price through email and gets ready to go buy it.

Now, he can work remotely - I can’t. I don’t have vacation left this year because I used it going to see his family overseas. And I... just don’t want to drive 8 hours after work (plus however many hours it will be to actually sign the paperwork). He gets sad but eventually goes at night, gets a hotel, and sees the car over his lunch break the next day. He ended up getting cold feet and didn’t buy the car.

Now he wants to go again, and he wants me to come with him. Reddit, I’ve seen the car. I’ve test driven it. He’s got the price worked out, my opinion on buying the car doesn’t matter - I just really don’t want to drive 8 hours in one day after working for 9 hours. He said were the situation reversed, he would be there for me - even if he didn’t sleep.

974,Asshole,"My husband and I got together around the same she (Aimee) was moving out from home. We've been married about four years now and it's just my husband and I at home, alongside my own son (26) who is also required to pay rent if he wants to stay here.

Aimee is now 23 and has been having some struggles juggling internship, a part time job and rent. My husband invited her to come and stay with us so she could manage her finances better and because he felt her ability to perform well at her internship was impacted by having to work on the side. He did this without consulting me first and Aimee arrived with the impression she'd have a free ride waiting for her and not have to work at all.

I was extremely unimpressed to say the least, and after I pointed out to my husband how unfair it was my own son had to pay rent while Aimee did not, he came around and told Aimee that I required she pay rent while staying under our roof, but he'd set the price and that it'd be a lot less than she was paying while sharing an apartment with others (a compromise we came to). On top of this all food costs would be covered and obviously internet and power, so it was a much better deal for her all around.

When Aimee found out about this, she blew it. She shouted at me and told me it was not my house to make demands in, and said that it was unfair because it was me who decided to make my son pay rent, not her father. She also yelled at her dad for ""misleading"" her and said a host of nasty things before leaving and is now staying at a friend of hers apartment.

I personally think she's being extremely childish and spoiled, but now his extended family has gotten involved and after a call from his brother, my husband is upset and wants to take back what he asked of her. I think it's completely unfair for one child to get to freeload while another has to pay.

First some background information. My sister (22F) and I (19M) have a usually pretty good relationship and this incident (which happened like 5mins ago) isn’t the end all. So our parents are amazing people but also very traditional. They don’t really believe in mental health and believe in “sucking it up”. My sister hasn’t done well in big major exams in her life despite being insanely intelligent. She also has a tendency of not taking responsibility as our father babies her (tbf this is my opinion). Recently she decided to secretly get mental health tests done for exam anxiety to try and get some allowances (sitting at the back of the room) for her exams in uni. The hospital only accepts card payment and because our cards are linked to our fathers account he can see the transactions. So my sister has been getting her friends to use their card and paying them back in cash. I would like to preface by saying that I have given my own savings to my sister so she could help pay them back too.

Today she had an appointment, none of her friends could go with her so she asked (a couple days prior) if she could use my card to pay for it and then tell dad ‘oh it was for one of my friends’. I said “no” because my dad isn’t stupid he was going to know exactly what is going on especially considering I would be in lecture when she had gone. She goes and uses her card and now she’s in trouble with the parents.

982,Asshole,"My fiance and I got engaged in March last year and started planning the wedding a month later. Neither of us have huge lists of extended friends/family and we didn't like any of the venues around our town so we decided to have a destination wedding. This was something we consulted many people on, as we're aware of the stigma associated with destination weddings - that they're exclusionary in particular. We had a few people tell us they wouldn't be able to make it if that's what we wanted to do but about 80% of people said they could/would, so we started booking things and making arrangements.

Fast forward to now, when flights are now coming out and the RSVP date is next month (wedding is in October 2020). I've been following up on people just to make sure the ones who initially agreed and said they'd come are still willing/able to. To my surprise, most of the people on my side are now saying they can't. Some I believe are for genuine reasons (ie- buying a house, changing careers, pregnant) and then there are the not so genuine reasons of just not feeling like it anymore. From the start I've tried to be understanding and as inclusive as possible, and when these people told me they were no longer coming I was polite and said I understood, no hard feelings, etc.

It didn't actually start to bother me until I realised my fiance's tally for her side of friends/family and pretty much all of them who said they'd come are still coming. Moreover, she ended up inviting a few extra people, and some of her family members are asking us if other extended family (people we've only met like twice ever) can come because they are really keen to. I don't have an issue with more people on her side coming - I think it's great, but the disparity in the guest list is starting to bother me. I never wanted to be that entitled jerk that expects his friends/family to fork out thousands of dollars to come to their wedding, but when I see people who barely know me super excited and happy to come, it's kind of making me wonder why my side can't show the same degree of enthusiasm.

985,Not the A-hole,"Dad of a newborn here. She has a severe (usually lethal) disability. My wife (28f) and I (32m) are essentially living at a hospital in a different city than where we “live” in order to help take care of our daughter. I have health insurance through my employer, but have otherwise technically lost my job.

We have a meeting with all sorts of specialist doctors tomorrow about the future care of our daughter. She will probably die in the hospital and there is no cure for what she has. There is only the hope that perhaps some treatments will give her a comfortable life for however long she lives. She has many broken bones and lives on a ventilator. We had her transferred from our hometown when she was 10 days old due to her condition.

My parents live in the same city where the hospital is located, and my in-laws are retired and are living in this city, as well. We’ve all been around each other for 8-12 hours a day, seven days a week, for the past 2 months since my daughter was born.

My parents are very upset/angry that my wife and I have decided that grandparents (of my daughter) don’t need to be at this meeting. My in-laws concede that it’s our choice, but my parents are putting up quite a fight. The only reason they have given me for needing to be there is that it “would be beneficial to have more ears in the room.” They promise they won’t say or ask anything. I told them I can record the meeting so that we don’t forget anything that’s said, and that this meeting will be for discussing and asking questions and not necessarily for deciding treatment options. We may decide some things, but the meeting is not specifically about making a bunch of decisions.

Back in the 80’s, my parents were told that I wouldn’t live to be born. But I did, and after 3 days in the hospital, I went home. I’m sure that was a very difficult time for my parents, but my mom uses that against me and keeps saying things like “yeah, I don’t know what I’m talking about. I’ve never gone through this.” But the reality is, she hasn’t gone through what my wife and I are going through. I’ve asked her and my father to help me understand the benefit of “having more ears” in this meeting, but they just deflect and say things like “well I guess there isn’t any benefit, apparently.”

I don’t trust my parents to sit there without saying anything, and my dad has a bit of a temper that I don’t want to have to worry about flaring up if a doctor says something he doesn’t like. I don’t really know why I’m doing and I don’t have all the answers, but my wife and I are trying to do the best we can in what is medically an impossible situation. I feel bad and never want my parents to be mad at me, and my mom has already given me the “well you won’t have to worry about me getting in the way anymore” and “I’ll stop by to see the baby and you won’t even have to see me” sort of responses.

I'd had enough when, a few years ago, she attempted to assist me and my mum in starting a business. Reluctantly we agreed, thinking it might be the hand out she needs to get herself on track.

&#x200B;

It only took 2 weeks of the business opening for her to almost ruin the years of hard work we'd put in. I won't go into too much detail - we're a care agency and she hadn't performed any risk assessments, created care plans or put the rota in place, which was her job.

&#x200B;

I fired her. She didn't think she'd done anything wrong. She kept showing up at my house, until I told her she couldn't anymore, then she kicked off and tried to wrestle me (?!), even though I was holding my 3 month old baby at the time. She was so aggressive, that my very stoic, low drama, very cute puppy dog, but very strong husband frog marched her off our driveway - She then told the family my husband is secretly abusive towards me, and this was evidence. She also followed up with some shitty emails, pulling out past dramas and things I'd done wrong as a teen (20 years ago).

&#x200B;

That was in June, and by early December, I was getting very anxious about awkward xmas activities, so I emailed her to say we'll call a truce, but it won't ever be like it was, I just don't want the kids/cousins to suffer.

&#x200B;

Since then, every now and then, she slowly starts trying to creep back in. Obviously, my family have forgotten her misdemeanors because of the fancy dance she does to distract them, so they think I'm overreacting or holding a childish grudge. I constantly have to remind them what she's done, and that I'm simply protecting myself. I being called an asshole basically because I'm refusing the little things, like lending her a specific screwdriver, or picking up her kid from school so she can get her nails done. She still tries to manipulate me, I see her doing it to our mother and point it out. I hate doing that but my sister will really take the piss if I don't (eg, a few weeks ago it transpired that my sister had illegally pretended to be my mum on 3 occasions to use her car breakdown cover, maxing it out for the year, and leaving my mum stranded 200miles from home without cover, and she (sister) was driving her kids and nephews around in a car that hadn't passed it's MOT, therefore no insurance, not roadworthy as evidenced by having 3 AA call outs in 3 months, but still didn't get her own breakdown cover!)

AM I THE ASSHOLE for continuing to hold a 'grudge'?!?!",22,63,0.88
987,Not the A-hole,"Throw away account. Sorry if I’m not doing this right. I’ve been a longtime lurker, but this is my first post.

Me (26F) and my boyfriend (28M) have been together for many years. We live together, we have similar interests, overlapping friend groups, similar sense of humor, common goals, etc. We love each and we’re happy together. But there’s a part of me that resents how much he travels. 

He used to have to travel for work, which was hard for me, but understood that that was part of his job. During those few years, he was often gone more than not. Eventually he changed occupations, still had to travel but far less often, so that allowed him to be at home more. I became used to him being at home, and us spending more quality time together, and had really enjoyed this.

But over the past six months or so, he’s started to travel heavy again but mostly for leisure. What frustrates me is that over the past 2 months he has been on the road for more weeks than not, and I’ve rarely seen him. And just to clarify, he works from his computer and has the flexibility to bring work where ever he goes.

I believe traveling is an important, by learning about different cultures and seeing landmarks and gaining new experiences. I also believe it really important for people in a partnership to have independent lives and experiences outside the partnership, for many reasons. But I just miss him, and am bitter that he hasn’t been home most of these 2 months. Because we’re both busy, it’s hard to find moments of quality time together, and it’s even fewer now. I feel like we’re missing out on building experiences together. I feel like I get stuck with all of household responsibilities. I feel like I can’t get used to him being around cause he’s just going to leave to take another trip. And I guess I’m just really starting to feel really lonely in the relationship, even though we talk frequently when he’s traveling.

I’ve asked him to slow down a bit, but it was met resistance and excuses, which bothered me. What bothers me even more is that when he’s away, he thanks me for being understanding and chill about all the travel, when I’m not really okay with it.

I would be very understanding if it was for work, and wouldn’t angry. And I would be totally cool with him traveling for leisure, but just at a less frequent rate (like 2.5 - 3 weeks out of 8). And I enjoy traveling too and I would love to go but I have obligations that have prevented me from going with, and that’s not likely to change soon.

But right now, I’m just so frustrated and bitter, and I feel bad that I’m holding on to these hard feelings because I love him and want him to do what he enjoys, but I feel like my needs are being forgotten about, and I don’t know if I’m making something out of nothing or if my anger is a reasonable reaction.

So AITA?

EDIT: Thank you guys for the honest feedback and suggestions that followed. It really did help me that it’s not malicious, but my feelings are rational and valid. As some of you have suggested, we might be growing in different directions. This could also be just a temporary road bump because of the different places in our careers. I should have made it clear in the original post that there has always been an outstanding invitation for me to join on adventures, but I’m in a position work wise where I don’t have that flexibility. We’ve been together since we were teenagers, so almost 10 years, and there’s not a reason (in my mind) why I would consider calling it quits right now. That being said, I made this post to see if my feelings were valid, because if they were I would sit down with him and have an emotionally honest conversation of how I feel, what the expectations and boundaries are that would increase my feelings of happiness and satisfaction in the relationship, and how that aligns with his needs and expectations, etc. And then just go from there to see if there is or isn’t some type of resolution. If you guys said my feelings were irrational, I would have dropped it, and focused on what’s going on with me and why I really feel this way. I love him and I don’t want to end things at all, but my happiness, and our current lifestyle compatibility are worth a conversation, if nothing else. So thank you for the    feedback and the advice, it really helped me put things in perspective!",26,27,0.91

989,Asshole,"My girlfriend is applying for a schorlarship and it required her to write a motivational letter (Why do you want to join this course, your hopes&dreams, etc.). She asked me and another person to help her write this letter but at the end we have to rewrote basically everything because her english is really bad and if she had kept her way of writting then you just won't understand what she is trying to convey. Anyway, she was happy with our version of the letter and sent it to the school. Now fast foward to today, me and her and some other friends are chatting about the scholarship and my GF brought up her motivational letter and said she had a hard time writting them but was proud of it. I sarcastically said ""Well, I had to write almost half of that"" and she was really annoyed. Later on when we were going home, she was angry and said that I shouldn't have said what I said and even though she appearciated my help, her letter is still hers and she don't want her friends to think that I wrote all of it (Which I didn't say). I apologized and told her I won't make jokes like that again but she kept bringing it up and make examples of how she still wrote some parts (Which I fixed with the other person). It was getting annoying so I just told her ""Hey, it's your letter but no one can understand it. I spent a lot of time rewritting it for you it is barely yours anymore. And I didn't say I wrote all of it by the way, you are just making it up"". The ride ended with her calling me an asshole. So reddit, am I the asshole? I know I could have reacted better and I shouldn't have made the joke anyway but I honestly think I wrote many parts of that letter and I deserved a little bit of recognition.(Oh she didn't even thank me when I helped her btw)

991,Not the A-hole,"Ugh this was frustrating on multiple levels but maybe I'm too close to the situation.

Several months ago, my(F25) siblings in law(M26, F19) took a road trip.  Since they were driving a very long ways, they asked to borrow a membership card i had to save on gas.  It was a weekend trip and BiL promised to return my card when he got back into town.

Long story short he didn't. Now i accept part of the responsibility there is on me.  I should have followed up. But we're all busy forgetful people and a few weeks ago i started pushing harder.  I wanted my card back to use the membership.

My partner asks him only to be told BiL gave it to SiL assuming she would see us first.  They don't live together so this is inconsistent but whatever.

Finally we go on a road trip with them and my partner asks SiL for my card back.  After a lot of dodging and evasiveness she tells my partner it was stolen weeks ago with her old wallet.

This was infuriating to me.  I feel like the responsible thing to do on her part would have been to tell us when it was stolen so i could replace it.  Yet when i brought it up to her that she was disrespectful and immature for not telling me she said that she had no control over her wallet being stolen, and didn't feel like apologizing because it wouldn't cost anything to replace and that at my age i should be handling this differently.

For my part i feel really disrespected and irate because i can't replace what i don't know is missing.  This would have been a non issue if she had either told us in the first place or apologized for losing something of mine and not saying anything for weeks.  Am i overreacting?  Am i in fact the asshole here?

EDIT:  Thank you for all your comments.  I will not be lending them anything and I was probably overreacting to a degree.  The advice here did help to put things into perspective.  At the end of the day it's a learning experience and one i could have handled with more grace than i did.",122,1687,0.96
992,Not the A-hole,"Little background info: my bf has kids from previous relationship that are living with us every other week. We're both full time students but most of my program consist of writing stuff at home and having meetings with other students maybe once a week. 

Long story short: the kids are going to school/ preschool in other district, where their mother live, bf usually drives them both in the morning and afternoon, sometimes they take a bus. Kids sometimes get sick, which is natural, so they have to stay at home. Their mother usually tells us to have them over until they get done again so they don't spread it to her family too, which I can understand as well. The problem is, my bf very rarely informs me about this earlier than when he's standing dressed in the door, leaving for school, like ""oh btw, kid X feels sick so they'll stay at home today"" and leaves. Then I'm forced to cancel whatever plans I had to tend to his kids. I told him countless times this is not OK with me, because it's much easier to reschedule my work or appointments if I know more than 5 minutes prior, but he just says I'm being a bitch about it, because I'm at home anyway.

995,Asshole,"Hello all, very intrigued as to opinions on the following:

&#x200B;

I am a heavy sleeper, and I mean a HEAVY sleeper. Because of this my first alarm wakes me up 3.5 hours before my shift at work starts, and in case I don't wake up I have alarms every 30 minutes to periodically wake me up and ensure I don't go back to sleep/oversleep etc so I can get to work on time every day.

&#x200B;

Lately the person who lives in the apartment below me has been banging on the wall/ceiling when my alarm goes off, which I'm guessing is because it goes off at 5.30am.

&#x200B;

This morning, my alarm went off at 5.30am and there was no banging, but I was too tired to get up and slapped the snooze button. 5.40am the alarm finishes it's snooze cycle and goes off again, at which point I turn it off.

&#x200B;

5.45am I hear loud banging on my apartment door, very aggressive and continuous banging. I would describe it as ""open the damn door"" knocking. I ignore it because I'm too tired to deal with confrontation and I don't want to end up in a shouting match that wakes up the rest of the residents. Then they go downstairs outside the building, and start pressing the buzzer for my apartment and just holding it so it's a constant buzzing. Then I unplug the receiver and the noise stopped.

&#x200B;

I have emailed my building manager to advise of the situation and for them to suggest the best course of action moving forward, but I have the following questions:

&#x200B;

1. Am I the asshole because my alarm is too early?
2. Am I the asshole if I'm a heavy sleeper and require 3/4 alarms over a 2 hour period to wake me up?
3. What actions would you take in response to the actions of my neighbour?

EDIT: Fair to say I didn't expect this many responses!

A bit of additional info for those who have related comments, I go to bed at 10pm and my first alarm is at 5.30am if I start work at 8am. I leave the house at 7.30am.

I've tried setting my alarm for 7am but after 9 hours of sleep I find myself really struggling to find the energy or 'get up and go' and end up being late for work. Those of you who get up easily will call me lazy, those who are in the same boat I thank you for your understanding.

My alarm does not go off the entire time, it goes off for about 3/4 seconds at 5.30am, 6am, 6.30am and 7am.

Thank you for all of your comments. Some of them are ironic as you are calling me an asshole while being an asshole yourself but lots of helpful comments here and thank you to those who said YTA and delivered their response respectfully. I'm not a rude or disrespectful person but I've not lived in a complex like this before and I've lived with many roommates over many years who have never complained about my alarms so this is more about ignorance on my part.

I'll make changes to make my alarm go off later and quieter; person downstairs can hear because my bedroom is directly above hers. It's worth noting that I don't think my alarm is THAT loud, and my partner rarely wakes up to my first alarm.

To those of you who suggested earphones I actually sleep with earphones in but they always fall out by morning time; suggestions welcome.

To those of you who suggested moving my alarm/phone across the room I will try that.

To those of you who suggested something buzzing or flashing I will look into it, open to suggestions if there are affordable products available.

To those who said the neighbours actions were justified, I still disagree. There are more amicable ways to deal with things like this, hence me not answering the door (to avoid an aggressive neighbour) and putting this post to see opinions so I can empathize with the neighbour. I don't want to piss them off, I just want to get to work on time and I have a hard time forcing myself to get up quickly in the morning.

Thanks again for all the helpful comments

EDIT 2: I do ignore my alarms or sleep through them. The alarm goes off, I wake up and turn the alarm off. Then in my tired state I fall back to sleep and the next alarm goes off 30 mins later. Today's occurrence was when I hit snooze while I was half asleep, and then it went off 10 mins later instead of 30.

When I use the phrase ""heavy sleeper"" I don't mean that it's impossible to stop me from sleeping, I mean that even after 7/8 hours sleep I still find it difficult to wake up fully, resulting in me falling back to sleep very quickly.

EDIT 3: apologies if those who are voting YTA don't like my edits, people are asking for more information and I'm just trying to answer questions this way rather than replying to a thousand comments!

Please note one of my edits where I did say that I'm going to make my alarms later and make it quieter, and also look at the silent alarm options. I'm trying 😂 set my alarm for 6.30am today, no banging from my neighbour and only 1 alarm went off. Sat here with a coffee trying to 'wake up' (i.e I'm awake but I feel groggy)

Thanks again for all the suggestions in this post and I think while I live in this cardboard box of a building I'll start by finding a quieter way to wake up at 5.30am, and see a doctor about my sleep and my levels of tiredness.

FINAL EDIT: Thank you again for all the responses, opinions and suggestions and they have been delivered in such a wonderfully varying manner of ways. Thanks also for the personal messages/chat messages etc as well and the advice etc. My inbox has completely exploded! Due to the volume, I won't continue to respond to any more comments or make further edits, if you want to discuss this and would like a response then I will respond to direct messages still :)",1053,2235,0.92

998,No A-holes here,"I've been with my girlfriend for 4 years and we are moving in with each other at the end of this year. I'm really excited but there's a big elephant in the room I'm not sure how to tackle. I'm not amazing with money but not terrible. I don't have any debt and I have some modest savings that are growing steadily (I'm 27 years old, for reference). When we met we were on similar wages but over the years I've received a couple of promotions and now earn a little under double what she earns.

We have been on a couple of trips together over the years and they have almost always stressed her out to the point of us arguing about them. Where I am getting excited with the planning, she gets defensive and finds the planning of it anxiety-inducing. Throughout our relationship it's been hard to bring up any plans I have without bracing myself for her reaction, which in turn stresses me out. It's worth noting I'm pretty budget conscious when it comes to holidays. I'll try and pick destinations that don't cost too much to get to or get around in, book cheaper hotels, travel by bus or train instead of planes, etc. I love travelling and to be honest would have done it more if I was single.

She has been open about being in debt from day 1 of our relationship. It's pretty much all credit card debt she has accrued from living beyond her means; trying to keep up with friends spending big when she was in her teens and early 20s. She's upfront about how she accrued it and I would say she lives pretty frugally now. She took out a loan to consolidate the debt, but has told me there's still a little left on one of her credit cards too. To my knowledge she buys very few material things, only the essentials.

I've tried talking to her about it but she always skirts around the topic of how much debt she is in exactly. I haven't asked her outright, but have tried to hint at it. I don't want to be pushy, but I want to have a future with her and I'm scared of involving myself with a debt I can't handle.

I've not really seen any evidence that over our time together she's made any progress in paying off the debt. She says she has made some strides, and I want to take her word for it, but I'm unsure. She talks about keeping her head down and being disciplined to pay it off, but it's been years now. It makes me think either she's not being disciplined or it's just a huge debt that's taking years to get on top of.

I'd be open to helping her pay some of it, but I also don't want to embarrass her or bite off more than I can chew if it's more than I am prepared for. I'm not exactly rich. I love her, and I'm willing to live frugally in solidarity with her until it's paid off, but I feel that if I have to heavily compromise my lifestyle I should know how much it is and have more visibility on the progress of it. 

I want to push and ask outright how much the debt is in total. WIBTA if I did this?

EDIT: Thanks all for your insights and thoughts. She is coming over tonight and I feel more prepared to have a patient, empathetic and supportive discussion, yet direct. I'm not interested in infantalising her and telling her what to do, I just want to be her teammate and understand exactly what we will be facing together.

 Some answers to frequently asked questions:

1. I do intend to marry her. This is literally the only thing in the way. She's an amazing human being and I don't want to judge her for poor decisions she made when younger. I'm far from perfect too.

2. She has always been honest about having the debt and we have had numerous discussions throughout our relationship about it, including taking steps such as consolidation and frugal living. My concern has been born out of the length of time it has been since she's seriously put her head down to pay it off. I'm starting to realise that may be my own naivety on how hard it is to pay off even a 'little'  (I feel like what this entails is highly subjective depending on the individual) bit of debt. Again, talking frankly with her about the amount and the repayments will help me understand. I've never had any debt - never went to University or had credit cards in my youth. So I can't say I have experienced first hand how hard it is.

3. When we vacation I pay for a minimum 60%, usually 70% of the costs. If we go out to eat I'll always cover 100%.

FINAL UPDATE: It was a really good talk. It was 22k, she's down to 14k now. She was really relieved to just get it out in the end. It's certainly not small, but it's not astronomical. I have shelved any future travel for a couple years at least and we are splitting rent 70/30. I won't pay for any debt outright but these changes should help her put as much as possible into her repayments. I'm also going to cover electricity, water etc. We will reassess every 3 months and see if we need to make any further adjustments.",117,543,0.96
999,No A-holes here,"Hey guys. Quick one. This happened back in ‘15 during Christmas and I just want to know if I was justified or not. 

We were in our Uncles house for a christmas gathering. After dinner, one of my uncles said he has a present for my sister. A Laptop. My sister gets very excited of course because she needed a laptop for her school works. 

My uncle goes and bring out the laptop and to my shock (I did not make it obvious), it was a 97-98 HP Omnibook. My sister of course thanks him for the “gift” but when we left I immediately told her and my parents I was so offended. His (Uncle) reason was they just got a new laptop and they no longer needed it. It is very apparent that the laptop has been in storage for a few years now. Dust all over, cracked body etc. and it had a dead battery with no charger. I told them that it was just as if Uncle was dumping his useless junk on us so it could be our problem now on how to dispose of it. 

Obviously after taking it to a laptop technician (whose blank face I could not even describe, just absolutely blank), he told us it was useless. Nothing can be salvaged, we couldn’t even sell it off for parts. The technicians we went to even refused to take it off our hands for free. My dad did get my sister a laptop (3 years later though cause we still had a desktop computer which we eventually sold) and she was so happy. My folks told me to just let it go but I just remember that moment every now and then. 

Redditors, was my reaction warranted? AITA? I know I should’ve moved on already but I just can’t forget my sisters face after we left.

Info: Uncle isn’t tech savvy. He gives gifts but some of them are used already.",73,185,0.94
1000,Not the A-hole,"Here's the deal. My family has always been poor. I'm talking like food stamps, mother regularly pawns her wedding ring and then buys it back, taking out payday loans for any minor financial crisis poor.

For information's sake, my father, the primary income earner of our household, is emotionally abusive, and demands to be entertained whenever he is off work at night by going out to eat, often garnering $70 checks, and also smokes a lot of weed and drinks often. If he doesn't get the money/things he wants, he becomes belligerent, breaks things, threatens outlandish things (like quitting his job), actually took his stuff and moved out for a couple days at one point... It's definitely complicated.

My mother and I are very close. Since my father has the personality and emotional tolerance of a toddler, I ended up being her confidant when finances got bad, and knew the importance of covering my own expenses through high school. I often went without things, willingly, because that was what needed to happen.

Right now, I am a freshman in college attending on full financial aid/scholarship. I worked some throughout high school and was very dedicated to both saving money, because I know things are very stressful financially, and working hard to get into a good school so I could advance socially and get out of that situation. As part of my package, I got about $3000 in cash from my school to go towards books, supplies, cost of living, winter clothes, etc. My plan was to save as much as I can, simply because that's how I am.

That said, my mother has access to my checking account (I made it at 16, and at our bank I was required to have an adult on my account), where my scholarship money is. The issue comes into the fact that she has currently transferred about half my scholarship into her bank account in the last 45 days. I went home this weekend and she said this morning that she would transfer some money back to me. However, I just checked my bank account and she instead took another $200 out.

I've loaned my mom money in the past, but she always tells me and pays me back promptly, and it's never been this much money. It's to the point I'm starting to become really uncomfortable and worried that I won't be getting my money back. I'm also a bit confused, since I'm not living at home, she should logically be spending less money since my family is paying $0 to attend school. That said, I know that my father is only demanding more and more of her, and she's currently having some major health problems. She normally works a full time and a part time job, mostly to deal with his bullshit, but she isn't able to work the part time at the moment because of her health.

My question is, WIBTA if I demanded that she stop taking money, even though it would cause her to endanger her health and likely escalate tensions with my father?

edit: Based on the urging of literally every person who's commented thus far, I've applied for a separate savings account at my same bank (where I will be sole account holder), so I can immediately transfer my money to that. Looking forward, I'll consider a credit union or another bank, but this is easiest for the time being

edit 2: okay, so after talking it over with a few people who know a couple particulars of the situation that I'm not comfortable sharing on Reddit, here's my new plan: along with the new savings account at the same bank, I'm going to make a new checking account at a completely separate bank, which has a branch on campus and no branch back home. I will, obviously, not tell my family. I'm going to keep the joint account open for the time being so not to cause trouble, but take the vast majority of the money out of it. To do that, I'm going to use checks (like actual paper ones), and say that I've made some purchase/paid a fee with it, but just cash it and deposit the money into the new checking account at the new bank. I know that probably seems excessive, but that way, she thinks the money is gone-gone, and not just moved around. Thank you, to everyone, for your advice",143,1332,0.96

So the company that i did work for as a subcontractor was  purchased by a corporation that flips companies.  Days after, i found out that the previous owner, who stayed on as the president negotiated a huge windfall for himself  - millions- once the company is sold again with no provisions for the other 10 people that helped build up his company. 

I was so angry that I started a competing company with technology that I had been trying to practically give him for free for years. I thought it would fizzle out after my anger went away, but lo and behold, i got two investors and it has taken off.  So much so that i met with the previous company's staff and offered all 10 of them jobs. 

The president thought he was so smart with his contract and screwing everyone else but he wasn't smart enough to protect himself from a mass walkout.  All but 2 people took my offer. I told them at the time it was a one time offer. 

Within 6 months, the 9 of us have become wealthy through profit sharing. The other company went in the dump rather quickly. 

The president lost everything  and i dont care. T he two employees that did not take my offer want to work for me. I am refusing to hire them. Some of my current employees agree and some do not. Am I  the asshole for not hiring them now?

1013,Not the A-hole,"So this is stupid, I know it is. I don't think I'm in the wrong but I'm willing to listen to other people not in the family. For the sake of not attracting my family, some info will be vague/switched out. 

So my BIL and SIL went on a holiday about 3 months ago. BIL's ancestry is from France (I'm not sure if that's how you word it specifically). So pretty much his great grandparents are from France and they moved to USA before BIL's grandfather was born. BIL and his family have never been to France before and when he married my SIL, they decided to go on a family trip to see where their ancestors came from. It sounded great and they seemed to have a great time! Then he started complaining about the tourists in France, how they were ruining the culture in France, being rude in someone's else's country, how he would have changed all that and pretty much talking shit about tourists. 

In all honesty, I got really pissed off listening to him and pointed out that he was a tourist as well. He disagreed and said he was a Frenchmen and tourists were ruining his country. I told him, nope, you're just another tourist just like them and that he was probably like 20% French. He got pissed off and told me that whenever I visit my country, I'm just a tourist as well. I told him that was different because I was born in Australia and was raised there until I was about 10 when we moved to USA. He got even more pissed off and didn't talk to me for the rest of the night. 

I thought the whole thing was settled and we all moved on. Now it turns out that he trying to force upon French names on his kids (despite him and SIL already picking out names they agreed upon years ago), bombarding me with information as to why the French as the best in the world, taking a DNA test, decorating his house with flags and other French things, learning French and forcing SIL to learn French, and is now apparently thinking of moving to France. 

SIL doesn't know what to do anymore and has asked my husband to ask me to apologize. If it was anyone else, I would apologize, but BIL is honestly a pain, and I don't think an apology will do anything to lessen the situation.

1016,Not the A-hole,"Long story short, sometimes I have slept in our front room on the floor when we are having disagreements. My husband really hates it bc he thinks Im trying to make him feel guilty or throw a pity party but thats not true...I sleep really well up there its darker and I have more room. (We only have a Full size bed and cant afford anything else right now)
Recently things have been good for us relationship wise but every night I have been woken up squished to the edge of the bed with no room to move around. I turn over alot in my sleep and I told my husband (of almost 8 years) that hes been doing that and he told me that I shouldnt run away then. Hes trying to cuddle but I cant sleep like that. I tell him I love him all the time. I do thoughtful things. I tried to explain that to him but he told me that i just ""have a warmth problem"" meaning im ""cold-hearted"" bc I cant sleep while being smother cuddled. That made me mad. I understand he feels bad but I cant change the fact I cant sleep like that. We went to sleep that night and he didnt wake me up trying to cuddle. The next night we go to bed no problems but sure enough middle of the night Im scooched to the edge and hes in the middle of the bed. I tried to turn over and accidentally hit my knee on his leg (couldnt put it in the position i needed) and IN HIS SLEEP (i can tell with breathing rate) he muttered to me ""dont bump me on my side of the bed"" i got so upset that his default sleep mode is still ""asshole"" and fed up with almost a week of interrupted sleep, I got up and made a blanket nest on the floor in the front room and enjoyed some deep sleep until woken up by him barging in at 7:30 AM demanding to know why I was up there but when I started to reply about just needing space to sleep properly and wanting to sleep in(sunday morn) he walked away and ignored me which resulted in me freaking out about him being selfish and yelling at him being an asshole. He didnt even remember what he said at night..but doesnt matter bc it makes it worse thats his subconcious ""go-to"". I ended up waking up one of our kids (ones his, ones mine) and felt bad but was TOTALLY triggered by being continuosly messed with. He told me its all me...my manifestation...that my anger is nobody elses fault but my own...which made me even more pissed. I didnt wake myself up!!!! Ive been avoiding him all day until 4pm he sent a text that said ""i love you"" and i replied ""ok i love you too"" he texted back... ""What? That was yesterday"" apparently the text was sent yesterday when my phone wasnt working properly but didnt arrive till today. Weird timing. I said that it was probably his FBI buddy trying to help him out. Hes said ""im fine"". Now I want to sleep in the front bc Im super mad. Kinda hating him right now.

1017,Not the A-hole," I worked in a bubble tea shop last night, and something came up that still bugs me. The story is, a group of family ordered their drinks. Things went smoothly and calmly, and every order I tell customers is to look at the register's screen to make sure if their order are correct. I asked that family to look at the screen, and the woman said ""No it's (the order) not good... I'm just kidding. '' I took that as the order was correct since they both smiled at me.

We did their order and gave their drinks. However, they told me there's a mistake. The man told me that while ordering, he wanted more bubbles in his drink, and I put the extra bubbles in the wrong drink. There are two things here: 1. while ordering he didn't specify which drink he wanted more bubbles and 2. they confirmed their order from the screen like I always asked. I apologize to them and prepare to re-do their drinks. Before I remove the seals, the man stopped me and said that I should put bubbles in his drink, the one that suppose to have bubbles, BUT leave the other drink alone that already has bubbles. I was going to fix their order, but the man asked for more bubbles, which means both orders were different.

I told him that I had to charge him for putting more bubbles since he's adding more to the order. That is when the man got really upset and tossed his money with a toxic attitude. I fixed the drinks and then the man and the woman told me I was giving bad customer service because they said it's my fault for not getting their right order. I've told them I was sorry, but also told them that I asked them to look at their order on the screen and confirm so that I would not have an argument over this. The woman later said I was blaming them. The man followed up as ""Yes, it's ALWAYS the customer's fault"". The whole family walked away while the man took a picture of me as like he did not care. Few hours later, he posted a picture of me, without my permission, and his complaints on Yelp.

The point is they blame me for bad customer service because I took their order wrong, but they looked at the screen and confirmed their order. Our store is run like this: if a customer wants to add more add-ons (bubbles, jellies, and puddings), we have to charge them.

I talked to my boss and my parents about this situation, and one thing I found out is that many Starbucks places will just give the wrong order to the customer and give a new one. If we make a mistake though, we would take it back and re-do their order. I think this is why the man was upset because he believed I could give them the wrong drinks and the fixed drinks. My boss told me to not worry about it much because those type of things happened before.

So, of course, AITA? Did I really give a bad customer service to them? After working for 2 years, I've never come across to this point where such dissatisfaction made them really upset. Any feedback is appreciated, and many thanks in advanced.",36,52,0.88
1018,Not the A-hole,"I've been thinking about it for the past couple of months. Basically the day after I moved into an apartment with my GF. 

My family didnt lift a finger to help me move, or help me out in anyway during the move. I moved 30 minutes away so I understood if people didnt jump to help out, but what hurt was when they only asked me to if I was still going to have rent for the month of the move. 
My girlfriends family, whom I am very jealous of, emptied their schedule, gave us anything and everything we needed, helped us move, and everything else they possibly could do. 

Some backstory for the relationship between me and my family;
I was basically the punching bag for them. Whenever something happened they would blame me, or just make fun of me in anyway possible. They would always say they were just giving me shit, but the majority of the stuff was just neverending. 
My immediate family was full of abuse and neglect, which my siblings took out on me. 
I payed for my Rent, Phone, and helped out as much as I could. But if I didnt do the dishes one day, or if I left a mess in my room I was threatened to be kicked out. I'm just so tired of all of their shit and being taken advantage of by them. 
My girlfriends family has taken me as one of their own and have shown me kindness I've never seen before. Thown me birthday parties, invited me to every family event, and always been there. 

TL:DR My family has always harassed me, taken advantage of me, and bullied me and I just want to cut them out of my life and just focus on my girlfriend and her family.",24,38,0.96

1020,Not enough info,"My boyfriend (late 20s) and I (late 20s) have been together for three years. I feel like we get along well most of the time, but lately our relationship has been effected by his parents (retired and able bodied). They live about a 2 hour flight plus 2 hour drive away. One at a time they come visit my boyfriend, often with less than a day’s notice and never a departure date. They stay with him for anywhere from 3-6 weeks at a time each. Every time they come, they expect him to give them a place to stay and a ride to and from the airport, even though they have another child in the area. He has a one bedroom home, so during these visits he has to sleep on the couch. When they are in town, the expectation is that I am supposed to stay away (we don’t live together) and give them their privacy, which I do. During his mother’s most recent visit she was in a very depressive state and sitting around the house not doing much of anything. When she finally left, the house was very dirty. There were dirty dishes piled in the sink and the house clearly hadn’t been cleaned to any degree since I had cleaned it before she came. Upon seeing this I was furious, I told my boyfriend there is no excuse for me to find the house in this condition after his mother had been here relaxing with no obligations for over a month. This ignited an argument, in which I iterated that I hate his parents and think they’re selfish. He defended his mother’s actions and said that I’m the selfish one and we departed angry with one another. The next weekend I gave in and cleaned the mess, which he helped reluctantly, but still sees no problem with this. I feel that this is unfair, as we both work very hard and she was in the house doing nothing for over a month and couldn’t even pick up after herself. Now, only a couple of weeks later, his father is due to arrive (no departure date given) and this argument over his parents is reignited. I told him maybe he should tell his father that now isn’t a good time to visit, but my boyfriend calls me selfish and says that our relationship is incompatible with the way I feel about his family. I think they are taking advantage of him and intruding on our lives, he sees no problem with their behavior. Their negativity is spilling over into my life and causing me to be in a constant state of anxiety. Am I out of line for feeling this way? AITA?",91,38,0.85

1024,Not the A-hole,"Last week, my sister (20F) told my parents she wanted to go to NYC for a few days soon for her birthday. My parents agreed to pay for the trip (as my sister currently cannot) as long as I (24F) went with her. They've always been anxious parents that probably bordered on helicopter parenting more than once, and my sister is the baby, so they're most protective of her. My sister really loved NYC when she visited a while back, and this is the only thing she wants for her birthday. She readily agreed to my parents' terms.

The thing is, my sister and I have a pretty bad relationship. We were never close, but in the past year or two, she's changed a bit, and all of her qualities that rubbed me the wrong way before have been exacerbated. She's currently seeing a therapist once a month and is on some medication, but it doesn't seem to be helping much. Her tentative diagnosis from what I know is Bipolar II.

I haven't lived with my sister in 6 years. However, I have gone on 1-2 family vacations with her in the past year or two, and they've been nightmares. My sister gets *extremely* moody and often turns on people with no warning. Less so on my parents, since she's still at their mercy financially/is actually somewhat close to them. Which leaves me as the lone target when we're all in close quarters. For example, she'll be totally friendly to me, and a casual conversation will go on without issue. Then, she'll be quiet for a minute, and the next thing she says will be totally out of the blue and frankly mean (""aren't you ever going to wear makeup? you might actually get a date then"" or ""I don't see why you're even on this trip, since you think you're so much better than everyone else"". I actually have high social anxiety and I'm really introverted so I do spend a lot of time alone). She constantly belittles anything I express interest or enthusiasm for. She will dig and dig at me, and if she ever gets a rise out of me, she acts like it's the worst thing in the world/will go full silent treatment for days. Last vacation, she got angry at me for defending myself (I shit you not, she said she didn't want to be in any photos with me because I was too unattractive to match her instagram aesthetic) and would not speak or make eye contact with me for 36 hours afterward. I wanted to cry.

So, I didn't agree to NYC. I don't want to put myself in that kind of position again with no way out. I'm at a vulnerable spot in life right now where my self esteem is in the gutter and I just don't think I can handle that trip. I hate fighting. I hate even being around other people who are angry. It makes my skin crawl.

She yelled at me about ruining her birthday and won't speak to me anymore. My parents are saying that she can't help her mood swings and that I should just get over it instead of ruining the only present she ever wanted. So, reddit, AITA?

tldr; I won't go on a trip with my verbally abusive sister, and now she can't go.

Edit: As to why they don't want her to go alone, I'll copy what I replied to someone below: they're kind of helicopter-parenty. They've been lucky to always live in a safe US suburb and they're paranoid about their youngest child going into a massive city alone (for the record, they had no issue with me going alone to London when I was 19 -- it's just her they're like this about). Hence, they'll pay for it as long as she has someone with her so they ""won't have to worry"". She doesn't have any friends she likes enough to take, and they both work full-time and can't take off to go.

I'm currently an unemployed recent grad and at their mercy, so I'm the obvious choice to go with her. It feels absurd not to go, since I'm both making my whole family furious and denying myself the opportunity to see NYC for the first time, but I'm just not in a mentally strong enough place to be okay with the situation it'll create.",64,98,0.93

1026,Not the A-hole,"Dad here, old fart, loves his daughter to pieces but I’m struggling to see eye to eye with my teenager and wife on this one. 

We’ve always been a meat eating family, we live in the rural Midwest and bacon for breakfast is pretty much a given. This year my 14 y/o daughter decided to go vegan, and I jumped onto her support team with enthusiasm. We learned how to substitute ingredients, cook new things, try new things, I adjusted our budget to include more expensive vegan substitutes for her, etc. 

None of this has been a problem for me until recently. She saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then I rinsed it out to load in the dishwasher. She exploded in anger (teen years, I’m not too fussed about the anger explosion, I know she doesn’t mean it) and said that that was HER pan for vegan food. I was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family pan, older than you, it’s not YOUR pan. 

She asked me to purchase her a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. I didn’t want her to feel weird about food, so I said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for her. The reason they’re colored is so it helps me remember that I’m not to touch them unless I’m cooking vegan. 

That wasn’t good enough. Now apparently the dishwasher is ‘contaminated’ with animal product, and the fridge has ‘bacon grease fingers’ on it (because I eat bacon and then touch the fridge) and she’s asked me and her mom to completely stop eating meat at home. I don’t mean I literally touch the fridge with greasy bacon hands, because I wash my hands, but it’s clearly enough that it upsets my daughter. 

frankly I’m on team hell no, her mom is much more amenable and strongly wants me to consider taking our daughter up on the request. My wife’s reasoning is that both our parents live close so we can eat meat products there, and that she doesn’t want our daughter to feel uncomfortable in the kitchen. My daughter says she is fine with cheese and butter in the fridge, but it’s specifically meat products that make her feel sick. Now I’m sorry for her, but I feel like she just needs to adapt and live side by side, because I’m not going to stop eating bacon in my own house.",7673,51397,0.89
1027,Not the A-hole,"My husband isn’t super religious but he grew up in a Christian home and hates when people use God in vain, like goddamnit. Out of respect for him I have cut that out of my language but I have caught myself slip before when I’m alone. This is important.

Well he came home from work on Friday and I felt like I was in a freaking circus. We have a two year old and a four month old. I am back at work and work 7:30-4 on most days unless overtime is required. We are lucky enough that my MIL watches our kids while we are work and we are beyond thankful for that, but when I come home I’m the one who does most of the cleaning, feeding and putting them to bed. I am also still breastfeeding and try to spend any free time that I have pumping. 

On Friday he came home after work and was whinier than usual. He was complaining about work, traffic, being hungry. He asked me once, “soooo babe, what are plans for dinner?” I told him I didn’t have tile to think about it. 5 minutes later after I put our two year old down for a quick nap and he asks “any ideas?” and I told him that I came straight home from work to pick the kids up from his mothers and that the two year old has been a nightmare and I have not had time. He rolled his eyes and I fucking snapped. I feel like I blacked out when i snapped, but I told him that he needed to get some goddamn fucking common sense and offer to cook or bring home whatever the hell he wants for dinner.

I haven’t apologized (yet) but I don’t fully regret what I said because I’ve explained to him a million times that I am exhausted and worn down. I wonder how many fucking times I can explain to a fully grown, competent human being that i need help around the house and with the children. Why do I have to tell someone that maybe they should fucking choose dinner and offer to bring it home? I think I’m more wrong for the God in vain part then the second half

1029,Not the A-hole,"I own a nightgown that I wear around the flat. I'll be the first to admit, the neck is a bit low, the skirt is a bit high, but it was never an issue with my (female) roommate as she's worn more revealing stuff before now and she said that it was cute and even asked me where I got it so she could get one. But then she got this boyfriend. And the boyfriend has a severe case of wandering eyes. I've noticed but as a lesbian all I can really do is remind him that I'm not into men and he has a girlfriend.

My roommate asked me if I could cover up when he's here. I think this is stupid as the only times I wear the nightgown are when I'm going from my room to the bathroom or to the washer/dryer/radiator to get clothing. Sometimes if I have a woman over I'll wear it long enough to grab some food but I'll take the food back to my room. I said it wasn't my fault her boyfriend is a perv and it's my place too.

She pushed me again about getting a robe and I work at a lingerie store so I get a staff discount. We have these robes that are knee length, silk, with a tie round the waist. They're not sheer but because of the location of the tie and my body type the robe is pretty low cut on me. and shows about the same amount as the nightgown, but probably does more for my figure as it cinches at the waist and I tie it tightly. It's a little longer than the nightgown but only a few inches.

I bought the robe, and every time I had to do something in the nightgown I'd throw the robe on over it and continue as normal. It's not helped with the boyfriend's wandering eyes. The roommate has approached me and said that when she asked me to get a robe, she meant a longer one, the type that's thick and fleecy. I don't want one of those, they're ugly and as my store don't sell them they're also expensive. I said that I'd bought *a* robe and I wasn't going to go out and buy a second one because the first one wasn't what she had in mind.

Roommate is frustrated with me. I am frustrated with her. Everything from shoulder to knee is covered but with the cinched waist and low neck it's not exactly what my roommate had in mind, but I don't see why I should have to get some huge bulky thing because her boyfriend has wandering eyes. I'm a lesbian, stealing her man is the least likely thing I'll do and it's not my fault if he stares.

1035,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I feel like I’m the biggest asshole, but I want some opinions. 

I (44M) currently live with my only son Brian (23M). Me and his mom broke up when he was 4 and I got full custody of him since his mom was unemployed  and doing drugs after he was born. She’s been in and out of his life since. She makes some contact, but not enough. Until he was old enough to be home alone, my mom would watch him. While he was growing up, I’ve tried to teach him to be responsible for himself, since I was always out at work and not home to be with him. He was always a big kid, but it was never a problem. 

When he got to high school, he joined the football team and began to lose the weight. He even started going to the gym regularly to build muscle. In his senior year, he got kicked off the team for bad grades. Around this time, my mom passed away, which I believe hit him the hardest since they were super close. 

Months later he started to lose all his motivation and stopped doing everything he used to do. He did graduate (late) but then he started to put on a lot of weight and smoke pot. I tried to encourage him to get a job and apply for college. He assured me he was but it never happened. I didn’t want to intervene because he is an adult and I couldn’t force him to do anything. 

Come last week, he texted me while I was at work asking me if I can take him to the mall and buy him new clothes because his current ones don’t fit anymore. I told him I would, but I can’t afford it right now. I did say I’d get him a few shirts and a pair of pants at Walmart, but he wanted to go buy things only at the mall. 

After a minute of talking, He refused to get anything from Walmart and only things from the mall. I got annoyed and said “maybe if you got off your ass and got a job, you wouldn’t have to ask me to buy you shit.” He hung up and called his mom, to which she then texted me a whole bunch of bs saying I fat shamed him and I’m just bullying him. I told her that I never mentioned his weight, but apparently he thinks I did. She told me if I didn’t get him what he “needs”, she will, to which I said go ahead. I’m not sure if I’m right to stick to my guns or if I’m just being an ass by not getting him what he wants.

edit: something I didn’t mention is that when his grandma passed away, he went for a wellness check up because of the rapid weight gain. I went with him and spoke with his doctor. I asked her to recommend us some mental health services because I did believe the weight gain was linked to depression or anxiety. She gave us a flyer, to which I told Brian to look into those things and to work on himself. Like usual, he said he would, but never did. I pushed him to get help, but it felt like he didn’t want any, and like I’ve mentioned before, I can’t force him to do anything. I love my son, but there are something’s I can’t really do for him.

Apparently she knows that this is my fault and I convinced him to get married far away because I don't want them there because I hate her and I've always hated her. Exactly none of this is true, of course. She and FIL are perfectly capable of traveling that distance. He's getting up there in age but they take yearly vacations to Europe that far exceed that travel time. 

She called fiance yesterday and laid the big one on him. Either we have it here or they don't attend. I'm only half surprised, really. Now fiance is sort of freaking out. He's been shifting between upset and pissed and straight up heartbroken. His mother has always been a piece of work but this is just next level. He tried asking her why but she just kept saying that she doesn't want to be there if he refuses to respect her and his father's wishes. 

His brother texted me today asking if I'd please agree to move the wedding here to keep the peace. I'm far more inclined to call this woman on her bluff because I'm about 90% sure that she's bullshitting in an effort to manipulate my poor fiance. Fiance is somewhere in the middle- he wants us to have our wedding where we want it but right now his mom is driving him crazy. 

Aita for not giving in to my MIL? 

Some details to add-

 Aside from my dress, which my mom graciously offered to pay for, we're paying for the entire thing. The venue we're using is more or less a mansion that we're renting out for a few days so many of our guests are staying there for free. We've also offered to help paying for flights for anyone with that worry.


Edit- Fiance and I talked it out today. He's still 100% behind our (yes, our) decision and is very happy to tell his mother to go pound sand. He was just understandably disappointed by her reaction because he was sure she'd love the idea.",258,1192,0.97

He doesn’t say anybody’s names, not even his own first name, he just says mommy, daddy, uncle and grandma, grandpa (even for the great grandparents) without any first names, but for them he wants him to just learn to say their names “because it’s his parents.” 
I told him I’m not going to do it and that our son is just two and not a circus monkey and he simply doesn’t say anybody’s names. We had an argument, he said that I always refuse what he wants and he hung up on me and now we’re not talking. Am I the asshole for refusing to do this?

Edit: my husband is Persian and in jail, so he’s not with us. We’re in touch over phone and visit every month. His parents live abroad and far away, that’s why they are coming over just now. It’s not an issue to teach him grandma, grandpa, but he wants me to teach him that in Persian plus their first names and he told me “you have 20 days to do it, just keep repeating it to him”. I don’t see why he can’t just call them grandma/pa when that’s fine for anyone else in the family, when I call my grandparents I don’t use their first names either, only when talking to a third party about them.",171,485,0.94

What's inevitably going to happen is that she's going to turn the AC on and there's going to be no gas, or she's going to play music with the bluetooth/aux and mess up my phone's connection (my car is finicky and it tends to work better when one phone connects to it).

1048,No A-holes here,"So a couple months ago, one of my good friends who was assigned male at birth, came out as trans. I’m extremely proud of her and I support her entirely, but since I’ve known her for so long, it’s been a struggle for me to remember and address her by her preferred name instead of her dead one, especially since she’s now in college and I don’t see/talk to her daily anymore.

I always feel so horrible when I accidentally deadname her so for the time being while I adjust to it, I pretty much always call her by her last name, since there’s no chance of me accidentally deadnaming her. I don’t think it’s that big of a deal since for the past couple years, I’ve pretty much called her solely by her last name anyway as a meme, so she knows I’m not devaluing her at all and it’s purely with good intention

However some of my friends think it’s very rude of me to call her by her last name. They constantly tell me that she needs to feel supported and that she can’t feel supported by me if I don’t call her by her new name. They say I’m almost degrading her which isn’t my intent at all but lately it’s really gotten in my head. I don’t want to hurt my friend at all and that’s the only reason I’m doing it this way. I feel like calling her by her last name until I’m used to the change is much less stressful on her than accidentally deadnaming her

So Reddit, AITA?

1051,Not the A-hole,"So that title definitely makes me seem like I'm the asshole, but hear me out.

I've had a lot of pets in my childhood despite my family hating pets. They wanted to make me happy so the suffered, for a while. Fish inevitably died, birds were given to relatives without my knowledge, etc. And through this all my little brother was never given the chance to have a pet of his own.

I love having animals in the house and agreed it wasn't fair, so I fought for him and we managed to get a kitten. My brother is 15 and a social butterfly. He has a million friends he constantly spends the night with, he spends all his money on video games and his outtings, and he likes to sit and play video games from sun up to sun down when he is home. We all knew this and knew he wouldn't have the time, patience, money, or attention span for a cat so I said I'd help with all those things.

I payed for the cat and all of his toys, treats, food, and supplies for. I would guide him. I knew my brother hated being told what to do and being checked up on, but I thought that for a living creature who needed both of us he would listen and appreciate my help and eventually get into a routine and not need me.

That was my only stipulation, I supervised and made sure conditions were good for the cat and if not I told him to rectify. My brother decided to stop listening to me almost as soon as we got the cat. He wouldn't clean his food bowls and would put fresh food on top of the old crusted food, he leaves the litterbox filled with waste, so much that his room stinks and it floats into the hallway when he opens his door and the cat kicks turds out of the box onto the floor.

I constantly try to tell him not to do these things, but he gets angry and just won't. It got to the point where we had a screaming match and our mother told me to leave him alone, because it's his cat and he can do what he wants and eventually he'll do better on his own. Neither of them seem to understand that this is a living creature who deserves the best treatment we can provide and it upsets me so much.

Lately I've taken to just doing everything on my own. I clean the litterbox, my mother and I keep up with food and litter, I bathe him when necessary, keep his food and water bowl clean, and everything. I'm 18 and I'm planning on finding a roommate and moving out. I feel like the best course of action for Smoke would be to just take him with me.

My grandmother agrees because it's her house and she knows things are going to get worse when I leave and that I'm the primary caregiver for Smoke, but my mother is only concerned with my brother's feelings. I know that my brother loves his cat in his own way and will be devastated if this happens, but isn't the cat more important than this. I'll feel horrible, but I think this is right for Smoke's sake and when he's older he'll understand what he was doing wrong. Should I steal the cat? WIBTA?",56,165,0.94

We are all mid-late 20’s going through the struggle of working really hard to get where we want to be in our careers, paying student loans, and all that fun stuff. We occasionally chat about work issues, late nights at the office, etc., but it has become almost painful to even mention work because when the topic comes up, it immediately becomes a competition with the teacher friend. Even when no one is talking about work, she likes to talk about “teacher life.” I respect teachers and their hard work, but I can’t take it anymore as someone who is also underpaid, and works 50-60 hours a week 50 weeks a year. I never barrage people with “office life” comments or make it a point to complain about how hard I work. I recently reached my breaking point when I was asked what I was up to, and I told my friends I was at work still (at 9pm) and the response from said friend was how teachers always do that. The issue is I was asked what I was doing. I wasn’t looking to hear about her life. I also know for a fact she is never at work that late. I told my other friends that I can’t be a part of these conversations anymore (essentially, I need  distance).

7 years ago when my daughter was 8 yo my husband passed away in a car accident. We were both  so devastated. He was a wonderful husband and father and I still miss him terribly until this moment. 

2 years after that I met this wonderful gentleman at church and got married 6 months after. He was a widow in his early 40 and never had a child. Him and his first wife tried for many years but was never blessed with one. His first wife passed away 5 years prior to us meeting each other due to cancer. Being a working single mom was too tough and I was incredibly lonely. And I kinda know him around the church for years just never got close or anything. 

It’s been almost 5 years of us being together and it has been wonderful. Him and my daughter are super close. Maybe because it was due to the fact that he has always wanted kids but he is really good and close with her. He spoils her to death in a good way and be a very good father figure to her. 3 years ago we were also blessed with having another daughter. My husband doesn’t play favor between his two girls and I can tell that he loves them equally.

They almost never sleep in the same bed anymore. They said they want a divorce, but they won’t do it because they have children.

About 2 days ago, I was trying to sleep. It was about 1AM and I had school the next day. My mom was yelling at my dad because he put his brother before the family, and my dad replied that he didn’t even want to be in the family anymore, and the only reason he stays is because of the children. 

They started screaming, crying, and breaking things. They were talking about how they wish they never got married. I’m used to this, but I’d finally had enough.

I went downstairs and said something along the lines of “shut up! I’m trying to sleep! I don’t care if you get a divorce! It’s better than having to listen to you guys scream and cry like children every single day! So yeah, go ahead and get a divorce. If you really cared about your children, you’d want them to be in a better environment than this!”

1058,Not the A-hole,"My (18F) parents divorced when I was a baby and afterward my father wasn't around all that much. My dad is remarried and I have a much younger sister. Once she was born I saw my dad even less. When my dad and stepmom make a plan to come and visit me they're never on time. Sometimes they've kept me waiting for them as long as two to three hours. They've missed most of the important events in my life because they were late. It's so strange because they both have jobs that require incredible punctuality. Whenever they're late they use the excuse ""we were all sick the night before and overslept."" My dad calls it The Crud. ""We all had The Crud last night.""

I graduated from high school back in May, they missed my graduation because they were late. We only live two hours apart. However, my stepmom's younger sister, who is my age, graduated from HS in May as well and lives eight hours away, they were on time for that. They're never late for events that take place with her family. However, if it involves dad's family they're always late. My dad never calls me, near texts, I get a call or text maybe two or three times a year. I almost always speak to stepmom about things.

It's important to note I've been dealing with the psychological effects of my father's lack of regard for me since I was a child. My therapist says I have abandonment and neglect issues streaming from lack of reliable parental figure. I have a lot of resentment towards my father in particular. My mother has been supportive and never says a negative word about my dad. However now that I'm an adult she's been gently urging me to go low-contact with my father in order to begin healing. My therapist agrees. However, it's hard to tell someone you never want to see them again when all you ever wanted was to matter.

Recently they emailed and asked me if I wanted to come up and see them and little sister. I agreed and they sent me the gas money to drive up. On the day of the visit I woke up feeling incredibly resentful. Here I was waking up early and leaving the house earlier than necessary so I'd be on time to see them when they've never extended me that curtesy. So I went back to sleep for another couple hours and woke to a text asking if I was on the way. I told stepmom I'd been up all night with The Crud and overslept but I'd be there shortly. I took my time, had some breakfast,stopped off for gas and car snacks. By then I was an hour and a half late. They started texting and calling. I let them know I was okay. When I finally arrived I was three and a half hours late. They were pissed. They were even more pissed when I pointed out that this is what they do to me every single time they come see me. They were cold to me for the whole visit. When I got home I told my mom about it. She said she understood but I should have just kept the peace and acted better than them.

The age gap kinda made it weird when I was with her, I saw her as nothing more than a parental figure and not an equal.  We never really fought since the age gap was pretty big and from what my parents say she did raise me a lot when I was a baby.  She moved away to college when I was 8 and I was pretty sad cause back then I loved playing with her and she loved having me around as a little minion lol.  She got into a serious relationship in college and she didn't come down for any breaks cause she went with him up to his family.  I think I saw her once or twice on Skype but I was in that kinda rebellious/shy phase so I never really said anything but a simple hi.  After 8 years of not seeing her she came down for thanksgiving with her SO.  I had no idea what to think about her coming down I wasn't happy or angry or anything she felt like a distant cousin.  That whole holiday went well, I didn't talk with her much cause I was in that rebellious phase and just kinda kept to myself.  

2 years later I moved out when I was 18 and she did help me with tips and tricks to starting up an apartment and how to find good roommates which was pretty cool.  I still didn't feel like anything to her but a distant cousin that I can ask for advice here and there.

1065,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR: Person in front of me on a flight was watching a movie on their phone, without headphones. I asked them to turn volume off. AITA?

On a commuter flight (in the USA), a guy seated directly in front of me was watching a movie without any headphones.  He started playing the movie shortly before takeoff. It was loud enough that I could clearly follow the dialog. As politely as I could, I asked him if he had a pair of headphones. He told me he didn't. I offered him a pair of earbuds that he could keep. I warned him that they only OK quality.  

Note: They're earphones that I give away at trade shows or when I do training (some learners need to re-watch lab videos because the walk through isn't enough for them and often don't bring earphones to training. I buy nice-ish ones in this category in bulk that are about $1 each. FWIW, I think they're better than the ones the airlines give out.) 

At this point, he got upset ""I'm not wearing those trash, I'll turn the volume down"". I asked that he mute his phone, not turn it down. He said he was shocked that I'd be so rude to ""call him out like this"" and that I should ""use your cheap earbuds to listen to music to cover my movie"".

I looked at the other passengers for help, and they just kind of shrugged at me or were very intently staring at their mobiles.

AITA? 

Has the social norm shifted? Nobody else called this guy out. He certainly didn't lower the volume as he said he would. The flight attendants walked past him multiple times, no other passengers said anything. 

Without my prompting, after the flight the lady seated next to me said I wasn't polite to embarrass the guy like that. That what he was doing wasn't right, but by publicly shaming him I made the situation even more uncomfortable for all.

I thought I'd just bend over and pick them up but apparently there was a hole in the floor and they fell into it, making them unreachable. I immediately called my landlord asking for help and he very quickly let me know that they fell into the downstairs dance studio (which is closed on Saturdays) and that he would send someone over to help. Shortly afterwards someone came by to open the door downstairs and was able to pick up the keys from behind a closet somewhere. The whole thing was very efficient and I sent a ""Thank you"" text to the landlord.

&nbsp;

Now here's where things got messy. The landlord replied with:   

&nbsp;

Landlord: ""I sure hope you gave him a big $20 tip""

I didn't reply because I didn't think a tip was warranted and also didn't want to get into an argument. It wouldn't be the first time I had issues with this guy and talking has never solved them.

Saving you big bucks replacing keys and car fabs and you stiff him. I am more than embarrassed. Hope you feel comfortable making good to Bob. I know he wont jump to your aid in the future.""

&nbsp;

Me: ""I appreciate what he did for us and wasnt aware that a tip is customary in this instance. However there also shouldn't be a hole in the hallway where items can fall in, dont you think? I'll certainly think twice next time to ask fro help now that I know im expected to tip your employees""

&nbsp;

Landlord: ""There never is a need to tip my staff but when they go out of their way to help you for something stupid you did it would only be a very nice generous thing to do regardless of whom they worked for. That is the reasonable thing to do. A little generosity and appreciation goes a long way in life.""

&nbsp;

Landlord: ""Bob the guy is a pain in the ass"" (this wasn't meant for me lol)

&nbsp;

Me: ""Thats very rude""

Landlord: ""Agreed it is rude not to tip a quality provider. It tells a lot about the character of an individual""

Although I'm very good friends with the guy who moved out, lets call him John, there's no denying he is an absolute cunt e.g. phenomenally gifted academically/well off and has no problems rubbing it peoples faces, hits on almost every girl/guy (he is bi) he sees regardless of whether their boyfriends there/if it's appropriate or not and he's done mma for years so no one can really do anything to him.

&#x200B;

The new guy, lets call him Alex, who came in is ""ok"", but he works part time and him and his girlfriend take up the living room 90% of the time watching crap on the tv none of us are interested in. We've had a few clashes where we've wanted to use the tv and asked him if he has to be in here 24/7 but nothings really happened either way and it isn't too much of an issue since we could go to Johns house. A few weeks ago we decided enough was enough and invited John around for cards/drinking in the living room when we knew Alex was in the living room with his girlfriend. Sure enough he started talking to the Alex and when he realised he wasn't really friends with us he started hitting on his girlfriend. Alex was annoyed obviously and squared up to him, someone told him it wasn't a good idea so he awkwardly sat down and told her to ignore him. John then started hitting on him, after about 5 mins of this he stormed off.

&#x200B;

A few days pass and Alex asks us not to invite him around  again, we say sure as long as you only use the living room on tuesdays and thursdays. He says ok, everythings good for a week until he's hogging the tv for the whole of saturday and we invite John round again who proceeds to be his usual cunty self. Alex never seems to come out his room anymore and one of the housemates think it's a bit harsh, it was my idea and frankly i disagree you can't just hog the tv like that. AITA?

1073,Not the A-hole,"This will be kind of long but bear with me. (Also on mobile..so, shitty formatting and all that.)

I have 2 step sons, Z (21m) and D (18m). Their father and I are no longer together but I still stay involved in their lives. 

Z, his father, and I all work at the same place but Z does not yet have his license but is in the process of trying to get it. (D also does not have his license but D also doesn't have a job and isn't in school.) In the mean time Z depends on me and his dad for rides to work. It's always worked out fine since we all work at the same place. The only issue is we all work varying hours because we work in different departments. Recently our job informed us that a lot of us will be moving over to the new building while others will stay behind at the old one. They want Z and his dad to stay and they want me at the new building. I am Z's main ride home most days since his dad is the service manager and usually needs to be out in the field and out of the office. He doesnt usually come back to the office and just goes straight home. (It's a long commute for both of us to and from work. It's a 2 hour drive both ways.) 

Work informed Z that they want him to stay but the catch is he needs to have a ride to and from work. Z and his dad work different hours so they were hinting ""hey, hurry and get your license and a car so we can have you here the hours we need you for."" So, when I purchased my new car, the first person I offered my old vehicle to was Z, naturally. He has the means to pay for it and also the need for it. But it's not the best for long commutes. It's one of the reasons why I bought the new car. My old vehicle is a gas hog. I was easily dumping 80 to 90 dollars a week in gas in this thing. Z knows this and he declined the offer. No biggie, I dont blame him. It's not the best, so after he declined the offer I then made the offer to my boyfriend's ex wife since she has been without a vehicle for some time. She gladly accepted the offer and was very happy. She only commutes in town so gas won't be as big of an issue for her. I thought that was the end of it. 

Z's dad is not happy. He is mad that I made the offer to Z but not to D after Z declined. I didn't offer it to D because their dad has always told them that if they wanted a car that they would need to be able to cover at least half the cost of the car (and dad would help cover the other half) and also be able to pay their own insurance. D is not able to do this because D doesn't have a job. So, I never even thought to offer it to D. Their dad hasn't said it outright, but is implying that by offering it to Z and not D that I am playing favorites. I told him I didnt offer to D because I knew D couldnt cover costs. That's when their dad informed me he would have covered the cost for D. But by then it was too late. I had already offered it to my boyfriend's ex wife. Their dad has now been telling our group of friends what an asshole I am for offering it to Z and not D. 

So, reddit, I want to know, AITA?

ETA: I wasn't charging anything for the vehicle but there's still a cost for tag and title.

1075,Not the A-hole,"Hello! 

My husband & I recently moved into a new house near my in-laws. They’re generally lovely people but we can’t see eye to eye on this issue.

My in-laws have 3 dogs - they’re very sweet and well behaved animals. I love dogs. Unfortunately, I have a pretty severe dog allergy. If I’m in the same room as one, I will get hives, start wheezing, and eventually my throat starts to swell. It sucks because I really do like them and wish I could play with them but i just can’t. 

Whenever we go to my in-laws, I pump myself full of antihistamines, and bring along my inhaler/Epipen. Usually I spend the day feeling really groggy and drowsy, and need to use my inhaler periodically, but I can be in the same house as the dogs at least. I do this because it’s their house, and I’d never ask them to make adjustments for my sake.

We’re hosting thanksgiving this year and my in-laws told us they’re bringing the dogs, since they can’t be alone all day. 

I really don’t want the dogs in my house because 1) I don’t want to spend all day feeling lousy because of medication, especially when we’re hosting, and 2) my house is small and I’m worried about hair/dander getting all over my house and causing problems after they leave.

Well, they blew up at me over it and are basically threatening not to come if they can’t bring the dogs. They say I should just suck it up and take medication, or they can’t come (they live 30 minutes away and don’t want to leave the dogs all day).

I feel awful and my husbands begging me to just allow it, but I feel really resentful of them for this and I don’t know what to do.

1076,Not the A-hole,"My dad left my mum when I was around 3 and my sister was 1. He rarely paid child support and was generally non existant for the majority of my life.

Every few months he would get in touch and arrange a trip, or a hangout, and then 9 times out of 10 would bail at the last minute, or just simply not show up. We would get excuses a few days later, I forgot or I had to work or some other bullshit. During this time he had several partners, all of whom already had kids around my age. Some of them went to the same school as me and I would hear all the great things they would do and how my dad is this great stand up guy.

There were a lot of times where he would take my sister out for a couple of days and I wouldn't be invited or wasn't even supposed to know. This has led to my sister always defending my dad, and they are fairly close now (she has 2 kids and he has a good amount of contact with them.)

About 9-10 years ago (I would've been late teens) he messaged me saying he was sorry for all the times he let me down, and that time was running out for us to develop a relationship. I replied telling him that he had 20 years to build a relationship and that I don't want anything to do with him. As far as I'm concerned he had his chance and I told him this.

Now I have a 2 year old son who has never met my dad. My partner supports whatever I decide in relation to this. My thought is if he wasn't a dad to me then why would I let my son get involved?

My sister says I'm an asshole for this, that I'm denying him his grandson and I think my mum agrees but hasn't said as much.

We don't live together, but we keep essentials at each other's houses. Naturally, my GF has a toothbrush at my place. Some more background, my GF is the type to get weirdly sentimental about anything she owns. As an example, I've seen her get teary when she accidentally lost a hair tie before. So, to the situation. One day we were dog sitting and the dog got her toothbrush and chewed it up really bad. No big deal I thought, I had a packet of new toothbrushes and I grabbed one for my GF. I was about to throw out her old brush when she yelled at me not to. She said she only wanted that specific kind of brush (honestly nothing fancy, normal brush). So I left her toothbrush but told her I would happily buy her a new one of the brand she wanted. She said no, her toothbrush is fine. Now it's been months since this happened, and she still refuses to get rid of the brush. It literally has MOLD growing on it, which I pointed out, and she casually shrugged off. I now keep her toothbrush separated from mine (because MOLD) but honestly I just want to throw it out and be done with it. WIBTA if I did and replaced her toothbrush with a new one?

Edit: Thank you all for your comments. I've tracked down the exact type of toothbrush and ordered it for her. When I get it, I'm going to sit down and have a talk with my GF about it.

1088,Not the A-hole,"This is not my story - I’m posting for my cousin. 


Hi reddit. I’m a mother of three, and my eldest is a 22 year old girl. I bought her a car for her 21st and she’s living with us for personal reasons. 

I ask her to park her car on the grass on my property rather than the driveway, as she gets back from work after I do and I begin work before her. 

I work from 6am to 1pm, and she works from 9am to 3pm most days, but there’s never a day that she finishes before me or starts before me. 

The issue here is that she refuses to park on the grass. It’s short and well kept but she is concerned she will get the white paint scratched or get the car dirty. This means that she parks on the driveway everyday and I can’t get the car out in the morning. 

I’ve tried to offer multiple solutions. I said she could leave her keys out in the morning so I could move the car and get mine, I could drive hers, she could wake up and move it and go back to sleep ect, all of which she has refused. 

The car is technically owned by me, and I told her that if she didn’t sort out the parking, it would be sold. I told her this about a month ago, multiple times and I recently posted the car on a sale group. Yesterday it sold and I gave the keys to the owner. 

I want to make sure everyone knows that she absolutely knew I would sell the car. I told her at least fifteen times and made sure she was aware I was telling the truth. I even showed her the post on the group and she shrugged it off. 

Now my husband is telling me I went too far, and should buy her another. She’s very angry at me and thinks I overreacted and was being rude. She’s living with us rent free and this has been a massive issue over the past year that I have raised with her many times. 

So reddit, am I being an asshole by selling her car?

EDIT: My cousin used the money from selling the car as a way to pay back the fees from taking the bus/ a taxi/ an Uber to work everyday for the past year as my cousin wouldn’t move.  

Being parked on the street was another offer made to her daughter that was also refused

I would also like to apologise as I don’t know the official term for ‘my cousins daughter’ so I’ll just refer to her as such

The mother/ my cousin didn’t want to park her car on the street because it’s insanely expensive and modified. It’s her pride and joy and is probably worth around 100k now including modifications, as it wasn’t cheap to start off with. Her daughters car however is probably only worth around 20-30k (I don’t know much about car prices and they’re both working now so I can’t ask). I also don’t think she should have to at her own house.",292,636,0.95

She happens to have a large mole on her face. So I decided to reply with something along the lines of ""when are you gonna get that gross shit cut out of your face, I'm sick of looking at you, its disgusting"".

This apparently crossed the line as she teared up and excused herself. 

Every time we would come in contact she would cover the mole. I had made her very self conscious about it. People at work started telling me how mean it was for me to do that.

Soon after she went in holiday for a couple weeks and came back mole free which pissed my coworkers off even more at me for lowering her self esteem enough to get it removed.

Long story short, she had a form of skin cancer which was caught in time and now, for the time being, she'll be okay. But everyone is still mad at me. Am I the asshole here?

If you are not a believer, it is boring af. Hell, Im Catholic and I know I'll be bored for 80% of it. I thought I'll spare them the trouble.

Anyway, one of my friends brought it up, saying I forgot to put the time and the church where the ceremony will take place on the invitation. So I said that she doesnt have to come to the religious part and just come for the wild party part. She got confused, I explained and she got annoyed to say the least. Said she isnt heartless and would sit through the 2/3 to see me get married in the 1/3. I tried to explain again & fix things but I felt guilty the whole time.

Edit: ah, I suppose I am TA. Just for clarification though: 
- we did explain things and they are coming to church. No hard feelings between us. 

- those who I decided to ""spare"" expressed anti-religious-events stances in the past (not going to Christenings, First Communions & Confirmations) so I thought it translated to wedding ceremonies

- i also thought it would be considerate to not force them to come because of the sense of ""they invited me so i have to"" and ended up going wrong about it :/",1723,21483,0.86

My stepsister has 4 year old twins, and a cat and dog. I've been at her house a couple of times but I never babysat, because I'm not good with kids. 

Well, her babysitter fell though last minute when she was supposed to visit her sick mother in law with her husband. She asked everyone but I was the only one available. 

I was kinda scared, I never babysat before, and two toddlers plus two pets sounds like a lot. I told her that too but I agreed. So that day I spend running behind toddlers, trying to walk the dog without losing the kids, making lunch and dinner, keeping the kids from bullying the cat, dealing with tantrums and meltdowns, normal babysitter stuff? 

I babysat from 9 to 9, to say it was a whirlwind would be an understatement, I was exhausted. I tried my best to keep the house clean but one of the kids did break a watch. I'm not ever sure where he got it from, it must have been in a drawer somewhere. 

When stepsister and her husband came home they where grateful that I could come, but annoyed about the watch. My sister told me it was about 120 euros (about 130 USD), and if I would pay her back. 

I told her no. She knew I wasn't an experienced babysitter at all, I was going all of this as a favour to them, and I just spend 12 hours working for free. I told her we could go 50/50, or that I could pay the difference of the watch and 12 hours of labour, but that I won't be paying in full. 

Now she thinks I'm entitled for breaking something when I was responsible and refusing to pay for it, which I guess I can see. I think she's a bit unreasonable too.

Yesterday I’ve seen a girl again I was friends with in college. We shared a flat and had a really good time. I realized pretty quickly that she is extremely unreliable. The first time I realized this, she was disappointed in her boyfriend (absolute asshat btw) for canceling a vacation so I asked her if we wanted to go. We made plans and everything, had a destination, a hotel we wanted to check in - until her boyfriend reconsidered and she dropped me and our vacation like no plans were ever made. Then I knew she was fun to be around, but no one I would LOVE to stay in contact with after graduation. 

Some other, more everyday examples: She canceled often because she was feeling sick, but because we lived together I knew how often she was faking it because she didn’t want to go. (She told me, I did not assume!) And if she’s doing it with everybody she’s going to do it to me also. She also often just forgets meetings. So overall there is a 70% chance she will not be there when arranged. 

I went to another city after graduation and soon never heard of her again. In the beginning we sometimes still texted, but she would just stop answering like 

She sends me a text “How is it going?”, I answer with a long text with facts and ask her “What going on at yours?” back. No answer. Okay, no surprise.

Yesterday, after 2 years, we met again at a birthday party. We caught up and she told me she was doing a training for another job, were she had to visit my city once in a while. She was like „Yeeeah, already wanted to ask you... Going to be in your city for a few weekends!“ I already knew what was coming.

Me: „That’s nice.“

Her: „Yeah, let’s meet up. You still have your apartment, right?“

Me: „Sure, and I know some pretty good hotels.“

Her: „That’s Not what I meant, I..“

Me: „I sure know what you meant, and I know some pretty good hotels.“

She laughed and it’s not like she was pissed or anything. And I’m honestly a little bit proud of myself because I’m normally struggling with telling people NO.

My brother has had his license revoked (to be fair, this was over ten years ago) for some significant speeding tickets. He brushed it off IN COURT. They took his license. He got it back a few years later. 

He has TOTALED 4-5 cars since then. 

He has exhibited road rage while I and my mother were in the car. We are both terrified of his driving. His girlfriend of 8+ years does not seem to have an issue. 

He STILL likes to drive way too fast for my and my mother’s comfort. 

To the actual story: a very close relative is having SEVERE health issues. We would both like to go see him. It doesn’t make sense with my big van for us to take separate cars on this 12 hour trip. However, both my mother and I have informed him that he would not be helping me drive this distance. Not only am I fearful for my safety, but my children's as well. They would be coming with me no questions. I do NOT trust my brothers driving. I have told him as much and why. He proceeded to say that HE did not feel comfortable with me driving twelve hours nonstop by myself, especially since I have some anxiety while driving (other people are f**king stupid). 

I have had one at fault accident (someone parked BEHIND me WHILE I was backing out of a spot?) since I got my license 12 years ago. No damage. 2011. 

HOWEVER. His car is apparently not in good enough shape to drive that far. I have offered room for him and his girlfriend. But I have stated that he is not permitted to drive (and I don’t know his girlfriend’s driving habits well enough to allow her). He has aggressively argued this, attacking my anxiety and my mother’s driving. 

But this trip is IMPORTANT. By telling him he may not drive while my kids are in the car (or even just me really) he has opted to figure out his own way or not go at all. This may mean that he may not be able to say goodbye to our relative if it becomes necessary and if my brother can not find a way there. 

I know driving 12 hours by myself is going to be difficult, but I still do not trust his driving. I have not ridden in the car with him for over a year because of my issues with his driving so I don’t know if he has improved, but he did total a car within the last 12 months. 

I don’t want to basically bar him from seeing our relative. But I don’t want my children to be put at risk. 

AITA for basically saying “I drive the whole way or you don’t go.” ?????",21,36,0.92

1105,Not the A-hole,"Backstory: I (25F) have a service dog (SD) who is very well mannered - more often than not people are SHOCKED when they realize she’s there. My SD is a larger dog and I rely on her for mobility aid, cardiac alert/response (tachycardia and low BP), blood sugar alert and seizure response. I mention this all because her tasks aren’t something a person could easily replicate and because in the car she takes up a single seat if she’s buckled in or her crate takes up the entire ‘trunk’ space if she’s crated in the back of my SUV. 

Story: My grandmother (75F) lives a few states away and has invited me to visit for Christmas a few months back. I spoke to my mom/siblings (49F, 23M, 22F) about going and splitting the cost of gas/food + making a driving schedule to get there. They said that sounds great and to let grandma know they would also like to come. I tell grandma and she is very excited to hear as it’s been at least a year since she’s seen anyone but me.

A few days ago my aunt (who I wouldn’t trust with a goldfish) approaches me and says, “Hey, so your mom and siblings have decided that they don’t want to go unless you leave SD at home because she’s a lot of work to travel with. I offered to watch SD and they [mom/sibs] wanted me to let you know that if SD is going they’re not going to join you... so you’ll have to let gma know why no one else is going to her house for Xmas if you choose to go with SD.”

I was baffled because not once has SD caused a problem anywhere. I confronted them wanting to know what the ‘issues’ are and they said that SD takes up too much room in the car, that stopping to let SD potty is a PITA and extends travel time, that SD draws a lot of unwanted attention everywhere we go, that it’s embarrassing when we run into accommodation issues (people not letting me/SD in), that SD has too much stuff we need to pack, and a few other minor things. My mom keeps saying “I want to just go somewhere with you for once and not have to worry about a dog”. I’m upset as it feels to me like they’re (mom/sibs) trying to manipulate me with guilt to leave my medical equipment behind because they’re embarrassed that I need/use a service dog.

So, Reddit, will I be the asshole if I book a plane ticket for me/SD? My mom and siblings can’t afford plane tickets, so they would still have to drive the 15 hours to see my grandmother for the holiday, which means there’s a chance that if I book a plane ticket they may still decide not to go and blame me for it (one less person to split the costs and drive time with). My friend told me I’m being petty and should just agree to leave SD behind because it’s only a few days and my grandma hasn’t seen one of my siblings in a few years; he says that I should ‘be the bigger person’ rather than counter their ultimatum with one of my own. What would you do?

To add, my grandmother loves my SD and I haven’t told her about any of this yet.

ETA: thanks everyone! I spoke to gma and booked a ticket for myself + SD ❤️",294,1117,0.96

1107,Not the A-hole,"
Okay, Reddit, I’ll try to explain this as best I can. I’ve ( 26 f) been with my boyfriend (30) for six years. For the last four years, we have lived in an In-Law-Suite in his parent’s home. We renovated the first floor by ourselves, and I love our little apartment/home. 

Last year, my boyfriend’s sister fell on some hard times, and needed to move back home to get herself back on her feet. She lost her job, her apartment and her car. This was completely out of character for her, as she is in her late 30s and had been independent for a very long time. Just before she had completely moved back home, the family discovered her drug use was the cause of her losing everything. She had been terminated from her job for stealing over a thousand dollars in cash, and could no longer find her habit while also paying for her bills and rent. 

As first, ground rules were laid out for what was expected of her if she was allowed to be back home. Remember, she is a grown woman, and my boyfriends family was under no obligation to take a drug user back into their home. To be allowed to stay she was required to take random drug tests, get a job, and pay her way. Simple. If the rules were broken, she had to leave.  

For longer than I’d like to admit, she duped us all into thinking she was cleaning up her act. We thought she had been passing drug tests for months, only to discover she had been using hard drugs the entire time, and had been using fake pee to pass the random tests. Knowing the possibility of a test was always looming, she had  learned to store nip bottles of clean urine in her bra at all times. 

To cut it a bit short, things have slowly begun to steadily go downhill. She is making less and less effort to hide her drug use, or she’s just getting sloppy. Her arms and hands are covered in track marks, and she’s recently had a few bad staff infections on injections sites, which she of course chalked up to an unrelated injury. Despite all the terms and conditions of her being allowed to stay home broken, nothing has happened. My boyfriends parents have done nothing about the situation, have stopped drug testing her, and don’t talk about the problem at all. 

Being that we have an In-Law Suit in a one family house, the only access to the laundry room is though our apartment. I don’t trust her. We keep our door locked, but my boyfriends parents allow her to access it even when we are not home so she can come and go and do laundry as she pleases. My boyfriend and I are not well off by any means, but we do have an expensive laptop, camera etc that I am always worried about. 

I am sympathetic to her plight, but I can’t live with her for another second. I’ve dropped hints about getting an apartment with my boyfriend, but he seems very reluctant about moving out of the space we’ve worked so hard to build. Am I the asshole for wanting to move out and distance myself from the whole situation?",16,77,0.94
1108,Not the A-hole,"    So I work at a hotel as a bellman and I was moving boxes for this bride (very nice lady) from her room to the bridal suite for her to get ready for the big day. There wasn’t a hook that was high enough for her to hang her long dress so I suggested this light fixture that protruded from the wall. She agreed and asked me to hang it there. 
Well a few hours later I get a call from my boss saying that the dress had caught fire. I was freaking out thinking that it was somehow from the light. Though this wouldn’t make any sense because they are very small LED’s used to light a painting. Anyways the entire wedding party was blaming me and I was requested to have a meeting with my bosses boss. 
Fast forward to the meeting I find out that the bridal party had turned on the fire place near the light fixture (where the dress was hanging) and that’s how it caught fire. 
Now I know that it probably wasn’t the best idea to hang the dress there. Though I feel like it’s common sense that you shouldn’t have a fireplace going with a flammable object very close to it.",39,267,0.95
1109,Not the A-hole,"“Emma” (24F) and I (24F) have been friends since high school, and a few months her boyfriend “Josh” (29M) of 3 years proposed to her. I was incredibly happy for Emma and Josh and let her know how excited I was for the wedding and told her that I knew it’d be amazing. She asked me if I would be one of her bridesmaids and I obviously accepted. Her wedding is planned for January, and I have been with her at every step. Everything was going really well in the wedding planning process until she came to me about the bridesmaid dresses. Emma has always had a much sexier sense of style than me, as I’ve never felt comfortable showing much skin. I have no issue with her dressing the way that makes her feel confident, but I prefer to be a bit more covered up. 

Two weeks ago, Emma messaged me a link to the [bridesmaid dress](https://www.thereformation.com/products/callalily-dress?color=Navy&via=Z2lkOi8vcmVmb3JtYXRpb24td2VibGluYy9Xb3JrYXJlYTo6Q2F0YWxvZzo6Q2F0ZWdvcnkvNWIwMzFlMjdjMzVjY2QwZjQxZTk2ZTc4), which has a low neckline and a high leg slit. I said “thank you, but I’m honestly not comfortable with that neckline or the slit. Would I be able to wear a dress in the same colour and a similar style, or have the dress altered to be more modest? :)” Emma didn’t reply for several hours, and then messaged me “it’s one day, can’t you do this for me?” I told her “I don’t want to show that much skin, but I hope that we can work around it.” She said “I don’t want to make exceptions for one person, it’ll look worse if one bridesmaid is wearing a different dress than everyone else. This is my wedding, I thought you’d be more understanding. If you were my real friend, you’d wear it.” I was honestly really surprised by this, because Emma has always been a really sweet and accommodating friend. That was the last time she talked to me, she blocked me after that and presumably removed me from the bridal party. I don’t think I did anything wrong, but my sister says I should’ve sucked it up and worn the dress for my friend. 

AITA for refusing to wear a revealing bridesmaid dress?

Edit: for clarity, I’m quite busty, and the last thing I need is for my boobs to pop out at a wedding, or just to be a distraction in general (chances are, many brides also wouldn’t want their bridesmaids’ bodies distracting the audience from the main event on their wedding day).",724,1850,0.95
1110,Not the A-hole,"I work as a part time security guard at a condominium that requires a key fob to gain entry into the lobby and any other entry points of the building. 

A new tenant that lives in the building informed the office management and security personnel that he is unable to key fob himself into the building, press the button to call an elevator to the lobby, as well as press the button inside the elevator to bring him to his floor due to his religion which forbids him from using electricity from Friday to Saturday every week. 

To keep this short, the reason why I do not assist him is because of his demanding attitude. He has caused many confrontations with myself and other security guards since day one because we will make him wait outside the lobby entrance until another tenant enters or leaves, at which point he will come in, or make him wait inside the lobby until a tenant calls an elevator, at which point he will ask them to press his floor number for him.

1111,Asshole,"I recently got remarried, and my oldest daughter (13) has made it clear to me that she doesn't like my new wife. Understandable, nobody likes their new step mom, but I would really like it if they could get along. I've tried to get them to bond, and my wife is all for it, but my daughter is very resistant. She has tried to make wild claims about my new wife being abusive, claiming that she calls her names or won't let her eat. Now, I know that my new wife can be a little tough. She may point out that my daughter's being lazy if she doesn't do her chores, and she may say no to snacks before she's done with her homework, but that is hardly abuse and I don't see anything wrong with it.

A couple of weekends ago, I had some stuff to do at work, so I left my kids with my new wife. My oldest daughter was, of course, opposed to this. While I was gone, she apparently mouthed off to my wife and refused to do anything she was told. My wife was annoyed and tried to discipline my daughter, which my daughter was not pleased about. When she went back to her mom's, she again made claims of abuse and whined about the fact that I left her alone with her step mother. My ex of course called me up and chewed me out, saying that it was my weekend with the kids, so that it should have been me with them, not my new wife, which doesn't make complete sense to me as my new wife is their step mom and should spend time with them, too. And now, my oldest daughter is refusing to come to my place. I'm not sure if this is her own decision or if her mother put her up to it to get back at me, but either way, somebody over there thinks I'm the asshole. AITA?",143,185,0.85

1114,Not the A-hole,"I (30f) recently planned a day out with my twin boys (7). My husband and I had our 3rd child 4 months ago, and due to being so busy with him, I haven't really had alot of quality time with my boys. There was a movie coming out that they wanted to see, so I decided I would make a day of it with them, take them shopping, mini golfing, a movie, and then a restraunt for dinner.

My sister (33f) suffers from depression and usually avoids going out with others, unless it's my mom or my kids (who she loves). I was out at my mom's for dinner during the week and my sister asked my boys what we had planned for the weekend, they excitedly told her what my plans were with them and how fun it was going to be. My sister then commented how fun that sounds and that she wished she could come.

I instantly knew where this was going, and sure enough, my boys asked me if she could come too. I didn't say yes or no, just said that we would see.

Later that night, when we were leaving, my sister said she would text me what time she was available and what time I could pick her up at. I told her I didn't want to say no out right infront of my kids, but that I actually didn't want her to come. I explained that this is my first time actually spending time with them since the baby came, and that I wanted it to be just me and them, she stormed off.

That night I got a few texts from my mom exploding at me for telling my sister I didn't want her there, that I know how depressed she is and how hard it is to get her out of the house (she lives with my mom) I told my mom the same thing I told my sister, and she more or less told me to get over it because ""I see my son's every day"" and that I was just making excuses for not wanting to spend time with my sister. I got extremely annoyed and told my mom I'm not responsible for ensuring my sister's happiness. 

My mom then told me my sister was going to stay in her room for the next few days, sad and miserable while I'm out having a good time with my kids and told me to do a better job thinking of others.

 This isn't the first time my sister has more or less invited herself to days out I have spent with them, there have been several times she has done this exact thing  One time she showed up at a science exhibit we took our kids, said she was meeting a friend, the ""friend"" didn't show up, and she started crying saying her ""friend"" was the one who purchased tickets and that she had bused there and how no day ever goes her way (she doesn't work due to the depression or drive) . My husband felt bad and ended up purchasing her a pass as well, and taking her to dinner and then home)

While I do feel sympathetic to her situation, I  have my own life and family and I shouldn't feel guilted because I don't want her to constantly be apart of it. I just got home from my day out with my son's, and feel unbearably annoyed and somewhat guilty due to messages from my mom, and my siblings telling me how much of jerk I am. AITA?

Edit: just to clear some things up, my family and I see my sister all the time, we are at my mom's house about 3 times a week minimum, and my twins have a sleep over there once a week, as well as numerous times she has left my mom's house due to something setting her off, and I have gone across the city to pick her up and either take her to my house, back home, or the hospital, and if I am being honest, it is draining feeling obligated to do all that plus have a newborn at home, sometimes I just want to be with my family and enjoy my time. Not to mention the fact that I am on maternity leave, and any time we do go out and she comes, it's on our dime (she gets some money from EI, but not much)

My sister does see a therapist, once a week I believe, but has actually been like this more or less her whole life. She is on some medication plus sleeping pills but her biggest problem is that  if anything or anyone in the slightest bit crosses her, she has an episode and grudges that lasts days (sometimes even years) towards whoever did  it to her,  and being like this has made it very difficult  for her to hold down a job or make friends.",335,1490,0.95

1116,Everyone Sucks,"RSVPs dont seem to be a ""thing"" here. You can send out invitations, you can follow up twice, no one responds. Everyone shows up to the party and most bring extra kids. 

I would rather not host any parties, at all, ever. Especially when planning is impossible because no one can be bothered to send a quick message to let me know how many might be in attendance. But my kid is turning 7 and he loves this shit. It's his birthday. 

Last year I sent out 24 invitations, received rsvps for 4 kids. 32 were dumped on my door step. The year prior was a similar story. 

This year we sent out 22 invitations with a request to contact me by phone, text, email or facebook. I've sent a few follow ups with no response. I have 4 kids that have RSVPd. 

The party was originally planned at an indoor playground nearby. The party place are hounding me for numbers and threatening to cancel the reservation if I can't provide them. Fair enough. 

My kid would actually prefer to hold his party at another location. I had vetoed it because it was way too expensive for the number of kids he wanted to invite, but for size of the party that have RSVPd, the cost would be perfectly reasonable. 

I want to cancel the party at the indoor playground, move it to the location that my son would prefer and plan to take only the kids that have RSVPd. 

It seems like a pretty reasonable course of action, but I'm pretty sure that 25 little kids will show up, gifts in hand, expecting a birthday party at the original place. There will be no party. 

So, AITA for making that the parents problem? Or just move on and plan a smaller party with the kids that I have been notified to expect? 

I don't want to communicate the location change to everyone, because the cost would be extreme if everyone showed up. I also don't want to continue planning parties for somewhere between 4- 40 kids because no one can be bothered to send a damned text message to let me know if I should expect their kid.",122,754,0.97
1117,Asshole,"My niece is five. My SIL and brother are big fitness people, full-fledged gym rats. My SIL’s while family is. They even have a full gym in their basement, complete with some kind of wrestling stuff (my SIL is a black belt in karate or judo or something). 

They workout daily. With her now. They think it’s cute. She started trying to do what they do, and they started helping her. **Right now**, she doesn’t use any weights (thank God), but they plan on getting her a set of 1/2 lb dumbbells for her soon. Her mom also plans to start training her soon, even though my side of the family thinks it’s far too young to start something like that (her family thinks it’s perfectly normal and completely healthy). 

They don’t keep any sort of candy or pop in the house. It’s only “healthy” food. The only time she gets “junk” is at something my family has, like my son’s birthday party. And even then, she won’t touch most of it. I tried to give her a Coke at his party, and she wouldn’t take it, said it was sticky in her throat, that she wanted water or tea. She was upset because her mommy and daddy say that your plate should always be half veggies. 

I’ve heard them talking about vitamins and macros and calories with her or at least in front of her. They think it’s good to explain stuff like that early, so that it’s not all thrown onto her when she’s older. They say that it’s good to get her started thinking about food as fuel early. But I worry they’re going to give her a bad idea about all of it. I worry that hearing about calories and all of that so young is going to make her obsess when she’s older. 

But also, to me and my family, they teach her to look down on people who don’t live like they do. They’ve taught her that working out is the way that you get stronger and faster and **better**, and that if you aren’t trying to get **better**, then you’re somehow failing yourself. 

It feels a bit like overstepping to say something, but I don’t like the way things are looking right now.

1118,Not the A-hole,"Context: I’m away at college right now. I’m an only child with a single parent. 


I was in my friend’s room, playing on her PS4 when I got a phone call from my mom. She had texted me like 10 minutes before she called me, but at the time I was in the middle of a match and didn’t notice. I still was in a match when she called me, so I quickly answered the phone and put it on speaker so that I could still play the game. 

We exchanged greetings normally, then she asked me what I was doing and I told her I was playing the game. Then she asked me why didn’t respond to her message and I told her that I didn’t know she texted me. She tried to call bullshit and say that every time i’m around her, my phone is in my hand, which is true but i’m mostly scrolling through social media and reddit. 

I asked her how long ago did she text me and she said ten minutes ago, so I told her “Oh, it wasn’t too long ago. Sorry, I’m not always going to be able to reply instantly.” And that set her off. 

She was saying that I was being disrespectful, and that I need to understand that there’s a pecking order (she’s the mother and i’m her child) and that I should be replying to her for each text. She was basically yelling at this point and hung up. My friend heard most of it and didn’t agree with how my mom reacted. 

My mom called back and yelled some more, was talking about how she was trying to help me with fafsa and that if i’m going to be disrespectful then I should figure it out on my own and that her financial responsibility to me was over when I turned 18. In the end she basically demanded that I apologize to her, so I did because she was making me upset and I wanted her to just stop.

1121,Not the A-hole,"My sister is mid 30s and has 2 kids (15 &10) who I'm very close with. I'm early 30s and have a small home right on the water, where everyone is welcome to use the outdoor equipment I have. 

In the last year or so, there's been a change in my sister. She only really calls me when she needs something (usually for the kids, so I don't mind). She borrows things and breaks them, and doesn't even offer to replace them. She comes to my house when I'm not there to go out on the water (again I don't mind), where she leaves my front door wide open and my dog gets out (which I only find out when I get a phone call from a neighbor).

Several weeks ago, her and her boyfriend came to my house (again while I wasn't there), and I immediately knew because my door was, again, left wide open. As I come into my house, I notice my dishes were mysteriously done and someone was also in my bedroom and had clearly rummaged through my nightstand. Now, I generally don't have an issue with her coming into the house to use the bathroom and such. But my bedroom has always been off limits.

I called her to ask her if she was there, where she originally lied about it, then admitted to doing the dishes, then finally admitted to being in my bedroom ""looking for a lighter"". The whole thing didn't make sense. Anyway, I made it clear that I didn't appreciate her being in my bedroom, she gets all mad, pointing out that she did the dishes (which I didn't ask her to do), as if that excuses the invasion of my privacy. So, we get into an argument where she tells me I'm no longer allowed to take my niece to our parents the following weekend.

My niece, the 10 year old, calls me later, in tears, very upset that she can't see her grandparents. She asks if we can go out the next day to cheer her up. I said yes. 

Now, I did try to call my sister that night to let her know our plans, but she didn't answer. So, the next day, I pick up my niece and I text my sister that we're going to lunch, where we'll be, and what time we should be back. A little while later my sister calls me, screaming that I kidnapped her child, don't f* with a mother and her kids, threatens to call the police if she's not home in 10 minutes, etc. I'm so freaked out, and my niece could hear the entire conversation, so I rush her home.

The next day we talk, where she explains that she was so upset because I didn't clear the outing with her first. Nevermind that's never once been a ""rule"", but whatever. By the end, I apologize, and she's on her high horse. She clearly had no idea how much her reaction had hurt me. To think even for a second that I could ever ""kidnap"" her kid...

Anyway, am I the asshole because, since then, I've ignored her calls and texts, unless absolutely necessary (like when she told me she's going to be late on the car payment that's in my name because she couldn't get approved)?

EDIT: I want to make it clear that I have, historically, always been able to pick up the kids at any time and hang out with them, never needing to run it by my sister first. The only exception, understandably, has been anything overnight.",45,35,0.85

1124,Everyone Sucks,"I’ve been helping my girlfriend out at a work event the last two days. Yesterday I spent 8 hours volunteering to set everything up and to help her out. I have a bum knee and back after a surgery and then a car accident within 7 months. I didn’t complain about my body once while I was there even though I was doing nothing but physical labor. I just put a smile on and helped the best way I could.

Today, the same thing, except earlier. I didn’t eat breakfast because I had to go do shit before I got there and on a time limit. Once I got there I had to do more volunteer stuff, but I went and got us a coffee because I knew she needed one. After about 3 hours I had to take a shit. So I told her I was going to go to her house and use her bathroom and make sure her dog was doing good since it was kind of hot out. 

I get to her house and her mom was there. Her mom kept asking me to do one chore after another and all I wanted to do was take a shit. After an hour of fixing the pool pump and other chores, I was dirty, sweaty and still had to take a shit. So I decided to go home after I told her mom I’m going back to the event, so I could shower and change clothes. 

I get home and my parents needed help bringing in furniture they bought and then they asked me to hook up the new router so they could use it. Again, still wasn’t able to take a shit. After I finished with all that I was able to use the restroom and shower. I get dressed and head over there.

As I pull into the parking lot my girlfriend starts texting me things like 

“thanks for leaving me alone here, you made me sad. I thought you were going to be right back” 

“You should have been smart and tell my mom no”

“I haven’t ate all day you need to learn to use your brain”

I told her to apologize for speaking to me like that or I’m going home and she said 

“You made the wrong choices but I appreciate your efforts, I’m not sorry” 

So I left and went home. She texted me back like 20 minutes later “I’m sorry, I didn’t know you did all that today. I feel better after eating”. She went to the restaurant with her friends that I told her I wanted to eat at with her so badly. It’s one of my favorite restaurants that we’ve never been to. She said “my friend said that I needed to eat and if you love me you’ll understand”.

I haven’t eaten all day and I’ve been starving, but I’ve been waiting to eat with her. That broke me and I started bawling my eyes out at home. I’ve been thinking about eating at that restaurant for two days non-stop and she eats there without me with her friends.

She told me “when you come back you can eat some food I’ll save” and I said fuck no. I’m not going back and then she said “you’re being selfish, I’ll remember this. Leave me alone”. So I am.

1125,Asshole,"I’ll keep this as short as possible. The last 3 days have been some of the worse in my life. On thursday a car crossed the yellow line attempting to go to another road (without looking) and hit me head on. I had no time to react. My car is totaled and I walked away with only a concussion/couple scrapes and bruises. I have been pretty much awake since then because of the emotional trauma i suffered. I am grateful that i walked away. (have pictures if anyone is interested in that). Anyways, my girlfriend has been super supportive and amazing through all of this. Today she told me some kid from her high school had messaged her and said “Hey your ex is John Doe right?” “he sent me these pictures” and proceeded to send the pics. I figured it was just going to be nude pics. My girlfriend and I obviously have past experience and a nude to an ex boyfriend that got leaked is entirely and absolutely not her fault. What he sent was 2 nudes of her and a picture of her sucking her ex boyfriends dick. I felt sick to my stomach. The kid then blocked her and she called her ex. He of course denied sending any pictures. She was crying and said I was “acting weird” I told her straight up that I felt bad about the situation and how it’s terrible that someone is spreading her pictures. I also told her that it fucked me up a little bit and i’d never want to see something like that. I told her it wasn’t her fault but i couldn’t help but feel upset. It’s one thing to be aware of someone’s past (no big deal in my book) but seeing first hand a picture of her sucking another guys penis wasn’t exactly flattering. AITA for acting slightly weird toward her? I can’t help but notice i’ve been distant tonight. I feel bad because she’s been here through everything. but on top of the emotional trauma from the accident and seeing a picture like that i’m burnt out. I know it’s not her fault and it’ll take a little bit to get past. What do you guys think honestly?",74,45,0.77
1126,Not the A-hole,"When we moved in together I was working part time from home, while he was working full time plus 1 hour commute. He was earning 4x what I was, so he payed 80% of the expenses and I paid the remaining 20%. To make things up as best I could we agreed that I should do more chores than him. I did probably 80% of the chores while he did 20%.

I did my part time hours and then I also did cooking, laundry, dishes, walked the dog, everything we needed to keep the house running, and it got to the stage where all he did was take out the trash. I didn't mind this because he was doing double, sometimes triple the hours I was doing and was paying 4x more than me.

&#x200B;

A few months ago I went from part to full time. I now do about the same hours as him for about the same money, but my work can still be done from home so there's no commute. On some days I don't even need to get dressed. We now split expenses 50/50. We sat down and renegotiated the chores so now we're doing equal amounts.

The chore rota is just one of us cooks and does dishes, the other cleans, walks the dog, and does laundry. We do everything together one day a week, and the other 6 days are split evenly.

Since the changes he's been complaining that he's tired from his commute so he doesn't want to do chores once he gets in. He says that since I don't have to take the train in and out of the city every day and a lot of it is a 5 minute job it's easier for me to just do it. He also says that on the nights I cook I can have dinner ready when he gets home, but on the nights he cooks we need to wait for him to get home.

He's also doing the chores wrong. The laundry gets washed, but he doesn't put detergent in or leaves it on the floor so it needs to be washed again. He's stopped cooking, and has started ordering takeout, which we then eat of out the containers with plastic cutlery so he doesn't have to wash up. The dog needs daily walks of around an hour and he'll come back after 20 minutes saying he's too tired to walk him any more.

I'll tell him that the clothes are on the floor and have to be rewashed, or that he needs to throw out the takeaway boxes, and I'll walk the dog longer the next day, but I won't help with his chores on his days, which he is getting frustrated with, saying that if I see something is wrong, I should do something about it, not tell him to.

&#x200B;

He says while my hours and financial contribution have changed, I am still working from home while he commutes, and it would be easy for me to just put the laundry in the machine or start making dinner between appointments and would save him a lot of time when he gets home.

I say as we are now working roughly equal hours and making the same financial contribution, we should also make sure that carries over to the chores because if we're working the same hours, paying the same amount in rent/bills/food, and I'm still doing 80% of the chores, that's unfair to me.

AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: His commute is an hour total for the whole day. 5 minute walk from our place to the station, 15 minutes on the train, 10 minute walk from the train to work. Twice a day means an hour total. His hours are 9-5 weekdays so he leaves at 8:15 every morning and gets home between 5:40 and 6:00 every night.

I know this is TMI but he's never tired after we go to bed. He'll say he's too tired to do chores but any tiredness will magically disappear the second he wants to have sex. It's not a medical thing, he's faking it.",48,30,0.86

Anyway I’m married and have a young son who has a medical issue. 

Basically let me explain the backstory first. I do not have a good relationship with this professor in general and don’t care for her. She doesn’t answer emails, answers a question with a question, isn’t helpful or understanding, hypocritical (you’ll see why in a minute). 

I informed her a week ahead of time that I wouldn’t be attending class one day because no one is able to watch my son literally. Usually my sister watches him or his grandparents. My sister had a doctors appointment that she can’t reschedule so she can’t. 

I don’t trust him with not known to family babysitters, atleast not yet and would have to get used to it. 

Basically, I don’t like this professor. There is supplementary material that she was supposed to upload to blackboard and hasnt done it for weeks and has broken her promise to me multiple times. 

Anyway, I was talking about missing class because I would assume their would be a quiz. I could get the notes from someone but can’t do the quiz in class obviously. 

She said too bad basically, and when I get in the real world I’ll have to be more professional. I tried to explain the situation, but to no avail. She said I couldn’t bring my son (ok). I said I would take it in the testing center a few hours later and she said no, no, no. I have to learn how to be professional. 

So I didn’t really care, class is about to end since the course is accelerated. I said “yeah, I’m sure you know a ton about being a professional. Taking weeks to grade assignments, not answering emails, breaking promises and going back on your word consistently, you’re the last person I’d want to get advice on being a professional from”

I, (18M) have a part time job that pays a little bit over than minimum wage, which I use to pay my fair share of rent, bills and petrol, as I still live with the family, and use the ‘family car’ (we have 2 cars, one that’s a big soccer Mum car, and a smaller one that I use when I work as I work late)

For the past couple of months, the family’s hit a spot of bother financially. Long story short, dad’s not earning enough to support a family of 5 (he freelances as a embroidery technician), and mum’s government payments have been cut as my youngest sibling’s just started school.

Obviously the best option would be that my mum starts finding a job, however, she hasn’t been working for 10 years, and her resume’s lost somewhere in a old computer we have. She’s also having trouble looking for a job where it would fall under school hours, as no one would be able to pick up my siblings, as dad would be at work, and myself at uni.

Dad has been looking for full-time, but is also having trouble finding openings. He’s applied almost everywhere, and he’s even applied for government help so he can get the ball rolling.

As I seem to be the only reliable source on income to the household, I’ve had to pay for expenses on numerous occasions. Normally this isn’t a problem, but recently I’ve had to tap into my savings that I normally don’t touch, unless I’m planning to buy something.

Enter the guitar. I’ve been saving for a solid bass and amp for a while, and it’s been a while since I bought something for myself. I’ve always been keen on playing bass, and I’ve really set out on spending a fair bit of dough on it.

I let the fam know about me planning of buying it and then they become disgruntled. They say that now is not the time, and give a lecture on the current financial situation. I am obviously done at this point, and defend myself saying that I’m legally and adult now, and that I can make my own choices about how I spend my own money. Long story short, they end up shaming me on not supporting the household and then ask for that money that was meant for the bass to pay for this weeks bills and rent.

Last weekend I purchased a gaming PC after only having a garbage laptop for a few months. Needless to say that I've been coming home from work everyday and getting on the PC until it's time to hit the bed. My (20) girlfriend (21) lives with me and originally wasn't happy with me purchasing the pc as is.

The last few nights she's been very unhappy with me, barely talking to me, going to bed early etc. I could tell that she wasn't happy with me being on the computer all the time so I tried getting off about an hour early to give her some attention last night, also took her to dinner. I had to work overtime today and was originally planning on playing while she was working, but that didn't happen, so I played after work. 

Fast forward to about 20 minutes ago and she starts getting upset so I sit her down to talk and explain to her that I'm still young and I'm not ready for these kinds of issues. I know how childish it sounds to tell someone that you would take video games over them but that's basically what it came to. I also explained to her that I would most likely be sick of the computer after another week, but she's still unhappy with me.

Update: 

We sat down and talked again and came to a solution. I work a set schedule of 6:30-2:30 everyday, and she works different hours. I'm going to be playing on days when she works, and a minimal amount of time when she's home.

1133,Not the A-hole,"I recently got a tattoo on my upper forearm, on the inner part right below my elbow. It's not an identical tattoo, or even a matching tattoo, but my fiance has a similar tattoo, and we got them around the same time. My parents do not know we're engaged, only that we're in a relationship and we live together, and we were going to tell them tonight at dinner. My brother and sister, who already know about the engagement, were also going to be at the dinner so it felt like a good time to do it considering they don't really like my fiance (he has other tattoos that they've seen and that is the sole reason they dislike him).

My brother, years ago (he's 30 now and he got it when he was in his early 20s), got a ""tramp stamp"", by which I mean he got a tattoo of the boy dog from *Lady and the Tramp* on his lower back. He thought it was funny at the time but once the hangover kicked in it was suddenly a lot less funny to him. I accidentally saw it a few years back and he begged me not to tell our parents because they hate tattoos more than anything and have said to all 3 of us kids, more than once, that if we got a tattoo that would be the final nail in the coffin for them, and have said that our grandparents would ""roll in their graves"". They said that the only way a tattoo could be worse was if it matched, because that was ""both ugly and stupid"".

I wore a white shirt to dinner which I guess was a little sheerer than I thought because at one point my brother loudly commented that me and Fiance must be sure about each other to get matching tattoos. My parents immediately asked me what that meant and I know as a grown woman who is financially independent and on track to getting married I should not have been scared to tell my parents I got a tattoo but I panicked. So when they started questioning me I said something like ""this coming from the guy with a tramp stamp"", which then set them off being mad at him. The louder reactions died down pretty quickly (we were in public) but they were angry at both of us for the rest of the meal, and they still don't know I'm engaged because of this.

I always knew my mom had access to my account (so she could take out my phone bill etc, which I was 100% okay with). However I've noticed that she's been taking out random chunks of money lately with no explanation. It was usually only $20 or so at a time so I didn't say anything. But, today I logged into my online banking and saw $200 was taken out, so this prompted me to look back a little bit and tally up what she's really been taking.

Over the past month and a half, she's taken $545 out of my account without telling me. I know this isn't a ton of money, but it is to an 18 year old who has been saving up for years to hopefully get myself a good secondary education with minimal student loans.

1139,Everyone Sucks,"I'm a co-captain/coach of an ultimate (frisbee) team. We practice in a public park on weekends, historically on Sundays but the past few months moved to alternating Sat/Sun due to player's schedules. 
There is a community soccer group that meets at the same time on Saturdays & they claim to have been doing this for the past 15yrs.
My team has been trying to work around the space that is still available, but we haven't been getting the space we need to properly practice. 

For today's practice we arrived & started earlier, before the soccer group arrived, to ensure that we got the space we need. This left them with less space than they felt was fair, despite them setting up their field so it intersected with ours (which we weren't going to complain about, we'd just be more careful in that area).
A man from their group came & talked with me about negotiating space. At his request, I tried to find another spot in the park where we could move our field that would give them more space without leaving us with too little space. Due to limited available space from other park users, it wasn't feasible for us to relocate today. The guy wasn't thrilled, but seemed to accept that that's how things would be for today, & asked if we could try to work something out for the future. Change the orientation of our field, maybe shrink it a bit, etc. I didn't make any promises, but I told him we'd do our best to make it work. We were both respectful, & we both returned to our groups.
While I was explaining the conversation to my co-captain, more guys from their group came over & tried to ask us to move. They weren't as respectful. I was trying to be reasonable while also holding my ground & not giving in to something that would be detrimental for my team. Eventually I put an end to it & said I needed to return to my team.

There were no issues during practice. After both groups finished, the first guy (seemingly in charge) talked to me again, & said that his players were upset. I apologized that we weren't able to work something out for today, & did my best to assure him that we would try to think about how we set up in the future so we can try to maximize the space for both teams. It's hard to come up with set boundaries, because the available space changes from week to week. 

I respect the fact that they've been playing in this park for so long. Some on my team think I should just tell them ""sorry if we get here first it's ours"" but I refuse to do that without trying to come up with a solution first. I'm trying to balance my responsibility to my team with not being a jerk to this group.

Other nearby parks aren't as high quality, aren't as accessible via public transport, or simply don't have enough space.

However, there is this one kid Jake who is always giving the other kids, the coaches, and the refs a hard time. He's one of the best players in the league (the star striker), but he often throws temper tantrums when things don't go his way. It also doesn't help that his parents are your stereotypical overbearing soccer parents; they would shout all game, lose their shit whenever he gets fouled, and screams at the refs about decisions. Most of the refs seem scared of the parents, and because of that Jake gets away with so much, almost never getting called out for pushing, tripping, or otherwise fouling his opponents. I admit that I have been part of the problem too, I was intimidated by his parents and therefore didn't give Jake a punishment even when it was deserved (he made a bad tackle on his opponent which normally should've been given a yellow card, but I just backed it down to just a free kick for the opponent's team). 

So there has been a tournament going in our youth league, and Jake's team has progressed to the semi-finals, and I was supposed to be the referee for this game. The game was going well for the most part, but at one point, it seemed like an opponent fouled Jake, and Jake fell down - from my perspective, the opponent never made contact with Jake, and Jake fell down to ""feign"" injury, so I signalled ""play on"". 

Jake's parents lost their shit from the stands and started calling me every name under the sun, saying I should never referee another game again. At the next stoppage in play, Jake then came up to me and said ""I was clearly fouled, are you blind or just dumb?"" Usually I would just give a verbal warning if a kid badmouths me, but between his past history, his parents screaming at me, and that statement, I had enough and showed him the red card (which means he's expelled from the game, and the team has to play the remainder of the game with one less player). 

Jake's team ending losing the game and getting knocked out of the tournament. Everyone - his teammates, Jake, and especially his parents - were furious with me and told me that I was the worst referee in the world and should never officiate another match. However, the other referees were on my side, they said that albeit that was a bit harsh, I wasn't in the wrong for showing the red card.

1149,Not the A-hole,"I work in a call center and a few weeks ago a new girl (early-mid 20s?) started working in my team.

It's a pretty big company, with a lot of people working different shifts, so it took a few days before I got to sit next to her during my shift, but the moment I sat down I was just assaulted with an overwhelming smell of rank, sour, old sweat.

For reference... I'm not particularly sensitive to smell. I'm one of those people who prefers the smell of a bit of honest sweat over somebody dousing themselves in some chemical aftershave or deodorant. But this girl's bo is just off the charts. To the point where it's literally distracting me from my work. The other week I was having a cold and I thought this would save me from having to smell the new girl, but nope. It was like her odour just coated my tongue with every breath I took and I could literally taste it for hours after I finished my shift. That bad.

At first I thought it might be a one time thing. Maybe she'd been in a rush and dragged on dirty clothes or something. 

But it keeps on happening, she smells bad every time she comes into work.

I've overheard people talking about her during breaks, so I knew it was not just me that has this problem with her. I didn't like that people were basically gossiping though, without bringing it up with her. 

So last week I pulled her aside and told her that I didn't mean to embarrass her, but that she had bad body odour. I asked her if she maybe had a medical issue that would cause the smell. She got sort of angry and defensive immediately (which I understand, because of course it was akward), and told me that it was because she hadn't had the opportunity to wash her clothes, because she doesn't have a washing machine anymore.

I suggested a laundrette that's close to our workplace, but she said that she didn't have the time and money for that. I didn't know her financial situation was this bad and I told her I was sorry and I offered to do her laundry for her. I told her it would be no trouble for me. She could just give me her laundry whenever our shifts coincide, and I'd bring them back for her the next time. But she told me that she didn't want that and that she'd sort it out herself.

Unfortunately, nothing has changed and she just keeps coming into work smelling bad.

So, the other day I brought the issue up with our supervisor. He said that he'd already had complaints about her from other coworkers, and that he's had a talk with her. So now he's going to send her to HR. 

Yesterday I heard from other coworkers that the new girl has been given a warning. I'm not sure about the details here because I wasn't there that day, but the word is that she'll get fired if she doesn't improve.

I was telling a friend of mine all of this and he said that I was an asshole for reporting the new girl when I knew that she was already in financial trouble. He says that I should have just ignored the smell, instead of causing her to maybe lose her job when she obviously needs the money.

1151,Not the A-hole,"My husband had a bad childhood. His father routinely beat him (and his 12 brothers) for as long as he can remember, is a raging alcoholic, forced my husband out of school at 11 to work on the farm, then sent him away at 14 to another country to work and send money home, which he did for years. His father stayed home and kept popping out kids with new wife (husbands mother is dead) to keep the welfare (not USA) checks coming in. FIL will ignore husband for months or years at a time and literally only contacts him to ask for money. This is not an exaggeration, husband hasn't had a single conversation with his father since 14 where FIL wasn't asking for money.

Now husband tries very hard not to talk with his father, but recently got a friend request from his little sister on facebook. He accepted and they spoke for 2 days before she asked him for $500 to ""invest"". Husband is pretty sure FIL is behind this and said he can't right now, but little sister has been blowing up his phone for a week asking for money for this and the holidays coming up ect and saying FIL wants to talk to husband. So my husband blocked her. She has now taken to blowing up my facebook asking for my husband. I lost my temper and told her that we know FIL just wants more money and all things considered, is it really a surprise that husband doesn't want to talk with them? 

Husbands side of the family is pissed and offended (expect his brothers which loved it) and husband is upset that I caused tension. AITA?",25,222,0.95

1153,Not the A-hole,"My nephew is 16. My sister and her husband have been raising him as a married couple for this long.

She and the husband were seeing each other around the time he would have been conceived and the husband has always believed that my nephew was his son. My sister and her husband recently told my nephew that he may not be the husband's son, as she had an affair around the time he would have been conceived.

My nephew was understandably upset and after taking some time to process the information told my sister's husband that he still loves him as a father and respects him as a parent but for his own peace of mind he wanted a paternity test. My sister and her husband said no, as he's their child as far as they're concerned, and they don't want anything to tarnish that. Nephew sees where they're coming from but says that the test won't change things, the husband will still be the man he views as a father as he's the man who raised him, but he needs to know if they're not biologically related.

He's under 18 and can't legally get a test where we live. He's approached me asking if he could request a DNA kit and use my address to receive the kit and get the results back.

1156,Not the A-hole,"My (20M) father(67M) is really rude and demeaning to everybody around him (particularly my mom which drives me bananas) but he's also incredibly sensitive (I usually wouldn't consider this a fault but it's just over the top). So whenever something happens that he doesn't like he reacts exactly the same way.

1. He swears at whoever has upset him (he completely denies this and maintains that he has never sworn in his life).
2. Storms off and slams his door shut.
3. Stays in there for several hours. 

This is his reaction to everything. The last couple of examples were my sister asking him not to kick her dog (she even said please), me telling him that it's rude to slam doors in my mother's face and finally I was walking towards the kitchen, he asked if I was going to the kitchen and I said ""yes"" and he got upset about the tone I used (honestly, I wasn't even using a tone, I just answered his question like I would to anyone else). This has all happened today. So this is basically what my house is like all the time, everyone is so afraid to upset him because he just flies off the handle.

And finally his process includes:

4. He makes a grovelling apology, usually in a baby voice and and says that he loves us and is so sorry.

My issue with that is that he never changes his behaviour and after he apologises he always is very self-congratulatory. He talks about how proud he is that we're so close (we aren't, none of his kids - he has several from other relationships excluding my siblings- and none of them willing spend time/talk to him) and how much he loves the family and how proud he is to be loved by us. And honestly, it makes even madder than the original swearing and slamming because he completely absolves himself of blame (we're also never allowed to mention the incident or we start at step 1 all over again). So he gets to play happy family while never actually doing anything to be a better person (obviously I have faults as well - and may be at fault here - but I try to improve myself when there is a problem).

So I finally told him that his apologies are meaningless and until he changes his behaviour I have no interest in hearing what he has to say. My brother and sister (full siblings not the half-siblings) kind of hate him too because of the way he speaks to them but after I said that to him they said that I was out of line. I've never heard either of them take his side/defend him so I think I might have messed up and behaved badly. So, I'd like some impartial judgments to check myself and possibly do some improvements.

1157,Not the A-hole,"So some backstory, this woman is a foster sister to an ex I had in highschool. We never really interacted back then, so never had any kind of friendship that stuck through the years.

Fast forward to last April, she messages me out of the blue asking to catch up over dinner and we sort of hit it off. We started hanging out more often and eventually developed a romantic relationship, although never making it official. 

At some point she had brought up that she's been driving her car extremely illegally over the past year and as she got a few really big tickets,insurance was too expensive for her. I felt bad, and I really liked her and didn't want to her to get in more trouble as she's a single mother with two kids, so I offered to look into seeing what it would cost to add her and her car on my policy to give her the state minimum insurance requirements which ended up being a little more than $100/month. She agreed to pay me the difference when she could, but I've yet to see a single penny after almost 6 months.

About last month I was tired of the ambiguity of our relationship as she had set many boundaries that made me feel like our romantic side of things were to be kept a secret from her family and friends, and I asked her to make the decision to decide that we were in a romantic relationship, or we were just friends. She had her reasons for not wanting to be in a relationship and asked if we could just be FWB instead. I begrudgingly agreed, as I felt the ""benefits"" part of the friendship were heavily in her favor.

What I mean by that is, I spent a lot of money and effort doing things that made her happy.Now I know what you're probably thinking, all I care about is sex. And you'd be wrong. All I really asked for was her to show me affection. I respected her boundaries about not around her friends and family. Sex would've been nice, but I get that I'm not entitled to it.

So after a month of trying to be okay with everything, I gave up. The whole situation gave me extreme anxiety and was really chipping away at my self confidence, and I couldn't justify staying just because of how I felt about her. So I told her I was done. We argued but she essentially told me she wasn't going to make me stay and I'm just going to do what I want anyways. Her last message of that was her asking ""So I guess this means you're not helping me anymore, huh?"". I said no.

We've talked only a few times since, and this morning she messaged to ask if I kept her on my insurance after a large tree branch fell on her car saying ""I figured you didn't, but I thought I'd ask"" to which I replied that I didn't. She then accused me of doing it to hurt her, and made a point to remind me of the legal troubles she'll face if she gets caught driving without it, and how much she's going to have to pay. I apologized, saying it wasn't my intention to hurt her.

So, am I the Asshole?",65,63,0.77
1158,Asshole,"For backstory, my sister (Jane) stopped eating meat when she was about 4. Later, she cut out dairy and eggs. She’s been fully plant-based since she was 11, and she’s 18 now. 

When she was younger, my parents humored her, mostly because you can’t not feed a kid, and she went almost two days without eating the one time Mom tried to out-stubborn her. When she got a job at 16, they gave her the same rule they gave me: you’re welcome to eat whatever they cook, but if you want something else, you have to buy it yourself. 

Jane took it a step further. For her birthday, she asked for a mini fridge, a hot plate/toaster, and a hot water boiler. She said that she didn’t expect there would actually be room or time for her to cook at meals, and that way nobody would argue what who bought. She also said that it would be nice to practice cooking that way before she goes to college. Anyway, they went with it. 

Except, after a few months of practice, it started smelling **really** good. So, my parents made a deal with my sister. If they eat what she cooks, they pay her for their portion. I (19f) agreed to do the same. 

The thing is that most nights, my parents don’t cook now. They pay my sister the $5-10 and move on. Some mornings, Dad even buys a breakfast bar off of her. 

My problem is that, well, it’s starting to get to where I either have to cook for myself or pay her to do it. And if I want seconds, she expects double the money because “I was going to have the leftovers for lunch, so, yes, it does matter.” 

Also, I’m not vegan. And she refuses to cook meat or include butter or cheese or eggs or anything. Her excuse is that “I’m literally cooking for me. If you want to eat a hamburger, I’m sure there’s plenty in the fridge.” But, I mesh, at this point, she **is** cooking for us. Hell, Mom and Dad even said that they would buy the groceries for us all if she would make dinner for us all but she won’t. “I’m not giving up the ability to make sure I can eat what I want just for your convenience.” 

I just feel like I’m stuck between a rock and hard place here, and I don’t know what to do.",84,97,0.81
1159,Not the A-hole,"I have been getting by financially so far. So has my partner, until about a year ago. He lost his income and was left with about 7% of what he had previously made in a month.

Before he lost his income I had managed to save up what would amount to about 4 months salary to keep as a safety net. He had nothing saved. During the last year however, I have had to spend that money to keep us afloat. He would chip in when he could, but it would only go so far. In the process I have had to reevaluate my spending habits and prioritize better. This I am actually quite grateful for. I needed it, and I appreciate the things I buy a whole lot more now. 

He got a job a couple of months back, and is doing ok again. A bit better than before, even. On average we make about the same now. My job is very seasonally based, and I work less this time of year. With all of my reserves dried out I am getting a bit stressed out atm. (Christmas is coming...)

During the previous year I have had to forgo a lot of shopping. That's totally fine! But also things that are kind of necessities, although not detrimental. At work I am on my feet all day, and I need proper footwear. With the style and quality I need and like, I'd say a new pair cost 10-15% of a months pay. 

Now that he is financially back on his feet, I asked if he could pay for a new pair of sneakers for me, since I have been wearing worn out ones with no support or cushioning left in them for about 6 months. He was ok with that. So I found some super cute ones.

I have been going on about them and how exited I am for a few days now. And he is trying to make it out like it's a ""gift"" from him. I just can't help it, this is pissing me off. I haven't said much about it until today. I said to him that I have had to endure pain in my feet, calfs and hips for 6 months now. All during summer, when I work all the damn time, bc I could not afford to spend money on proper work wear. Imo that's not what a gift is. I honestly think he fucking owes me this, and should not try to capitalize on ""good guy points"" from it. He says it is a gift and that we are even now since we recently started contributing equally again. And if that is my attitude, he won't be bothered to give me anything ever again. 

I don't expect him to pay me back what I have put out. I agree with him that that is what partners should do. If I bring up the fact that I don't have a safety net any more and that worries me, he gets really defensive and accuses me of trying to make him feel bad/guilty. There is no acknowledgement of the fact that I made a lot of sacrifices the past year, or any will to contribute to make me feel a bit more financially secure again.

1161,Not the A-hole,"Last school year my Fmil decided to donate Internet access and chromebooks to a school. It's in the same county as my daughters school but not the same district. I guess the school staff figured out who my Fmil is because when she picked my 7 year old daughter up from school last week they dragged her around on a ""tour"" that consisted of things they wanted her to spend her money on. 

I'll throw in they figured out who she is because she had a photo with the states secretary of education, and the school she made the donation to named the school library after her. The school is about a 25 minute drive from my daughter's school so one of the administrators probably saw her name on the building. Somehow they definitely knew who she was because they thanked her for being so willing to give to the schools. 

I live in a school district that recently had a seven figure sum just go missing. I don't want her to spend another 50 or 75k rewarding that bad behavior and money management. The district has been caught over paying for no bid Contracts to friends and family of school district employees. Why should my Fmil spend money when they had plenty that they lost and choose to over pay because of corruption. My daughters school recently gave many teachers pink slips in June only to rehire them in August to prevent the teachers from getting tenure as that saves the school money in benefits, including my friend and my daughters favorite teacher. 

My boyfriend is on board with me shutting his mother down. I don't think it's right. They lost over 1 million dollars. That's enough for 5 chromebooks for every kid in the district.

1162,Asshole,"I ordered a cheeseburger for delivery the other night and specified ""no sauce, no pickles,"" but when I got my burger it had both sauce and pickles. When I called the restaurant, the owner told me my complaint isn't fair because he didn't get any special instructions through the app I ordered from. He even sent a screenshot verifying that my ""no sauce, no pickles"" request wasn't in the order. Okay, fair. But I'm still sitting here at night with a burger that has sauce and pickles, which I specifically said I didn't want. By now, the restaurant is actually closed, because I placed my order 15 minutes before closing and the delivery obviously took some time. The owner tells me he'll make a new burger with no sauce and no pickles and have it delivered in about 20 minutes. Great, right?

Well he ends up calling me a little later to say that since they're closed, they've already cleaned and shut down the kitchen and closed up shop. He literally tells me ""we're not doing this"" and hangs up. It's 11PM at this point, but I'm still sitting here with a burger that has pickles and sauce, which I can't eat because I've had my gallbladder removed and it would give me stomach pain. I had to just eat the fries and drink the Fanta that also came with it.

So I call him back and say that I know software messes up sometimes (I work in software), but it isn't fair because I ordered my burger ""no sauce, no pickles"" and I want what I ordered. He says it isn't fair that he has to re-open his restaurant and open the kitchen again and make my burger and then clean the kitchen and close again. He ends up offering me two burgers, free of charge, that he can deliver to me tomorrow. Okay, I guess? I mean, I still have to arrange dinner at 11PM now because I am stuck with this burger that has pickles and sauce, which I had to throw away.

I ended up taking his deal. So I called him the next day asking when I can get my two free burgers. He sent a pic of them grilling the burgers. I finally got my cheeseburger (no sauce and no pickles!) plus fries and Fanta and it was pretty good. I only eat burgers once a month due to my missing gallbladder so I don't think my request was something anyone had to make a big fuss about.

1163,Not the A-hole,"Just for some context, I'm a 19M at home for reading week, my friends in this situation are also 19.

So my friends and I were driving around town late at night (Me as the driver) just chilling and catching up, as we all went to different universities.

One of them brought a girl along without even letting me know, I was not really ok with it, but it was whatever.

She was so obnoxious, talking about weed 99% of the time, like we would be talking about something random and she would find a way to bring weed into the convo.

She asked us if we wanted to go walk around this park, we all were bored so we said sure.

The whole time she wasn't really saying anything, and she was constantly looking around, when finally she said ""AHA, Found it!""

She said she had  2 ounces of weed in like a mini back-pack, ""sorry, I needed to pick this up for a friend""

2 ounces is more than the legal amount to carry in public, so I said ""No, I dont want weed in my car, you gotta put that shit back, besides, it's not legal to carry that much around outside.""

She said she needed to hide it again, and so we walked off and she caught up.

We decided to go to this cool abandoned house maybe 10 mins away from our neighbour hood when I smelt some weed, she literally opened a ziplock bag and was going thru it.

I stopped the car and told her toss it or get out.

Her reason for bringing it in my car was that ""this is only an ounce, its legal!""

I said ""I don't care, toss it or get out""

She told me she wasn't tossing it, so I told her to get out.

She pouted and stood outside.

I gave her one more chance and she rolled her eyes, I asked if she had someone to call, she turned her back and pulled out her phone and I drove off.

My friends said that it was a dick move that I pulled to kick her out the car like that, but I explicitly said I don't want weed in my car, I don't care if its legal or not, like, I don't want that shit in my car. AITA?

EDIT-

To those saying that it's not right to drop off a girl in the middle of nowhere, I was fully ready to wait until she got a ride, but she wasn't responding to anything I was saying, so I left

Also, some people are saying that she dropped it down to the legal amount ""per my request"".... No, my request was to not have weed in my car, I just told her that 30g is not allowed to be carried around regardless.

I have no problem w/ weed, I love doing it recreationally, but my friends and I always have had a rule where we don't fuck w/ it if one of us is driving, we don't want anyone intoxicated, or carrying it around in the car while one person is driving.

She left me the 21st of September, and for a while after that we still called every day and talked about how much we loved each other. Up until the 8th she was talking about how much she loved me. Up until the 11th she was saving my messages about our plans to see and talk to one another and our future.

After that she started talking about how she wanted to do her own thing. Then some shit went down and I was visiting my grandmother and didnt have great service for a few days. During this few days, she fucked another guy.
I didnt know this at the time, all I knew was that she was sleeping over at her friends house (she wouldnt fuck him, hes not her thing yk) but she was drinking and lying about where she was (snapmap) and I got sus when she turned ghost mode on.

My sister has two children, an 8 year old boy and a 2 year old girl. Both kids are the result of a relationship with a guy I told her was trouble from the beginning. They split up a year back and haven't been in each others lives since. No one's sure where the Father is now and as predicted he's abandoned them entirely.

Last month, my sister was arrested. I was the one she called, and she asked me to look after her kids while she was in jail. I said I wouldn't be able to as I couldn't take the time off work to look after them. She begged me to help out and said that she didn't want her kids taken into foster care. I said I'd visit them if that was an option to keep the family connection, but I don't want children and I don't know how to look after them. I don't really have the resources and they'd have had to share a room in my home. 

Now, my sister is out of jail. The charges were dropped as there was a miscommunication. She's in the process of getting her kids back but says they're incredibly traumatised by their separation from familiar people and surroundings. She says she's also struggling to prove she has a stable income to look after them as her job let her go when she wasn't able to show up due to being in jail.

She said that in this situation, if I'd offered to take the kids then they wouldn't be traumatised by their time in foster care and she wouldn't be jumping through hoops to get child services to leave them alone again. From what I hear, they ended up with a nice family in a good area. I think that family were better equipped to look after the kids than I was and isn't it better for kids to be in a home where they're actually wanted? 

I like my niece and nephew a lot but I don't think I would've been any good at looking after them for a long time. I didn't know it would be only a few weeks. It could've been indefinitely for all I knew and I didn't want to adjust my lifestyle for kids that aren't mine.

That sounds really awk but I'll rephrase. I'm a high school junior who took the SAT for the second time in October. I took it once in March of my sophomore year (1380) and then in October of my junior year (1500). I'm Indian and go to a top 10 high school in the US, so it's v cutthroat. My parents were okay with me taking it October because the March one was a no-study no-prep type thing.

I told them my score today and they told me I'm not gonna get into college and that they won't register me for another SAT. (the reason they say I won't get into college is because my GPA and transcript are really bad, 3.786 W, 3.46 UW, and I have a C in a semester math course and a C+ in APCS, so pretty bad for my school)

For my birthday they gave me a lot of money, and I mean *a lot of money.* So I want to use that money to register for another SAT. I know I can prepare adequately (I had -5R, -3W, and -1M so...)

I feel like trash for lying to my parents and my sister said I was TA because it was their money that I'm using without they're knowledge, but they gave it to me for my birthday so?

I’m not talking some photo where you can vaguely make out the private regions. This was a photo of the baby laying on the changing table on her back, legs spread in the air, full vulva on display. I have no idea who in their right mind would think it’s okay to post a photo of their infant daughter like that on the internet, so I reported the photo as inappropriate.

Afterwards, I was telling some of my friends about it and they all seemed to think that I’M the one being ridiculous. They said it’s just a baby, and that I’m being weird for “sexualizing” a baby.

Obviously I know that any normal human being does not look at naked baby photos in a sexual way. But I explained posting a photo like that is still a stupid thing to do because (1) you never know who is on the internet looking at these pictures, and (2) this baby is still a human being with their own right to privacy.

I have learned from airport security not to enter the metal detector until your bin is in the x-ray machine to keep it under my control and to prevent pilfering. I sent the young ladies through the metal detector, and I waited with the bin. The security guard motioned for me to step through, and I told her that I was waiting for my bin to enter the machine. She became agitated and told me to ""just step through the metal detector - your stuff would be fine."" The belt wasn't moving, so neither was I, saying I would step through when my stuff moved into the machine. Once my bin entered the machine, I stepped through the metal detector, and she began to lecture me saying, among other things, ""we're just like the guards at the courthouse."" I told her that I follow the same procedure at the courthouse without incident and that the security there is managed by deputy sheriffs, not private security, so not the same. I won't apologize for protecting my group's valuables.

1195,Not the A-hole,"Hi all,

As a bit of back story, I had a very rare form of cancer - penile cancer - last year and I had to have a radical penectomy (complete removal of my penis). I was a mess for a while, and I lost my previous relationship with my ex too but I've slowly rebuilt my life. I owe a large part of my recovery to my therapist and one of the things he's been helping me to work on is building my social life back up and reconnecting with friends. I had the opportunity to do just this by going out for drinks with some old workmates. Me and my gf went because we both worked there and she was invited too. 

We were getting quite drunk and one of the guys I knew there was asking me about how I was doing in my recovery (my situation went quite public so a lot of people know) and the subject got onto sex. Now the guy in question is openly gay and is known for having a really ""offensive"" sense of humour which I don't normally mind. 

When I started to tell him what I do to constitute a normal sex life, he basically said I should become a ""bottom"" now because of my limitations and said he'd gladly introduce me to a lot of his ""top"" friends if I ever split up with my gf. And he said he'd give me great tips on how to enjoy my ass being fucked. 

I really got angry at this and went off on him, and everyone noticed and tried to calm me down. I'd say it definitely caused a scene. I stormed off and went home, my gf came with me. 

When I woke up in the morning, she said she was really embarrassed and said I should have handled it far better - basically, she said she thought I was a lot tougher than that and said I should apologise to him as it was only banter and what he normally does. She also said basically I'd ruined everyone's night out and need to apologise to everyone we went out with. I'd say it's been our first proper argument/disagreement since we've been going out. 

This is where I'm stuck. I initially didn't think I did anything wrong, and thought he was the asshole here but her comments have made me wonder.

1197,Not the A-hole,"We have always had a strained relationship and my sister only added to it. A few years ago, I was living at home. Just me and my mother. I worked and paid rent and other bills. My mother didn't pay for my college or get me a car like she did with my other siblings and that caused resentment on my end (which is ironic considering I am the only person to have graduated from college and to have a job). My mother was a very difficult person to live with and I'd always planned on moving out once I got a job that could support myself. My sister found herself in a bad spot. She is a single mom, no job, high school dropout and burned out on drugs and batshit crazy. She wanted to move back in because she knew my mom would pay her bills and my sister wouldn't have to get a job. They have a very sick, toxic co-dependent relationship.

&#x200B;

A few years ago, I left for a few days and told my mom I would be back. When I came back home, all my shit was put in a different room and my sister had moved into my room. My mother said that she thought I had moved out (yes, I know it sounds crazy, but my mother is crazy). I was about to start a new high-paying job (she didn't know about it) and knew I could not live under the same roof as my mother, sister and her kids and go to work focused. I quickly moved out. My mother knows I make very good money because my tax papers were sent to her house and she opened it. 

&#x200B;

Basically, after all my bills are paid off, I easily have about $2,500.00 left over every month. I have close to $50,000 in savings. I would never give my mother money because I know it will go to my sister and it would probably go to drugs or tattoos or weed or cigarettes. I've bought groceries just so that my nephews had food. I have to put limits because my mother and sister WILL become dependent on anyone who helps them.

Last week my mother told me she had to have two front teeth removed and couldn't afford the crown work. I could easily pay the bill and it would be no sweat off my back financially. But I am still angry how she backdoored me out of the house and give me a fraction of what she's given my other siblings (all of whom are fuck ups). She really doesn't care what that put me through and how it affected me to this day. I had to walk around for a few years with a missing molar because I had no dental insurance after my mother took me off her insurance plan (which I only found out when I went to the dentist) back when my mom worked and I was in college. Hell, she even bought my brother Invisalign when I was missing a tooth. My teeth just got fixed a few years ago since I could afford.

I feel bad this old woman is walking around with missing front teeth, but she didn't help me when I needed it. The only time she's ever offered me help is when she knew I would decline it.

However, my country normally has xenophobic tendencies and my girlfriend looks noticeably foreign.

Friday morning, I headed out early morning to run some errands and saw the scope of the protests. Even driving through the city center at the crack of dawn seeing the extent of the damage (the government had just temporarily cleared the square at 4am). Normally, protests have been historically restricted to the capital but these have been nationwide. After I got home, she was heading up to a friends place close to my area and I went to sleep planning to meet up later since I had barely slept, keeping up with the protests and walking up at the crack of dawn.

Now I had made plans to head down to the protests on Friday, but i wanted to avoid the city center for a bunch of reasons. One is the downtown area is the one the government focuses on the most, with intense riot police, water cannons and tear gas. Two, they had already cleared it with force the night before. Three, since it's considered the main protest, violence is most likely to break out.

When I woke up in the afternoon, she somehow left her friends place and headed down to the protest in downtown. After two hours, reports were getting in that it was getting violent. I called her and her friends multiple times begging them to go to different safer protest but they were insistent on staying and then ignored my calls only sending me sporadic message updates. At that point, I had coordinated with a few friends to head to that protest and try to pick her up. But since all of the roads had protests on them, the trip to my friends place took over an hour and a half (normally a 20 minute trip).

I had frantically tried warning them to leave before the prime minsters speech since that might push the crowd over the edge, but it fell on deaf ears and by the time I reached my friends place the riot police had already started to clear the city center with tear gas. There were multiple reports of casualties starting to come in and viral videos of police brutality. At that point she said she was leaving and sent me a live location on whatsapp. After coordinating for around 30 minutes with her still being cagey, we were able to find a place to pick her up.

I (18f) have been super interested in cars since I was a kid, and decided when I was 15 to start saving for a drivers licence. So all birthday money, money I got for helping people move or mowing lawns, and later the money from when I started working went in a bag in my room (and when I started working I moved it all to a bank account). In those years I never bought anything for myself, because i was more interested in learning to drive than buying new clothes or going to the movies with friends. 

I turned 18 a few weeks ago. I went online to transfer some money from my main bank account to my 'licence' account, but it was empty. Completely empty. I talked to my dad and he confessed he needed the money, because if he didn't pay (he didn't tell me exactly what) we would lose our house. He felt completely justified, though he was a bit apologetic. He made it clear this was more important than a licence, and that he had no intention of paying me back. 

I felt gutted. I still do. Three years of savings gone, and I was so close to getting a licence too. I packed my school stuff and some clothes and went to my grandparents, I've avoided his calls and refused to see him since. 

I've spoken to some friends and family members, some of them agree that it was an awful thing for him to do. But some of them think I'm a brat, since I'm 18 now it was expected of me to help my family financially, and that refusing to talk to my dad is too far. 

I just feel sad, and a bit betrayed. He didn't talk to me, he just took it. Of course I don't want to lose our house either but he could have at least asked. I don't want to talk to him anytime soon. 

AITA here?

1209,Asshole,"Several months ago I lent ""John"" some music equipment so we could make some covers just for fun. This includes recording equipment, an electric guitar and an amp. He was living with his parents at the time of the accident and had all of my gear in his room. I would often come over and we would jam and have fun, and I got on well with his parents too. His parents were aware that he didn't own the equipment as he didn't have a job (he was just out of highschool), so they must have known that I was the actual owner.

About a fortnight ago he went out on his motorbike to see his gf. Her house is also in the same suburb as us, but has roundabouts everywhere with concrete curbs in the middle. I've seen the marks across it, but evidently he hit this curb, lost control and fell off the bike. 

I got called by his brother the next day, saying that John had passed away in hospital overnight after being injured in an accident. Obviously I was crushed, we weren't best friends but this is the first time someone in a social circle of mine has died. We talked for a little bit, and then there was an awkward silence which I didn't know how to deal with. I brought up the music gear and basically asked for it back. His brother got angry, started shouting and swearing and then hung up. 

Later his parents called mine and mine came and confronted me about it. It turned into an unnecessary argument because they thought that I was completely apathetic to his death. Apparently John's brother had spun the story that I didn't consider him a friend and that's why I wanted the equipment back immediately. He told this story to his parents and they told it to my parents. I couldn't even contest the claim because my parents don't care about context or that I didn't mean anything bad by it.

I didn't go to his funeral. When other friends asked, John's brother told them his story, which pissed me off so badly. Now my family and friends are calling me an asshole, and my explanation doesn't make sense to them because they can't (or refuse to) empathise with someone who is simply bad at dealing with social cues. What pisses me off even more is the family shutting down any chance for reconciliation by going dark. What do they expect me to do about it?

On top of dealing with the loss of John I have to deal with all of these people burning bridges. I might actually be fucked. Did I bring this upon myself?",742,3243,0.94

1211,Not the A-hole,"So the situation begins with my mother having recently developed a liking of highball cocktails. So when she found out that a fried chicken place that she frequently visits also did highballs, she decided to take me and my little brother there for dinner, and also invite her sister as well.

The place was moderately filled, and she wanted to be seated at a bigger table because my parents do often order many things (and just take everything not eaten to go). But we were told that we could not be seated there because it is a Friday and the place would be expecting larger groups than us. She would continue to make a fuss and show about this with the staff even after being seated, enough to draw eyes from other people in the restaurant, and we, at my mother's command, walked out.

But she really wanted that highball and that fried chicken, so she decided for us to go back. I told her that I would just go home and skip dinner if she was going back because it would just be embarrassing to eat there after she made that show about some seating arrangement and walked out. And so she gave me a look that can basically be described as ""stop being an asshole and let's eat some food"" with a reply of ""Seriously?"". And I ignored her, and I walked back, and now I've just typed up this post.

So was I the asshole in this situation? In my opinion, if she really cared about her chicken and highballs, she really wouldn't have cared about the seating arrangement. Because she was going to get that stuff anyways, regardless of where we are seated in the restaurant.

Note: I asked a friend about this situation as well, and he asked me ""Well, why couldn't you just find another fried chicken place that also does highballs?"". It wouldn't have worked out because we walked there. Hell, she went there carrying dumbbells, so she could exercise after eating.",29,38,0.87

We had a wedding rehearsal today, and afterwards we went to a restaurant to eat some supper, well my son (M1) got done eating and got restless so I got him out of his high chair and started letting him walk around the area our party was at. 

Well he wanted to explore as most young kids do, so I let him walk around the restaurant.. with me following him. Many of the customers did not like that.

 I made sure he wasn't in the way of anyone and didn't get into anything he wasn't supposed too. But I still got some nasty looks and a few comments like ""watch your kid or why are you letting him do that""

Some people loved it and commented on how cute he was and what not. 

But, some people of the party are saying it's a dick thing to do and I should have just kept ahold of him or went outside. (it's chilly where I live this time of year and uhh death by a car is not a way I would want anyone to go) Instead of letting him run ""wild.""

So am I the asshole for letting my son walk around the restaurant?

1219,Not the A-hole,"When my son was born, I joined a mother's group and I'm still close friends with two other moms. Our boys have grown up together, but from the very start, their kids raced through all the typical baby milestones while my son took his sweet time. With everything from rolling and sitting to walking and talking, their boys had mastered it often months before my little guy was even trying. It was sometimes hard to hear about their smart kids and not worry about my own son's development, but I celebrated their sons' achievements along with them.

However, now that they're all a little older, all three boys are on par in terms of development and you wouldn't know that my son took much longer to learn how to do things. The big difference now is that my son is, for the most part, a very easy-going little kid, and their boys are...energetic, to put it nicely. So now I listen to their complaints about how hard it is to do the simplest things, such as going shopping or getting ready in the morning. Meanwhile, I can easily do all these things and more with my son. My husband and I have even taken international trips with him a few times now since he's so adaptable and easy-going. He's honestly just a joy.

Anyway, to get to the point: after recounting a particularly challenging shopping trip with her son, my friend asked why I never complained about how my son behaves at the shop. I told her (and our other friend who was also there) that frankly I had nothing to complain about, he enjoyed accompanying me on errands, and is generally just a compliant and happy kid. I said how he loved to ride in the shopping cart or help me get items from the shelf. I probably was gushing a bit. My friend snapped at me 'aren't you lucky' and our other friend said 'geez, no need to brag' and rolled her eyes at me. I'm not great at confrontation so I changed the subject but they were both cold to me and left shortly afterwards. We usually text and chat often but my texts have been unanswered and I'm definitely getting the cold shoulder from them both.

When I applied to my current job, I was dumb and desperate and I didn't research the company. When I was hired, management was nice and it seemed like I would have a positive experience. However, my first paycheck was $1 less per hour than what I was told when I was hired. I was very upset, but I shrugged it off because they said I misunderstood.   


During my first week, my co-workers said there was a high turn over rate and they didn't like management. They seemed nice to me, and I'm not picky in the slightest, so I shrugged this off too.  


Soon I realized management turned sour. They acted positive, but would be sarcastic and make comments to make me feel inadequate at my job. When I had a family emergency, I asked to leave an hour early (I did all my responsibilities for the day and it was slow) but they shamed me for it the next day and asked for proof. I complied.   


Fast forward to this week, I started having panic attacks because management yelled at me and questioned my character  (she had a bad day). She kept saying bible quotes like ""you reap what you sow"" when I asked about benefits that were promised in the handbook (but not given). She also said that she will pay us if we post positive reviews on indeed, google and glassdoor because the company has 2> stars on all of these sites.

I am (loosely) apart of a friend group of about 13 people. I say loosely because I haven't been very present lately because of work and family. 

Basically, we occasionally hang out with a friend that we'll call Hector. Hector is sweet but flawed, like the rest of us. He wears his heart on his sleeve when it comes to friendships. All he wants to do is make us happy and us to feel important when we're down. 

We have a group chat without Hector. And in that group chat everyone talks constant shit about him the moment his name is mentioned. It's always, ""He's so annoying. IDK why he doesn't get the hint. OMG someone let it slip that we're hanging out and now he's coming. He's such a try hard. I hate him so much. Im just using him for lunch/dinner."" And tons more shit like that. No one would tell him this stuff to his face. 

Personally, I don't mind Hector. He's very nice, a bit awkward but not gross awkward. I just don't have the time to hang out with him like I used to. He does message me sometimes to check on me, send memes or other cool shit.

1225,Not the A-hole,"My aunt (Claire), uncle (John), and their 2yr daughter (Pikachu) are visiting tonight. Before anyone wonders, my aunt and uncle are pretty cool and hip people. I'm 25F. I live with my parents, rent-free, and will be until I enter my masters program in about a year. 

I was informed two months in advance that they would be coming. Nobody said anything about giving up my room. We knew they were coming for months, and I was told that they would sleep on the blow-up mattress in the office.

1. I am deaf and have a vibrating alarm clock. It's a pain to unplug and extricate from my bed, and it doesn't work very well on a blow up mattress.

2. I have an expensive computer in my room and I'm worried that something might happen to it. It is a VERY tiny room, about 10ft by 11ft, and cramped with furniture.

3. When someone can just unilaterally kick me out of my room with no notice, it gives me a lot of anxiety and frankly, anger.

In the past, I've asked my mother to give me at least a couple days' warning if I'm going to be expected to give up my room. I don't like feeling like I can be kicked out of my bed at any time, and it makes me angry that she had months to tell me that she wanted me to give my bed up, and she didn't.

In fact, it didn't even occur to her that this was something she wanted to do until *three hours before my uncle's family was due to show up.*

First, my mother asked me if I would be willing. I guess she saw by the look on my face that this was something I didn't want to do, because she elaborated that she thought Pikachu would be ""anxious"" being away from home, and the office doesn't feel very ""homey"". There's no stuffed animals, etc. in there. There aren't stuffed animals in my room either, but I don't think that was her point. She thinks Pikachu will be happier in my room.

Let me make it clear: No matter what room Pikachu sleeps in, Claire will be sleeping in that room with her. John is taking the couch because it's the only place he'll fit.

I hesitated. My mom saw the hesitation and asked, ""Are you *kidding* me?"" And I explained that I wish I'd been given a few days' warning, and she responded, ""Well, that's life.""

I said, ""So this isn't you asking me if I'll do this, this is you voluntelling me to do this.""

I negotiated that when Claire gets here, I'd ask her if she wants my room. I said, ""Mom thinks it would make Pikachu more comfortable to sleep in my room. I know she'll be more comfortable with her mom, so if you think it'll help, you can have my room tonight."" My mom said OK.

Claire said, “It doesn’t matter, I’m fine with either.” My mom proceeded to herd her to my room. If I was upset before, that just made me angry. 

My mom made me feel like an asshole for even hesitating to give up the room (""Are you kidding me??"").",149,320,0.94
1226,No A-holes here,"My girlfriend and I were dining at a local fast casual restaurant tonight when another diner came in to order. As soon as she walked in, we noticed that she had a very overwhelming odor, even when she was 10+ feet away from us. We’re not sure if she was homeless, or simply didn’t have access or ability to shower, but it was enough that it made us pretty quickly lose our appetite due to how distracting it was.

We thought we were in the clear after she ordered, but she just so happened to sit at the table directly adjacent to us. We debated what to do, and decided that we couldn’t finish our food there - we were either going to wait a few minutes and grab to go boxes, or move tables.

Luckily for us, the woman went inside to grab some napkins, so we seized the opportunity to move somewhere else (this restaurant is next to a food court so we knew we could move out of sight).

However, as we were hurrying to leave while she was inside, she exited the restaurant and made eye contact with us, making us feel like complete assholes.

My 16 year old son came to me panicked and said his 16 year old boyfriend just told him he (the boyfriend) was HIV positive. I told him to stay calm and no matter what everything was going to be fine (inside I was more panicked than he was) we immediately drove and got him (my son)  tested. He’s negative (my son is negative, but his boyfriend is positive.)

My son says  boyfriend didn’t lie or neglect to tell him, he only just found out himself. I have no reason not to believe him. 

But I still said he had to break up with the kid. I insisted on it. My son said they’d be extra cautious and he could take PrEP and it would be fine but I told him the truth, that it was too serious a disease for him to even slightly risk contracting at his age. 

I know most people won’t believe me but this has nothing to do with my son being gay. 

He’s had two serious boyfriends in the past and a handful of dates, I’ve never had a problem. They’d come by the house, it was fine.  And this guy I had him break up with was a good guy. 

I just know my son’s maturity level and don’t trust him to take all the proper precautions to keep himself safe. If he were 30 and called and said “my boyfriend just said he’s HIV positive but I don’t want to break up with him” I’d be by his side going to get a PrEP prescription and reading all the articles and encouraging him to be safe because it would be his responsibility as an adult to make these decisions for himself. 

Right now though, I still have to nag him to wear a seat belt when he drives. I don’t feel like I’d be doing my job as a parent if he kept seeing an HIV positive person until he can protect himself. 

But my son, of course, does not agree. He says I’m being discriminatory against HIV positive people, and I just got off the phone with my brother, and he said the same thing. That I’m taking this too seriously and I was wrong to make them break up. 

That even if that’s what I wanted it should’ve been a decision my son and I came to together after more discussion.

And I go into the kitchen and I ask my daughter, ""what's the most important thing?"" She says ""the gift bags.""

I'm a full time student so there is only a small window of time where we can go anywhere together. It was originally planned for mid December,  but my boyfriend's friend reached out to him and told him that she was going to the same island a week earlier than we were planning. There was a miscommunication,  and I was lead to believe that things were still going forward as planned because he called me and said he bought the tickets. He was really excited because he got first class. Turns out, he bought tickets to go with his friend for early December. Now I can't go because I have final exams that week. I was informed of this because his friend messaged me and asked if I was ok with the two of them going (there is nothing romantic about it, so I said I was ok with it). When he got home, he told me that we can just go during my spring break instead since I'm not able to go earlier. Now, I fully understand that he is allowed to go on vacation any time and anywhere he wants, but the whole idea of going to Hawaii again for my spring break sounded like less of a trip and more of an apology. I told him I wasn't really excited about going now, and maybe if he really wanted to go somewhere spring break we could go somewhere he didn't just get back from. He told me I was being weird, and he won't do all the touristy stuff so that we can do that in the spring together. AITA for not being excited to go anymore, or should I be grateful because he is willing to pay for a spring vacation?

TLDR: My boyfriend and I were planning on going to Hawaii for winter break, but he decided to go with his friend a week earlier instead. Now he wants us to go spring break but I'm no longer excited to go because it feels like a 'making it up to me' kind of thing.",56,64,0.92

1235,Not the A-hole,"I was recently in the process of moving out of state, so my sister came over for a visit before I left. 

Some backstory: she is the type of person that feels that if somebody isn't doing something the way she would or doesn't agree with her, then they are wrong. Always. 
Example: I file fold my laundry when I put it away and she will tell me how I'm doing it all wrong and proceeds to tell me how to do it right ""in order to save space"". She also always follows her advice up with ""I'm not trying to be rude or anything. I'm just trying to help"". 

So, as I was packing things up, I already knew a lot of the things wouldn't fit in the car and would have to be mailed up to the new place. 
She starts to put her 2 cents in and tells me ""I don't know how you're gonna fit everything in that small car you have. You should really just get more boxes and ship most of your stuff."" (We don't have a lot of money in order to do this and are only taking what we really need/want and have already packed a huge box full.)

I tell her that we've already planned everything out. She keeps pressing the matter. I let it go. 

Eventually, I get to talking about when we get up there and after we have more money when my husband starts his new job, we're going to be ordering some baby furniture (we have a bassinet for her to sleep in and a swing/bouncer, so she isn't without a place to sleep) for our daughter from Rent A Center.

Cue my sister.

S: You know, you're gonna wind up paying more money for that stuff, right? 

Me: Yeah, we know. We just can't get everything outright, but she needs to have a crib soon as well as a highchair and a few other things.

S: But it's all name brand stuff. You don't need that! Just go look in discount stores or secondhand shops! I'm not trying to be rude or anything. I just want to save you money.

At this point I've had it because she had been doing this type of thing for weeks off and on and all day that day. So this is how I replied:

Me: Alright, well I'm really done with your advice. You say you're not being rude and trying to help, but you are forcing your personal opinions on me and its pissing me off. So, I'm just gonna ignore any other ""advice"" you have for me. So, just leave me alone, let me pack, worry about my own things, and keep your mouth shut.

She got pissed off and went to sit outside for a while. It was nice and quiet when she did this.

People are on diets and want to save money and stuff. The thing that bothers me is when she invites just me or me and one other person out, and then she doesn't eat. She even picks the restaurant sometimes! She also doesn't tell us that she won't be eating until we're already at the table. I think I get annoyed mostly because I would have rather gone to a coffee shop or a bar or something than an overpriced family-dining chain. I don't want someone to just watch me eat. 

&#x200B;

She also never wants to do anything free (hang out at the mall, go to a park, library, walk around downtown, etc.) and so, when we eat out, I feel like  I'm footing the bill for the space that we ""rent"" by paying for food that I didn't really want at a restaurant. 

If I'm ever in the situation where I'm not hungry and at a restaurant I usually still order something cheap, eat a little, and just put most of it in a to-go box for dinner the next day. I don't understand why she doesn't do the same. (I am 90% sure that money isn't the problem. She usually just eats with parents at home and isn't hungry when we go out.) 

It makes me want to cancel plans more and I just feel bitter now. Is this unreasonable? Am I just being really bitchy?",41,90,0.95

1240,Asshole,"My husband and I recently received a wedding invitation in the mail. I had no idea who the couple was and he told me it was from his co-worker. I told him I had never heard him mention this co-worker before and he said that they’re work friends. He wants to go so we RSVPed immediately that evening.

The ceremony is an hour away from where we live, and the reception is 30 minutes away from the ceremony site. Also, the reception starts an hour and a half after the ceremony ends (really, it’s an hour after you take into consideration the drive from the ceremony to the reception). Then it’s an hour drive back home from the reception site.

I think we should skip the ceremony and just attend the reception. I know this is in poor taste but we’ve never been to either of the cities the ceremony and reception are hosted in and we probably won’t know anyone else there (maybe aside from a co-worker or two of my husband’s). If we attend the ceremony and most of the reception, we will be dedicating nine hours, including driving time, to this wedding.

Would we be the assholes for skipping the wedding ceremony due to the distance and the gap of time between the ceremony and the reception? Also, to note, we will be leaving for a week long trip out of the country four days after the wedding. To say the least, time is of the essence at the moment.",29,28,0.73
1241,Asshole,"I have 20 direct reports, and I adore each and every one with all my heart. We are friends and a family, over and above being a team. Every year, we have a Christmas party at someone's home. Food, wine, secret Santa, joy. Historically, I have given each of my staff a hand crafted gift (soap, candles, jewellery, etc). Historically, they also go in on a gift for me (wine and glasses, a spa day, etc).

This year, I've had some shit go down. I have separated from my husband, we had a drama-filled home sale, one of our kids has some significant issues at school, and a month before the move I have learned my dad is dying of cancer and has been given an optimistic 6 months.

I'm kinda overwhelmed. Lawyers, insurance brokers, movers, bank accounts, school meetings, mortgage issues, some new challenges at work. It's all overshadowed by the new news of my dad's aggressive untreatable cancer, and how to maximize time with him for me and my kids (and my ex who also adores him and will always be family) but he lives three hours away.

There's no way I can make them something this year, but I also can't afford to buy something remotely meaningful for 20 people. But I know them, and they are going to be ridiculously helpful with my move, will likely give me an overly generous housewarming gift, and will probably double down on a Christmas gift for me because they are hurting for me.

I am thinking that in lieu of making/buying them something, I may make a meaningful donation to the cancer society and give them cards advising them of that. But I get that that may seem lazy and selfish, and I don't want it to come across that way. The only other choice I can imagine is to just do nothing. I honestly don't know which is better.

I needed to go somewhere an hour drive away, and my dad (thankfully) offered to drive me, as he was going somewhere farther and my destination was only 15 minutes out of his way. The day comes, and I sit in the back of the car, and he freaks out, like ""what are you doing?! Do I look like a chauffeur to you??"" Slightly startled I get in the front seat of the car. It had never even crossed my mind that sitting in the back would be treating him like a chauffeur. AITA? Is this a common thing?

1243,Not the A-hole,"I (m 40) have custody of my 15 year old daughter (Jenny) when I divorced her mom 13 years ago. Since then her mom has been wishy-washy at best in being involved in our daughters life. We live 2 hours away from each other. There was a 6 year period that she wasn’t around at all. No visitation, calls, cards, emails,...nothing. Our address and her school, activities never changed.  The last 3 years she has been better than the first 4 years before the disappearance but still not great. Sometimes she no-shows, or is several hours late. Sometimes she’ll randomly show up to get her and I had no idea she was coming. 

I pretty much let Jenny decide when she wants to go to her moms. I only ask that her mom let me know whatever plans she has with Jenny so I’m aware. I never hear from the ex and get a half or wrong story from Jenny even though I repeatedly ask her mom to please just tell me her plans. She still refuses.  

This year after school Jenny gets home with her younger half sister ( Stella) and they stay at my house until Stella’s mom gets off work to pick her up.  They’re home together for an hour and a half max. 

Two weeks ago Jenny’s mom has someone show up, because it’s never her, at 3pm on a Friday to pick her up for the weekend. I wasn’t home yet from work. Jenny calls me and let’s me know what is going on. Jenny had no clue anyone was coming. Stella gets off the bus a half hour later than Jenny. I made a couple quick phone calls and was bailed out by a relative that was available to pick Stella up off the bus. 

I immediately got ahold of Jenny’s mom. 

Me: Hey in the future when you make plans with Jenny I’d like for you to send me a text to let me know what the plans are as well so I can make arrangements if I need to. 

Ex: Oh sorry. I thought Jenny would tell you . 

Me: I’d just like to hear it from you a day ahead of time from now on or Jenny won’t be leaving the house any more. I don’t need specifics just please let me know that some one is picking Jenny up between 3-5 on Friday. That’s all I’m asking for. 

Ex: ok. I can do that. 

So two weeks go by since that conversation. Today I get a text from Jenny’s mom at 3 o’clock. Sorry for the late notice but someone is on the way to get Jenny. 

I immediately replied that sorry but she can’t go. I asked for a day notice and I get less than 2 hours. She made some comments about Jenny being a built in baby sitter and how it costs her a relationship with our daughter.  I replied that not being a constant in Jenny’s life for the last 13 years and never around for anything Jenny’s ever done has cost her a relationship with our daughter.  

So am I an asshole for sticking to my demand of getting a days notice before Jenny goes for the weekend?

To me this seems selfish and seems like she expects that me and her mom will pay for everything while she only spends on herself.

1251,Asshole,"I(22F) went to a family gathering last weekend, as some of my relatives were in town. I  arrived at my uncles house around noon, to meet my mom/relatives there before lunch. 

I often wear hats when it's sunny out. This hat in particular was kinda a ""meme"", but kinda not? Basically it's a dad hat that says ""SHUT UP BOOMER"". If you know the memes about baby boomers being out of touch with the youth and the problems they face, you'll understand.

My cousin greets me at the door, we have a laugh about the hat, I hang it up at the door. At some point my younger cousin gets a hold of it, he shows his mom (aunt1) who has a sense of humor, it gets to her husband and eventually everyone in house knows about the ""joke"". Everything appears fine, until we sit down for lunch, paraphrasing conversation here.

Uncle1: So, shut up boomer? What is that supposed to mean?

Me: Uh well, it's just a joke.

Uncle1: I don't understand the joke.

Me: Well it's a joke about how um, some older people don't understand modern problems.

Uncle1: Modern problems? Like what?

Aunt1: Oh shush, we don't need to have an argument.

Uncle1: It's not an argument! I just wanna understand!

Me: Well, things like climate change, or how the cost of living has gone up, and the cost of college has gone up, and wages have stayed the same, so it's a lot tougher for a lot of young people in a lot of ways.

Uncle1: Is it a lot tougher? I didn't have the internet around when I was young, you kids have tons of opportunity, more than we ever did. And my generation still managed to do well, we had to work really hard for it, and we love to work hard. And climate change is nothing to worry about, you're wasting your mental energy thinking about global weather, if millennials put that energy into their work, they'd be doing a lot better.

Uncle2: \*Nods in agreement\* You know how many young kids are becoming millionares making apps on the iphone? 

Aunt1: Shh let's keep this nonpolitical, can we?

Uncle1: We're having a nice conversation! We're all adults here! And you can't wear a political statement like that and be surprised when people ask you about it.

Uncle2: Yeah that's right, imagine if I went outside wearing a hat that said ""shut up black people"".

Aunt2: \*Nods in agreement\*

Cousin1: \*stares and me sympathetically\*

My mom: Would you boys relax, it's just a silly thing. So cousin1, how's your semester going, did you have your midterm exams?

Uncle1: We're having a nice conversation! 

This continues for about 30 minutes, I mostly stay quite while they rant.I go home and hope the whole thing blows over, but apparently it stirred quite a bit of drama in my family. My mom thinks my aunts/uncles were rude, but that I initiated it with the insensitive hat, and that I should apologize the next time I see them. I told her that they were being ridiculous and they should be able to take a joke.

I don’t get on with my stepdad. He calls me bad words because of my style, he tells my mom that I’m not allowed out, or that my dad is a loser and I’m not allowed to see him. He tried to stop me seeing my dad  a few years back but my dad threatened to take my mom to court so he had to stop but he took his anger out on me.

He is a good dad to my half brothers and sister but he really hates me. I don’t blame my mom, she is in love with him.

Mostly I live with my dad these days but my mom will on the odd occasion insist on me going over to stay for a couple days which I hate. My dad kinda has no choice but to go along because we have a social services lady who makes notes if I don’t see my mom and it negatively impacts my dad. 

Anyway a few days ago my mom gave me some money to bring back some food because I was at the mall and on the way back to my moms place I bought a milkshake from five guys. A peanut butter malted shake. I picked up enough food for everyone but I figured because there was a small amount of change left over and I was lugging all the food home I deserved a milkshake. 

When I got home my stepdad said ‘where is your brothers and sisters?’ I said I didn’t buy them one. My stepdad took my shake and said well since you want to be selfish and not think of your siblings you don’t deserve this. And threw it in the trash.

That night that she went out she got really drunk and ended up cheating on me with some other guy. I was really pissed and hurt but I care for her deeply so I forgave her. She made a couple of promises to me but one of the major ones is that she would never drink again. I understand that is an unrealistic thing to expect from someone but I feel like it would be nice if she took a break for a bit. Her family threw a graduation party for her a few days later and she had a couple of glasses of wine, which I wasn't really happy about. Its been about two weeks since then and her birthday is coming up at the end of the weekend. She's told me that she wants to go out and do something for her birthday which I have no objection to but I said I'm not comfortable with her going out drinking. She started to argue with me about how it's her birthday and she never celebrates and that she should be able to go out drinking if she wants. She kept insisting that she is going to be on her best behaviour especially since she will be with her sisters. I don't want her to never drink again but I feel like it too soon for this too happen, in addition, I feel like when she drinks its quite irresponsible (blackout drunk) so I'm not comfortable with it yet. he hasn't found a job yet since shes graduated and spends a lot of her time at home, so I understand her wanting to go and do something.

1257,Not the A-hole,"Ok, sorry that this sounds like a scene out of an American Pie movie or something, but here goes:

So yesterday I had the apartment to myself, and decided to masturbate. Don’t judge, we all do it, lol. Anyway, my roommate came home during, and was with a mutual friend of ours. This mutual friend and I are really close, and hang out all the time, so when they arrived, she opened the door to my room to come in and say hi. Now, my door was closed, but wasn’t locked, because I was home alone. She unfortunately walked in on me doing my thing, looked horrified, and left the room. Of course, I was super embarrassed.

Later, she asked me for an apology for making her see that. I said that it sucks that she had to see me masturbating, but I didn’t feel the need to apologize, because I didn’t do anything wrong, she was the one who walked into my room without knocking. Her response was that we have a close relationship, and go into each other’s rooms without knocking all the time, so she assumed it was fine - which is true, but obviously in this case our closeness led to an awkward situation. 

I’m usually the type to suck it up and apologize even if I feel I did nothing wrong, but I didn’t want to for this because I felt uncomfortable with her seeing me jerking off, so the idea of me apologizing for being walked in on masturbating makes no sense to me. She’s not “end the friendship” pissed, but she is still mad that I won’t apologize to her.

1264,Not the A-hole,"Should be ""are we the assholes"", but that's not how this sub is written. Also, I won't be naming genders in this to avoid unfair assumptions. 

My partner and I got married 3 years ago. A little bit before we got married, it came to light that my partner had a massive amount of debt (medical, student, and lawsuit based). There are valid reasons to this and it's not that they were irresponsible. Due to this, their credit score is garbage.  This is not something that could conceivably be paid off in a few decades even. It is in the hundreds of thousands. **If we had gotten legally married, we would be unable to ever afford to have children or even be able to rent an apartment on our own.** 

Now, I am not rich by any means, but I have always worked hard to stay debt free, maintain good credit, and am lucky enough to have no student loans. We had dreams for our lives and wanted to not ruin all of our chances, so we agreed to skip the legal portion of marriage for the time being. The social/religious aspect matters both to us and our families, but the legal aspect is rarely looked at too closely. 

We had a reasonable wedding and just... didn't sign a paper. We asked for a contribution for a down payment IF guests wanted to get us gifts (no registry or physical gifts). We called it a wedding because it is/was. 

We were able to buy a house with my credit (property is only in my name). We've been married for 3 years and just had our second child. We file taxes separately. We would never have been able to do this if we'd signed the papers. This wasn't any kind of issue until our second child was born and it came out that we didn't have a marriage license to give over at the hospital (obviously) and we had to sign a declaration of paternity. All hell has broken loose.

They are now referring to us as ""boyfriend and girlfriend"" and say that they don't know what to tell the children in the family about this or what to do on holidays (unmarried couples don't room together on family trips).

My(30m) wife(27f) and I have been together for over 4 years and married for over 1 year. We have a few kids, a dopey dog and a bunch of crazy cats. For the most part, while our relationship has encountered its fair share of ups and downs, we are very happy. We love each other, share a lot of common interests and have big aspirations for our and our kids futures that we have steadily been building towards.

Furthermore, my wife, who is Caucasian, has a profound admiration of East Asian culture. She loves sushi, anime, manga and we’ve both set a long term goal of visiting Japan when we become empty nesters. Her best friend is of East Asian descent and so it’s pretty obvious that aspects of that culture are near and dear to her heart.

Here’s the thing, I’m Indian. And my wife has told me I’m not really Asian. As an Indian, it’s a widely held belief that the subcontinent of India is located within the Asian territory. Geographers and historians can correct me if they want. However, the crux of the issue is that in her eyes, I am not Asian, despite my believing I have been Asian my whole life.

This entire situation is compounded by the fact that I was born in Africa and am documented as black. Hope that’s not too confusing for readers.

So AITA for expecting my wife to acknowledge that I am Asian?

TLDR: Wife doesn’t acknowledge my Asian heritage and plus I’m black on paper.

EDIT/UPDATE: First of all, thanks to everyone for their input and further clarity of UK versus US customary lingo about ethnicity. Real quick, my wife weren’t in any sort of spat. She knows I’m Asian but often jokes about me not being Asian (despite me also being black on paper) as well as being Indian. I discussed posting this to the subreddit to get the general consensus as sort of a funny little experiment. In fact u/youarenotasian is my wife and she commented that I was the asshole.",168,76,0.89

1267,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway- Im just going to get in to it.

I (19M) got a call from my mother frantically telling me that she got a call from my sister's school because apparently she had ingested peanuts, she is deathly anaphylactic, I was at home for reading week, and am studying for upcoming midterms, but dropped everything and drove as legally fast as possible to get down to the school.

I ran in to the the office which was really crowded. There was only one secretary, and I knew instantly who it was- My mother and alot of other parents complain about her being a short-tempered smart ass.

I ran in but there was a line up, I told her my urgent need to talk to her right now due to my sisters allergic reaction and she looked at me and asked if I was blind ""there's a line hun"".

I waited for about 2 minutes before telling her this really cant wait, she put up a finger and picked up the phone.

I got upset and she called a hall monitor to escort me outside the office until she was ""Ready to talk to me"" I was yelling to tell her about my sister's allergic reaction yet she told me she didn't want to hear it. I was in absolute awe at her attitude, especially with the situation I was in.

I dialed 911 because it seemed like the school didn't give any fucks about my sister. The secretary saw me and ran out to to tell me to hang up.

She started by telling me ""See hun, I told you to wait for a reason- there was a mix up, A student told your sister that she gave her something w/ peanuts as a joke, we are dealing w/ that student right now, I could have handled this situation a lot better- I have a lot of students to deal with""

I looked at her and said ""what on earth are you talking about, my sister is deathly allergic and you expect me not to be worried and to wait and do nothing? Every fucking second counts in an emergency you fucking idiot, what were you expecting? Were you waiting to keep me on edge for as long as possible before telling me?""

I yelled at her for a bit more and she started to tear up and walked off, the monitor told me to leave ""The school isn't going to deal with a hysterical child, we are waiting for your parents, where we will then deal with your attitude""

Are you serious? How am I supposed to react in that situation? Yes, I agree I was really angry, but I feel like I was justified- My sister could have fucking died, all she had to say was there was a mix up- I would have waited if I heard a logical reason like that as to why she didn't need to talk to me right at that moment. AITA?

EDIT- 

To add context, some people are confused as to why I didn't immediately go to the hospital, the reasons why are because

1.) I don't know what hospital to go to

2.) they were not contacting me, even though im on her emergency contact

3.) from my understanding, she ran to a teacher and told her she was going to have an allergic reaction, so she got sent to the nurse and my mom was notified, before anything went down the idiotic student who tricked her, told the teacher that it was a ""prank"" and that she didn't actually have any peanuts, obviously it was a really dumb and small prank that turned in to a big situation, I guess the faculty themselves were confused about what was actually going on so they were unsure what to actually do.",1540,15695,0.91
1268,Asshole,"I saw the former friend I had a fallout over this on FB and it brought up this memory.

Years ago when I was on OKCupid, I came across a profile of a woman we'll call Lucy (not protecting her identity with a fake name, I just literally don't remember).

Lucy's one and only picture of herself was a shot of her front from her neck to the top of her pants. She was topless and holding her breasts so they weren't visible.

Her profile had a rant in all caps at the top of her profile about how she was not interested in casual sex and to stop asking her for it. To be fair, this happens a lot on OKCupid, so I generally don't begrudge someone making it clear (because a lot of people don't bother reading profiles too carefully).

But I found it hypocritical and funny because A) Her face wasn't even visible and B) she wasn't wearing a shirt in her picture. I cropped it so only the picture was visible (no identifying information) and asked Facebook what they thought and included the same explanation above as to why I thought it was hypocritical and funny. 

My friend Nancy saw it and told me I was being sexist and a woman is allowed to wear whatever she wants. I tried to explain that I wasn't suggesting she can't wear what she wants, just that it's funny that she has a picture of herself without a face and without a shirt on and seems angry that other men assume she's into casual relationships.

To be fair, I'm pretty verbose (see this post for details on that), so she gave me a TLDR in response and deleted me as a friend. We haven't spoken since.

AITA in this situation? I realize posting her picture was probably asshole-ish, it's not something I would do as the person I am today, but am I the asshole for how my friend interpreted this and was this sexist?

Edit the Deuce: It's been about an hour and I think that's almost all the comments I will get on this one.

Thank you for the responses! I genuinely appreciate it.

It seems that the consensus is that I'm the asshole for posting her picture without her consent with the intent to mock her.

1269,No A-holes here,"I’m 19F and live with my parents and brother (30M). I turn 20 soon. The rule in my family is the birthday person chooses their dinner and cake flavour. I went vegan last year so for last year’s birthday dinner, I was very newly vegan and not wanting to make things difficult, I just asked for spaghetti and marinara sauce and put mushrooms in mine while my family had beef in theirs. It worked out but now that I’m used to being vegan and have a lot of recipes I love now I want to do something else. My dad said to just pick whatever I wanted and he’d eat the cake but cook himself a steak for dinner, because he’s not a vegetarian food lover. Okay great that’s fine.

Then my brother came in. He’s a chef and cooks for my parents once in a while but not often - always meat so I just do something else which is fine. He has been wanting to make a roasted red pepper soup for a while now and he said he wants to make it for my birthday. I’ll be honest - it’s not a dish that particularly appeals to me. I like soup, but it just doesn’t sound like one I’d liked. I’d probably try it though because I’ll eat anything pretty much if it’s vegan. However, for my own birthday dinner I’d like to love my meal and know I’ll be happy with it. I want my mom to make a baked risotto we’ve made a few times and loved. I told ny brother he could make it another time because that’s not what I really wanted for my birthday. He didn’t say much but just went really quiet before finally saying “So you’re just going to make your own birthday dinner again?. God forbid I try to do something nice for you.” 

AITA??? It’s not like I said never make it. Just I don’t want to try a new recipe I’m not sure I’ll like on my birthday. I feel entitled to choose my own dinner even if not everyone will like it.",124,142,0.92

I was on my return flight recently and had downloaded some drug related videos to watch. I put my headphones on & started the video. I wouldn't say it super laden with explict video, but there were some scenes with drug use (needles, crack pipes, etc). During one of these scenes the person next to me asked me to stop playing the video because they thought it was disgusting and inappropriate; they didnt make a scene but they were pretty pissed. I debated for a second before telling them no, they'll just have to look away

My only concern was causing an issue on the flight. Otherwise, i dont really believe in censoring most information even if its a little explicit.

I can’t sleep on planes, but I always like to try. 
I had my eyes closed and head back after we took off and was just kinda sitting there waiting, listening to music. 

About 10 minutes later a heard a click and opened my eyes to see a woman taking a picture of our whole row from the isle of the airplane. She wasn’t a flight attendant or anything. She was one of few other white people on the flight. 

I said, “what the fuck? Did you take a picture of me” and she’s standing in the isle, holding a big fancy camera pointed at us, and just kinda shrugs at me and walks away. She goes and sits next to her guy friend. 

20 minutes later or so I hear clicking again and see she’s up just taking pictures of other peoples rows. But all I did was sit there thinking, ‘this is really weird.’ She then walked up to the front of the flight and started taking pictures of everyone in the cabin at once. Idk why I just felt uncomfortable at this point, and I was still annoyed she had already taken a picture of me, so I stuck my middle finger up high for every picture she tried to take. 

She went and sat back with her friend and she sounded like she was getting really heated in whatever language she was speaking. 

I pretended to go to sleep. And within 10 minutes she got back up and tried taking more pictures of the whole cabin. So I stuck my middle finger back up in the air. 

After the flight her guy friend kept pointing at me and puffing his chest but she kinda held him back. So I flipped them off again and left.

One of my coworkers in The Annex, let’s call her Danni, has been out of the office for almost two weeks now. We always got along, but we weren’t super great friends. Typical office buddies. Her absence has been kind of weird because she’s really talkative, so in Halloween spirit the other Annex inhabitants and I thought it would be funny to put my plastic skeleton in her chair as a stand in until she returns. Danni is light-hearted, and I knew she would think it was funny if she came in to a skeleton at her desk. I also have seen her posting on Social Media going out to bars and museums during her time off, so I assumed she was in good health.

Almost everyone in the office had a good laugh over it, including our clients, but I overheard one of my coworkers saying she thought it was insensitive since we didn’t know why Danni is out of the office. I told her it was just a joke, and that Danni would think it was funny, but she had our supervisor send out an email that it was inappropriate and to remove him. 

I texted Danni a picture of the skeleton at her desk shortly after and said we missed her so we got a fill in and she thought it was really funny. She also told me why she’s been out of the office, and it doesn’t have anything to do with illness.

One of these friends mentioned it to someone when they asked what they were doing this weekend, and one of our loose acquaintances overheard.

1276,Not the A-hole,"Me and my partner have been together for just under a year.

He has a friend who he was hooking up with before we met. They had feelings for each other and were FWB's for several months but decided not to make a go of it. We met a few months after they stopped seeing each other, fast forward to now and we are very much in love etc.

When I first started seeing him I brushed it off as not a big deal. But as we got more serious about each other it started to bother me that he would have phone calls with her etc. I have been cheated on before, but I have no reason to suspect my boyfriend of foul play. I can tell he is in love with me and I don't feel insecure. I have tried to rationalise this friendship as much as possible, and although I feel like I'm being unfair... I can't shake this uncomfortable feeling when I think about their relationship.

Whenever me and my partner have discussed her I've tried to be really measured about it. I've said things like 'I don't want to take anything positive out of your life', and I've really tried to get my head around it. I offered to meet her, if he wanted me to. But I've also admitted that it bothers me, when he asked me if it did. He has had some time to dwell on this and let me know that he would not be cool with it if I were still speaking to someone I slept with/had feelings for. As a result, in the interest of fairness, he decided to stop speaking to her.

So he tells her that he wants a break from their friendship, that he's getting serious about me and that he doesn't think its appropriate for him to be close to someone he has a history with while with me. She did not take this well, and basically accused me of being controlling/insecure/jealous. This obviously has put my back up further.

One thing that really got me, was that they had apparently had some agreement that she would be his best man if he ever got married. When they argued she brought it up and was like, well I can't do that if the bride hates me. This got me thinking, and I can literally not in a million years imagine being okay with my future husbands best man being someone he's fucked... even if they are totally over each other.

1278,Not the A-hole,"Posting on behalf of a friend

I'm a doctor which means I have 5x10 week rotations each year, some of which can be customised. For the final rotation of the year I called 2 weeks in advance to see if I could have Christmas off. Admin gave me the option between having Christmas or New years Day off.  I’ve always loved Christmas, and I’m now dating a girl that really loves it too so it was an easy decision. That option was 1 of 4 options for doctors during the next 10 weeks, Option A/B which have my desired schedule, and option C/D which have the alternative.

A week later I get a call from medical admin asking if I'd reconsider my choice. Confused, I state no, I would like to stay with my previous selection. 10 minutes later I get a call from another of the 4 doctors saying there was a mistake, and that he had asked for option B a month ago, and that the medical admin had assigned place B to me when in fact he had asked for it much earlier. He stated he had booked flights to see his family and spend time with his grandma as it would be ""her last Christmas"". I say call me tomorrow so I can have a think about it.

Today I get a call from him wanting to chat about this situation. He restates his case and I understand his desperation on the situation. I say let me consult the people in my life that would like me to be with them at Christmas and get back to him after the weekend.

He then goes to medical admin and attempts to coerce the poor admin lady into swapping the schedules. At this point it is important to understand that while unlikely, it is possible to get shifts covered over this period. I get a call from a clearly upset medical admin lady basically begging me to swap shifts. Concerned for the tone, I try to further investigate why she is so upset. I ask to meet with her and go to the ward where I will be working next rotation.

I arrive to meet two consultants who state the schedule is finalised and I do not have to swap. The drained look on the medical admin face highlights the fact that she is clearly distraught over the emotional distress she has caused the other doctor. I ask if he has tried to get the shift covered, to which they answer no. The consultants were clearly concerned for the wellbeing of the admin lady and rightfully so as it is not the right of any doctor to demand any time off regardless of how early they request it. It's just part of the job.

My question is am I the asshole for taking the time over this other person. From my perspective, we have both called early to get Christmas off. The admin lady made the mistake to assign column B to me, when she should have assigned column A which would have nullified the entire situation. We both have clear right to the day off as it meant enough to us to call early and arrange our schedules. The person who filled column A lucked into the situation and is now unwilling to swap. His actions make me question his integrity and there is no evidence to support his claims at this point.

1282,Asshole,"I said this is NSFW because it's kind of gross, at least to me.

My boyfriend has a skin condition. It's something like 10 years ago he got athletes foot which went untreated, and now he has psoriasis or eczema or something on his feet. Doctors explained it as the skin on his feet is very thin and heals too fast. So he has healed tissue over scar tissue over healed tissue over scar tissue, etc. He's had this condition for literally 10 years.

He has a pair of scissors he keeps by his desk which he uses to scrape his feet. To itch and also to debride the skin. When he's doing nothing on the computer, he's absentmindedly scratching his feet. He explains it's the only relief he can get, and if he doesn't itch it, it heals over and he has panic attacks due to the need to itch. It's very neurotic and honestly I wish he'd see a therapist or something.

Doctors have said his itching is making it worse. If he just left it alone for a couple of weeks, it might clear up mostly. But my boyfriend has tried many times and is in ""agony"" by his own words.

Anyways, this pair of scissors is one of his prized possessions by his own admission. It's the ""only thing that works"" and he has moved with it several times. If he loses the scissors, he literally upturns his office looking for them. As I said, very neurotic behavior.

We have very strict lease guidelines (we're on a college town, so this is understandable), and it's clear she's not supposed to be over nearly as often as she is, which averages about 5-6 nights a week. Rarely, she might only stay over for 4 nights. (Our place is considerably closer to her main job than her actual residence.)

She showers, does laundry, and cooks a TON (cooking is also for her job... So she's using the oven and stove FAR more than the rest of us). 

It's not like she's really bothering any of us, and she's a nice person, so I don't feel like it's necessary for me to contact the landlord. Also, since we're all on individual leases, I don't want to even try and bother asking her for rent money. 

However, I do think she and her boyfriend/my roommate need to pick up some of the extra expenses. This roommate also likes to keep the house fairly warm, so the electric is just getting more and more expensive all around.

I tried to be nice about it and said, ""Sorry, but I specifically chose this seat and I don't really want to give it up, I've been traveling for hours.""

The woman's response was, ""Well so have we! Imagine traveling with an overtired kindergartener who now won't be able to sleep since she can't sit by her mom!""

1. I was seated in the window seat, the woman was in the middle seat next to me, and another passenger was in the aisle seat next to her. 6 year old kid was across in the next row over in the aisle seat. Since the mother and the kid were only one seat away from each other, it wasn't so much an issue of not being seated next to each other, but more that the mom wanted her kid to have the window seat so she could sleep
2. This wasn't an issue of separation and the kid being scared. Her mom was ONE seat away. This was an issue of wanting the seat for her kid just so she could sleep

My husband (27M) works in a different field that also requires a lot of travel and currently does travel a lot. I’m a recent transplant to where we live, but we live in his hometown. My project is coming to an end and my husband and I have been discussing where I might be staffed next as we know there’s not a lot of local work. Well, I got word of some potential travel work spinning up in the city where I went to college and lived for a while; this city is also substantially closer to where my parents live (albeit a 4-hour drive away). This project would probably last about a year.  
I tell my husband of the whispers of new work spinning up, thinking he’ll be excited for the career opportunity, especially one closer to family and friends, and get the opposite. He tells me that he’s uncomfortable with me traveling to this city because the people I used to work with there are rowdy (this is true but I’m only actually friends with one of these people and she’s been 100% supportive of our marriage - even attending our wedding events). He says being in such close proximity so frequently to this group is only inviting trouble. I tell him that if trouble is really what I’m after, can’t I find that anywhere? He says he’s fine with me traveling anywhere else in the country, just not this city. I worry that if this work does come about and I don’t take it, not only would I be missing out on loved ones’ time, but I could be shooting myself in the foot in terms of networking opportunities and my career trajectory. I expressed this to him. The problem is, I know with him it’s not a simple expression of discomfort - if I don’t yield to his feelings, it would be an ongoing fight with him. I mentioned this to him and he confirmed it.  
I’m not a party animal, but I do enjoy the occasional night out or socializing. I don’t have any friends where we live, so the only time I really go out is for work events. Last night, I went out for cocktails with my team and thought it’d be a great opportunity since husband’s traveling this week. When he texted me at 11:30 pm and I told him I was still out with the team, he said “This is my point of why I don't feel comfortable with you in \[City\].”  
He made the point that this can’t possibly be the only work spinning up, and he’s probably right, but we can’t know that for sure nor that this won’t be the best opportunity. Ultimately, I’m just peeved at what I see as him trying to place restrictions on me, although I know compromise is a part of marriage. He says I need to have more respect for his feelings.  
AITA for feeling that his behavior is controlling?  
Tl;dr: I have a traveling work opportunity in the city I went to college in, but my husband doesn’t want me to take it for fear of a questionable social environment there.",225,478,0.93

1293,Asshole,"I went to school for computer science with a concentration in sound engineering. A little less than half of my degree were music classes as music is my passion. I personally play electric guitar, nylon guitar, and violin, and have all three since I was very young, I'm 29 now. 

I've been working at my dream job for five years as a music instructor. It's not as extravagant a job as most, but I love it. My schedule is very lax, I do what I love, it's not stressful, and I work from home, all the while still making around $35,000/yr. I have no debt, own my own house at 29 outright, my life is magic, to be honest. I figure my take home after taxes, financial obligations, bills, etc is maybe $20-23k.

But my wife is expecting child soon. My salary more than allows us to live comfortably, but not extravagantly. Any kind of finer things we couldn't afford. If our kid wants to do a sport or other extracurricular? It would make things tight. At least we wouldn't have to worry about medical, etc because we're in Canada.

The problem is my wife wants me to begin my career, as if what I'm doing now is not my ideal career. She wants me to use my degree. Starting salary for a sound engineer is surely at least $50k-60k/yr. But I don't think I want to do any of that anymore. I found my calling. We've talked a lot about it and ultimately she says it's my choice and I think I know what choice I'll make. But this does mean we'll suffer financially, relatively speaking. This is the difference between comfortable lower-middle class and comfortably upper-middle class.

Complicating things is my wife is disabled (lost a leg in a motorcycle accident before we met). She does work making crafts and etc to sell online but her income is maybe $5k/yr, almost nothing in the grand scheme. It really falls on me to make the brunt of our income and I'd rather make less and have a happy life than make more and loathe my life.

One friend was talking about her roommate's FWB and casually referred to this woman as a ""1 out of 10"" in terms of looks and briefly described the woman in order to justify this ""rating."" It immediately didn't sit right with me. I forgot what I actually said but it was something along the lines of ""No!! It's mean to rate people."" My friend then said that she thinks it's justified because her roommate said that the FWB sometimes is mean to him. I said that I'm just very uncomfortable with the idea of rating people's attractiveness in general. I didn't use an angry tone of voice and didn't make a character judgement on her - I was pointing out that I took issue with this one thing that she was doing.

She texted me later and said that I made her feel bad in front of our other two friends for challenging her idea of rating people's attractiveness, and wondered if I was mad at her. She continued to insist that ""rating"" nice people shouldn't be allowed but when it comes to mean people, it's a free-for-all.

After 18 months they finally got a one bedroom studio apartment. since I've literally done everything with the kids by myself the last 18 months. I figured it was about time she took them for a couple of days a week, the kids have been dying to spend some time with their mother anyways.

I pretty much had to force her to take her own children, there was nothing but excuses on why she couldn't have her own kids. I had to threaten to take her to court for child support in order to get her to take them.

The pay and benefits are much better and I would have to work there for a year or so which is when they're going to apply the same format at my current location and I can transfer back. The problem is that my wife is not into the idea at all. To her it's a hassle for her and the kids and she doesn't consider it worth it doing it for only one year. She has a job (although she can probably get it back due to her history there), she's also concerned about losing our current home and also concerned for the kids.

So my uncle's computer had an issue with it and he asked if I could help fix it since I am the ""tech"" guy in my family. The issue was actually kinda complex so it took me awhile, and the whole time my uncle would pass by me and say ""wow still not fixed yet?"" and other snide comments, despite me taking time out of my day to help him without pay.

He headed to the store and I was able to fix it, but before I left I set his desktop background to an image of a guy straddling another guy, full nudity, full penetration.

We asked my brother and sister in law to be in the wedding several months ago and they never said yes or no but just said we have to see if they would be pregnant by my wedding or not. We've had some issues with my brother and SIL since getting engaged (they asked me to change my wedding date after i made a deposit, told me no one would come as its on Halloween, etc) If they were pregnant or had a baby then they wouldn't be in it because they don't let anyone watch the children. They have a 3 year old and are currently pregnant with their second child who will be 8 months old at the time of my wedding.

A bit of background and context. I live with my mother and brother whilst working full-time and paying my mother $1200 USD per month as an ""allowance"" (Traditional asian family background. I have no choice but to pay, and also can't move out because I have to support her). For context: I live and work in Asia where my salary is around USD$3200 per month.

I work hard and support myself, trying to save as much for myself as possible, because you never know what ""emergencies"" comes up and I have to support or pay for something in the family.

My immediate family knows this as I always put my phone on the dinner table, so if I get a message from work, I'll hear it.

My cousin, let's call her Sandra (my mothers favourite) came to town for a few days. She isn't rich herself, but sustains herself, living life quite carefree, travelling the world, whilst teaching English - She doesn't need to support her family as her parents are millionaires.

 After they had talked about it, my cousin kept mocking me for being depressed and not enjoying the trip, for example saying that ""I was gonna have a panic at the airport and get searched by the police"". This got to the point where my uncle had to tell my cousin to stop and all-in-all, it ruined my trip.

So one night my brother wants to talk to my cousin on my PS4, and I say no, which he responds to threatening taking away my PS4 account given we share games. I just tell him fuck off and slept on the couch that night since we share a room too. 

Next morning he says we're going to my cousins and I say no. We get into a heated argument and my mom gets caught up and eventually she says to go to my cousins or go outside, which I took as ""Go or Get Out"". I then stormed out the house and went walked for probably an hour while my brother drive his car with me trying to convince me that I need come back home, and that my mom was crying and that she was gonna call the police to find me if I didn't. I did come back where my mom told me to stay outside while she got my stuff and had my dad pick me up and stay at his house.

I probably stayed there for a week until my brother came to father's and we had a talk about what happened and came to the conclusion that ESH and that everyone overreacted. He said from his and my mom's side was that I was being a bratty teenager and didn't want to listen. 


Now fast forward a couple months later and I still haven't talked to cousin. Me, my friends, and brother were hanging out when my brother asked why I still haven't spoken to him, which I said that I don't like hanging around with him because he makes me feel bad, he's rude and kind of an asshole. My brother responded saying that my cousin is very depressed and didn't actually mean what he said, which I responded with, I don't care that's no excuse to be an asshole. My brother then said that I should tell my cousin my feelings and give him some closure and I thought that was a good idea.

JJ came in right as we were about to renew the lease for another 18 months. Her name isn't on the lease, but she verbally agreed she would be living in the area for at least 18 months,  so it would suit her to stay the whole time. But, we agreed if she did have to leave early (potential job change) she would give at least 2 weeks notice.

There is one rule my girlfriend and I are really strict on is respect for our cat, a siamese called Bluey. Which includes not letting him go outside.

Recently Bluey has been really attached to JJ and has been following her everywhere, including trying to follow her outside. We've given JJ plenty of warning that we will not be happy if Bluey gets out. 

Last night around midnight  we heard the sound of 2 cats fighting, and one sounded like Bluey. All the housemates went out to look for him, including JJ. 

I went to see how he had got out and it turns out JJ hand left her window open and Bluey had gone into the room when she was in the bathroom and pushed though the fly screen (I knew it was loose, but he had never tried to push through before). 

Bluey was found safe. But I'm sorry to say my girlfriend and I lost our temper at JJ and raised our voice at her for being careless. It didnt help that I had had a really long day at work, and worrying about my cat was the last thing I need.

JJ apologised and I thought that was the end of it. But this morning she packed up and left, saying she felt unwelcome and unsafe in our house, and she wants her bond back immediately.

Because she's left so suddenly,  the rest of us (mostly students) are being forced to pay more until we find someone else, which is especially hard for those of us with our name on the lease. We still like JJ and want to be friends, and we thought she would like to be too. In order to smooth things over, I asked  if she could please just pay one more month worth of rent , and then I'll give her bond back. J said that was a dickish thing to ask and is refusing to pay, but the other housemates think it is fair, especially because she has a full time job and can afford it.

I recently just got promoted into Shift Manager position after someone left and I'm rocking it (based on the responses I received from the upper managers). However, it's taking a toll on me. 

Before I took the position, there were 2 of us that were supposed to split the 5 days closing that the ex. manager used to handle. Wednesday to Friday for him, Saturday and Sunday for me. We both get 1 busy day of the week (Friday/Saturday) and slow days. However, since the other manager apparently cannot handle the Friday closings so they put me on it instead. I don't really mind doing the closing on Fridays but the problem is we are understaffed and I do not have a competent coworker to work with me during Fridays. Excluding the upper managers, I'm the fastest worker in my store and the rest of them are either a.) Slow or b.) Not trained well enough. I'm really stressed about the fact that we are understaffed and have to shoulder a lot of the problems and workload. We close at 1am on the two busiest days and 12am on the rest of the week. I'm a student and I'm starting to neglect my classes because of the workload. I think they then expect a lot and too much from me but I cannot yield as much as they thought I can.

But inside I wrote: **'Happy Personal Christmas from X and X'**. I really don't know why. Perhaps just to distinguish it from all the other cards she would get saying 'Happy Birthday'.

Two days later, all hell breaks loose. My wife is bombarded with calls from her family, all saying that I have insulted her sister and her freethinking humanism. My wife has heard that she thinks I was insulting her by suggesting either she thinks she's God or else that she's a big baby.

I have apologised by letter and will have to do so at a family dinner this evening but, really, AITA?",35,31,0.93
1320,Everyone Sucks,"Throwaway because I'm a little embarrassed about this.

I live in the UK so the drinking age is 18. I'm 28, I haven't been ID'd since I was about 21. I don't have a baby face and parenthood has aged me horribly. I have a 22mo daughter and I'm 27 weeks pregnant and obviously showing. Basically there's no way you'd think I was under age. 

Yesterday I nipped to the shop, kiddo with me, to pick up some bits, bread, milk, 2000 packets of pickled onion monster munch (the pregnancy craving is fierce) while I was there I spotted my husband's favourite cider on deal so I thought I'll grab him some as a little treat when he gets home from work.

I get to the counter and the woman (maybe late 50s) starts scanning my items. She's giving me some weird looks but I figure it's probably all the monster munch (seriously like 10 packets.) Then she scans the cider and asks if I have any ID. I say ""really?"" In a light-hearted but bemused tone.
""Yes really"" snaps the woman.
I start fishing my ID in my purse and say ""sorry, it's just I haven't been ID'd in about 7 years, you caught me off guard a little"" I'm still trying to keep things light at this point.
""It's my job to ID people who I don't believe to be old enough"" still in a very snappy tone. I'm getting a bit pissed off with her attitude at this point so I say (still in a mostly joking tone) ""I'm not sure if I should be flattered you think I look so young or offended that you think I look like the type to have 2 kids before they turn 18"" I'd handed over my ID now and she's studying it like she's about to get tested on it. ""Well you obviously are old enough then""she finally snaps at me, I hold my hand out for my ID back but she deliberately drops it on the counter. Rude.
I finish paying and am about to leave when I get a light bulb moment. I turn back to her and say ""you know I wasn't actually bothered about being ID'd, just a bit confused but you're attitude wasn't very professional. But I think that what's really going on is you didn't want to sell alcohol to a pregnant woman. It's for my husband by the way. Next time please try to be a little less judgemental and a little more polite."" Then I basically did the pregnant lady version of a sprint out of there. I think she was hoping I didn't have it on me so she could refuse the sale easily.

I'm kind of shocked at myself, I'm usually insanely passive and non confrontational, at least x7 more than your average British person. I don't know what came over me but the whole attitude of that cashier just got under my skin. I told my husband and he finds the whole idea of me telling someone off in public hilarious but I cannot stop stressing over it, I think maybe I went overboard.

1323,Not the A-hole,"Here's a little background info before I get into what happened.

I've been working out at this gym for about a year and a half now. I've never seen a sign posted saying ""no dropping weights"" or ""no yelling/grunting"", basically a sign condemning loud noise. Nor have I ever seen anyone get approached by a staff member for doing any of those things.

A week ago, while I was working out I was doing deadlifts. Unfortunately, the only thing my gym has to help mitigate the sound of weights dropping is thin pads you can use to cushion the (padded) floor. Usually, I don't use these, and I very rarely ever see anyone else use them, as the floor itself is already padded with mats. I'm building up to my working sets, which goes into a max rep out of 435 lbs. My gym has one set of rubber 45-pound plates for deadlifting, but to go into the higher numbers you need to use at least 3 metal plates on each side to reach 405 lbs.

While I was using the 3 metal plates on each side, a gym worker came up to me and told me: 

"" Hey man, theres pads right there if you don't want to be so loud."" 

I then responded: ""Sorry about that. I'll use the pads."" The worker then went back to the desk.

I use the pads from then on. I also make sure to slow down how quickly I let the weight go back down to try to prevent as much noise as possible, I figure if the weight is disturbing him then I'll do my best to quiet it. 

When I finally get to my max set of 435 lbs, I have to drop the weight slightly quicker (but not as quick as when the worker complained to me), as just pulling it is very taxing and controlling the descent is difficult to do (and I don't want to risk an injury). Even though the rubber plates help dampen the noise, the six metal plates do move around and make a lot more noise.

The worker then walks up to me again and says to me:

""Come on buddy. I already told you to keep it quiet. If you're gonna make this an issue, then I can talk to my manager and make sure to get your membership terminated.""

There were only two other people there and none of them complained. The other worker and the manager are friendly with me and have not. given me a noise warning. So I think the issue was with this employee.

I was irritated that he already disturbed my workout twice (at midnight and I want to go home), so I told him: 

""Look. I already put the pads and I'm putting the weight down slower. This is 435 lbs man, and it's gonna make a lot of noise because there are 6 metal plates and on it, plus it's heavy so of course the impact makes a sound. You don't have any signs or written rules about noise. So until the manager comes and talks to me, or theres a rule made officially, I'm gonna continue my workout and you'll have to deal with the noise.""

I feel bad for how I spoke to the worker, but he threatened to get my membership terminated over a rule that doesn't exist.

1324,Not the A-hole,"Okay so this just happened and it honestly annoyed me a lot but my husband is giving me looks that make me think I'm am asshole...

So right near our place is a McDonalds that we've been to many a time. I also have often ordered off their skip the dishes because I love their griddle cakes and sausage patties and I dont feel like making that nonsense late at night when I always seem to crave it. So my husband wants McDonalds and asks what I want and I say the pancakes and sausage. We could have ordered off skip but picking it up would be faster. He made me double check skip to make sure they had breakfast. I've ordered this from skip more times than I was willing to admit, but I checked anyways. All is good, so off he goes.

He calls me after ordering to tell me that the guy at the window told him they don't do all day breakfast, and don't have literally any breakfast items. I'll say one more time, I've ordered breakfast late at night from them MANY times. He's lying. 100%. So I went online and triple checked that the location is advertised as all day breakfast, and seeing that it was, I went to the contact us and complained. He also didnt give my husband the proper receipt so I couldn't do the transaction # but I put in the time and that I was disappointed because it seems clear he just didnt want to deal with it... had I ordered on skip he wouldn't have had the chance to lie and I would have gotten my damn food.

It isnt even about the food really... its how blatant and obvious the lie is, especially when it's his job. I'm not one to complain about stuff like this often, I might say something to my husband but I've never asked for a manager in my life... but it wasnt even a believable lie and I was annoyed. My husband called me a Karen.

1331,Not the A-hole,"Pretty much I’m on a school trip with 8 other people. 4 boys and 5 girls including me. 

There is this one lass. She’s got on my last nerve. At 8 (curfew is 10:30) she will kick the boys (who are all our friends) out of the room to lay in bed until 10 to complain about me and the 4 others talking, watching tv and video and playing Minecraft. She will always get on at us, tell us to turn things down, turn lights off (when we need them to actually see and to be quiet so she can sleep. 

She then proceeds to wake up at 6 am (the rest of us get up at 7 am) and she uses a loud and annoying asf alarm that wakes us all up so we have to wake her up and she then thuds and crashes about getting her stuff to go to the 6:30 swim. She also shouts when she talks but when I tell her to tone it down a bit she just says “that’s just how I talk”. 

We all stay in a 2 bed and 1 pull out bed hotel room and she chose the pullout bed for isolation and quiet so she sleeps on the other side of the room but still wakes us up at 6 am. 

Tonight I had it. She came back early, got set up for bed and the told us to be quiet while she and the other girl sat on the sofa and chatted. She got on at my friend for laughing and then the divide happened. The shusher Kayla has one person Lee on her side while me and TV e other two girls agree it’s unfair.

We would be okay with it if she was nice about it but she’s quite rude and very snarky with it saying “gosh can’t you just be quiet” and then complaining about me and the others talking at 9pm in our own room when we are allowed. We have kept it down but she wants us to shut up or leave altogether. 

Pretty much she stayed up and chatted but once she was done she immediately looked over and said “ugh just switch that light off” (keep in mind it’s the other side of the room and she sleeps with music on). I snapped. My two other friends were changing into sleepwear and brushing their teeth. 

I just “No. Lily and Allie are still getting ready for bed. Just cause it suits you doesn’t mean it suits others. This light will go off when they are ready and in bed and don’t need to walk about. You will just have to wait unfortunately. I’m sure you can do that”. 

Kayla and Lee haven’t said a word to me since. Idc about Kayla not talking to me but Lee taking her side is making me wonder AITA in this situation?

Remember she isn’t wanting us to quiet down. She wants us to shut up altogether. We have whispered as quiet as possible but she ain’t happy. Even us talking in texts is disturbing her sleep. Btw her side of the room is separated from us by a wee wall so no light should bother her.

Edit: we did try talk to her earlier but she got hostile and ended up trying to justify how her early sleep is very important and we need to be more considerate even thou she wakes us up at 6 am. According to her we are over exaggerating.

Edit 2: Slammed the door and woke me up at 6 am then came in while everyone was sleeping, talked loudly and turned on all the lights. I told her to practise what she preaches. She started raising her voice at me so I told her people were still sleeping and to whisper.",70,453,0.96

I ask if I could move up because I couldn't really see the board that well, when I hear my ""friend"" whisper its because I have ""asian eyes."" I just ignore it, but I thought it was a little weird that he said some racist shit to me when I assumed we were good friends. The next music class, around the end of the class when we are packing our instruments, I'm just talking with my friends and this kid comes out of nowhere and says that my breath smells like dog (implying that I eat dogs). At that point, I was just pissed off that he was saying some pretty racist shit so I said to him ""You're failing 5 classes, go fuck yourself."" At that point he gets really angry and starts to try and attack what sort of extracurricular activities I do and claimed that I was just a loser that went home early everyday. I then replied that I would rather go home early than fail 5 classes. That made him even more angry at me, and started coming at my physical appearance. He said I was built like a rice bowl, and the rice was my eyes. That pushed me over the edge and I replied that he was only still attending our school because his dad works here.

My parents divorced a couple years back, and my dad has since gotten married to another dancer/teacher who I don't really like. She has forced me to stretch farther than I'm able to, which I guess has gotten me more flexible, but it's miserable to do. If I'm watching TV at home, she tells me that I should be stretching.

I knew this was going to happen again, and I begged my mom to not make me see my dad, and my mom let me spend the weekend away with her and her boyfriend.

1341,Everyone Sucks,"My girlfriend has a cat with which she is absolutely obsessed. Frankly I don't like it (I don't mind cats in general, but this one has a lot of negative traits), but I make an effort to tolerate it because I know how much it means to her.

She sleeps with the cat every single night, which eventually became a point of contention because she wants it to sleep in the bed even when I spend the night, whereas I'd prefer that it wasn't in the bed at all when we're there together (because A: I just don't like the cat being in the bed and B: she cuddles with it more than me whenever it's there...more on that later).

I feel that compromise is an important part of any relationship, so a few months ago I offered what I felt like was a fair solution: on nights when I sleep over, the cat would not be allowed in the bed when we lay down for the night, but if it jumped into the bed after we fell asleep (which it almost always does in less than 30 minutes), then I wouldn't kick it out. She agreed, and I thought all would be well.

However, in recent weeks she's gone back on our agreement and started demanding that the cat be in the bed with us at all times, which I'm obviously not happy with. Today I tried to calmly talk to her about it, and she told me that she ""changed her mind"" and is ""not willing to compromise on this."" Personally I think she's being ridiculous. I'm not asking for the cat to be banned from the bed entirely (even though I'd prefer that). I'm trying to meet her halfway by just asking that it not be involved when we're drifting off to sleep. I feel like having that time to snuggle your partner is important.

Anyway, later in the evening she laid down to take a nap and asked me to join, but the cat was laying right next to her where I would normally lay. I said, ""I would, but you're not going to let me move the cat, are you?"" She said no, and I asked how I was supposed to lay with her with the cat being in the way. She said that I could just sleep on the other side of it.

At that point I felt downright insulted and unwanted. I said, ""So you're literally saying that you'd rather sleep next to the cat than next to me."" She got angry with me, so I left her apartment despite the fact that we planned on me spending the night tonight. Am I right that she's the one being unreasonable here? This seems like such a ridiculous problem that shouldn't be causing fights like this.

1344,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I have been married for 10 years. A few months back, she somehow managed to break the wedding/engagement ring that I had bought her when we first got hitched.  It was a really nice, unique custom piece, lots of little diamonds in platinum in the shape of ivy leaves.  We’re big LoTR fans and the idea was to have a ring made that looked like Galadriel’s ring.  I digress. 

Anyways, she destroyed it doing something in the garden, so I took it on myself to get it fixed.  I took it back to the jeweler who made it, and after a few weeks he declared it unfixable.  So I ordered a new one.  Took a month. 

When I went to go pick it up, I saw he had another ring in the display that would fit nicely on the same finger with her ring - sort of a circle of tiny diamonds that could nest in the ivy leaves.  I figured what the hell, I’ll buy it for her as a surprise and give it to her when I return her new/old ring to her.  A 10-year upgrade.  But, it was a really small size ring, and I guessed it wouldn’t fit on her finger.  “No matter,” the jeweler said, “give it to her now for the surprise, and then you can all come back and I’ll measure her finger and make you one, and you can give me the small one back.” Sounded like a good idea to me, so I did it. 

Fast forward, I gave my wife her replacement Galadriel ring and the new ring.  She loved them.  When she tried on the new ring, however, she was devastated that it didn’t fit.  I told her that it was ok, I knew it was too small, and we just have to go back to the jeweler to get her finger measured for a new one just like it.  

This information was not well taken.  At all.  She said, among other things, that it’s not a real present, it’s just a chore, because she has to get out of work some time to go to the store to get her finger measured and she’s really busy right now.  She’s disappointed because she was so happy to get the ring, but in reality it’s just a tease because she has to wait a month or more to really get it.  I’m lazy because I didn’t have a plan, I just bought her something on impulse and then made it her problem to get a ring that actually fits. 

All of which hurt my feelings pretty bad, especially seeing as how it wasn’t terribly convenient for me to go get the ring that she broke replaced in the first place, not to mention the expense of all this jewelry buying.  I’m not really much of the fighting type, but I just can’t bring myself to apologize for buying her a diamond ring, even if it doesn’t fit.

He’s told me that the way he sees it is that my daughter is only my step and by calling her my own I’m taking away what should only be between mother and child and I’ll understand later on in the pregnancy.

I flipped and asked him to leave 
EDIT: by flipped I mean crying, not yelling or seeking an argument.

My parents are saying, nicely, that they agree and I’m TA for being so upset when she isn’t mine and that she only has one mother

My argument is I met this child when she was an hour old, I’ve seen her every other week and I’ve had a hand in raising her

Obviously everything is on HIPPA lockdown. She is way too extra on Facebook with long and inappropriate comments on her workplace and coworkers (one even about me once before we became friends). 

She posted a very lengthy status about how one of the new clients was her ex husbands new wife and how she was on house arrest. This is SOOOO violating to the new wife. I sent a screenshot to a friend who confronted her and she took the post down. 

Recently she has been gushing on Facebook about how she will probably move from secretary to case manager. I feel like I need to report this post even though she deleted it. She should in NO WAY be a case manager with the amount of personal and work stuff she spews on FB.

1356,Not the A-hole,"Okay Reddit, I (23F) need an unbiased opinion.

My family situation is very difficult and too complex to explain here - the short version is no one will be willingly in the same room. It’s been this way for over a decade, so I haven’t had a Christmas with more than one person - my mother - in over a decade.
My mother and father are divorced, and whilst my father has always been welcome, since I was 4, he has never joined us for more than half an hour to exchange gifts at Christmas. His reasoning for this is that he doesn’t “do” Christmas, he never actually opens his presents with us and often only tells us he liked them when he finally opens them months later, and prefers to watch reruns of Formula One in his apartment. Which is fair enough.
None of us are religious.
The upshot of this is that every Christmas is spent alone with my mother watching TV, who as the day goes on gets progressively more sad (and drunk) and melancholic for happier years gone by. I’ve come to dread Christmas and I suffer a bad bout of depression every year - I just can’t suffer it. It’s hard to explain without sounding self pitying but even talking about Christmas, or my plans for it, has reduced me to tears many times. I know my mother has given me everything alone her whole life, but the whole festive season is just tearstained and sad. Most years we don’t even decorate, or have Christmas dinner, we just hole ourselves up and wait it out really. In recent years I’ve suggested we both volunteer at soup kitchens or something on Christmas Day, but she’s always point blank refused.
Today my boyfriend (23M) invited me to spend Christmas with his family and family friends on an island off the coast of the mainland. He has three brothers, a mum and dad, and their friends are going too. They play board games, watch Christmas films, have Christmas dinner, etc. I was immediately excited and suddenly stopped dreading Christmas. It sounded fun.
But my mother has not been extended an invite. Which means I’d leave her behind alone. She’s furious at the idea, adamant I must stay here with her and watch TV.
So...WIBTA if I go?",71,274,0.95

1363,Update,"This is the original post: /r/AmItheAsshole/comments/dcvwmo/aita_for_continuing_to_call_my_teacher_by_her/

I first want to thank everybody who commented on my post. It honestly helped me so much and without it I don’t know if I’d end up in this position.

So I went up to my parents and asked them for the millionth time if they could come with me to talk to my principal. They of course said no. I’m kind of ashamed to say this but some tears were shed when they said this. Afterwards my dad came up to me and told me that he’d come to me if it meant so much. However he told me to go up to my teacher just one last time and if it didn’t work he’d definitely accompany me to the principals office.

So I went to my teacher. I already knew how everything was going to go out so I didn’t have any hope. I told her that I don’t appreciate her making fun of my name and if she continues I would continue to call her by her first name ( minus the Mrs.). She told me that I was a very disrespectful child and that she could do whatever she wanted and that she was fair. I told her that many people don’t think she’s fair and in return she just looked confused. I handed her my phone with reddit on it and had her read the comments ( luckily she’s my English teacher). Her face went from nothing to just sadness. I swear it was so weird. It’s like a realization hit her because she just changed everything.

She apologized to me and told me that my name for her was associated with someone else in her life who affected her a lot. And saying my name just gets her bad memories I guess? She told me that she was caught up and just kept apologizing. At this point I kinda felt guilty because I never took this thought into consideration.

She told me she’d try to say my name ( and won’t cross it out of tests anymore) but it might take time, and that in the meantime I can still call her by her first name. ( All my classmates are jealous because I’m the only person allowed lol)

We’ve talked about the past detentions she’s given me and she said she’ll talk to the principal about it and will try to get them removed.

Honestly this isn’t how I thought things were going to turn out. And I’m pretty sure you guys wanted some epic revenge like her getting fired or something, but all we have is a happy ending.",1087,41743,0.89

Me and my wife recently got married. We are from different countries, and currently we are living and got married in her home country. 

My parents came for the wedding and decided to stay for a month, given that it’s the first time out of the country for them and we see each other about once a year since I moved here.

In the first week of them staying here, they stayed in an Airbnb provided and paid by my mother-in-law, and then they were at our apartment during our honeymoon, with the idea of them booking an Airbnb for themselves when we got back.

My mom is a sweetheart but a bit anxious and invasive, and I’ve never had a good relationship with my dad, he can be quite stressful, overwhelming and intense. He dealt with depression but is doing better know, he is controlling and is having some problems with understanding that I’m not living with him anymore.

They’ve been at our house for 5 days and they don’t seem to have any intention of booking accommodations for themselves. They’ve become controlling of the way that we live in our house and my wife and I are starting to feel stressed about this, we have been dealing with my parents problems, tensions between them and they seem to be completely oblivious of them intruding in our home.

I took my sister to some local event for pumpkin carving tutorials or some shit like that (I don't really know, my mom just asked me to take her to it).

The event required that you bring your own pumpkin, so I bought 2 pumpkins, one for her to practise, and one for the real deal.

When we got there, it was just my sister and I, but their was a whole group of kids and adults who seemed to be from the same group judging by how much they were talking, their was a total of 4-5 children consisting of boys and girls (around 15)

We got the tools and started working on the pumpkins, once we finished we set it on the table and put a candle in it to take some pictures, I left to go to the washroom and I came back to my sister just sitting in front of one of her pumpkins completely burnt and cut up.

I asked her what happened and she told me that when she wasnt looking the kids took her pumpkin and gave it back destroyed, I saw the other families kids laughing their asses off.

The family had about 5 or 6 pumpkins they were carving, and they set aside a bunch of them on the same table we left ours on. I looked for their 2 best looking pumpkins, and carved a fat hole where the faces used to be, and filled it with pumpkin seeds and glitter, I set their pumpkins back on the table. I sat back down and one of the adults demanded that I give back a pumpkin for the ones I destroyed, I told him no and showed him what his group did to one of mine, he said that I destroyed two which is unfair, even the person running the event said for me to give one back.

1369,Asshole,"I know how the title sounds, but try to imagine being around someone who never even tells little white lies that every other person routinely does. He's a great guy, I love him to bits and he doesn't have a malicious bone in his body but he prioritizes being honest above everything. He's not one of those ""brutal honesty"" people, and he doesn't give his own opinion without it being solicited and pass it off as just being honest, but he will tell the truth without sugarcoating it as well.

Examples would be when a mutual friend who is *extremely* obese was upset about not being able to find a partner and asked us why he wasn't having success. My boyfriend asked him if he actually wanted his opinion, and when our friend said yes my boyfriend said ""because you're obese, you don't take care of your health and people don't see that as an attractive quality in a partner."" I know he was trying to help and actually really likes this friend but holy shit. 

Other times, I've bought him gifts for birthdays or christmas and he's said ""I appreciate the time you put into choosing this for me, but it's not really something I'd enjoy. I'd rather you return it so you don't waste your money"" or he'll sometimes stop eating when I cook something. I'll ask ""Not feeling well?"" and he'll say ""I feel alright, I just don't like this but thank you for cooking tonight."" Same deal if I cut my hair or get a new outfit. He'll always tell me I look beautiful, but if I ask him what he really thinks he'll be 100% honest as in ""it makes you look like you have a muffin top"" or ""I think that style ages you"" if he doesn't like it. 

This came to a head recently when I brought him to a party with people from my work. We were mingling and my token nosy coworker started to chat him up. It was going well and he was entirely polite to her, until she started oversharing stories about her upbringing despite us not reciprocating and then said ""ok, your turn!"" to him. He said ""No thank you."" She said ""Was your childhood really that boring!?"" at which point he says ""I wouldn't say so. I just find the question to be extremely invasive and I don't feel like sharing that information with you, I've just met you and I'm not sure why you'd share what you've shared with me."" I pulled him away after that and scolded him.

I really do appreciate the fact that I can trust he'll always be honest with me and I don't need to worry about hidden feelings. And he's never cruel in his honesty and only speaks up when directly asked or put on the spot like at the party. But at the same time I'm used to literally everyone else telling white lies. Just saying ""thanks"" for small gifts and pretending they like it, or saying ""yeah, I had a big snack earlier"" when they don't eat a meal you made or even telling small lies or at least hiding the truth to annoying people in social situations for the sake of keeping the peace.

My son has zero mental disabilities. I was very uncomfortable with this relationship because of the huge difference in mental capabilities. My husband felt the same but not as strongly. 

However, literally everyone in the group has been thrilled about this ""romance"". Especially the girl's parents. They are talking about the two getting married for heaven's sake.

I thought that I'd just wait it out and have our son realize on his own that he cannot have a meaningful relationship with this girl.

But it's been 5 months and it's only getting worse.

I ended up putting my foot down and informed both my son and the girls parents that this relationship was completely inappropriate. Especially since my son has now started being hit by the girl during her tics and he is physically unable to defend himself. My husband supported me in this.

We have become enemy number one ever since. The parents have attacked us through texts and have turned everyone in the friends group against us.

There is an individual she brings over that I've personally caught stealing a pair of glasses I bought on another occasion. He said he was drunk and thought they were his. The funny thing is, those glasses were in my bedroom. Since we don't have any hard proof I decided to put up those cameras.

Today, she said she feels violated and I need to take the cameras down. The cameras are placed in the common areas (living room, kitchen) and in my office. I told her that it would be silly not to own these cameras and what if we get robbed, there needs to be something we can review.

I didn't think I needed to consult her considering the situation and it just felt like something we'd rather have than not have. It's been brought up in the past that we were going to install them, we didn't get around to doing so until now. Am I the asshole?

Update: she went on a rampage and has been arguing about how we think she's a thief.  She's moving out end of the month.  All worked itself out.  Thanks for everyone's input.

Update #2: the conversations have gone to a whole new level of crazy.  She's claiming I'm trying to record her naked around the house.

To be honest, it didn’t really hit me emotionally at the time because I hadn’t thought of him as my father in decades and hadn’t spoken to him.

My wife and kids knew the story of my father. I told my wife first, then told my kids. My son asked questions and I answered what I could.

She is very very much into the Instagram life (actually she has many followers and goes a lot on brand endorsed trips etc) and unfortunately she has a Great Dane that is little more than a prop for her instagram pictures. 

Joanne has a personal assistant who usually takes care of the dog, but she is *very badly* socialized. My step daughter is in love with this dog and doesn’t train it/ discipline it whatsoever. I understand puppy love, but Joanne is on another planet where this dog is concerned- to give you an idea, it chewed through $4500 of upholstery in my stepdaughters car and she laughed it off. And she is VERY careful with her belongings but because it was her dog it was forgiven straight away.  

My husbands cousin passed away 4 years ago from an aggressive cancer that left her gone a week after her diagnosis. My husband and his cousin were close growing up, like siblings, and we immediately offered to adopt her daughter out of love and desire to keep our niece close to us. She is 15 years old and her name is Charlie. 

Jo and Charlie are *so unbelievably* close, except for where the dog is concerned. For whatever reason, the dog *hates* my 15 y/o and growls, stops her from leaving or entering rooms, follows her from room to room growing etc. 

Jo thinks it’s super cute and funny, despite her father telling her *many many times* that it’s an accident waiting to happen and that she needs to discipline her dog. Charlie is terrified of dogs and reacts negatively too, which obviously sets off the dog even more but she’s a kid and is a jumpy kid at that- the onus is on Jo to calm her dog down. 

Jo wants to move in to our place from now- January because she is massively remodelling her home and expanding. She’s offered us a symbolic (ridiculous) amount of $ to allow her to live with us, which is silly because she’s our daughter and she’s always welcome, but I told her it couldn’t be a possibility UNLESS she takes her dog to obedience classes because the dog is one day going to lunge at Charlie and that’s just unacceptable. 

She said she hasn’t got time to go to obedience classes, and asked if we couldn’t just take the dog and go ourselves. I’m considering it, but my husband thinks that we should tell her she can’t stay unless she makes the time for these classes.

1387,Not the A-hole,"I live on the 3rd floor of an apartment building. Our next door neighbors I feel like don't have many resources. They seem to sometimes baby sit a variety of kids, as well as having their own. For months, they've let these kids, which range from probably 12 months to 4 be out on their porch unsupervised. From the third floor porch, these kids will throw various toys and books off the porch. This has been happening for months. Once they dumped all of the insides of a bean bag chair off of the porch and the pellets are still in the mulch. 

The adults in the apartment never clean up the toys that are thrown. Often times they are soaked through past saving (if it's a book, for example.) Maintenance eventually throws the stuff away. 

I don't particularly like these neighbors, but I have a lot of empathy for them, because again, they seem like they don't really have the resources (both in tangible and non-tangible ways) to fully watch the kids in their home. 

Yesterday as I was taking out the trash, I saw that five stuffed animals had been thrown into the mulch, but one was Dreamy Hugginz. 

Dreamy Hugginz is the plush dog that is my kid's most beloved stuffed animal. This was in fact not our Dreamy, but a second Dreamy (Dreamy II). 

I told my husband that if Dreamy II was still on the ground in the morning, that I was rescuing him. The company that makes this dog no longer seems to, and it would be useful to have a second.

Lo and behold, this morning, Dreamy II was still in the mulch. I plucked him up and gave him a warm bath before work. 

I have never touched any of the various toys that have been thrown over the porch edge. But it felt wild to me to not take this very specific dog that we would have a lot of use for. Especially since I am certain it would otherwise be thrown away. 

My husband thinks we should ""return"" Dreamy II to the apartment. I've knocked on their door before, and they haven't answered. Also, it seems weird to me to return this one stuffed animal that is precious to me, but probably not to them, but not the other four. Also, I feel like this would set a weird toy precedent since, again, this has been going on for months. 

Tl;dr AITA for taking a stuffed animal from the ground that I feel certain would otherwise be thrown out?",28,29,0.87

1389,Asshole,"This one is a little old (couple months) but a post on here reminded me of it. I feel like I'm in the right but she broke up with me over it so still feel like I should check.

My (ex) girlfriend (girlfriend at the time obviously) and I had been together about 18 months, give or take.

She got a call from her step mother a week before we broke up saying her father was in hospital. He'd had cancer and hadn't told her, and now he was in his final days. My girlfriend didn't want to go see him. I asked why and she said that they didn't have that kind of relationship and hadn't spoken in many years. She also said that he only ever contacted her when he wanted something, and she knew what he wanted and wasn't about to give it to him. I asked what and she said it wasn't anything important and to just drop it.

The step mother had called on the shared landline phone (we lived together at this time) so I called the step mother back, introduced myself, and arranged to go see my girlfriend's father. I went and saw him and when I did I asked for permission to propose. He said I could have it if I got her to go and see him. I tried to get her to go see him, and when she asked why it was so important to me I told her about the conversation with her father. I thought she'd be happy (as happy as she could in the circumstances) considering this was the first time I'd indicated I was seriously thinking about proposing, and that I was trying to do things the right way.

She immediately told me to go fuck myself and broke up with me on the spot. I heard from a mutual friend that her father passed about a week after that. I tried to get in touch to offer my condolences, but she's blocked me.

I'm a traditional guy, I strongly believe in the importance of asking the parents for permission, but as my girlfriend's mother had passed away when she was in her late teens and I'd never met her father I wasn't sure if it was going to be possible, and then when she told me her dad was in hospital I realised time was of the essence. It was important to me that I asked for her father's permission before doing anything and I would have felt conflicted about proposing without asking him first.

Like I said it's been a few weeks but it's still bugging me. A bunch of our mutual ""friends"" have cut contact with me and everyone seems to be on her side, but no one seems to understand why it was so important to me. AITA?

&#x200B;

edit - I don't think she's his ""property"" or anything like that, I just think there's a right and wrong way of going about things. I'd probably have proposed even if he said no, but as far as I'm concerned to not at least ask would be disrespectful to the man that raised her. I felt I had to ask because my parents did the same thing (both sets, mum asked my paternal grandparents and dad asked my maternal grandparents) I was raised to respect my parents, and by extension respect my elders. The step mother was there the whole time I spoke to the dad (over an hour) and she agreed with him that they'd give permission after they saw her. They said they wanted to ask her herself if she wanted to marry me.",825,1666,0.86
1390,Not the A-hole,"I \[23M\] am getting married next summer and my fiancee \[22F\] and I are still in the planning stages of our wedding - including still divvying out roles for our family/friends. My cousin Meagan has had 2 kids since getting married a few years ago, Lily and Michael. Given that they are the youngest family members out of both my fiancee's family and mine, we were talking about our wedding during a family BBQ and how the guest list was coming along. I let them know that it's slowly but surely coming together and in that moment talked about possibly having Michael be our ring bearer and Lily be our flower girl. Everyone in our family thought this would be a fun/cute idea . . .

 . . . Everyone except my Aunt Bri and her 12 year old son (my cousin) Andrew. Andrew is a brat; he is a really an only child despite having two older siblings and always throws fits whenever he doesn't get his way - like dragging himself on the ground, hiding/running away, ignoring people, and pouting/crying. My Aunt Bri and Uncle Ken hardly do anything to address these fits other than threatening to go home. They don't give a shit about what kind of video games he plays, how he talks back to them or the rest of our family (light cursing and addressing family by first name rather than Aunt \[My mom's name\] or Grandma \[My Grandma's name\]). There is no way around this, kid is just a pain in the ass. He was born well after my cousin Meagan and her older brother Patrick were (age difference of at least 12+ years between them) and so has sort of always gotten his way growing up with virtually no siblings in the picture. 

Later during my family visit, my  grandma pulled me aside and asked if I had any plans to include Andrew in our wedding in anyway. I asked why. My grandma then mentioned that I made my Aunt/Uncle/Andrew a little upset by offering my cousins toddlers roles in the wedding but not offering Andrew a special role in the wedding as a little groomsmen or something else and that I should really ask him/do something special for him like get him a toy while asking.

I turned to my Grandma and my mom - who was also in on the conversation - and I said ""No. I honestly don't think Andrew deserves any kind of special role. Kid is a spoiled brat to be honest and I just can't see him not throwing some kind of fit or crying about something on the day of our wedding."" My mom agreed with me as she has always felt the same way about her nephew and like me, felt that he would not be respectful/behaved and would try to make it about him - the way he always tries to. My grandma, however, slightly disagreed and said that I should really consider it and that ""he is family.""

TL;DR  My aunt and uncle are upset with me for not asking my 12 yo cousin to be a groomsmen/have some special role in my wedding next year despite my cousin being a brat and my fiancee and I asking my other cousin to have her 2 toddlers as our flower girl and ring bearer",141,418,0.95

1393,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I had a daughter recently. We live near my MIL and no other family, so when my wife decided she needs some time away from the baby while I'm at work on occasion (I totally agree) that the natural solution is for her mother to watch her. My MIL is thrilled about this idea.

My MIL has been wonderful to me, and is great with our daughter (under our supervision). The problem is that when we first started dating, I discovered that MIL had spent years in prison for neglecting my wife's terminally ill father causing him to suffer a drawn out, needlessly painful death. I didn't say anything to my wife, assuming that one day she would tell me. She didn't. Up until recently, I decided I wouldn't say anything as I didn't want to tell my wife I had hid this for so long, or lie to her and pretend I just found out. 

My wife became frustrated with me not giving her a reason why it wasn't okay for her MIL to watch our baby, and no matter what excuse I came up with, she kept persisting. I finally broke and told her what I knew. 

My wife was very upset and angry I hid this from her. According to her, the situation was that her mother was taking care of her father, his needs started escalating beyond what she could meet or receive help with, and it spiraled out of control. My wife has forgiven her mother and says MIL is very apologetic and has paid more than enough already. She thinks I'm the AH for hiding what I knew, refusing to let MIL watch daughter over ""unfortunate circumstances"" that happened years ago, and ""cruelly depriving our daughter of a relationship with her only grandparent"". 

I think the incident shows a serious lapse in judgment, and I think my wife is the AH for refusing to recognize the seriousness of MIL's crime, that having her watch our daughter could put her in danger, and that there are worthy alternatives, like a nanny or one of our friends. AITA?

Edit to add comment to OP: That is what my wife has said. She says that his needs just escalated beyond what MIL could provide and she was unable to find resources to help. It started with minor things, but it spiraled out of control from there, and MIL didn't get help until far too late. He was found dehydrated, emaciated, covered in bedsores and human waste, etc., and he was without his medications for weeks. After being charged, MIL then fled and evaded arrest. I think that played a role in her sentence.",417,1238,0.97
1394,Asshole,"Every morning during the week, I drop my daughter off for pre-school.  She's 4 now, and has been going since she was 3.  The parking lot can get pretty crowded with parents dropping kids off.  Last year, this wasn't a problem at all, but this year there seem to be a bunch of parents who don't think that parking spaces apply to them and have started just parking at the end of a row where there are no parking spaces.  Normally, I would just be annoyed and wouldn't think much about it, except that this is not a huge parking lot, and when they do this, it blocks traffic flow and makes it hard for people to maneuver around the parking lot.

In addition, when they park at the end of the row, it makes it very hard to back out of the parking spaces along the side of the parking lot because they effectively cut off the extra space that would be used to back out of the spot.  This is difficult for me because I drive an F150 with a larger than normal turning radius.  I have nearly backed into both other cars and other people trying to pass by because there isn't enough room to back out when others park at the end of the row.

Now here's the cherry on top of all this: *there are a good 10 to 15 empty parking spots in the back*.  Yes, totally empty.  These people are parking at the end of the row so they don't have to walk the extra two car lengths.  It puts them 7 seconds closer to the door.  That's it.

I've talked to the administration, and they just shrug at me and say there's nothing they can do.  The best I got today was that they would ""send out an email"".

I get that this is kind of a petty thing, and I should probably just shrug it off, but oh my god does this grind my gears.

So my question:  if I say F it and just park my F150 at the end of the row taking up the extra 4-6 imaginary spaces there, will I be the asshole?

&#x200B;

Edit for clarification:  I do park at the back.  Sometimes that's the only option as I run the slalom of parking rows.  But sometimes I park on the edge towards the back, in what appears to be a normal parking spot, and come out 10 mins later to see someone has double parked behind me at the end of the row instead of parking in the back.  

And yes, I understand I drive a truck.  Parking is not a problem when people park in actual parking spaces, like I do.",48,62,0.8

1399,Asshole,"So I work a corporate office as a Desktop Technician. Recently, I've been moved to a Windows 10 Project, which involves upgrading the building's to Windows 10. As the technicians, we usually take care of intaking the machines and working on them, while a separate team of champions sets up their appointments and orders the specs needed for their upgrade. Unless they are out-of-warranty devices, the upgrades are done in-place, and the devices are wiped before Windows 10 is installed on them, so we have to do an evaluation with each user to make sure they've backed up their user data so they can still work afterword. This is all included in the email the champions send out before the appointment.


I was doing the front desk at the Command Center that day, basically greeting whoever came in and assigning them to a tech for evaluation. So this woman, let's call her Betsy, comes into the HUB and checks in at the front desk. I check her in for her appointment and grab an intake sheet in the folder next to me. She gets a puzzled look on her face and asks what it is. I inform her that it is an intake sheet and that she can bring it over to the tech for her evaluation and she should be all set. Suddenly, she gets pissy and starts badgering me, saying ""Are you serious? Is this necessary?"" etc. All the while, I attempt to reassure her, saying ""Betsy, we deeply apologize that you weren't informed earlier. As long you don't have too much data on your machine, it shouldn't be any longer 3 minutes. We can also reschedule you for another time if you'd like"". That gets her to finally sit down with a tech (call him Brian), but not before mumbling her entire way there.


She's obviously very annoyed during the whole thing and not cooperating at all. He had to ask her multiple times if she could log into her laptop, as she's busy complaining over the phone, and when Brian attempt to discuss the data saved in her laptop, she gives very vague answers, and all the while she just wants to know when she can go. Continuing to get nowhere, I had to step in to speed up the process. Finally, Brian lets her go and she gives a sarcastic ""thanks"" and begins to walk out the door. She's still mumbling, but since she's walking by me, I can hear what she's saying, and I get a loud and clear ""...Bitch is gonna make me miss my fucking train... 2 minutes...""


I stopped her and kept her there for at least a good 5 minutes, ripping her apart, basically stating that she was out of line, and that all the information for the evaluation was on her confirmation email,that we would've understood if you had to be in a rush and that she had the option to reschedule and prepare, but that she chose to go through with and and make Brian's job difficult. She didn't say anything and just walked out. Judging by what she said, I definitely made her miss that train. Brian thanked me, but apparently some coworkers think I was a bit unprofessional and should've reported her quietly.

1401,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway in case I'm wrong and my main account gets [destroyed.So](https://destroyed.So) I work for a tech startup in London. Cool, dog friendly office, relaxed dress code, young and energetic team and we all get along really well.

I have fantastic relationships with pretty much everyone and am known around the office. A lot of the time I have coworkers over weekends for poker night for the lads, trips out etc.

A few weeks ago I was walking to a station and I saw a colleague. We don't speak much usually as she is fairly new and in the exact opposite department as me but I'm outgoing so I thought I'd say hi.

I walk over and  say 'hi'. She looks at me then just turns and ignores me. I think maybe she didn't recognise me so I said 'Hey \*her name\* its me, \*my name\* from \*our office\*!'.

At this point, a few people on the platform are looking at me as if there may be an issue or maybe I was bothering her. She turns around and looks right at me again, and I can tell she notices me and knows who I am but she just frowns, rolls her eyes, stick in her headphones and moves away from me. I found this hugely embarrassing. I thought I may have offended her at work somehow or maybe she just didn't want to be friendly outside the office which I though was weird, but her choice.

The next Monday, I was having lunch with someone from her department and she joins. I thought this was odd but I didn't leave, just directed my conversation to the other colleague until I finished eating and left. Since this incident I've been treating her with complete and utter professionalism at work and respect but I don't talk to/interact with her unless I ABSOLUTELY have to for work (super rare) or she asks me a direct question etc. (she says 'Hi' and of course I'll reply but I don't instigate)

Over the last weekend had a small gathering at my place where I invited about half the office.

This Monday, my manager pulled me aside and said that she had complained to HR that I was being 'hostile' and whilst she (my manager) hadn't noticed anything, the two of us and our managers still had to sit down with HR to 'mediate'. During the session, she said: I was chatty with everyone but her, I don't start non-work conversations with her, and I didn't invite her to my 'party' despite the fact others from her department had attended.

I was shocked and said I didn't think she wanted to be friends after what happened on the tube. She apparently hadn't mentioned this, I gave my explanation. Afterwards, my manager asked if it was true and the colleague said it was unfair for em to 'punish her for being a little moody one time'. That is not what I'm doing. I just have no interest in a friendship with her.

My manager would love it if we 'buried the hatchet'. To me there's nothing to bury, I don't want to be friends with her but I will continue to be polite. Her manager thinks I'm TA because: she's new and I am a social hub at work and being 'shunned' by me will make it harder for her to gain acceptance.

1402,Not the A-hole,"I have a pretty big family, but we’re all pretty close. Every year, all my cousins in on the east coast and I take a trip somewhere together to have some quality bonding time – there’s usually eight of us that go on this trip. This year, I told everyone I wanted to make a video to commemorate our time together. This is something that I’ve done on other trips with my friends (but not my family) and it’s a fun way to remember the trip overall. I just take small videos through the trip, then put them together with a song on in the background afterward. No one really cared about this, except my sister.  
  
My sister is very much anti social media and although she has some accounts, she rarely if ever looks at them, and never uploads anything. She doesn’t enjoy taking pictures either. She expressed that she did NOT want to be a part of the video, did not give me permission to include her in the video, and anytime she caught me recording she would repeat “I do not consent to this, I do not consent to this” until I put my phone down. She would go on a rant about how everyone except her is a slave to their phones at least twice a day, and toward the end I just stopped recording because it was not worth her whining. I also wanna clarify, I usually take these videos in 5-15 second bursts. I was not constantly recording things, and instead spending the majority of my time catching up with everyone. Just occasionally, I would take out my phone to catch a funny moment or a nice view (we stayed in an area with a lot of good hiking trails this time around).  
  
I made sure to follow my sister’s instructions when editing the video, taking out any parts that had her featured in any way. A week after the trip we had a family gathering planned, where I played the video and everyone really enjoyed it. All our parents were also present and they had a blast seeing what we had been up to on our trip, as we are usually pretty vague about activities. I’ve been encouraged to continue the video process for our next cousins trip too.  
  
My sister, however, was another story. She was fuming mad, and spent a good amount of time yelling at me about how incredibly rude and offensive it was that she was not included in the video. The editing made it seem like she was not even on the trip and she thought I was punishing her by not including her. I told her she specifically asked – multiple times a day – to NOT be included in the video. All my cousins on the trip backed me up on this, but some of my aunts and uncles were on my sister’s side. My parents know exactly what my sister is like about social media (a big argument for why she did not want to be in the video was that we were gonna post it on social media and strangers would see her in it) and have taken my side. My sister is now calling and texting extended family and saying I’m a horrible and mean person who doesn’t love her, and is refusing to talk to me. I don’t want to apologize for this because in my eyes, I was doing exactly what she told me to. So, AITA?",43,181,0.93
1403,Everyone Sucks,"Hi there! First post. English is my second language.

My [26F] sister [32F] lives separately from our family and has been for about five years. We are quite close and see each other every weekend if we can (work schedules sometimes make it difficult).

Ever since my sister moved out, she never really wanted to give me a set of keys to her apartment. I live with our mum and she has keys to our house. It is not within our family's habit to show up unannounced or to go snooping through each other's belongings. Privacy has always been a huge thing in our family. I normally wouldn't keep it against my sister - not having a set of keys - but there are two problems.

1. She invites me over often;

2. She is chronically late.

And I don't mean 5 minutes late. I'm talking 30 minutes late. We would talk about meeting at 5:20 pm at her place for a girl's night and she'd be there by 5:50. I'd say I can deal with that on an average day but last time... uhhh... let's say I needed to use the bathroom. I needed to just let my guts go wild because clearly i ate something bad for lunch.

And she wasn't there by the time I was.

I text her frantically asking if she has a spare hidden anywhere and she said no. I was panicking because I'd be standing with shit-stained pants if this situation didn't get resolved. I kept texting her to hurry and come home to let me in to goddamn SHIT IN A TOILET and not into my pants while running up and down her street trying to find a place with a restroom. And then she texted me, go to a mall. The mall is a 30 minute walk (or a 15 minute run but who can run at that point).

Luckily, I found a Thai massage parlor whose ladies allowed me to use their in-parlor facility. I came out looking sick and they even offered me tea ;;A;; I've gone twice to get massage there after that as gratitude.

Needless to say, by the time my sister was actually home, I was mad. It was like six weeks ago and I've refused to go to her place UNLESS she texts me she's already there. It takes about 30 minutes by car for me to get to her.

My sister thinks I'm an asshole for overreacting and refusing to come over in this way. I've been angry about that and recently learned that her BF, who doesn't even live with her as of now, has a set of keys and has had it since 2nd month of their dating.

1405,No A-holes here,"So I’m a university student, and within my close friend group (of like, 10 people) 5 of us have all been sharing a 5 person apartment since close to the start of school (we’re 4th years). We have a pretty good thing going and definitely want to keep it going if we can. Last year, two other people in this friend group were sharing a 2 person place; let’s call them A and B. 

Here’s the issue: for this coming school term (our school is weird, we’re starting in January),  we all have to find new places, and A is planning on getting a place with his gf, leaving B with no one to live with. Theoretically, A and B and A’s gf could all live together, but that would be a little weird and definitely not something any of them want; and the rest of the people in the friend group aren’t able to live with B for various reasons.

So, it turns out when A made this decision, both he and B thought that myself and my roommates were happy to split up in order to not leave B by himself (finding a 6 person place is hard) — this was probably a misunderstanding, as none of us have any memory of agreeing to that. We’d been planning on finding another 5 person place (though we’re all happy to include him if we can find a 6 person place).

Being confronted with this, myself and my roommates talked it out and decided that if we can’t find a 6 person place we’d just have to leave B to figure out his own rooming situation and hopefully find some other not completely random people to live with. When we told him about this, he was (understandably) upset.

1407,Not the A-hole,"I'll keep this short. Yesterday I went to the eye doctor for irritated eyes after weeks of not being able to comfortably wear contacts. I was seen 30 minutes late, very clearly the last appointment of the day. The doctor looks at my eyes for a minute and a half and says, ""You have a chronic condition, you'll take 3 drops a day for 3 weeks then you'll need artificial tears every two hours for the rest of your life."" After asking for clarity on the condition, she just keeps explaining how many drops I need to take. As she's wrapping up and v obviously rushing me out, I ask for the name again because she sped through the explanation by saying ""They really should have a name for this 'chronic condition' for clarity rather than telling a patient they have *something* and will have it forever."" Her response is, ""Yea it's called allergic conjunctivitis, google it"" and leaves. I'm absolutely fucking shocked so I had to step outside for a minute to process that I have a chronic condition and was told by a medical professional to google it without explaining possible causes or long term effects. I go back inside maybe 2 minutes later to get my doctors notes so I know exactly what to google and ask to speak with her one more time and was told that she'd left. She's the only doctor in the office W-F and she'd just finish a patient with screwed up insurance and language barriers so I'm sure she had a long day but who tf tells a patient they have a chronic condition and to google it?

Because of the professionalism, or lack thereof, of that office, I know for a fact her other patients struggle as far as income/insurance is concerned. Also, this wasn't a validation post, in the end, while she only did the bare minimum, she at least provided a treatment so technically she did do her job (though again, a lot of you agree the treatment she provided doesn't sound like treatment for allergic conjunctivitis).",181,1172,0.96

I called out ""Hey, walk on the left, stand on the right, let's get this moving!"" After like 10 seconds, no one was moving so I started walking up the middle of the escalator (I wasn't late but I was tired of this kind of thing happening).

He works hard, takes care of himself and is just generally nice, he never acts superior to me because he's older.

I've told Jess all of this but she refuses to believe me. She will not stop shit talking Carl and our relationship. I've asked her to stop politely, I said you don't even need to approve of it, just stop saying negative things, but she keeps insisting she's so worried for me she can't drop it. 

So I told her if she can't support me or at the very least can't just not saying anything at all then I don't want to spend time with her anymore. She now thinks Carl has brainwashed me to isolate me from my friends but it's her attitude that's done it.

Carl says he supports me either way, obviously he doesn't like her saying bad things about him but he says he knows that friends can sometimes go overboard when they're trying to look out for you.

My fiancee's family is Jewish and I am an atheist (to be clear I am not militant atheist or anything, the only way people know I am one is if they directly ask me and I like to think I am considerate of people's beliefs). Her brother's now wife was asked to convert from Christian to Jew and when she didn't my fiancee's family did not treat her the best. My fiancee does not care if I convert or not. To me converting means nothing and I would basically be doing it in name alone just to make our lives easier. Anyway this came up when I was talking to a friend who is Jewish but not very religious if that matters.

Now on to the part where I may be the asshole.

I told my friend about me converting and he expressed his surprise as I have never been religious. He was shocked that I would be willing to change my world view like that for my fiancee's family. I explained to him that I was just doing it in name to make my life with my in laws easier and, to me, it would be no different than if he told me he was converting to be a unicorn as his daughter is around that age where she is into that and it would make her happy. He said it is not the same and what I said was insensitive and offensive. AITA?

I only had a couple beers because I’ve never been a heavy drinker, especially around people I don’t know well. 

The night is winding down and one of the drunkest guys there starts talking about heading home and I realize he’s planning to drive. It’s a pretty big club we were in so there weren’t any staff to notice this going on or take his keys and I felt it was my responsibility as one of the only sober people witnessing the situation to make sure it didn’t happen. 

(I wasn’t counting how many drinks this particular guy had but he was barely stringing a sentence together and tripping over his own feet.) 

Everyone was so drunk and the one person I knew well from the original group (my friend) had gone home at this point. So I tried to find someone to leave his keys with but when I asked the most sober seeming one he kept kind of giggling? It made me very suspicious he planned to just hand the keys over to the drunk buddy.  

So finally I had to go and relieve my babysitter, I could no longer stay. I considered leaving the keys with the establishment but I figured sketchy club, I don’t know anyone, wouldn’t be hard for them to steal or sell the car and deny I ever gave them the keys. 

So I told them “I need to leave and I’m keeping these. Do you want me to drive you home?” The response they gave wasn’t totally coherent but could best be summarized as “fuck off, the night is young.” 

So I drove home. 

Fast forward to today and I’m flooded with messages saying I’m an asshole for taking the keys and not arranging a ride home for the car owner.

As my girl and I were leaving her son came over and was pushing my girl for no reason, she was across the room and called to him but he kept going, so I reached over and gently took his arm and separated the kids and redirected him to his mum. 
I didn't tell him off, didn't use any force aside from holding his arm. 

I thought that was done and dusted but after I leave I got a message from her basically saying ""don't grab my kid, people should never lay hand on anyone else's kid unless their in danger"". She wasn't rude but she made it sound like I'd assaulted him 

We do have very different parenting styles, I'm more relaxed but still firm on safety and welcome other people helping keep my kids in line, shes very much a perfectionist when it comes to her only child and has never let anyone even babysit. 

So AITA for stopping her child pushing mine when he didn't respond to his mother telling him off?

Edit: I've just looked back at the messages and she feels I should have removed my child rather than touching hers, which I feel since my child wasn't doing anything is punishing the wrong kid.

I guess you could say I have no religion at all. 

I’ve always helped out my family and put them and even others before me most of my life, I basically helped raise my younger sister but a year in a combat zone puts a lot of things into perspective. I hardly ever heard from my family unless they WANTED something from me while over there. I remember breaking down crying to a battle one day because I never heard from my youngest sister (who has a paying job) unless she wanted money sent to her. My mother would bring up how she was excited for me to come back just to help her with her new charity work she does every week.... At that point I woke up and had another thought, “ I’ll just stop giving them so much of me.” And I did just that while still overseas. Any extra help I was giving/offering I no longer did . I was literally given the silent treatment for a few days from mom when I took away Netflix from my sister. 

So I come “home”. The welcome home was just... Awful lol.. I instantly start doing what I need to do to get myself back into working and finding another apartment and out of moms because my family is a “tit for tat” kind of family. I help with housework, do their laundry, clean the kitchen, put gas in the car and fix/provide anything IT related just so I can keep a peace of mind and they don’t start in on me.

So my husband and I made the decision to make then aware of it and they took it from there, we don't know if they brought it up or not but they were very upset to find out she was purposely trying to get pregnant and inevitably need their assistance especially with everything going on with MIL. 

Back to the now: She's pregnant. She told me over facebook messenger by saying, ""hey I want to be honest with you and have to tell you something."" My response to her, ""are you serious.

I miscarried my twins about a month and a half ago and I know she's apologizing because she feels bad that I lost mine and now she's pregnant but I feel like the way she said it is as if she had no idea she was pregnant or trying and the, oh!

I recently graduated from college this year and like many other graduates I’m on my job hunt. 

I’m living at my grandmother’s house with my grandparents, mom, her husband, and my baby sister. 

Edit for clarification: grandparents live majority of the time in another country, so I am usually alone with the baby.

My mom offered to pay my bills and give me some extra cash in exchange for watching my baby sister (3months old) while I get on my feet. I have about $100 in bills a month and she gives me $100 every two weeks for babysitting. So $300 a month total to watch my sister 5 days a week for 8-12 hours.

My mom wakes me anytime from 5-6am and I groggily make my way to her room where I begin taking care of the baby while she does her makeup and gets ready for work.

My mom works odd hours but usually comes home around 3-5pm, 7pm latest. So I have my sister for a long time. I’m basically like a new dad.

I can’t do ANYTHING while caring for my sister. She’s a baby so I don’t blame her for anything but my mom said this arrangement would only be until I found a job. The thing is I feel like I have no time to find a job, I feel kinda stuck.

Sometimes her dad gets home around 7pm and then I have 3-5 hours to myself *maybe*. My mom constantly intrudes into my room and asks me to hold the baby “for a sec” while she does something and it turns into an hour. I’m trying to apply for jobs but I have to write cover letters which can be tedious for each job. The baby also can’t be in my lap while I’m on my computer because she cries and gets bored from lack of movement/stimulation. 

I can’t stay up too late because if I don’t go to bed early enough I won’t be rested the next morning. My mom said weekends would be “my time” but she stills hands me the baby or calls me for help. It’s annoying when I have things to do.

I called her the other day and said something along the lines of, “I think we should talk. I babysit a lot and I feel it isn’t enough money for the time. Can I have more money?” I explained that I help her much more than we arranged originally which I’m glad to help her with, but it’s exhausting for me. 

She then EXPLODES. Saying how family shouldn’t charge family and she’s paying my bills. I then explain that if I wasn’t there to help her she would be paying around $1000 a month for daycare. She told me she couldn’t afford it but I called her out because I manage our family amazon prime account and I see all the stupid stuff she buys. She eventually got heated and said I didn’t have to babysit ever again if my sister was so troublesome. This made me feel bad because I love my sister but I wanted my mom to know how much she really asks of me and how much I help her.

Behold a few hours later she asked me, “so are you watching your sister tomorrow?”

Eventually she caved because her husband also agreed $100 every two weeks was def not enough money for watching a baby.

Unfortunately he is not the most organised of people though, and on two occasions he has messed the dates up and we have had to stay at his parents for a day when coming back from trips. I am not that happy about doing the whole process, mainly because it's a lot of work to get the house ready for guests (3 young kids), and I tend to be the one who does all the cleaning in preparation, in addition to looking after the kids and getting ready to go away.

At the moment Richard is abroad on a business trip, and he has just informed me that he accidentally accepted a booking for this weekend (Saturday to Monday). He has asked if I would be willing to go to a hotel. This is not ideal for a number of reasons. I currently have my mum staying with us. I also leave for a business trip Sunday morning. So I would have to clean the house, pack for a business trip and pack for the children for 2 days, then take all of us (and my mum) to a hotel Saturday. Then I'd have to leave them there with my mum on Sunday and expect her to manage them at a hotel and get them to school Monday morning, before getting to go back to our home and change all the bedding etc. He also offered to send the kids to his mum's for the weekend, but since my mum lives a long way away and sees them infrequently, I don't think this is fair on her.

I have suggested he finds a hotel for them, but he is concerned as it won't have a kitchen etc. I feel bad for the guests as it's not their fault, but WIBTA if I put my foot down and refuse to leave?

We also meal-prep to save money and eat healthy, which means I come up with the recipes beforehand. I search recipes that work for both (he doesn't like particular ingredients and is not much into ""exotic"" dishes, so I have to strike a balance). I also create the shopping lists, we do the shopping together (if he does it, he always forgets something), I do the meal prep and the cooking.

We've got a dishwasher which we load/unload pretty equally, and we take turns taking the trash away.

In return, I kind of expect of him to take care of the cleaning. I clean the kitchen counters and the hob daily after cooking, and I dust, but I expect him to do the vacuuming.

(They're paid pretty well in this country far as I'm aware) She was saying that if medicine was a business they'd be paid much more, and that having to pay for healthcare would give people an incentive to work hard. 

As someone who grew up not very well off, I'm very proud of the free healthcare we have in this country, though I appreciate that it's not perfect, but this woman believes that we're better off without it simply so she can earn more money (in a profession that pays fairly well anyway).

My mother lives far away, so when I go out to visit her every few months I usually go by myself. 

She started developing dementia last year. She’s at the point where she’s forgetting major details but is aware that they’re things she should know, and it’s devastating. 

My wife and I are going out there for her birthday next month and I made a critical error in explaining her dementia. I said:

“Now, she only remembers really important things. So I’m thinking to spare her feelings, you should wear a name tag.” 

I knew as the words were coming out of my mouth they sounded wrong. 

My wife: “Really important? *My name* isn’t really important?” 

I explained by “really important” I meant remembering her own name and to drink from the milk carton, not the bleach bottle. 

But my wife wasn’t buying it and thinks it’s a statement about how important she is to my mother that this information wasn’t important enough for her to retain and that my suggestion was for her to wear a name tag instead of trying to encourage my mother to remember it. 

She says wearing a name tag would be humiliating and she’s probably right but I can’t think of any alternatives. Am I an asshole?",199,473,0.95

I posted this on tifu, and several redditors suggested I should cross-post here. 

My kid is half Chinese and half Caucasian. He was born in Hong Kong. I’ve lived in hk for a really long time, so despite my completely western appearance, I speak Cantonese at a nearly native level. That said, I’ve never had to learn medical terms related to infants, so therefore I was learning a lot on the fly.

Just a few days after my son was born, we had to take him for a regular check-up. At the check-up the did the usual weight/length measurements and asked us about his eating habits.

After a fairly extensive check, the nurse said she was worried about his digestion and asked us to hang around and see a specialist.

After spending about half an hour worrying what may be wrong, the specialist called us in and examined my son.

After a minute, she announced (in Cantonese) that he was ‘very yellow’.

My immediate response was ‘Of course he is, he’s half Chinese.’

Both my wife and the doctor turned to me with horrified looks on their faces. The doctor then clarified that ‘yellow’ in fact meant jaundice. Apparently, it can be fatal and his situation was pretty critical.

Needless to say, the ride to the hospital with my wife was icily quiet.

Tl;dr I confused the Cantonese word for yellow with the word for Jaundice, leading me to make something of a racist joke in front of a doctor treating my newborn son and my wife.",873,3002,0.94

People keep touching me to get my attention or otherwise invading my space. I’m autistic (only my manager knows this) and I wear noise cancelling headphones most of the time.

My manager has worked with autistic people before and will actively walk to where he is in my line of sight and get my attention to talk to me. Unfortunately most people don’t do this.

I’ve got people who poke me, some who put a hand on my shoulder, and some who just sit on my desk really close. I wear noise cancelling headphones so I don’t always hear them approaching. It actually is really startling and throws me off so I can’t really concentrate on what they are saying. I already have auditory processing issues, and it’s worse when I’m startled or interrupted and have to switch concentration tracks.

One of the people who poke me I’ve asked previously to get my attention in another way after he gave me a startle. He waved once and then just went back to poking me or sitting on my desk basically next to my keyboard. I hate being snuck up on and honestly it’s not hard to give me a wave or something first. I’m kind of sick of people thinking it’s okay to touch me.

The person I sit next to and I have a small whiteboard that we write messages on, sometimes for comedy purposes (right now it says “bring food”), sometimes for information (“Sally is away until Tuesday”). WIBTA if I wrote “Please don’t touch me” on it?

Edit: poking is usually not on my shoulder, it’s usually on my back, sometimes the small of my back, and has been with various objects including rulers, drink bottles, and a banana, by the one person I’ve asked not to poke me.

Knocking on my desk doesn’t actually bother me that much so I’ve taken it out of the list.",130,113,0.88

1440,Not the A-hole,"Hi everyone,

My (23F) mom (42) and my step dad split up last December after 17 years of being together, he has been in my life since I was 5 and even though I don't speak with him much anymore (due to him having a new girlfriend and life) I still call him my stepdad.

Anyway, the months leading up to the split my mom got a new job and she loves it. She came over to my apartment one day and told me about how she isn't happy with my step dad and has been seeing someone behind his back. It happened to be her boss and she is still with him today. I have met him a few times, he doesn't seem to care for me much, we have nothing in common and when I try to talk to him he just ignores me, I hate being around him because he knew that my mom was still with my stepdad and didn't care, also cheating in general is horrible.

The real kicker now is that they just got engaged, I didn't find out until my mom posted a photo of it on Facebook. She told everyone else about the engagement and how they are getting married next year except for me (even told the girl at the sushi place we go to before me). They don't live together and are constantly fighting about the most pointless things. He doesn't have a lot of money (mom told me that he doesn't get a paycheck) but somehow buys my mom anything she wants. My mom has always been materialistic and loves attention. I feel like she is in this for all the wrong reasons.

My biggest thing is that I don't want to be part of the wedding, I don't want to my mom to ask me to be in the wedding because I don't enjoy being around her now because she has completely changed, she is not the mom she was before she met him. She never texts me anymore, I can text her and not get a response for a day or so, she only texts me when she needs things (to buy her smokes, bring her things to work etc). I just miss my old mom.

So AITA for not wanting to be in my mom's life as much as I once did and saying no to being in the wedding if she asked?",18,34,0.96
1441,Not the A-hole,"Okay, so this may seem like a rather petty/small situation compared to some of the stuff that you find here, but here goes.

So I'm a big fan of Dungeons and Dragons and other tabletop games, and I've been playing it with the friend of mine who introduced me to the game about a year ago. My friend is a really good GM, but tends to get rather sensitive when it comes to matters of concepts from Germanic folklore, as she comes from a Scandinavian background herself and considers Norse mythology a big part of her cultural heritage. Adaptations that aren't faithful to the original mythology usually don't sit well with her.

It seems as though elves also count as one of those things. Long story short, as a Black person, I tend to make characters that are also Black/dark skinned. She never had much of a problem with any of my Black humans, but for one of her games, I wanted to make a high elf (not Drow), who just happened to be brown, and the first thing GM-Friend said in respnse was:

""Do you have an explanation in mind as to why she's so dark-skinned?""

I didn't really think I need to 'explain' my elf's skin color... But apparently, the idea of a dark-skinned high elf bothered her for some reason. She even suggested that if I wanted to make a Black elf I'd be better of playing a Grugach (A type of savage jungle elf) or just going with a Drow... Which... Again, I didn't want to do 'cause I didn't want to 'cause that just wasn't how I envisioned the character.

Either way, that whole exchange made things extremely awkward, so I just went and made a completely different character instead to avoid any further controversy. It still kind of irks me that this happened though when I look back, even though the situation never got heated or anything.

So, am I an asshole for butchering someone's cultural folklore, or is my friend just being too sensitive about it?",199,87,0.85

1443,Not the A-hole,"Hi, so this will take a bit longer to explain.


My mother founded a firm some 30 years ago with some starting capital from her dad (25k €) for which he retained 40% ownership of the company.


Upon my grandpas death he willed to both my mom and her younger brother 200k each. In additon my uncle was willed the 40% ownership of my moms company (grandpa believed his son would need it a lot more than my mom).  
A year or so after my grandpas death my uncle then talked my mother into giving him half her inheritance (so 100k) since she was doing so well with the company etc and him being the baby brother she eventually caved.


Fast forward 10 years or so and my uncle was now scheming to make a hostile takeover on my mothers firm. In the end things got so bad she had to buy him out of the company for something over 400k.  
Ever since my mother wouldn't speak to her brother again.


In the past 20 years my mother then developed severe alcoholism and after two economy crisises her firm ultimately went bankrupt about 10 years ago. We lost everything. With my dad out of the picture only me and my sister would take care of my mother for the past 10 years, any attempt from us to reconnect with our uncle was met with ridicule.


6 weeks ago my estranged uncle died unexpectedly


2 weeks ago my mother died due to her alcoholism. my sister and I arent inheriting anything since there isnt anything left.


At my moms funeral suddenly my uncles wife and two adult sons showed up. We hadnt seen them in over 15 years so we were happy to finally start a relationship with them.


here comes the weird part:
Today (5 days after my moms funeral) estranged aunt calls my sister and explains her sons both rejected the inheritance from my uncle due to tax reasons expecting the inheritance would go in full to their mother.
Problem is by law she would only receive 50% of the inheritance but the other 50% would go to my mother since she was still alive at the time of my uncles death.  
Since my mom died my sister and I would receive the 50% from my uncles inheritance.


Estranged aunt explained none of this to my sister, instead she was very emotional, explained that her two baby boys made an honest mistake and pleaded with my sister to refuse the inheritance so she would get the full inheritance and keep a roof over her head (what?!)
My sweet sister told her we would refuse the inheritance.


When my sister told me about this I got sceptical of their behaviour. Did they already know about this when they made their heartfelt appearance at my mothers funeral? Was it all fake? Why didnt they talk to me but to my (very sweet) sister about this?


All in all I can't shake the feeling they've been scheming at least since they heard of our moms death to guilt us into fixing their mistake.


I cant ignore the fact that most of their inheritance was founded on close to half a million euros my uncle ""took"" from our mother.

WIBTA if I accepted the inheritance? My sister thinks so.


Edit: I just realized something!  
aunt did say to my sister that she had to name all other possible heirs. for me and my sister she only put down our name and birthday since she claimed to not know our current adresses.  
this is weird since after the funeral she had the phone number of both me and my sister so she could have just asked.  
Leaving it blank also means the state has to determine our adresses so it takes longer for the letter to arrive and she kind of implied we should go to a notary and refuse the inheritance before we even get the letter

Edit2: talked to my father (who knew my late uncle well before everything fell apart) and he said he remembered my grandpa had my uncle set up a last will some 30 years ago with my mother in it. Since my uncle had children since he is sure my uncle updated/changed the will but he cant believe there isnt a last will anymore, especially since my uncle apparently had a stroke three years ago, so his mortality should have been on his mind",73,322,0.96
1444,Not the A-hole,"My (30f) husband (39) had a vasectomy on Monday. I would say it was a pretty standard procedure, but the doctor did have to use some extra lidocaine during the procedure for pain. I've been as supportive as I know how to be. Taking on the 3 year old and 4 month old pretty much exclusively since.  And ice pack duty. 

This is including middle of the night toddler wake ups, and early morning pediatrician runs for an ear infection.  I'm waking up early to do all of the things that normally takes the two of us to do. I'm just a little worn out between work and kids, and not having my partner who is usually pretty equitable. 

The doctor said no lifting 10 pounds within 24 hours (which means both kids have to give daddy space), and light work after 48. They even said he could return to work (he took the week off) after a day off

Well tonight after staying at work late, putting both kids to bed, making a steak dinner, and staying up to watch two episodes of The Office, we squabbled.

 I went to the kitchen to unload and load dishes (usually he loads, but as stated above, I've been doing all of it), but as soon as I started I realized I made a critical error. I forgot to get more baby formula, and we wouldn't have enough for childcare tomorrow. Not good. I had already stayed up too late to spend some quality TV time with my husband, and this was just going to add to my night. 
 
I immediately looked to my husband for help. I haven't wanted to push him, but I was running on empty.  I asked him to do the dishes so I could get the formula. It was almost 10pm (LATE for me on a work night) and I'm already dead on my feet.  He gave me a big nope. He said he was still recovering and couldnt do that. He also couldn't go get the formula because he was on the Norco. I was kind of speechless. I asked again of he could do the dishes. He refused.  
I have a bit of a short temper and can get real bitchy if I'm mad, so I just kind of went silent. I had nothing nice to say so I just gave him the silent treatment. On my way out the door to the car he told me to grab him a Mountain Dew. 

When I returned he insisted that I owed him an apology. I continued ignoring him. If it's possible to see double red, I did it. 

Realistically this Reddit rant is taking longer than it took to go get the formula, but I'm just so damn mad.  I don't want to discount his pain, but he's been up and walking around since I got home, he just hasn't physically done any housework or parenting. I have a hard time believing he's in such pain that he can't take some plates out of the dishwasher, and put some bottles back in. He's about 53 hours post op.

He didn't say he was in agony, just that he was supposed to take it easy. He said he didn't want to hurt himself bending over the dishes.

So Reddit, am I the asshole? Do I owe him an apology? 
 
TLDR: husband 53 hours post op vasectomy refuses to do dishes, leaving me to go out at 10pm to get formula, and then return to finish dishes.",86,58,0.87

She has also made it quite clear clear she doesn’t care if our child says these words. Of course I’ve tried to tell my daughter these words aren’t nice and they need to stop but her response is always “momma says them!” My girlfriends idiotic response is “they are just fucking words!” 

My daughters constant use of these profanities has earned her the title of the bad kid in her class. None of the parents ever want to have play dates because my daughter teaches their children the words. We are constantly having conferences with her teacher who is also fed up with my gf. 

I’m honestly incredibly fed up! I have taken to calling my gf profanities constantly and when she gets upset my response is “they are just fucking words!” My daughter is now calling her mother profanities as well and she has told her to stop.

I’ve only ever spent it with people close to me and currently, the only people close to me that aren’t family are my boyfriend and two other girls, and one of them is out of town.

Something in my gut told me he was planning a surprise party but I couldn’t think of who he would invite? So I will admit I bothered him about it until he told me. I told him I hope it’s just me and him, because I don’t want to spend it with anyone else. 

He broke and told me it was a dinner at a place that I hate (went to it my last birthday and didn’t enjoy it and he knew it) with the people that were honestly just his friends and their girlfriends. I’ve met his friends before, maybe once or twice, but no sober interactions. All while drunk. So I don’t really consider them any close friends that I would want to spend my birthday with.

I immediately got upset and honestly started crying because it was a realization that I don’t have my own friends for him to invite. I told him I don’t feel comfortable spending a birthday with his friends that I’ve never had genuine sober interactions with. He got upset. So now I’m trying to get him to stick with the plan then since I seen how upset he was.

1448,Asshole,"I'm a mama in my early-60s with six kids living on Long Island. My husband was a pretty savvy investor and when he died he left me with enough money that, after a lifetime of scrapping by and sacrificing, I now never have to worry about money or working again. I live modestly, despite my security, so I made an offer to all of my kids when they got married, ""if you move to Long Island and live close to me I'll give you the down-payment for a normal, family home."" Only two of my children accepted my offer.

My son ""Alec"" married ""Maggie about five years ago. Maggie grew up in Flushing, Queens. I made them the same offer I made my other kids, about the house. They wanted to live in the city. When my first grandchild was born I reiterated the offer and got declined. They subsequently had three more kids. After each was born I made the offer again. I also usually make the offer once a year just to remind them it's still valid.

Over the years I've had many conversations with Maggie about living on LI, trying to impress her with the virtues of living in our hometown: family, community, wide open green spaces for the kids, not to mention the beach is right down the road. She's a city girl through and through and said she couldn't see herself being happy in the suburbs. She and I have never really connected but we respect each other. Whenever my grandkids come for a visit they talk about how much they love it here. I've mentioned this to her on many occasions, not baiting her just telling her, ""hey, your kids really love it out here, just keep that in mind.""

Recently they decided to move out here for one year, as a test, to see if they're happy. I won't lie and say I wasn't excited. They didn't ask me for the money I've offered in the past. They bought a small house and have been renovating it, and asked that no one visit until the house is done. It's finally done and I was invited over for a tour. My D-I-L was fixing dinner and telling me about how she had gotten a new job in town, she finally had time for PTA, she had found a really nice public library for the kids. I was happy and said, ""see, didn't I tell you you'd like it if you just gave it a try?""

The mood sort of changed and my D-I-L said, ""we didn't move out here because you kept telling us to, this was always part of our plan."" Later I asked my son what the deal was. He said Maggie feels like I was gloating because they finally moved out here, especially after how many times I've suggested they do so. My son has made it no secret he wanted to move back home but was staying in the city for his wife. He explained to me that they had an agreement ""they'd live where Maggie wanted for a period of time and then they'd live where Alec wanted for a period of time"". Apparently it was just finally my son's turn to choose where they live.

Alec says Maggie feels I've been very pushy and that I gloated when I finally got my way. Am I this asshole for what I said?",163,358,0.88

Anyway about 6 years later now and she's back in town I guess she got serious with another guy where she was living and they ended up having twins.

So she contacted me when she came back into town and she said she's single and I'm single so we started dating again. Early on she asked me if I was ok with her twins and I'd be ok with dating someone with kids. I said yeah I was cool with it, why not right? I've always wanted kids and these kids were already around 3 years old. 

I haven't met her kids this whole time because she said something about not wanting to confuse them and I was cool with it. Things have been getting pretty serious between us and things are going good so last week she told me she's ready for me to meet her kids now.

She was always showing me pics of them and stuff, but meeting them in person they look exactly like their father and that made me so uncomfortable for some reason.

I was told that both kids were kept in at lunchtime and had apologised to each other.  When I questioned this, the teacher said it was part of their 'justice process'.  

I spoke with the principal about this justice process and put it to them that my son shouldn't have had to apologise to responding to that kind of insult.  The principal claimed that since both kids had used unacceptable language toward each other, mutual apologies were required.  I used the examples of a workplace and that if either was said aloud was used only one would be regarded as hate speech.  

I was very frustrated with the fact that they weren't taking this more seriously because as far as the kids were concerned both insults received the same punishment when one is clearly more disturbing.

When we first moved into our home a neighbor told us that there was a mentally ill elderly man down the street. Our neighbor informed us that (let’s call him John) was no harm, and he just walks through the neighborhood regularly during daylight hours. Our assumption is that he may be a stroke victim due to his appearance. 

It’s usual behavior of John to hear our vehicle and rush out of his home to walk up our driveway towards the back of our house. In the event that we’re inside before he’s come up our driveway, he will stand out there for 5 minutes waiting for us to come outside. Almost every day I feel the need to run into my home. John has a very small vocabulary, and yells. When you say, “gotta go, John. I’ve gotta get inside and eat.” or “gotta get the groceries inside” John will yell “WHY” and stay on the property until we’ve been inside. 

My wife and I seem to be the only folks in the neighborhood who have spoken to him as a typical person, which has caused him to gravitate towards us and come outside anytime he sees we’ve arrived home. Most interactions with other people and John are limited to “Yeah, yeah. Gotta go.”

John has started standing in the way of vehicles, and my wife has witnessed him doing it to others. He’ll put his hands on your window sill and be persistent about “why” you’ve gotta go.

And with Johns new habit of standing in the way of vehicles trying to leave, it’s now a safety concern for us, and him. Yesterday my wife arrived home, and John rushed out. My wife exchanged greetings with John and headed for the door - and John began to yell at her and come closer. John will also stare into open windows or screen doors. It’s unsettling how persistent this man we don’t know is, and how far he comes onto the property. Based on this behavior, we’re worried that he’ll become extremely persistent and snap. We see folks in the neighborhood running into their homes/nobody stays outside long. 

The way we look at it is, if this were anyone else - it would be harassment. John lives with a caretaker, be it his wife, or sister. We’ve ruled out mother. We’ve thought about speaking w/ her, but she’s never outside. 

My wife has seen John stick his hands and head into the cars of the teen girls that live next door, and we’re worried that he’ll scare any kids that come over, like he has other kids in the neighborhood. Our intention is to speak w/ the guardian. Such as, “We’re concerned that John has been blocking folks and walking onto property, screaming, and chasing them into homes.” 

Right now we’re not sure if we’re the assholes. Our intention was to be patient and receiving, but with his newly aggressive behavior - it has us feeling trapped.",22,54,0.89

I am a uni student in Australia, and I've been financially independent for several years.  
I asked my Mum if she was in the position to help with the cost of the surgery because I wasn't able to work the extra hours I'd need to cover it. She sent me $500, which I was grateful for! I haven't asked for money before, and haven't since. I didn't offer to repay, and she didn't ask me to.  
Today I called to chat about my plans over the holidays, as I graduate in a month. I mentioned my friend and I were thinking about going on a super cheap trip to Cambodia to celebrate graduating, and my Mum flipped out. She said I was horrible for travelling after asking for money, and that she'd be extremely mad if I went. I hung up on her.

At first I was mad that she was making me feel guilty for coming to her for help, and then MONTHS later doing something nice for myself. But I am now not sure, was it bad for me to not offer to repay the portion she helped with?

1459,Not the A-hole,"Warning: long post ahead

I have had a friend for several years. She was my best friend, and officiated my wedding. We are both crazy dog people, and if anything happened my husband and me, she would have inherited our two dogs.

About a year after adopting our older dog, he was diagnosed with a tumor on his side. We caught it very early, and it was treated. He was cancer free for over three years, but we recently found another tumor. We caught it even earlier than the last one. After discussing it at length with our vet, we decided to treat it again. She felt very optimistic, and told us it wouldn't be much more risky than putting him under to get his teeth cleaned, since it was a simple procedure. She also told us she would do the same if it were her dog.

The next day, my friend sent me a text out of nowhere (less than 24 hours after the diagnosis) telling me that she thinks I'm selfish for having his cancer treated. She said that we are putting him through a ton of pain because we're selfish, and want him around longer. We should let it go untreated. I was extremely upset, so I didn't respond. I didn't want to say anything out of anger that I would later regret. 

She texted me the next evening asking me why I was ignoring her, after iI didn't respond to her about Christmas presents. I told her that I was really hurt by what she said. I felt that it was insensitive to text me saying those things to me less than 24 hours after his diagnosis, especially when I didn't ask for advice from anyone. And to even insinuate that I don't have my dog's best interest in mind is appalling and hurtful. Her response was that she was sorry I was offended, but she's not sorry for what she said because she is entitled to an opinion on the matter, and she thinks he have different ideas of what's in his best interest. I told her that she wasn't there with us and the vet, and frankly, if she isn't paying the vet bills, she doesn't get a say in the matter. I also told her that this was a stressful and hard enough time for us, and I didn't really see the point of continuing the conversation if she refused to apologize. Her response was ""Well I'm entitled to my opinion, and if you want to end our friendship over it, that's a damn shame. But that's all on you."" We haven't spoken since. 

Today was our dog's surgery, and she didn't attempt to check on our dog that she claims to care so much about. In my opinion, the fact she couldn't put her pride aside to check on him today speaks volumes. I 100% would have if the situation was reversed. No matter how mad she was at me. While what she said sucked, my biggest issue is her refusing to apologize for clearly hurting me, and then putting all responsibility on me.

Also, I know not everyone is crazy about or even likes animals, and I get that, but our animals are part of our family.",79,119,0.9

I make 200k a year running my own business and she makes around 30k a year. While we've been together I've made sure to always keep her tank filled with gas so that she could get to and from work and school without having to spend her own money. Also I make sure to stock her up with food so she can save more money,  just the little things since we haven't been together long. 

Recently I left to go on a business trip for a new contract.  I jokingly texted my girlfriend saying that when I get back home she can take me out on a date and pay for everything. 
She replied saying that if her bills were all paid and she had extra money then she would take me out. Also until I start paying her bills I can't tell her what to do. This kind of left me stomped because it wasn't a response I was expecting. I asked her why she's suddenly acting this way as if I asked for a lot. She replies back saying all I've done for her was feed her and made sure her tanks were filled, things she could have done for herself.  Then she went on a rant about how she doesn't need me and everything I did was because I wanted to and she never asked me to.  I then apologized to her for stopping her from being independent and told her that I wouldn't help her with anything else.  Ever since then she's been running into car trouble and has had to go seek out another job in order to get by.  As of yet she hasn't asked me for anything.  At this point the relationship just feels weird and I'm not sure if its worth staying. I was taught to help build up and support your partner, not watch them struggle.

Edit: After talking to my now ex girlfriend about the situation she explained to me the reason for her reacting the way she did was because of past relationships. In the back of her mind she was waiting for me to turn out like those guys. So we've decided to just end it because she still wants more time to heal from the past.

1463,Not the A-hole,"Pretty simple. Went to the grocery store with a friend (21m) of mine (22f) during lunch break. He picked a bar of chocolate and bread. At the register, he only paid for the bread and hid the chocolate on the other hand. I did not saw him doing this, I just thought it was weird he only paying for the bread but I figured he must have decided not to buy the chocolate. While walking out I saw him with the chocolate in his other and he even had the audacity to offer me some. It bothered me a lot but I pretended I didn't notice and that was it.

This happened last week.  I couldn't even hold a proper conversation with him ever since. If he had been caught I was with him and could've serious problems, or just the embarrassment of passing as a shoplifter when I'm not, especially in a store I usually frequent. I'm literally disgusted by him, I feel that I'm maybe overreacting, but I literally cannot even look him in the eyes. He has noticed and asked if I was okay, I just said I've had a few bad days.

Do you think I would be the asshole if I ignored him completely from now on or saying that I dont want to have anything to do with him? He is always trying to spend the lunch hour with me, today I just left work in the afternoon because I didn't want to be near him.

EDIT -  IT IS NOT ABOUT THE CHOCOLATE its the way he was comfortable doing it, and that he felt ok doing that while I was with him is concerning. What kind of person does that?

1464,Asshole,"So I started university 2 months ago and I'm living on campus in the dorms. During the first week my RA told me to go down to the front desk of my residence building and get a To-Go container as each student living on campus was permitted one for the year. Basically you use this to-go container at the dining hall if you'd rather eat back in your dorm (you are ONLY allowed to use this specific container to take food to go). The first week of school was pretty hectic with all the clubs, partying, meeting new people, etc. so by the time the second week of school rolled around I remembered I never got a to-go container. I went down and they told me that there were no more left, but I could buy one for $2.99 at the dining hall. This really annoyed me because everyone living here was supposed to get one. They didn't even keep track of who got one and who didn't so people could've gone down multiple times to get extra to-go containers. Anyways a few days go by and I mention to one of my suitemates that I never got a to-go container. She chirped up saying ""Oh I have two, I'll give you one!"" and I was really grateful. She specifically told me she took two from the front desk and in the back of my mind I kind of judged her for taking two when she was only permitted one but I called it even in my mind because she gave me one. So 2 months later, one night I told her I was feeling under the weather so I was just gonna get dinner to go and asked if she'd like to go down with me to the dining hall. She says yes and I once again thanked her for giving me the to-go container that one day. She gets really angry all of a sudden saying ""YOU have my second container?! I've been looking everywhere for it. Give it back!"" I tell her I'm not giving it back because she gave it to me and shes only supposed to have one anyway. We bicker for 10 minutes about it then forget about it (I still have the to-go container). AITA for not giving it back? Technically it was hers but because of people like her not everyone got one.

EDIT: She NEVER implied she wanted it back when she gave it to me which is why I was shocked in the first place when she made a big deal when she remembered she had given it to me.

We took the exam in the gym, and there were like about a hundred seniors taking the exam. After we did the reading section we were given a 10 minute snack/water break, and the way our gym is set up, there's a little foyer which is separated from the gym by doors. But these doors have windows in them, and I was by the doors eating my snack when I see this one kid in the foyer (I was in the gym) on his phone browsing the internet. A proctor was within a few feet of me and I got her attention and let them know the kid was on their phone, and they opened the door next to the one the kid was leaning on, looked at them for a few seconds, and then walked up to the proctor's desk. At that point I walked away.

Break is over, and they say ""Guys, don't be on your phones, we had to cancel someone's scores because of it."" Immediately I felt a pit in my stomach. I know they warned against it but I didn't know they would cancel it right then and there. I was able to shrug it off for the rest of the test.

I tell my mom when I get out of school, and she was a bit ambivalent about it. She tells me that I potentially got this kid banned from all other CollegeBoard assessments and cost him thousands of dollars in scholarship money, and I felt bad about it.

1468,Not the A-hole,"Sis has a young daughter. She and her husband have her in a nursery but work long hours, usually 8-6, and the nursery is open 8-5.

Mum offered to do drop offs/pick ups each day, so mum goes to their house around 7am. She collects my niece and drops her off at nursery, and then later picks up my niece from nursery, and then goes to my Sis' house to wait for them to get home.

This system has worked until recently. Mum changed jobs and now is unable to do the drop off/pick up.

I am 17 and still in school. School is 9-4. I have a job as a cleaner and work from 7-midnight. I have 3 hours between school finishing and work starting to do homework and grab some food before my shift. I'm in bed by 1 in the morning and sleep until 8.

Today I heard my mum on the phone to my sister. I didn't hear Sis' end but mum said ""well, we could always ask OP to help out"". After they hung up I got a text from Sis:

>Hi, OP. Mum said you're helping out with nursery. Husband and I really appreciate it as we could do with the help. Mum will sort you out a key to get in to the house. You need to be here at 7 to get her, and be there @ 5 to pick her up. Husband or I will be back around 7 to take her off your hands. Thanks again :)

I never offered to do any of that, nor had I indicated that I had the time/energy to do that. I texted back:

>I can't do that. I sleep until 8 because I work until gone midnight, I start school at 9, I'm there until 4 and I start work at 7. I don't have the time or energy to help you out.

Sis then replies:

>Mum said you would. You just need to be at my place by 7, you can drop Niece any time between 7 and when you start school. Look, we can sort something out so Husband or I leave 10 minutes earlier to give you time to get to work, but we can't arrive late/leave early by a full hour. I need you to step up.

This is when I got mad.

>WTF do you mean step up? I love Niece but she's your kid not mine. I'm not changing my schedule because you can't fix yours.

Sis didn't reply. Mum tried to give me the key and I asked why she signed me up for this when I don't have time. Part of me feels like a bitch for not wanting to help out my sister, as she is trying to work with me here. Mum pointed out that all I had to do was wake up a bit earlier to drop Niece off, the pick up doesn't clash with school or work, and my sister was willing to sort out something so she could leave work early and I could get to my job on time.

However, I am also really irritated that I wasn't even asked to do anything, I was told what to do and this is going to take a chunk out of my schedule. Without the full 3 hour gap I could probably still get a bite to eat but can't do my homework if I'm watching my niece, and in order to be at my Sis' house for 7, I have to get up at half 6 at latest, which means that my 7ish hours of sleep per day will go down to 5.

I want to buy a house. We live in a crazy expensive area. A million dollar home is considered inexpensive. You can’t buy anything for under $600k and that will only get you a tear down. We can’t afford to buy without help. And there is no cheaper area to buy in without us moving and me quitting my kick ass job. 

My Dad has offered to give me 20% of whatever house I want to buy as a down payment, but he doesn’t want to give it to my husband. Basically, my Dad said he’d take a 20% interest in the house (or a second mortgage) and amend his will so that when he dies, I’ll solely inherit either the mortgage or the 20%. The last condition is that I put the house in my name and not put my husband on the title. 

My Dad has always thought my husband was a mooch because I make most of the money. Note: my father has been married twice and both wives have been stay at home (my mom and then his current wife quit her job when they got married). I think there’s a drop of sexism in this. It seems he thinks men need to make the money. Anyway, he says he wants to “protect” me in the event of a divorce. 

I brought it up to my husband and his initial reaction was not a happy one. While I don’t technically need to buy a home, I think it’s a good investment in my husband’s and my future. My husband has come around a little. I’m irritated my Dad is taking this position, but I can’t talk him out of it. 

AITA if I take the money and buy a house in my name only?  

Note: I know this sub has a lot of people that have separate finances, but my husband and I have always shared everything. Please keep that in mind. If we had separate finances, I wouldn't ask this question because I'd obviously not be TA. I'm worried I'm an asshole because the deal has always been joint.",442,829,0.92
1478,Asshole,"Ok, if I were you I would have already branded me TA. But hear me out.

I’m from an English speaking European country. I recently moved for work to another country in Europe, where I will be living for a few years. I moved here for many reasons, one of which was that I wanted to learn the language. I am taking lessons and progressing slowly. 

I work in an international field, and **when I interviewed for the job I specifically asked if speaking the native language was required. They assured me that all work is done through English**, and as they employ from countries all over the world, the language of the country itself was in no way required. 

Everyone has been lovely and speak fluent English, so there has been no trouble for the most part. Of course, at lunch break they converse in their native language, even if I am at the table. I want to make very clear that **this is perfectly fine**. I cannot join in the conversation with everyone else at all times, but that is not a problem. I do not feel specifically excluded, and if anything it helps me pick up the language faster. 

However, while casual conversations are no problem, it has become a problem that they are conversing about work related matters in the native language in emails, and it’s very difficult to keep up. If I am at my computer I can use google translate, but often emails are sent as a pdf where I cannot copy and paste, with a wall of text I cannot understand. I have asked for translations from others who are happy to help, but I feel like a burden constantly asking, and it’s becoming tiresome with the large amount of emails I get day to day, and I have started to ignore emails until something urgent is sent to me. And when this happens, they normally revert to English. 

I feel like a jerk, but I’m not doing this purposely and I am trying to learn the language, but I have not been here long enough to have a full grasp, particularly of emails containing work-related jargon. I try to keep up, but my new attitude is ‘if it’s important they’ll write again’. Everyone who knows me knows I don’t speak the language, so I now assume an email in the language isn’t meant for me. 

I am taking lessons in the language, but my job is supposed to be functioning in English. I hate how I sound, but it’s hard and tiring. AITA?",22,30,0.9

She's a Great Dane/Greyhound who was expected to live to 10 years. She can't stand up for more than 30 seconds without falling down, isn't eating/drinking much, can't make it outside to the bathroom without being carried outside and is riddled with cancer.

My parents have gone out of town for the week and to a degree are not expecting her to make it by the time they get back. My dad dug a hole for her in the backyard. I have come back home to be with her just in case, just so she won't be alone if her time comes...I have spent the past couple nights sleeping with her beside her bed in case she tries to get up and falls. Last night she tried to get up several times and fell each time. She is beyond the point of medical help. She has been the family dog for my entire adult life, however, I no longer live with my family. My parents, Odin bless them, do not have it within them to put her down, because as they say she still has good days. At this point, she is having good moments and spends the 98% of the time in bed.

My sisters and I have discussed it and think it would be best to put her down. Have a doctor come over and let her pass here. We spoke with my parents before they left and my Dad cannot bring himself to be okay with it, my mom is a little more understanding...

My question is would I be the asshole, if while they were away, my sister and I had her put down... I wouldn't tell them we had her put down, just that she didn't make it. I am so ethically torn because I would be taking their goodbye away, but at the same time, she is suffering terribly...I'm so torn guys. Would I be the asshole?

Up until this point I have enjoyed most of them and their quirks, like the stubbornness and the loudness. Its entertaining, and as long as you dont take the Grandmothers comments too seriously you're fine... unless youre my girlfriend. Shes been picked on her whole life by both her mom and grandmother (called fat and told she smelled on a regular basis, which she isnt and doesnt so IDFK where that even comes from.) To keep a long story short nothing she does is ever good enough for mom and grandma. Now, onto the incident. 
Earlier this week, my girlfriends mom (let's say Gina) was asked by her aunt (lets go with Abby) to babysit Abby's little boy (2y/o). Gina simply didnt want to do it, and made convenient excuses so that she was busy. Grandma was asked as well, and simply didnt want to do it. However, neither of them told Abby they would do it. Gina simply told my GF ""you need to babysit Abbys kid on X date"". She was ""asked"" but it's never a question with them, because the only reasonable answer is ""as you command"" to anything mom or grandma says. (Yes GF is moved out and living with me, has been for months now, so no ""my house my rules"" BS). Well, this time my girlfriend said no. She simply doesnt feel comfortable being in charge of a kid yet. She doesnt like kids, has really bad anxiety and doesnt know what to do at all if something goes wrong. I have medical knowledge so if things go really bad I can save his life, but I have no idea what I would be doing either if we did end up sitting him. 
They exploded. I'm pretty sure I heard her grandmother call her ""lazy"" (another favorite of hers) and Gina said ""I didnt exile my family when I got a boyfriend"" and finally ""dont come to me if you need anything."" 
Now I dont really know what the status of the relationship is, it seems like my girlfriends mother has abandoned her. 
Are we the assholes here? I feel like we have more valid reasons for not sitting for Abby than Gina or Grandma. Also, this ""I dont wanna do it, make Cybervikings girlfriend do it"" is a YUGE pattern for them.

EDIT FOR CLARITY: Abby, the aunt, is not the issue here. She has no idea my GF was asked to watch the 2Y/O. Gina, the mother, tried to pass the buck off to my girlfriend. If Abby knew what Gina did and how hurt my girlfriend is by all this, she would be furious with Gina.",35,162,0.95

A bit of relevant info about me. I am a born and raised Christian but have always other faiths interesting. I used to work with an Afghan in my last job in a factory and we would spend almost every shift talking about our religions. As a result I have a fair understanding and respect of Islam.

So I have co-worker I've known for about 2 and a half years who in my opinion is a compulsive liar. Let's call him Adam. If I may these are Just a few lies I've caught him in.

He claimed when I first met him that he used to have a wife and one child who died in a car accident. (I have a wife and child) However when he spoke with another coworker of mine who has two kids, Adam told him that he had two kids who both got hit by a car.

We were on the phone one day and he came across a homeless woman on a property we are supposed to keep clear of homeless people. He seemed to think he put me on mute and went to kick her off the property. It was a very standard interaction, he was calm and she politely left without incident. However when he came back in the car and ""took me off mute"" he claimed she screamed at him calling him a N\*\*\*\*\*r and told him to go die.

Anyways, today. It was a slow night and Adam and I were talking about something meaningless. At some point Adam mentioned that he was raised in a Muslim temple. There wasnt  any story he had told me that outright made this impossible. At various points before he said he started drinking at 13 and his mom was catholic but that doesn't make the story impossible. I asked him to clarify if I heard him right and he said “yep from 5 to 16.”

Not gunna lie i doubted him but I kept cool and asked, as if i was curious about Islam, if it was true that muslims prayed facing north. He said yup sure do. I asked how often do you have to pray ""all the time, hours every single day.""

I then asked what Mecca was and he said it was basically the Muslim pope.

I then asked about the Quran and memorizing it. He reported back that he had to memorize it cover to cover by the time he was ten. Or the priests would blow up on him. I asked how many books are in the Quran, he said it was different for different groups and avoided answering but two minutes later after I heard him park he said there were 114 which i believe is right. Kinda suspect some googling happened though.

I'm not going to lie and say I confronted him on what I believed to be a blatant lie. I simply got pretty. Angry about the whole thing and stopped talking to him for the night. I talked to a coworker about it later and we had a laugh.

Afterwards though I kinda felt slimy about the whole thing. As a religious person I really don't know that I would appreciate being checked on whether or not I should be considered a Christian especially not by an outsider.

1494,Not the A-hole,"My wife had septoplasty done about 2 hours ago.

She would get here Tuesday afternoon and be here to take the kids to school and daycare today (Wednesday) while I was at the hospital with my wife at 7am through the rest of the day. We decided that since she would be here I could work my normal shift on Thrusday and over the weekend, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, to fill in for a desperately understaffed weekend shift. I let my supervisor and the weekend supervisor know I would be in those days and we planned work accordingly. I should add, I work in an aerospace company running at basically full capacity, so there is a delicate balance that will throw everything off if not maintained. 

Then, yesterday afternoon (Tuesday) my wife calls me and tells me [grandma] is not coming. Great. So I go to my supervisor and tell him ""So, I'm really sorry man but I dont really have a choice but to back out of the 4 days I said I'd work.

So now, after I uprooted 4 days of scheduling and moving people around because I had to back out of a big commitment and now look like an ass, it was basically all for nothing. Inside I'm fucking livid but I just express my irritation to my wife. I told her ""Just tell her it's fine, she doesnt need to come.

1500,Not enough info,"Me and my friend have a long history of making outlandish bets with each other. Almost 10 years ago we were watching Jiro Dreams of Sushi and got into an argument about if it would still exist in 2020. He was adamant that for environmental reasons that it would either be regulated out of existence or all fish would all be dead. I disagreed and we made a wager that if sushi was still widely available by 2020 he would owe me a $1,000 sushi dinner and if not I'd owe him a $1,000 steak dinner.

A few weekends ago we were at a wedding of a mutual friend and while waiting for dinner to be served I made an offhand comment about how pretty soon I'll be dining on the finest sushi his money can buy. His wife was with us at the table and I went on to explain the bet to her and how once 2020 hits I am owed a $1,000 sushi dinner. She did not take this well and now he is trying to use that as an excuse to not pay up.

She was outraged that my friend/her husband was going to ""blow"" $1,000 of their money on a dumb bet. The way I see it is it's $1,000 of his money since we made this deal years before they even met. I might add that she is well aware of our history of dumb bets like when I had to buy him a bottle of wine from his year of birth because I weighed more than him after we did competitive dieting for a summer. 

While I'd love a fancy $1,000 sushi dinner I'm not a total jerk here. I'd happily settle for just a nice omakase sushi dinner with a bottle or two of sake. To me the bet is more about having a nice dinner with my friend and not having to pay for it and I'm not going to lie some bragging rights.

Taking him to and from the gym means I cant relax in the evening fully until we're back afterwards.


To compromise, I said I'd be willing to either take him there and he walks back or he walks there and I bring him home afterwards.


He said no flat out as it takes too long to walk there and it's getting dark in the evenings so hes not comfortable walking in the dark.


I tried to explain that taking him to and from the gym is taking away from my evenings, when I just want to relax after work.


He wont budge and says it's not a big deal and I'm taking advantage of the fact he cant drive.

Edit: to answer some questions 


Hes willing to drive, its just that driving lessons are expensive and we havent gotten round to it yet. The same thing goes for a bike, but getting a cheap bike would be a good idea 


I understand he doesnt want to walk around at night, which is why I almost didnt argue it. However, during the summer he wanted lifts so that's why I suspect its more laziness than worried. It's not a dangerous area but dont want to risk it, you know?


After the argument I went for a nap to rest and cool down, he went and washed some dishes (something else we argued about) and then when I woke up he was gone

I feel like she doesn't treat me as an equal and that I can't rely on her to put my feelings first, but am seriously thinking I should just give in so that the heartbreak ends and my parents give me an easier ride.

The reasons behind my decision are mainly:

1. Since we got engaged, my sister's marriage has broken down and while my fiance +I have tried to offer support +love where we can, each time we have reached out it's been met with 'Your life is so perfect now, but it won't always be like this +I'll remember how smug you've become.' She's told me that she feels like I've become a 'Stepford Wife' character and that I have forgotten my roots and the rest of the family.
2. At my cousin's wedding overseas in May, my sister spent a lot of the trip drunk and messy, making jokes at my expense and when I asked her not to, creating drama that I was being unfair to her. We were in a similar situation - surrounded by a mix of family that we don't see often (Dad's side) and strangers from the wedding party's family and friends. The only difference was that I was taking time to try and get to know everyone rather than partying all the time. I gave up trying to reason with her after 3 days as she wasn't listening, and asked my dad to please intervene. He spoke to her briefly but she didn't listen, and then on the wedding day she got so drunk at the reception that she fell over and wet herself. I felt terrible for her, and reached out the next day only to be told to leave her alone cos I didn't know how difficult life was for her. 
3. I live some 160 miles from my sister, in the North-west of England-she lives where we grew up, near London. In the 7-and-a-half years I've lived up here, she's been to see me once - 7 years ago. All other times, I've travelled down to see her - about a 7-hour round trip - and juggled that alongside working full-time and my life up here. I've visited 10-15 times a year on average, as my job in sales luckily allows travel. In the run-up to the wedding there will be dress fittings, stag and hen parties and other social things that I know she won't bother coming to because 'it's too difficult to travel' - I feel like it's not just turning up +putting a dress on, it's getting involved and supporting in the run up to the big day.

Am I the asshole for saying I've had enough and  that I don't want her in my wedding?",27,48,0.88

1505,Update,"I made a [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bh9gkt/wibta_for_changing_my_name_passed_down_from/) and wanted to make an update.

I turned 18 in May which also coincided with me finishing highschool the next month. I wanted to get my name change done before I began college because it would be a headache to change it in their systems (and lord knew I didn't want Bertamo to be on my degree were I to graduate).

My parents had other plans and wanted to bring me on a trip. The trip was half so my mother can go to Italy to visit some of her family and my dad bringing me to Germany and the Netherlands to visit some of his family. In the three weeks we were gone, I got to meet literally hundreds of my family members, most of them Bert or some alteration. The purpose of this trip was to get me to change my mind.

And you know what? I had a great time. It was really reflective and introspective as I got to meet some other Berts my own age and listened to their thoughts on their name. A lot of men and boys my age or around my age struggle with the name because even in Germany/NL, the name isn't common. And some of them do change their names. I met family who did just that and even some who said they regret it. I even met Bertbay who wears his name on his shoulder with pride.

The most common sentiment was it's a commonality between family members and that should be protected. Something that stood out to me was if you were to meet a Bert, anywhere in the world, chances are pretty good they belong to our family. There were stories of Berts meeting as strangers and leaving as friends and family. Everyone believed this was the most important part as it means all you need to look for is a name to know your family.

I'll be honest and say it got to me. So much so I decided to keep my name. It's nothing to be embarrassed about and truthfully? A lot of posts in the previous thread said my name was beautiful and unique and it made me think maybe it's worth holding onto. And after starting college last month, I say my name in pride. I've already made a few connections just because my name is so out there: I stand out, which is a bad thing in highschool but a good thing in college.

Thanks to everyone who gave judgment last thread and I hope my little story of closure is an interesting read.",100,1646,0.96

During life, it's common that I will ask my spouse if I can get him anything or offer him something specific. Common examples include ""Can I get you some water / something to drink?"""" Or ""Can I make you some hot dogs?"" Or ""Do you want the rest of my oreo milkshake? I'm full.""  

Sometimes he takes me up on it, but he almost never ever says no. What he says half the time is, ""Not right now. But I might take you up on that later."" 

Then two hours later when I'm in the middle of something he might say ""hey, any chance I can still get some hot dogs?"" Or it's the next day and he's eating the rest of my ice cream that I would have happily eaten now that I am hungry again, because that's what hunger does after many hours -- it comes back.

He's always polite about it and if I said I was busy he would be totally fine, but I feel put upon when he does this. I feel like, ""I wasn't offering to make you hot dogs at any point during the day. I was offering to make you hot dogs RIGHT NOW.""

This is my first time posting and mum thinks im being unreasonable but would like to know if I would be a Ahole 

Lil bit back story (me in my 30s) found out around the same time my much younger sister (24) got pregnant due in Feb next yr  and I am basically infertile PCOS with strong possibility of  Endometriosis so while im grieving my choice of wanting kids in the future is pretty much taken away from me (as I pictured myself as older mum)

But not once have I rained on her parade, I told her about mine doc results and notes, she shrugged it off, but it is whatever my sis can be self centred and well being a first mum I guess its expected shes excited  for herself and I was for her, still am certain degree..

Anyho she already TOLD me that ill be babysitting if our mother ( soon to be Gran) can’t, when im not working.. I was “err ok then”

We found out its going to be a Girl which of course all happy about, I am such a bow girly girl in some cases that I went out bought the little one some bows for her when she gets to 3-4 years old IF she wants to wear one (cheap version of Jojo bows) .. but my sis is DEAD against that idea, she doesn't want her daughter to dress up in anything I LOVE and bows out of the question.. 

I explained, well if you want me to baby sit can’t I just dress her just for the day?……NOPE shes practically screaming at this point NO bows no fairy/mermaid dresses NOTHING because that means shell be just like her auntie and doesn't want that ( I love fantasy creatures)

I told her that hurts I cant have kids so I wont be able to experience anything like this formyself , would be nice just have a girly day with my future niece, im not trying to be a parent its just have fun.. 

Yeah she does not care its her word is final,

So I said ok then fine, I will not be baby sitting, do no expect me to go out my way to change nappies (diapers), clothe or bathe her I will not be responsible for her, you will just need take her with you to do errands etc and I walked away..

My mother thinks I been unreasonable because shes a new mum and I need to let it go and just sneak it while shes at work or whatever, but I feel she being to petty for petty reasons, not legit ones

So folks would I be A hole?

Note: I will still bond with my Niece when mum baby sits her (as she offered and so excited to be a Gran that she happily do it anytime)

Ill never take it out on my Niece as its not her fault that her mum and I have a broken bond for many many years ( we are polar opposites maybe 95% of the time)

And before I post I want to clarify by no means I want to parent my Niece, im not very maternal right now anyways, I have so much goals in my life that Kids/Babies RIGHT NOW are a no no

1516,Not the A-hole,"Over the course of my three years working at my weekend job I(27F) have grown close to my coworker Emma (32F fake name). When I started working at this company and interacting with Emma, it became apparent that her then boyfriend was abusive to her. Emma would tell stories at work about how if she didn't come home straight away after work her asshole BF, we'll call him Asshole, would put her and her daughter's (daughter is from a previous marriage) things out on the lawn. (Emma and Asshole lived in Asshole's house and she had no legal right to stop him from doing so). Through the many stories my coworkers and I heard about Asshole, we became more concerned about Emma's and her daughter's safety and offered different services and ways of helping them. Eventually Emma and Asshole end their 2 1/2 year relationship and Emma along with daughter move back into her parent's house.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to five months later, Emma finds an amazing guy we'll call Good Guy. Good Guy is the antithesis of Asshole. He sweeps Emma off her feet and makes an effort to be a good male influence in Emma's daughter's life. I think everything is going well in their relationship until about 6 months in Emma says offhandedly to me that, ""Good Guy is boring and she misses the excitement of Asshole"". I respond half-jokingly, ""if you call not knowing if you'll have a place to sleep tonight exciting, then sure"". Two weeks later she confides in me that she slept with her parent's neighbor behind their homes. I was shocked. Apparently there was some flirtation that had gone on for some time, and then he asked her to go for a ""walk"" one night. I asked Emma if she planned on telling Good Guy. She said it was a one time mistake and she didn't want to ruin what she had with a such great guy.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to last week, Emma and I are at work when she tells me giddily that she can't hold onto a secret. I ask her whats up and she confesses that shes been meeting up with one of our married customers in a local park for the past couple months for them to screw in his truck. My stomach turned. Here is this friend that I have gotten so close to, who we all helped escape her abusive ex, who we listened for hours about how her life is so tragic. My empathy was gone. I asked her if she planned on ending things with Good Guy. She said ""no, she doesn't want to lose a great guy"".

&#x200B;

When I left work that night I went home and told my boyfriend about Emma's secrets and how I was struggling to be her friend at this point. It seems that most of her problems in life were her own doing. Previously, my coworkers and I had been lenient with her with her shitty work ethic because of her tumultuous home life, but now she has no excuse. My boyfriend thinks she is bad news and suggested that we just stay work acquaintances.

1517,Asshole,"I was at home last night. My boyfriend had an important job interview today, and he asked me to keep the noise down so he could sleep. He had to be up early in the morning and needed sleep.

I got a text at midnight from my friend Jess, who lives nearby and doesn't have a car. She said ""op, help, I think I'm being followed home"" 

I texted back right away I'd call 911, and asked her to share her live location with me using Messenger. I called them from the apartment, and was frustrated they didn't seem to be taking it too seriously. They asked why she thought she was in danger, even asked if she's prone to overreact. I didn't have all that information, only a few texts.

The dispatcher said he could have an officer stop by to check on her ""within the hour"" which seemed horribly slow to me. I hung up and decided to go pick her up myself. I quickly got a fire arm from our safe, get my keys, and got in my truck. 

I got to her location in under 5 minutes, and let her into my truck. She said that when I got there, the guy was still following her, turn for turn, but got scarce when I came speeding over. 

I had no regrets about going to get her. We don't know what the guy was trying, but it all seemed suspicious enough that we filed a police report when they finally decided to make an appearance...

I got a text a while after I'd left, from my boyfriend, he was really stressed to wake up to see the safe empty, the truck gone, and me gone with it, at 1 am. I called him and told him I'd been worried about Jess but it was all ok now.

He got mad that I'd run out over nothing (???) on the day before his big job interview. And I said I hadn't known what to expect, without knowing anything more than Jess was scared.

1520,Not the A-hole,"Edited with pic. Also, neighbors will still have a better view from their yard, just not the inside of their house. Back story; I have lived here 16 years. We are on a nice marsh creek. I used to keep part of the waterfront area wooded but have always intended to build a bulkhead and use it. I am a single woman and it is expensive, so it has taken some time. I used to have a trail to run to a friends house back there and had chairs where I enjoyed the view. Got new neighbors and about 5 years ago they clear cut to my property line and started storing stuff on my property. I kept asking him to move their stuff off and saying I wanted to use my land but I he would ignore me and do whatever he wanted to. He had a land survey and proceeded to stabilize his waterfront land and part of mine because he thought he could steal it. His shitty behavior kept escalating and I kept trying to just be nice so I wouldn’t have tension. He got aggressive and sort of threatening and let’s just say I finally popped my top. Cleared my land, got a survey and my property runs directly behind theirs on the water. There is more story about a fence but they did finally install one so he isn’t coming on my land in the middle of the night anymore. 
The area behind their house is a better view, plus it is my land I paid for. Both neighbors on either side have built tall viewing towers and I’m interested in doing the same, but it would really block their view. These people have been absolute shit to me but will also likely live next door for years to come. WIBTA for building on my own property if it blocks their view? I could place it further away from their house to be courteous but not have as good a view, and block mine from my house. I feel sure they would not have the same courtesy. Anyway, I’m angry so I thought I would see what people with no attachment to the situation think.

 EDIT 2- it ilooks like it will only block a partial view. Guys just finished setting the pilings and it seems like the neighbors will still have half of the view. Note distance between last piling and his tower. I feel like that’s a compromise.

He agreed to drop it and that he understands that I didnt do anything (again not sure if he actually believed me or if he was just saying that because he could see I wasnt going to apologize or admit fault for anything) and that was that. 

I did read all of the comments and really tried replying to many or them. I even looked at the links some of you guys left. 

I know most of you want us to break up, but I guess I'm in denial. I know that there are things wrong in our relationship and that on some level he is abusing me. 

I guess it's just not bad enough for me to leave yet or something. I really do appreciate all the comments though. Leaving is something that's always in the back of my mind, I just cant bring myself to do it. That is probably going to be pretty disappointing or even annoying to some of you.

They can “claim” they’ve changed until they’re blue in the face, but I will **never** forgive them or any homophobic person for being bigoted in the past.

My three roommates (21F/22F/21M) and I (21F) are all theatre students, so we’re usually all down for a bit of bawdy prop comedy. Hence, when my 21F roomie brought home a tiny “grows in water” cock n’ balls, we thought it was hilarious. We put it in an enormous vase of water in 21F’s room and laughed every time we saw it get bigger. Now, months later, the penis (which my roomies have affectionately named “Peepee”) is enormous, significantly above average in both length and girth. Which wouldn’t be a problem, if it was still in its original owner’s room.

The problem is that at some point this summer, probably while we were moving in our new roommate, Peepee’s vase got moved to our living room - right next to our front door - and has been there for almost two months. 

I’ve mentioned before to my roommates that I find it a bit inappropriate to have a GIANT PENIS in our front room where anyone and everyone can see it, but they just laugh and say they like Peepee where he is. We all frequently bring over friends and I always find myself apologizing for the random penis, but even my friends and my roommate’s friends all just laugh it off and ignore it. I get that we’re college kids, but it still baffles me that I seem to be the only one uncomfortable with it. 

WIBTA if I asked them to move it back to 21F’s room or get rid of the damn thing? Usually I wouldn’t have doubts about asking, but my roommate’s dismissiveness when I asked the first time caught me off guard.

EDIT: more information

We aren’t living in student housing, we all pay equal shares of rent on an apartment together. This is our second year living together and we’ve never had any problems, we’re all pretty good friends.

Penis is about 7/8 inches long and 3 inches in diameter, with enormous 5/6 inch balls. I also loved Peepee and thought he was very funny, until he got moved to the front room. 

Idk why people seem to think I’ve got some conservative hangups about sexuality lmao. If it matters for context, I’m an actress regularly cast in sexual roles, frequenter of sex shops, and a philosophy student focusing on gender and sexuality. I’m very comfortable with penises as a whole. It’s just having an eight-incher as the first thing people see when they walk into our home that I’m uncomfortable with.

EDIT AGAIN: To give the people what they want... [here’s Peepee](https://imgur.com/a/vEHuMFm) .

UPDATE: I shared this post with my roommates and they cracked up. They also completely understood my discomfort and offered to put Peepee away!

1530,Not the A-hole,"This is so stupid but it's an argument we keep having so I wanna bring it here for perspective.

So my boyfriend is obsessed with trying to minimise his carbon footprint. Like highkey obsessed. He grows his own food, and dumpster dives, and won't drive his car unless he absolutely has to. A bunch of other stuff too. I think it's all pretty cool and I really admire his conviction, but there's one thing he does that I find absolutely disgusting which is:

He refuses to flush his toilet after he takes a piss. And he expects me to do the same when I come visit his house. He said it saves water and he only needs to flush after he takes a dump since piss is sterile anyway. I said it looks disgusting, and it makes the bathroom and surrounding rooms smell like piss. He said it's his house and he'll flush when he wants to and I should be doing the same since His House His Rules. It's gotten to the point where every time he hears me flush he'll ask if I took a shit and it will inevitably become A Thing when I tell him that I didn't, I just flushed my piss like a civilised person.

If it matters, he's otherwise very hygienic. He showers daily, washes his hands and he always smells nice. He just refuses to flush if it's not brown.

 I'll also add to his credit whenever he's at my house he'll flush every time he uses the toilet (after I had a go at him for not flushing the first time) because he respects the rules I have for my house (his words). So I do kind of feel like a hypocrite for not giving him the same courtesy, but at the same time I absolutely refuse to leave my piss just sitting there in the toilet bowl.

Anyway... am I the asshole here? Or am I completely justified in continuing to flush? This is really only an issue at house.",181,210,0.93
1531,Not the A-hole,"I'll try to keep it short. I (20f) live at home and go to college, I own a dog and pay for 100% of the expenses and take care of him. My sister and dad enjoy having a dog around as long as they're don't have to be responsible. 

My sister (17f) has a bad habit of leaving food around, specifically in places the dog can reach. I've talked with her (and my dad) about this often, explaining how sick it could make the dog. Every time she promises to be more careful, but it still happens. 

There have been several times that my dog eats the food she leaves lying around, and a few times it's made him sick (vomiting). I've explained again and cleaned it up the first two times, after that I made her clean it up. 

But now she left chocolate lying around (I think it was on the couch, I'm not 100% sure). My dog got very sick and we had to rush him to the vet, he's okay now. 

I told my sister that I wanted her to pay the bill, because this keeps happening and it's irresponsible. That she could either use the money she saved for her vacation or work for it and walk the dog when I'm at school until the 'debt' is paid. 

My dad things we should pay 50/50, because it's my dog and therefore my responsibility. I guess I could live with that too. My sister doesn't want to pay or do anything because 'it's not her dog and accidents happen.' I'd feel bad taking most of her vacation money, but this has been happening too often. 

AITA?

Edit: Monday though friday I'm at school, I hire a dog walker for once in the afternoon. He's alone the rest of the time, unless my family wants to play with him. He's okay being alone for a bit.

Edit: I'm moving out in 2ish months, so I'm moving my dog to a safer place. And I do have pet insurance, but that just means I pay part of the bill instead of the whole thing, it's still quite a lot.

Edit: Both my dad and sister had a say in whether or not I'd get a dog right now, they both agreed it was fine for those few months at home as long as they didn't have to pay for anything or walk him.

INFO: Yes, I'm training my dog. But he's still a puppy and the couch is his spot, he's used to getting some treats there. He doesn't try to get food from the kitchen or living room table, just the couch (and on occasion he has snatched something from the coffee table). I'm not sure how to teach him that he can eat dog treats but not human treats if they're in the same place, but I'm trying. Teaching him not to eat something off the street ever was much easier.

Last edit: Yes, I'm crate training him. However I'm still working up to longer times gradually, I'll look into it if it's an option while I'm at school.",241,707,0.95
1532,Everyone Sucks,"Hello everyone. 

I am Spanish (F28) and new to reddit but I need your opinion on this, I apologize for possible syntax errors. 

So, I live with my partner (31M) for 5 years. I have had depression problems due to work and family problems that sank me a lot. During this time my partner was not very good to me, he understood that I was sad and supported me with family problems but did not understand the symptoms of the depression I was in (lack of libido, tiredness, hypersomnia, irritability ...) and He was very hard on me with regard to the common tasks of the house. 

I sought professional help and thanks to that in the end I got out of the hole. Recently my partner has started to show symptoms of depression. As I know what it feels like, I have been patient and supported him in everything. I assure you that my most repeated phrase has been ""it's okey, don't worry, I understand"" but my partner is doing ABSOLUTELY any household chores.

I have a full time job and he studies at a distance, so he is at home everyday. When I got home from work he hasn't even cleaned his breakfast cup and spent the morning playing fortnite (again, he's 31 years old) The house is always dirty and I am beginning to not be able to deal with the situation. He calls me selfish for getting angry because he says he has a depression, but he hasn't sought professional help.

It is true that I am no longer so patient and sometimes I shout and get very angry. I stop talking to him or ignore him. I also don't have sex with him because I'm very angry (and I don't feel like it when I'm angry) and  I perceive sex as ""a prize"" that he doesn't deserve. I am not a martyr, I will not lie.

Am I an asshole for getting mad at him?

Edit: when I said ""I perceive sex as ""a prize"" that he doesn't deserve."" I meant he's all day playing and doing nothing at the house and then, at night he realizes Im there (he's been ignoring me because of fortnite) and demands sex. I feel really used, just for money and sex.",58,50,0.89

1539,No A-holes here,"My boyfriend Sam works in finance. We've been together since school (now both 28). Obviously he did a lot better than I did, went to uni and did well there and now works in finance. I work in childcare and he out-earns me hugely. I love my job and wouldn't give it up for the world but am aware of the difference. Sam has studied and worked with people from much better backgrounds than me but has never treated me any different even with the salary differences. 

Since he's worked for his current company he's made a friendship with one of his colleagues. Her name is Amy, and I'll admit that she's way prettier than me. I've met her several times and to be honest I don't like her. I didn't have a problem with her to begin with, but when we first met we were chatting about clothes and things, and she asked me where I shop. When I told her *average budget clothes shop* she couldn't stop herself laughing. Also, Sam brought me to one of his work parties as his date. Stupidly I spilled my drink on my dress, and Amy was laughing her head off. 

Whenever the three of us meet she relentlessly cuts me off to carry on her own conversations with him, even when he brings it back to me she cuts me off again. I know for a fact she doesn't like me. 

Also, what I said earlier about how he's never brought up the career/educational differences between us, he's started to since they've become friends. We've argued about certain things, and he's said that I can't possibly understand because I'm not as educated as himself, he's said his job is *much more* stressful than mine when he's always been very understanding of the stresses I go through. He's gone from acting as me equal to openly wishing I was on the same ''professional level'' as him. 

I know for a fact that this is all that snob Amy's influence. The way she's acted towards me before. I'm 100% sure she's putting the idea that he needs to be with someone ''on his level'' into his head. This coupled with the fact she's asked him to come hang out with her at her parents house makes me very worried about what she wants with him.

Sam thinks I'm making something out of nothing, insists they're nothing more than friends. I don't suspect him of anything but I know what she wants, but he thinks I'm wrong to think that of her.",62,226,0.93
1540,No A-holes here,"I'm (19M) a university student from Poland who's studying currently in France. Honestly no friends that I made here are homophobic, but I happened to have a bad experience with my first roommate because of his beliefs. After he found out that I have a boyfriend, he started ignoring me then asked to move dorm rooms.

That wasn't very pleasant and since I'm usually more panicky person, I started feeling anxious about coming out to my new roommate. Despite the fact that there were no signs that he's homophobic, he even has LGBT friends, but I just didn't want to potentially go through that first experience again.

This week my boyfriend came over from Poland to visit. He stayed in a youth hostel because even though you can technically get away with someone staying at your dorm room for longer time, you both have to be sneaky and we just didn't really want that stress. The hostel is cheap and I helped him pay for it.

My roommate didn't know about this for the mentioned reasons. We're kinda close though and he's in class with one of my friends this semester. He found out through my friend that my boyfriend's visiting (it's not my friend's fault, she didn't know about my roommate situation) and he was really angry with me for more things: not telling him that I have a boyfriend, not saying that he's visiting because he wanted to help him stay in the dorm for free since his first cousin works for the campus administration. And so on...

Am I the asshole for panicking too much (even I admit it's too much, I just can't help it) and hiding this stuff from my roommate? I didn't want to hurt him, but my anxiety about being rejected took over.",32,118,0.92
1541,Not the A-hole,"I own my house. It was left to me when my parents passed away. I assumed legal guardianship of both my younger half siblings. It's been 5 years, I'm 28 and my siblings are 13 and 17.

The rooms in the house are:- 4 bedrooms- A kitchen- 2 bathrooms- A small office on the ground floor- A second larger office on the top floor- Attic

Both offices used to be bedrooms. The larger one was my parent's room. It's now used by my brothers. They have a PC set up in there, some gym equipment, and playstation, it's more an activity room than an office. It's the largest room in the house. The smaller office is mine. I work from home and regularly see clients there.

I've been with my girlfriend for over 3 years and she moved in a year ago.

In August her brother lost his job. He's been looking for work since but no luck. His wife is limited to part time hours (she has to be under a certain amount each week). They have 3 kids, ages 5, 8 and 12. Their savings are pretty much gone. They have enough money to get through this month and maybe next month, but come December unless there's a Christmas miracle they don't know what's going to happen to them.

My girlfriend's parents live about an hour away, and have room to host them, but they want them to pay 600 a month in rent which they don't have.

My girlfriend has asked if they could live with us for free. Not permanently, just until they get back on their feet. If I were to agree before the end of the month they could keep the money they would have used on rent for November.

I don't have a problem with them living with us, however there's a space issue. I said they could have the guest room and the pull out couch in the larger office. My girlfriend thanked me but then said that she wasn't sure that would be enough for a family of 5. I suggested the blow up mattress. She then said that this might be a good time to do some renovations. I've mentioned before now that we should fix up the attic into a proper bedroom, rather than just storage, but when I said that it was in relation to us having kids, and was a few years away. I'd also mentioned condensing both offices into one singular office, and keeping the other room free, but that was before my brother started storing gym equipment in there.

We could convert the attic with a few hours of work. If we could just get in there, fix the light, buy some furniture and move some boxes around it would be livable. In regards to the office, we could easily move the console and PC, but the gym equipment would be a whole other story as it's large and heavy so there's not many places we could put it, and I can't see clients in a room full of gym equipment.

I don't think now is the time to rearrange the house, especially as the living situation wouldn't be permanent. I'm fine with them using the stuff we already have, but redoing the attic/offices feels like a lot to take on with 2 weeks notice.

AITA?

&#x200B;

Info - the 17 year old brother paid for most of the stuff in the larger office: the gym equipment, PC, console, and all the additional costs out of his wages. I paid for the books, TV and couch. I've spoken to both brothers and they're fine with rearranging stuff to accommodate my girlfriend's family.

My girlfriend isn't upset/mad/angry, she just suggested I think about moving up the renovations, but said that it's totally my call, she appreciates me being willing to let them stay in the first place, and said that ""we're opening our home to them, they won't have any problems with it but if they do they can go live with mum and dad and their stupidly high rent"" so she really is willing to go with whatever I decide.

The brother is not a choosing beggar. He's proud, and wouldn't stay longer than he needed to. He'd be grateful for anything they could get, and wouldn't overstay his welcome, my girlfriend is just worried about the logistics of going from a 4 person household to a 9 person household. He's also willing to sign a tenancy agreement, saying that he has to move out within 6 months of moving in. So if he moves in in November he'd be willing to sign something saying he'd be out before May, but says that he'll probably only need a month or two, just long enough to save up enough for first month's rent and a deposit, plus another month to save up some sort of financial safety net.

&#x200B;

For everyone asking: the parents are charging 600 not because they need it (they're rich with a house big enough for everyone to have their own room) but because they suck. They threw both my girlfriend and her brother out of the house the day they each turned 18 (even though they were still in school), they all but disowned my girlfriend (to be clear I am also a woman and they disowned her because she's gay) and they did pretty much the same to the brother for staying in touch with my girlfriend and they only talk to their kids when they need something, usually for my girlfriend and her brother to go to some sort of social event and make them look good, which both siblings have refused to do for years now.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**UPDATE: The brother got a job! This is no longer an issue! He had an interview, thought he fucked it up, and it turns out he didn't! Again, this is no longer an issue. They will still be looking for a cheaper place to live in case this happens again but they will not be moving in.**

And it turns out, my brother’s girlfriend is baking some cheesecake cupcakes. She left her dishes here. She’s not in the house anymore. She went home.

I was a little irritated because she’s not apart of the family; my parents don’t like her anyways. As I was walking upstairs, my mom said to wash the dishes. And I said, “okay but I’m not washing her dishes” and she yelled, “be quiet, stop making me mad, just go wash the dishes!”

My parents think it’s rude that I don’t wash her dishes. 
I think it’s rude that she left her dishes in a home that isn’t her own. I was my dishes in my boyfriends house, isn’t that manners?

My parents also think it’s rude when I don’t wash my brother’s dishes.
I think it’s rude that my brother, who is 2 years older than me, is not assigned any chore roles and literally has no daily chores other than taking out the trash. I have daily chores. He just sleeps in until 4pm.

Background, my husband and I (married nearly 9 years) are getting more involved in the kinky side of things and I wear a day collar he gave me and I'm interested in trying rope play and other things. He is aware I'm interested in the BDSM world and wouldn't mind attending catch ups but he isn't interested. I haven't attended any catch ups as I said I'd want him there too if I did go. 

Mutual friends of ours have recently broken up and the guy found an active dating site profile for his ex girlfriend. He thinks she was cheating on him in the relationship and was talking to my husband about his thoughts. 

After they had that chat, my husband asked me if I've ever had an opportunity to cheat. I said yes I have had the opportunity but I didn't act on it. I explained how I've had messages on my fetlife account from randoms but I've never responded to them. 

The conversation moved on from there but this morning he has messaged me asking if I've deleted my account yet. When I said no, why would I have he said he feels betrayed that I've broken his trust and gone behind his back. 

I explained how I don't need to delete it as I'm interested in reading BDSM tips and seeing the pictures on there, and that I don't interact with people and therefore I don't feel like I've done anything wrong as its just like having a kinky FB account. He doesn't agree as I didn't tell him when I created it and now because I can't see how I've done anything wrong he said he is going to sleep somewhere else tonight as he can't see how talking about it in person tonight can fix anything. 

I know now that it makes him uncomfortable, but I put it in the same boat of how him looking at private FB groups/instagram of soft porn/hardcore porn of random women makes me uncomfortable but I deal with it as its his right to view what he wants on the internet (and this is something that has taken us years to work through and was cause for fights in our early married years). I don't tell him anymore that he needs to stop looking, so why should he do the same to me? Back in the day he didn't stop looking and flat out told me he wouldn't stop looking as its normal and healthy to do so. 

I'm not refusing on principle on him looking at porn, I'm just refusing as I don't feel like I've done anything wrong and I don't want to feel resentful for not being able to explore learning about BDSM.

1549,Asshole," I’m currently in college and in one of my classes, there’s a girl who may be better off not talking. She’s about 21 and constantly raises her hand to share information or stories she has that are vaguely related to the topic but has no meaningful impact on the class. Almost every time she speaks in class, she stutters or trips over words, not a speech issue just because she speaks to fast, I think. Only once has she raised her hand to answer the teacher's question and that was a welcomed experience honestly. Most of the time when she raises her hand to speak in class it’s unnecessary and it’s gotten tiring. It happens at least once every class period. The teacher has started to give her a *look* and she’s started to cut her off mid-sentence to resume class. When she gets cut off other students snicker. I’m unsure if she notices it or not, but it hasn’t stopped her from raising her hand.

Some examples:

* 1st day, we had to share basic information and a fact about us. Most people say “I play basketball” “My favorite color is blue” etc. She goes on to say “I’m a fiery Irish redhead with freckles and passion and…”  It goes on and on.
* Topic was prenatal development and the lecture mentioned how drugs and alcohol affect the fetus the most in the first 12 weeks. The girl raises her hand to something along the lines of “oh I just want to say that if you ask a nurse that deals with pregnancies, she’ll tell you that drugs and alcohol will actually affect your baby throughout the pregnancy.” As if that’s not pretty much baseline knowledge. A guy in the back clapped for her saying this trying to be funny, I won’t lie I gave a tiny laugh.

This girl actively tries speaking to me. I try to be friendly with her and let her speak. We were talking about a movie project we have, and she says she had to force her parents to watch the movie with her because her sister didn’t want to watch it or something and she hates watching movies alone. I said, “what you don’t have friends?” in a joking way. She got shy and had a sad tone in her voice when she said “oh… uhh… not really…”  I felt like a complete asshole.

I feel bad for her, she’s getting laughed at and I feel bad for the class having to put up with it. She is very annoying. I’ll feel like a complete ass for trying to explain this to her, but I think it is what is morally right. WIBTA if I tried telling her she should raise her hand less in class and focus doing so when the teacher is asking specific questions or calling on someone to speak?

My girlfriend is an independent contractor, she hasn't paid taxes in a few years, I keep reminding her she 
needs to fill out the forms but she keeps ""forgetting"" and just doesn't follow up, the reality is she doesn't want to and it is too hard for her so she wants me to do it for her.

Additionally, she has restitution to pay to a different state for a crime she committed some years ago, she pays the minimum amount every month, well, I do. She has me use her credit card to pay for it because she can't seem to be asked to actually log into the website and do it herself so instead she relies on me to do it.

I am sick of doing everything for her.

So I stopped. I told her I was stopping, I told her I wasn't doing it for her anymore and made sure I wrote down everything she needed to know to do it herself, she acknowledged it but I know she hasn't paid since 2 months ago. 

She is going to get arrested for the lack of restitution payment, no question, she will probably also get ruined by the IRS when they decide to go after her.

1553,No A-holes here,"About a week ago, I came home from school and spent a few good hours doing homework and eating lunch and whatnot before I realized that I hadn't seen my dog, Toby, for a bit. I assumed he was outside because sometimes we let him out for a bit to let him explore and use the bathroom and I assumed no one let him in yet, so I opened the front door and began calling for him without a response. 

Eventually I asked my parents where Toby was and a second later my mom stood up and started leading me away from my younger brother so that he wouldn't hear and that's when I lost it. I already knew what was happening and I never thought this would ever happen to my dog. And I call him my dog because I was basically the one that raised him from a puppy. He slept on my bed every night and he followed me everywhere. I would take him on car rides when I had to run errands and I taught him tricks and trained him. 

She ended up telling me that she accidentally ran over him while reversing out of the drive way. Her and my dad were leaving to go eat out somewhere (that day was also their anniversary) and they were kinda in a rush when Toby had unexpectedly ran behind the car. 

They ended up sitting with him for about 5 minutes, after they ran him over, before he passed, and as far as I know (from what they told me), he wasn't in any severe pain. He laid there silently while they cried and comforted him.

When my mom explained what happened, I don't think I've ever cried or felt emotional pain like that, ever. It was so sudden and so out of the blue. I assumed that he would be with us for years until he got old but he was only 2 years old when he died. 

During the next few days, any moment I was alone or driving by myself. I would miss him so much and son uncontrollably. I was so angry and upset but I knew I shouldn't be mad at my mom. I knew she felt completely terrible, and she cried enough herself. He died on their anniversary and I can't imagine how it must feel knowing you killed the family dog on such a special day. 

During these past few days, I've been looking into rescuing a dog from a shelter instead of buying from a breeder or getting a puppy. There is a huge hole in the family right now and I want to be able to fill it with someone who also wants to feel loved and have a home. But after talking to my parents about it, my mom seems almost completely against it. She doesn't want another dog and she especially doesn't want a dog from a shelter. And its not because she's still upset about Toby, or that she doesn't want to replace him, she just thinks its too much of a hassle and we're better off without a dog. 

I wasn't very angry at her for what she did because I knew it was an accident but now, because of how she responded, I am so angry with her and I feel like she owes us, in a way. 

AITA for being angry at my mom because she accidentally ran over my dog and doesn't want to rescue another one?",49,56,0.86

1555,Not the A-hole,"So I used to get carsick when I was young, although it hadn’t happened for a very long time and I thought I had grown out of it - until recently my close friend invited my fiancé and I on a road trip to New York with her boyfriend. This is about a 14 hour drive from where we all live, but since I haven’t gotten carsick for years I figured it’d be alright, although I brought Dramamine just in case.

I’m sure you can see where this is going. We drove her boyfriend’s car, a Cadillac which is a few years old - nice, for sure, but not the nicest ever. [EDIT: people have gone apeshit that I specified that price of the car. I did it to give a sense of how much it would cost to clean, which is a lot. That’s all.] Around the 3-hour mark, while we were on the highway and her boyfriend was driving, I started feeling nauseous. I let them know about it but said I’d probably be alright for a bit. Fast forward about 40 minutes, and I’m feeling a lot worse. I warned him I was going to throw up, and he responded pretty flippantly: “you’ll be fine, just breathe”, “I really don’t feel like pulling over here”, etc.  For about ten minutes I kept getting more insistent, and he kept refusing to pull over, until eventually I couldn’t contain it anymore and I threw up in his car. I was feeling wholly too unwell at that point to be able to get up and stick my head out the window or anything like that, and there were no bags or anything else to contain the mess.

Well, boyfriend flipped out. He started yelling about the mess I’d made in his car and what the hell was I thinking. He was furious. My friend managed to calm him down with “I’m sure she’ll be willing to pay to get it cleaned.” Boyfriend was still extremely annoyed and remained passive aggressive, but stopped yelling at least. I was still feeling too sick to open my mouth to defend myself, but I sort of assumed friend would talk him out of it later when he had calmed down.

Well, now a few days later and that’s not the case. He’s asking for the money, and to be honest although it would strain my finances I can afford it, but I don’t feel like I should have to. I told him I was going to throw up and he ignored me. He is, of course, furious about this, and friend says that if I was going to object to paying I should have done it at the time, rather than now days later. So, Reddit, AITA for refusing to pay? I did make a mess of the inside of his nice car, but the way I see it it was completely avoidable had he just listened to me.

EDIT: To be clear, I did take the Dramamine. Didn’t work. Also, I did clean it myself to the best of my ability, but it’s the kind of thing that requires a professional cleaning to really be done well.",507,1307,0.96

1557,Not the A-hole,"A few months ago a friend of mine got sports (NHL hockey) tickets given to him. He asked me to go to the game with him, so I agreed. The day of the game he asked me if I would drive to the game, so I said yes, and proceeded to pay for the parking (about $20). Then once we get inside the game he says ""since I've got the tickets, you've got the beers"", and I proceed to spend about $150 on beers and food for the guy.  He gets super-drunk at the game and starts getting aggressive with other people around him to the point where I pull him aside and say ""if you get in a fight here, i'm not jumping in and helping you, you're on your own.""

Today he asks me to go to another game with him, AITA for going but refusing to pay for anything?  I think that paying for his beers and putting up with his behaviour the last time was payment enough. His point of view is that he could've taken anybody to the game, and chose me.",38,47,0.88
1558,Everyone Sucks,"I’m in beauty college. Wellness exercises are things like “writing down your goals” or a breathing/stretching exercise. I don’t do the wellness, and never have. It’s week 5 of my current course, and that is the case with all of my instructors. This was never an issue before, and not all instructors do it. It’s treated like the equivalent to standing for the pledge of allegiance. Today, the exercise was playing “2 truths and a lie”. I browse on my iPad quietly. I love to participate and engage when the lesson starts though. Alice comes up behind me and asks how mine are coming along. She can clearly see my screen, and that I’m doing something else. I didn’t say anything because it was unusual to me that she checked up on me when I usually don’t participate. She came by 5 mins later to ask me again, I said I didn’t do it. She asked me why, I told her I just didn’t want to (I am not the only person not doing it). She said “okay then.” And we started the lesson. 

After I come from my lunch break, Alice approaches me, she has a paper that is used to document when instructors warn about things like our attendance. She told me that my refusal “disrupted class” because she had to ask me “like, 3 times” if I did the exercise. She said that I should have told her at the beginning of class that I wasn’t going to participate. I have never done this with her, nor any other instructor at the school since this has never come up. 

In the area describing the issue she wrote that I “disrupted class and refused to participate”. In the solution area, it said I was “Expected to participate in our student portal where we have these exercises.” 
I asked her “So I’m required to do the wellness exercises?”
She said “no, it’s not required, but there’s an expectation that you participate.”
I asked again, if having the “expectation” means that I’m required to do the wellness. She said no. She wanted me to sign and acknowledge this paper, and I refused to sign it. 

I asked her “so if wellness isn’t required, and I’m not in trouble, why do I need to sign this paper?”
She said “It’s an agreement that you’ll let me know ahead of time that you won’t do the wellness.” 
I said “Okay, so I’m letting you know right now I won’t be doing it. I still don’t understand why I need to sign this paper if I don’t even have to do the wellness?” My concern is them documenting this occurrence and putting it in my file as something more than it is.

She didn’t even have an answer for that except to say now I need to sign it to acknowledge we had this talk. I don’t agree with what she wrote on that paper so I did not sign it. I’ve been in school for 10 months and only now has this been an issue. Before I refused the final time, I asked if I’m going to need to talk to the director of the school (who is her family member), or if I’m in trouble. She said no.

So she huffed off, not before writing in huge letters on the paper “REFUSED TO SIGN”.

AmGuy - The Amway rep guy
AmGal - The Amway rep girl



So me and my husband were at Walmart looking at cheese. This couple, AmGuy and AmGal, approached us. AmGuy made a remark about my husband's tattoo and AmGal joined in on the conversation. My husband and I have been approached by Amway Reps soooo many times in Walmart and Target so after about 30 seconds into the conversation I was pretty damn sure this is gonna be one of those days. But it was 6 pm so we didnt really have anywhere to go and my husband wasn't good at getting out of conversations while I was bored so I was like sure, why not. After a while AmGal and I started talking to each other while my husband was talking to AmGuy. I made a remark about how she looked so young and what was her skincare routine. She said she used Artistry. I'd never heard of Artistry before so I whipped out my phone and look that shit up. And sure enough that shit was by Amway. And below is the conversation of me and AmGirl:



Me: Oh, it's by Amway.

AmGirl: You've heard of Amway before?

Me: Yeah.. I don't use Amway.

AmGirl: Why?

Me: Because I don't believe in that stuffs.

AmGurl: What do you mean?

Me: Well Amway is like a multi-level marketing like Lularoe and stuffs and I've heard some pretty bad things.

(AmGirl started to sound frustrated and annoyed at this point, my husband and AmGuy stopped talking and turn their attention to us girls)

AmGirl: So it's just what you saw and heard then. But it's not like what you've heard.

Me: Well, I don't like that in order to get in the business you have to pay a fee and you have to buy products every month. I don't think that's a job. If I'm gonna start a business, I'd rather do it myself not doing it under a company.

AmGirl (visibly upset): Well then, I think you just had a bad mentor(?) and that's pretty ignorant.



Then AmGirl just put down the cheddar pack that she was holding on to throughout the whole conversation and told AmGuy that they're done here and stomped off and AmGuy followed her all confused and that put an end to our encounter.



Well, I didnt feel anything while we were talking to them but after I left Walmart, I started to feel bad about telling her that that's not a job and saying all that shit to her about Amway reps having to buy products every month.

My partners grandmother and I have birthdays that are pretty close together (in Nov). Usually we will combine our birthday celebrations into one dinner, which I love. Cheers to consolidation! However, this year, grandma wants to go to a restaurant that’s an hour and a half away from the city we all live in. I can’t really suggest a closer place & disregard the grandmothers wishes (seniority). I really don’t want to go. In addition to the fact that almost three hours of my day will be contributed to travel time, my partner & I have very little free time on the weekends. It feels like a hassle more than a celebration. 

My partner says he would like to see his grandmother, but he doesn’t like the idea of driving that far away from the city just to have dinner. Also keep in mind being November birthdays, we will see his whole family a few weeks after this “dinner” for Thanksgiving.

1568,Not the A-hole,"For about 50 years, my mom hosted all of her children and grandchildren for thanksgiving and Christmas Eve. She’s now gotten too old and asked us kids to take over the tradition. There are 4 of us so we just rotate. We’ve each hosted one holiday so far. This thanksgiving is my turn. 


We have never spent thanksgiving or Christmas Eve with my wife’s family. We’ve just never been as close to them plus they live all over the country. Well this year her mom and aunts decided to go to the Macy’s thanksgiving day parade. At first it was just a sister’s trip but then they decided to invite all their kids and grandkids to meet them up there. 


My wife really wants to go. She hasnt seen some of her aunts and cousins in years. Our daughter wants to go because it’s a “once in a lifetime event” (which i agree with). And I want to go.


As soon as we decided to go I called my older brother to see what we should do about thanksgiving because I can’t host this year. He said our oldest sister is going to be pissed and i have to tell her myself. He wished me luck.



So I call her and she is mad. She  says she’ll probably have to end up hosting even though she is up next for Christmas and I’m being inconsiderate of what our mom asked us to do. “Mom wouldn’t abandon thanksgiving to go to nyc” and went on about how sad mom will be that I’m doing this.


I offered to pay for them to rent a spot and have it catered but she said that takes away from the close knit family vibe. 


My brother said his wife might be up for it but he didn’t sound too happy about asking her. My other sister can’t do it because she’s renovating her house. 



I do feel bad for backing out of my turn but I tried to offer up solutions and I also offered to host the next holiday—which my oldest sister said no to because it’s her turn and she’s been planning for it all year. Next up is my brother so I said me and him could maybe just swap thanksgivings if his wife is up for it.

1570,Asshole,"Am I the asshole for not inviting my best friend to my wedding?

Here’s a bit of backstory before why I didn’t invite him. 

Me and my best friend have been close for years and when I met my fiancé, they didn’t quite get along.  When they were together they would always give each other death glares over me and fight for my attention. After a while I managed my time so that I can spend time with both of them separately so that they would stop fighting. 

When I decided to propose to my fiancé I planned to do it at Disney world and to help split the cost of the trip, I invited my best friend and another friend. We were all having fun and it seemed to be going well until I popped the question... my best friend exploded almost immediately after she said yes and started to scream at her about how she wasn’t good enough for me along with some other things. I split the party so that me and my new fiancé would go and enjoy the rest of our day while my best friend and the other friend went and cooled off for a bit. When we met back up at the hotel he continued his rant about her and it lasted for the rest of the trip. 

Fast forward a year and me and my fiancé are planning out our fantasy wedding starting with a guest list. We each have around 100 people we need to invite and I’m a little short on people. Me and my old friend haven’t really talked much after our trip and kind of went out separate ways while still talking once in awhile. He keeps asking me if he can come to the wedding but I don’t want to invite him because I don’t want another huge argument to blow up in the middle of our wedding or have him put my new fiancé down. 

Am I the asshole for not inviting him after what he did?

1572,Not the A-hole,"Was walking home from school today after debate practice. I live in a pretty cold state, and while it wasn't excessively cold or anything, it was cold-ish. I was wearing a hoodie and shorts. This girl, let's call her Kate, who lives in my neighborhood decided to tag along with me even though her friends offered to give her a ride. For whatever reason, she was wearing a tank top and those short Nike running shorts all the girls at my school seem to wear, so obviously she was more cold than I was. 

I'm 90% sure Kate likes me, both because of how she acts towards me (bring flirty, always finding excuses to get alone with me, texting me in the middle of the night, sending me thirst trap selfies on sc she tries to disguise as streaks, etc) and through what I've heard from other people. I don't really like her back, and don't really care either way about her or her supposed crush. 

Anyhow, she was walking alongside me and started 'hinting' about how cold it was. I could obviously see where this was going, but didn't really want to give her my hoodie because 1) Its my favorite hoodie, and as people say, when you give a girl a hoodie, it's as good as gone 2) I don't want to be cold and 3) She might see my giving her my hoodie as a sign of interest or something. So I ignored her signals. She kept on talking more and more about the weather, which was annoying, until I finally snapped and replied sarcastically, 'what do you want me to do? Control the weather?'

She got pissed and told me she just wanted my hoodie. I told her no, which pissed her off more. She's the type to go quiet and fume when angry, and that's exactly what she did, but apparently she texted her friends about it, since now they're all texting me calling me an asshole.

1573,Asshole,"Some context: We've been living together for 4 months, he's a 26 year old male and a full time college student while I am a 22 year old male and have a full time (9-5) job.

So my boyfriend has increasingly making snide comments about him having to cook dinner. I say ""having"" because I am an AWFUL cook, and basically survived off of sandwiches and cereal all throughout college, while my boyfriend on the other hand prefers really thought-out and complex meals. When we decided to live together, I told him that from the start that he would be doing most of the cooking, especially since all he eats are complex dishes that require so many steps that I can't even imagine doing. He agreed, and that was that.

Now we've settled into our little routine and he constantly brings up that he has to make dinner. He complains to his friends about it enough that they also make snarky comments, saying things like ""oh we'll come over and even bring food so you don't have to cook for once!"" and things of that nature. At first I thought it was primarily playful, so I didn't worry too much about it, but now it's gotten out of hand. He brings it up at least once daily, and he constantly criticizes my lack of cooking and says how exhausting it is for him to have to worry about it all the time. 

Now here comes my defense. He cooks at MOST 6 times a week. This varies a little because sometimes, especially weekends or days when he has to study for exams and such because we end up going out or I ubereats something. Lunches usually consist of either leftovers or me buying something near the office, and breakfast  consists usually of yogurt or toast. So really, he only worries about dinner during the week. Also, while it is true that he cooks the meals and that requires a lot of time and effort, and I'm not trying to downplay that at all, that doesn't mean I just sit around the house all day and do nothing. It's kind of our unspoken rule that when he cooks, I clean. This means I wash all the dishes, put said dishes away, clean up the aftermath of his cooking, which is a lot and very messy, and then put the food away. Not to mention, I clean the ENTIRE apartment on my own. This means sweeping, vacuuming, cleaning the bathroom, all of it. We're both kinda clean freaks, not to mention we have a golden who sheds like no other, so this isn't like once a month type of scenario. This is 1-3 times a week.  And to top it all off, I do all of our laundry. This includes washing AND folding AND putting it away. So really, the ONLY thing he has to worry about chore-wise is dinner. Not to mention he only has class two times a week for 3 hours, so he's the one who's at home the majority of the time. Would I be the asshole if I stopped doing the things I do to show him how little he actually does? It seems to me that he thinks he does everything while I do nothing, and every time I try to talk about this that's exactly what he thinks.",31,28,0.91

My daughter packs her own lunch each morning, and it is typically a salad. That poor child forgot to pack a fork and asked the lunch lady for one up at the register.....

That woman told her that there is a 10 cent charge to rent a fork at the high school. Yep, if you do not buy a school lunch you must pay 10 cents.

I called and was transferred all over after stating I needed to speak to someone about ""renting forks"". No-one knew what to do with me and even hung up on me the first time. I am assuming they thought it was a prank. I finally got hold of the nutritionalist and here is what I was told .....last year some high school idiots would run into the cafe line and steal handfuls of forks to then make ""clothes"" and ""hats"". I asked if the kids walking around in fork hats and shirts were caught and punished and she stated that they were. So I asked her why they would then punish the other 1500+ kids that didn't steal from the school buy making them RENT EATING UTENSILS and she stated that charging for the forks is a deterrent. So let me get this straight....kids stole free forks from the cafeteria but won't steal them if they have to pay for them?

So I told her that I would write the school a check for $1.00 to cover the cost of any RENTAL FEES my daughter may have to pay over the next four years and I wanted to know what to include to rent the seat she sits in while I was at it.

Am I the asshole for fussing at the school over something so minor? I feel like my child is punished for something she wasn't even a part of and didn't know about. And I am mad she has to go around asking for a freaking dime to eat her salad.

EDIT:  Everyone assumes that I was yelling or belligerent while on this call......I was very calm and collected due to the fact that once you get ugly people quit listening.  I was a smart ass about the seat but if they will charge for a fork they are being ridiculous and I wanted to make a point.

Also, I have always been one to look out for the underdogs when it comes to school and buying stuff.  I am the one that asks about the kids that don't get to buy lemonade on a field trip if they don't take the required money or the kids that are super smart but can't afford to pay for the AP tests, or can't take the classes they want because Home Economics will cost them an extra $20 for the semester.

So I got the message that she didn’t like me like that. 

When the waiter came to collect the check I told him to just put my meal on the card. The girl looked pretty confused and said she thought I was paying and that she couldn’t really afford the amount this cost. (It was around 100$). So she couldn’t really pay for it.

Normally I would never have even considered taking someone else’s dog, because I know how much it would devastate me if my own pups were taken, but this dog was left on the street covered in mats, shit, and piss. 

I found the dog on our way to pick up our dogs from boarding. He was wandering around in the street, and he honestly looked like a stray. He smelled god awful,  was covered in really bad mats, and had no collar. A neighbor came out and told us he apparently belongs to some younger girls who leave him outside like that all the time. I knocked on their door about a dozen times and tried ringing the bell, but got no answer. My mom took me to a nearby animal clinic, and they found that he had no chip and was still intact. 

We took him home with us, bathed him and trimmed away most of the mats. He is an incredibly sweet dog, which made it even more heartbreaking that he had been so neglected. He didn’t fight us at all when we bathed him or trimmed the mats, so I feel like there’s no excuse for how bad of shape he was in. 

I showed my friends a picture of him, and one of them immediately fell in love and wants to adopt him. 

My mom is on my side and says that they forfeited their right to the dog by neglecting him and leaving him to get hit on the side of the road. My dad is mad and says we need to bring him back because we are thieves. 

AITA for taking this dog? WIBTA if I brought him to my friend, who I know will take good care of him?

Update:

I know this may upset some people, since it seemed like a majority of people thought that I wouldn’t be an asshole for taking him. Honestly I’m pretty upset with how everything shook out too.

Well, long story short the owner called.  Apparently he belongs to the mom of the two daughters, and the two daughters are the ones who don’t give a shit while the mom works around the clock. She really wanted her dog back, so I brought him back, but I also called the local SPCA and filed a report so that if anyone sees him out wandering like that again then action can be taken a little more quickly (hopefully).  So I guess in the end ESH, but at least he got groomed and hopefully it won’t happen again.",253,910,0.94
1583,Not the A-hole,"For some context, I’m 24F + Asian and never had a boyfriend in the years I’ve been alive. I’m socially awkward, insecure despite being average looking(not ugly but I wouldn’t call myself pretty. Just average.) and just reclusive/quiet when not spoken to. The incredibly shy/introverted and slightly studious type. Henceforth my singleness. I have been asked out many times by boys but they never really interested me? They weren’t my type honestly and I definitely don’t want to lead then on.  I’ve always been pretty straightforward about that. I figured when the time comes, it will come. Sure I would like a relationship but I’m not actively looking. 

With all that being said, I can communicate like a normal human being despite hating human interaction. I’m a recently licensed pharmacist who’s worked the beast that is retail for a while since undergrad. I’m a professional in my field, very personable with my patients and coworkers. That’s all fine. 

I have a cousin(34F) who my mother adores. My cousins husband brought her over years ago from her home country through marriage and they are doing pretty well for themselves with a little child. She depends on her husband and expects him to do all sorts of things to accommodate her preferred living style. New Lexus and home and all that jazz. She works too to support her family so I don’t pry into whatever they do cause its not my business. 

Now this cousin is always asking me “when will you get a boyfriend.”, “your younger sister has a boyfriend already. She surpassed you!”,  and all these snide comments about my love life. Which doesn’t exactly make me happy cause it’s none of their business. This cousin also prefers my sister(who I admit is the fun one in her eyes. while I’m the smart one. Its just the way I see our dynamic and quite frankly I’m okay with it). 

My other family members also bring this up sometimes too. It gets really annoying real quick. I hate it. But I’ve learned to ignore these snide comments and to tune them out. Just remain quiet whenever they bring it up cause there is no use addressing it and I’m a pretty non confrontational person. 

But today I’ve finally had enough and replied “ I make 6 figures a year. I don’t need a man to take care of me or make me happy. I can do it myself. Please stay out of my business” to her being single comment to shut her up. it got incredibly awkward real fast.

1585,Not the A-hole,"I (24F) work for a small non-profit in a medium-sized city. I have been here \~1.5 years as a designer. My co-worker, B (22M), is the front desk assistant. 

I had come back to work after taking leave for bereavement in June after my grandma had died and and everyone in the office knew about it, since it's so small. I went to get coffee and B got up from his desk and started coming towards me with his arms wide open for a hug saying he was sorry about my loss. I backed away and pull my arms to my chest, clearly signaling him to back off. He instead, took another step forward and verbally asked if he can hug me. I told him I'd rather he didn't and then sidled by him to go back to my desk. His boss, J, saw this happen and had a talk with him about appropriate conduct with female coworkers because I am not the only one in the office who has had issues with him not respecting personal and physical boundaries.

The most recent incident happened at our annual work dinner party about a month ago. It is hosted by our president in her home. I attended with my boyfriend and we were hanging out in her kitchen with J and his husband, when B comes in. I was up against a wall and had nowhere to go, so he hugged me without my reciprocation or consent. He then SHOOK HANDS with the men in the room. J came up to me the next day and told me I should file a report with HR. B followed my report up by emailing me, saying he hugged everyone at the party, so he thought it was okay. J confronted him about the incident and obvious lie since he clearly shook hands with the men and B told J he ""didn't want them to get the wrong idea."" Appalled by his sexist/homophobic comment, J told B to leave me alone as much as possible except as needed for work.

I genuinely do not like B, I think he is an incompetent, sexist, entitled shit who has done nothing to benefit our organization. The work he does is riddled with mistakes if it gets done at all. Recently, I designed a truck and B oversaw meeting the company who delivered it and make sure it arrived safely on our property. I went out a few hours later to take some photos and found the doors of the truck WIDE OPEN. We work in an urban core and if the truck was left over the weekend, the homeless would have certainly made it a shelter. B had to go back and lock it. We had another person check the truck again at the end of the day because none of us trust him, and one of the doors was still fucking unlocked. This sheer idiocy happens on a weekly if not daily basis.

I guess B is not happy with the way things have been, because he reached out to HR who suggested we sit down and mediate. I have done nothing but treat B with the utmost respect and professionalism and my opinions of him, while low, have stayed to myself. I have nothing to mediate, I work fine with him, say hello if we bump into each other, etc. So Reddit, AITA for not wanting to mediate and preferring our relationship be on an as needed basis?",164,705,0.93

so recently my mom got engaged to this guy that i’ll call E. i met E a couple months before they were engaged and he’s a pretty nice guy. before you know it we’re all living together and have a cat. this is basically just me saying that i like the guy

eventually the conversation about my last name came up between me and my mom. i have my grandpa’s last name. i said that there was no way that i would change my last name to E’s last name. i explained that i respected my grandpa too much to change it, and that changing it would be equivalent to ignoring all that he’s done for me through my childhood, and would hurt him.

my mom is super hurt by this, but luckily E doesn’t know about any of this. she says that i’m not accepting E into the family and that i’m being bitter about my childhood (though i’m still in it) it pains me to see her like this. AITA?

1591,No A-holes here,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. A little backstory: I’m a 20 year old female in my junior year of college, living out of state for school. I have a FWB I used to see while in high school back home. Since moving out here to college, I see him every so often, usually on school breaks. Earlier this year after moving back to school after January break, I found out that I was pregnant. The only guy that it could have been was my FWB back home. He and I used to joke about the fact that I’d just “swing over to the abortion clinic” if I ever got pregnant. I understand how heartless and stupid this is, but that’s just our sense of humor.

After finding out I was pregnant, I texted him something simple like “just making sure, you said you don’t want a kid, right?” His response was something along the lines of “ummmm no???” Okay, cool. I’m in no place to have a child and he just confirmed that he didn’t want one either. The pregnancy was still early (just a few weeks), so I made an appointment with the health services at my college and they directed me towards a clinic which gave me an abortion pill. I took it, everything was all fine and dandy. Just to be clear, I’m not asking for a judgement on whether I’m TA for having an abortion, it’s a hugely controversial subject and shouldn’t really be discussed here.

Upon going back home for summer break, I met up with him for FWB activities and ended up mentioning that I was now on BC because of the “preggo situation” in January/February. He immediately got super quiet and reserved. Apparently he didn’t realize I was actually pregnant during that time, and didn’t put much thought into my text telling him that I was. In my opinion, I was going to get an abortion anyways, so it didn’t really matter what he thought about it. We’ve even discussed in the past how neither of us want any children, especially with each other. He ended our night early and doesn’t really talk to me as in-depth as we used to talk to each other. I lost a good friend and a FWB. AITA for not discussing the situation with him further while it was happening even though the outcome wouldn’t have changed at all?",51,53,0.89
1592,Not the A-hole,"My mother in law has been asking if she can take care of my son and babysit for a while to spend time with her grandchild, I dont usually speak to her but this time she was asked me directly to my face rather than to her son. I figured he had given her the reason why I was rejecting her requests, but apparently he had just been telling her that we didn't need a babysitter etc.

&#x200B;

So, I told her straight, I said she can't take care of the baby because she is an ex alcoholic, I have known her for 8 years now, she has only been sober for less than 2 months, and every other time she has quit so far, has only been a short amount of time before she starts drinking again. Also in the time that I've known her she has had her own son (aged 16 at the time, special needs) taken away from her, it's actually illegal for her to be in the same room as him. 

&#x200B;

My partner's family thinks that if I dont give my in law some trust, then she will just be more likely to go onto alcohol again, that people can change. I feel that she can change but before I would feel confident that my baby was safe, I feel like alcoholics should demonstrate a lot longer than a few short months, that they are clean, I'm also nervous as who knows if she stopped drinking other than her word for it. I don't see her every day in order to check. They think that there's no possible way that my mother in law is drinking again and said that they have seen no signs, that there is no concern.

We have had quite a few arguments in the past. Including because she refused to Venmo me for an Uber when she didn’t order the one back.

So a couple of nights ago, my friends and I were going out and there was a pregame at Brandy’s apartment. My friend paid for the Uber for us to get from our apartment to brandy’s. Later in the evening Brandy paid for the Uber to get from her apartment to the party.  
 
I called the Uber home. Brandy originally wasn’t going to come in our Uber but it was more convenient to do so. Because there were 5 people coming with I called an Uber XL which was $25.  When I called it I said “ok, the Uber is $25 but I’ll charge it to my parents card and we can call it even so we don’t have to worry about Venmoing”. Everyone agreed and I called the Uber. 

Later that night I received a Venmo request for an Uber from Brandy for $5.25 which I declined. 

The next day we were both attending an event and she came up to me and told me that she sent me a venmo request and asked me to pay it.  I told her I declined the request because I called an Uber that totaled $5 per person to which she responded “but you charged it to your mom’s card.”  This made me really mad because she is not entitle to my parents money or access to their Uber account.

My gfs daughter has seen them and has gotten pretty upset about how she hasn’t gotten them too.

My gfs daughters teeth are pretty crooked which I haven’t really noticed before because she is always so quiet and keeps her mouth closed a lot. I always thought it was because she was just shy in general, but now it’s clear it’s because she’s self conscious.

Around 6 months ago she asked me to lend her $100 because she didn’t have enough money to pay her credit card. I never had any reason not to trust her so I said sure and transferred the money. 

The problem is that 1) it’s been 6 months. I honestly think it’s super rude of her because she promised she’d pay it back in 1 month; 2) she keeps going on trips with her boyfriend and people from college; 3) she also is always talking to me about the 4-5 books she bought (literature, not uni books) and her $150 whey protein; 4) I feel like the adult and financially smart thing to do would be to prioritize paying off your debt and only then giving yourself treats. Sure everyone deserves to spend a little on themselves but 5 books at once? Whey protein? 2 different trips?

We started dating right when I got my dog Shelley from the pound, and we've all been together ever since. I got really into training Shelley and she's super well-behaved, knows all sorts of cool tricks, and I thought it would be funny and memorable if she was the ringbearer for our wedding ceremony. I got her this funny dog t-shirt to wear, I've been working with her on holding the ring basket, and I think it's going to be great.

The issue is this. Our families are both thrilled about our wedding, including the kids on both sides. One of them is my girlfriend's nephew (10M). The other day we were over at my GF's sister's house for a barbecue when her sister came up to us with the nephew alongside, saying he wanted to ask us something. We kneeled down and he kind of quietly asked if he could be the ringbearer for the wedding. I think he's been looking for something to do since we've been trying to save money and everyone on both sides has been helping us, so I'm pretty sure it's not just something his mom put him up to.

Anyways my GF and I both thought it was really sweet but we told him that we already had someone picked out for the role, and offered to let him help in another way. He said okay but he definitely looked like he was about to cry.

His adopted mom has always kind of talked down about them whenever the topic is brought up, and talks about adopting like she should receive an award for bringing him here. I was also adopted and nobody ever talked about our parents to us that way, even though my parents lost me over drugs and alcohol. Eventually I did track down both my birth parents though. Now deceased.

A few months ago we had a scare with an auto-immune reaction and became concerned for our kids. The doctors asked about generic history. I later tell DH that he could know if he called the agency and started the process. He doesn't want to because they gave him up. The area was in a bad way and I try explaining that he doesn't know the exact reasons why and reiterated what the doctors said about genetic history. I said we won't be around forever and both of our families are shrinking, isn't it great there are more people out there maybe wanting to know us and our kids will have a big family again. He says if they gave him up they aren't anyone he wants his kids around.

A few weeks ago I found his parents. For medical history and for them. They weren't allowed to have another child and knew adoption would at least be a chance for him instead of abortion. I didn't tell him. They understand why he's mad but they're grateful he's safe.

Then yesterday he started to piece together the bit about the picture. I explained it was for our kids, and for him and for them to have closure about their child. I said as a parent now wouldn't you be heartbroken if anything came between you and your kids that you couldn't prevent. I didn't think it was right for his adopted mom to be dragging his birth parents the way she does. That she did a wonderful job raising him and doesn't need to stand over people in desperate situations to prove it.

We've had our first little one almost four months ago! He's a healthy baby, no major problem at all and we got to bring him home two days after he greeted us (I don't know how it normally goes but a lot of the babies I've seen being born made some visits in incubators and such so I'm really really glad!). 

So here's the problem, Elliot hasn't been babysat quite yet but my parents brought up the subject over the weekend of Elliot coming to spend a night over at their place since they want to offer me and my girlfriend a day + night stay at the spa for my upcoming birthday (which is in two or so months).

I said no, a firm no, because my parents are heavy smokers. They both smoke cigarettes and weed in their home and have been doing so since way before I was born. I've had terrible breathing problems growing up and while I do know that the smoking wasn't necessarily 100% to blame I do know it didn't help. More-so, my parents never moved from their smoking habits after meeting with our family doctor (who would constantly push them to stop smoking) and basically adopted the ""let's close the door to our kid's room when we feel like smoking, should be good enough"" approach. So I don't have any trust in them not smoking while Elliot is there and I'm not there to supervise thus I refuse to leave him with them.

My mother took it to heart and she's hurt. On one hand she says I don't trust them to be responsible with their grandson (which to be honest, I kind of don't because they weren't when I was a kid) and on the other hand is serving me the ""you think you know best, we've had 4 kids etc, etc"". What really pushed me further in my position is my father, who's been saying I'm making a fuss for nothing because I turned out perfectly healthy and very athletic despite whatever the doctor was saying to them (which is true, once my teenage years started my problems cleared and I went full on into sports running and badminton with no further problem) and that I'm just trying to highroad them like a smart-ass (he also blamed my girlfriend because he says she's a health-nut and that pissed me off). 

Now here's the thing, following their comments I maybe went too far and told them that unless they completely stop smoking they won't ever get to have Elliot over without my supervision and I don't care if it hurts them because my son's health is more important to me than their feelings, so AITA?

Edit: One thing that I forgot is that my older sister is a smoker as well but I know she doesn't smoke indoor ever since she's had her first kid as well and wouldn't be opposed to let her keep Elliot (my girlfriend a bit so but we haven't made any decision on that yet) which my mother took as a ""you're calling me a liar when I say I won't smoke with him there"".",168,557,0.94

I’m a senior in college and have lived in a house for 3 yrs. Last year, I started a relationship. We eventually decided to live together. I was already on the lease of the house, and since the previous roommate was moving out, my ex (then, girlfriend) wanted to move in. I was hesitant to live with an SO, but accepted. Pretty soon, we broke up in May, but had resigned the lease in April already. So this year, I’m living with my ex. There’s also 2 other roommates. The 2 roommates and I get along, but there’s obvious avoidance between the ex and I. I have conversation with the other two, but I only communicate politely about cleaning, bills etc with the ex if possible. 

When I moved back I made sure to set my boundaries clearly so that ex wouldn’t try and get me back. I made it clear that I planned to have a dating life, and didn’t care if she did the same. As long as I can’t hear her having sex with people, and she can’t hear me, I’m fine. She agreed, we move on. 

Fast forward a month. She has decided to fuck one of my “friends” who lives with my other friend, so I had to leave a friend group due to her always being at that house. It sucks, but I have other friends. She can do what she wants, so I don’t confront her. 

I found a great date on tinder, and we decided to bake at my house for a first date. Funny enough, she just ended a relationship and is in the same position as me. But since her relationship just ended, she doesnt want to have guests yet. I plan the date for my house when ex is working until 10:30. 

Date goes well. We bake downstairs while other roommates mill about. After that, we have sex while no one else is home. While we’re laying up after, I get a text that I don’t read. 10 minute later, I get a call from ex, which I silence, since I’m headed downstairs anyway and can talkl in person. 

2 minutes later, I go to walk date out of the front door, & hear ex sniffling and holler for me from the back door. She says she’s been avoiding coming home because roommate told her that I was on a date. She assumed that we were hanging out downstairs, and the thought of seeing me with someone else was enough to make her cry. Thing is, I’d been upstairs for the last hour, and had been done having sex for 20 minutes before anyone was home. The only contact she had with the date was hearing her voice as she’s walking out he front door and ex was coming in.  I apologize for missing her call but that’s it. 

She now says she can’t live with this, and needs to move out (good), but until then, she wants me to text her every time I have a romantic guest downstairs. She’s the only bedroom downstairs by the kitchen and living room. 

It seems unreasonable to me. I would still plan to have dates over mostly when she’s not around anyway. I feel like since I pay rent, I have every right to use the kitchen and living room as I please (within reason).

Like she'll drunkenly call me and my SO her best friends when she only knew me for 6 months. She'll sweet-talk me but come to my apartment and call my furniture ugly. She'll make fun of my being a human and animal rights activist. But the thing I got really hung up on, which was just a red flag to me, was this situation:

Last summer, we went to a 3-day festival together. It was just the two of us, so we stayed in the same tent. Now, I have a big issue with the bathroom situation at festivals to the point where I'd rather not go because I am terrified of somehow getting human feces on me. Like, terrified. I can't even flush the toilet at home without closing the lid first. One time I had to skip classes at school because a tiny drop of toilet water hit my hand while flushing. I went home and showered for an hour. I don't know why I am this way.

Anyway, you can imagine the state of the toilets after 2 days at the festival. I asked my friend nicely to simply take off her shoes before walking into the tent, especially if she had just been to the toilet. Well, I had to ask her ten times, and she ignored me all ten times and proceeded to walk all over our shared mattress with her shoes on.

AITA for expecting her to respect my wishes?",58,26,0.86
1604,Not the A-hole,"This argument happened over a year ago. I recently got some new insight and it's made me wonder if I am TA.

Bg info: Me (F33) and my husband (M35) have been together for 17 years, married for 7. We both worked FT for 10 years after college until trying for children and for many reasons (length of commute, my dangerous work environment, his pay being well over 20x what I made), we jointly agreed that me being a SAHM was the best decision for now.

I got pregnant and around the same time a close friend asked me to be her bridesmaid. I said yes, had the baby, everything was fine. Due to husband's work schedule and commute, he left before the baby woke up and got home long after she went to bed and I also nursed her at night, so I did 100% of the childcare.

Friend's wedding was coming up and the MOH's mom offered her beachside vacation home for the weekend. I was unsure if I should go. I would have to use a breast pump every three hours nonstop, including travel time and nights, in order to keep my supply up. When asked, husband was hesitant but didn't say no. After much debate I decided to go, thinking I almost never do girls' trips and I wanted be there for my friend.

I typed up a massive list of baby's schedule, when/how much/how to feed her, everything I could think of. I told friends and family that he would be alone with her and to let him know they could help if he needed. Prepped everything.

I went on the trip and called every night. I left earlier than the other bridesmaids so I could make it home at a reasonable hour Sunday night. My husband was eating dinner and watching tv when I walked in the door and he didn't react. I said, ""Hello?"" and then, ""Is everything ok?"" and got a grunt. After a confused minute of me standing there, he said, ""Anything else?"" I started sobbing and yelled at him (which has only happened 2-3x in our relationship) that I missed them and how could he not even say hello after I was gone for 2.5 days, wtf basically. He hugged me but didn't apologize and we avoided each other until the sting was gone. I also found out friends and family all texted him asking if he wanted some company or help and he never replied to them.

Last month it came up again and husband said, ""You never said 'thank you!'"" Which honestly never occurred to me. To be clear, I thank him plenty for all that he does for us, both verbally and implicitly. But to thank you for being a parent for one weekend that I didn't initiate, for a good friend's major life event? While I spend every other waking moment taking care of the baby?

In hindsight it would have been nice of me to thank him. But I don't think it was truly necessary and/or justified his reaction. AITA?

Tl;dr: FT SAHM has one girl's weekend, husband gets angry for not being thanked for watching baby.

Edit: for those pointing out my reaction was very strong, you’re right. It was my first time away from baby overnight, my return flight was delayed 3hrs so I missed seeing her that evening by 20mins and my husband had not been responding to my texts updating him on my travel changes. So I was a little on edge.

Edit 2: Of course I appreciated him accommodating my weekend. But if the situations were reversed and he was the one going away, which happens rarely but still more often than me going, I do not expect a thank you from him. My problem is more how he behaved towards me while I was on my way back and when I got home. I make sure to be happy and have something for him to eat when he gets home exhausted every day, for example. I feel like if he had greeted me nicely and maybe later on explained that he felt a little off about the whole thing, this would have gone way better.",535,1379,0.96

1609,Not the A-hole,"This is my first time posting, have mercy.
Alright so, this weekend was thanksgiving up here in Canada. As such, my family got together for a visit and a meal. Now, I’m a university student living three hours away from my parents and siblings, so seeing them is pretty rare (this is good, parents are emotionally manipulative but that’s a whole other thing). 
We decided to go bowling, my parents, siblings, my boyfriend, and my mother’s parents. I was wearing a cute dress, since my mother puts up a big stink if we dare to wear jeans to family events. It was a pretty simple sundress with a knitted sweater over it. Now, I’m a pretty buxom gal, so no matter what I wear, there’s going to be cleavage. There just isn’t any getting around that, and this isn’t a new thing for anyone. The dress wasn’t a turtleneck, but it wasn’t absurdly low, either.  The neckline stopped about where my armpits are, for a rough estimate (not that it should even matter. Gals, wear what makes you feel cute)
Maybe ten minutes into bowling, my grandma pulls me to the couch she was sitting at and says, “X, I’m saying this because I love you, but you need to respect yourself more.”
I’m pretty floored by this. I’m a pretty conservative dresser, for the most part. Never got dress coded at school, parents never had to tell me to change, etc. I asked her what she meant. 
She gestured to my dress and said that what I was wearing was inappropriate and made her uncomfortable. She also said that, maybe my mom didn’t want to say anything, but if she were my parent, she would be embarrassed to be seen with me. And that I shouldn’t be wearing that when out with my boyfriend. “What you choose to do in private is your business,” she said, “but in public, you need to wear more.”
I’m still not entirely sure what the implication was there, but I have my guesses. I tried to explain to her how hard it is to shop for clothing that doesn’t look ridiculous with my chest while walking the line of not looking slutty, and that I don’t feel uncomfortable in what I was wearing. She says it doesn’t matter, I need to be aware and respect other people’s comfort. 
I ended up leaving early and going home to change just because I didn’t want to listen to her shit all evening, and came back in a sweater and leggings. She didn’t say a word, though, I found out later from my dad that my mom and her had a big argument while I was gone.

So, I guess what I’m asking is this. Am I the asshole for trying to defend what I was wearing? With the older generation is it better to just suck it up and don a nun’s habit? I don’t have much supportive family, and up until now, she’s been fine and I don’t really want to lose it.",47,58,0.83

1611,Not the A-hole,"I met this beautiful asian girl last year and we've been really enjoying our lives together so far. She is a wonderful human, very caring and loving, and extremely supportive of her family back home (3rd world country) and financially has been able to allow them to live quite comfortably, without jobs, in a nice house etc. Initially when we met, I was really taken aback by this, and used the juxtaposition with white western family dynamics to really view what I've been doing wrong with my own family all my life (specifically, giving zero fucks), and I really respect her for that.

Fast forward several months, and I'm learning that her finances are an absolute mess. She has around 50k in non-mortgage debt (car loan, 10k in credit cards, misc other debts) while working like 70 hours a week, poor thing is just practically unable to make ends meet despite earning 45-50k/yr on her own. She moves in with me, I agree to pay around 80% of the rent (I make a little more than her, but not by much, just have more financial freedom) and she gets some relief. 

Around a month ago, she discovered she needed braces, of course being the loving boyfriend I am, I offered to help her pay for the braces (everyone deserves to love their own appearance), but I added the stipulation that she needed to be more diligent about paying back her CC debt, which is a real black hole for a lot of the western world, and she needed to get that demon dealt with first priority. She agreed, and we made a plan to spend the next year paying down her debts, getting her teeth fixed, and then looking towards some college so she can advance her career a little bit. 

Her family however, also has needs. She has been back and forth trying to decide on a vehicle to buy them, which I advised should be a) cheap b) reliable c) not brand new so she can still meet her finances back home. Come to find out, she has been suckered into signing a 5-year loan for a brand new Nissan, spent nearly 2k on a vacation (and another 1k that I chipped in for her to go back home), and figures this is a reasonable spend. 

IMO, her family sees her as a cash cow, and they were extremely unsatisfied with options in vehicles that were 4-5 years older, they really wanted a brand new car, and waited for her to arrive back home so they could guilt trip her into signing for it. I'm pretty choked and I feel like my own financial future is being challenged by her shitty choices, but I'm also not sure that I even approve of the ""our daughter is abroad, of course we can afford X"" attitude. I basically sent her some love over SMS today and told her that I love her, but I'm really worried about her financial choices, and it's getting to me.

I'm half inclined to tell her I can't help with the rest of her finances if she is going to keep making extremely poor choices, I just don't want to send her that information while she's still on vacation but it's eating me up inside.

I (f31) have been friends with Jennifer (f40) and Cristina (f28) for about 5 years. (They are not friends with each other if that’s important). Both are smart, funny and kind. When we first became friends they had some drama in their lives. I didn’t think much of it because it happens. As time went on though I noticed that every time we would hang out almost all our time was spent with them venting/complaining about whatever issues were going on in their lives with little to no time spent on my life. When they would ask it was usually in passing and almost always as a Segway into another topic about them. I hit my breaking point last week when I went to dinner with Jennifer and she spent the entire dinner literally crying about her boyfriend.

Sometimes because of these comments I find myself falling back into old habits and it puts a strain on my relationship.

1620,Not the A-hole,"I had a roommate for 3 years. In those 3 years we never became close friends, but as a roommate she was awesome. Pleasent to be around, clean, tidy, quiet,  etc. There were a few instances where her selfless actions melted my heart (mostly regarding my pets) and she never mentioned it. 


I knew that she had a boyfriend, I met him. He was older, good looking guy, who seemed to be very happy with her. Sometimes they would fight, sometimes I wouldn't see him for weeks, sometimes she wouldn't get out of bed for days etc. As I said, he was happy, sometimes she was happy too. But when he would come, he was very sweet and caring. He would help her with housework (she hated ironing so he would do that), made some food for her etc. They would go on trips together, sometimes they worked together... It is hard to sum up 3 years, but it was real. 


Eventually, he stopped coming and she moved to a new city after her lease was up 


We don't live in a small city, but this is a small world. I guess, his wife knew who was my roommate as she also knew who I was, where I live, which dogs I have, and which car I drive.

She approached me in a big group of women and it took me like an hour to figure out what is going on. She seems to be nice, but in a very  ingenuine way which is hard to explain. She never raised her voice, but she asked me 5 times how was living with a fucking whore. She told me that my roommate was only good for fuck, that those women don't have a class, will never be happy, have mental, and daddy issues. She told me that her husband was with her only for an hour a week so he can get off, that she was a prostitute who didn't get paid, that it meant nothing, that she is ugly, bony girl who will be forever alone.


Honestly, I forgot half of it by now, but I was in shock. The woman wasn't drunk, it was like 9 am and she looked normal.

As i have had enough and I was starting to see red, I tried to leave, but she blocked my way and asked me to confirm her story which I didn't. I did the opposite. I mostly summed up what I have written here. Her face was paler and paler and by that point it was too late to take back what I just said. She didn't say anything back.

I ate with my mom lunch after this and she told me I was 100% heartless and wrong. A few from my friends who met my roommate told me that they would probably do the same as she crossed the line. My roommate is gone for 6 months now, so it's not like the woman just found out about this.

1621,Not the A-hole,"Hi everyone,

I (28M) am making this post because I really don't know what to do. My girlfriend (22F) is my first girlfriend in life. And I don't know if some things are just normal for a relationship to work or if some are just out of line. 

So I received a seasonal gift from my three young staffers at work. This is just a tradition in my country at this time of the year where young people pay their respects to elders (or in my case some kind of mentors). These three girls gifted me two bottles of instant crystallized coffee and a wallet. So I mentioned that to my girlfriend and she wanted me to give her the wallet. To some extent, I can understand her feelings. She also said it out loud to me: she doesn't like the fact that I keep a gift coming from a group of girls. So then I told her that I would get rid of the wallet on my own. Maybe I will donate it to someone. Or regift it to someone. But she couldn't accept it. She would like to have it and get rid of it by herself because she didn't trust me. Then I started to get a little bit mad. It is one thing that I do whatever I want with the said wallet or any other gift that I get. But it seems insulting to the people who give the present that my girlfriend can take over their gift to me and do as she pleases. So for now, I told my girlfriend that we would talk about it later. Maybe she is getting mad at me right now. But I don't want to talk about this whole thing at the moment. 

So please judge my case. Don't hold any punches. Let me know if I am the one who is unreasonable. As I said above, this is my first relationship, and I don't know which things are something I need to work on or which are the ones I have to put my foot down.",98,298,0.94
1622,Not the A-hole,"So my dad drinks and drives, pretty often. He's done it with me and my brother in the car. He always said it was fine because he has a high alcohol tolerance, I never really questioned it because he's always done it. 

But recently one of my friends got hit by a drunk driver (she's alive, just a broken leg and cracked rib) and it made me realise how dangerous it actually is, I feel like an idiot for thinking it was normal. 

I've talked to my dad about it, three times so far, but he's just told me to stop worrying and that he knows his limits. So when he came over smelling like beer and told me he was driving home I tried talking to him about it again, but he insisted on driving. I called the police and told them his licence plate and where he was going, he was pulled over. 

I'm not 100% sure what's going to happen now. At the very least a big fine, at most community service and losing his licence (I think?). 

My mom and brother are very pissed, they told me it's none of my business and that I just got him in a lot of trouble 'for no reason'. That I just should have tried talking to him again. I haven't spoken with my dad since it happened, I don't know if he knows that I called. 

Sidenote: My parents are divorced. I'm 16f and my brother is 18m, if that matters. When my dad came over it was about half past 9 pm and he came home from the bar.

1623,Not the A-hole,"So basically I work a 9-5 pm, M-F office job. It's a pretty intense job so our company avoids us working late as much as we can to avoid burnout and turnover. Yesterday, I worked late for one of three recruiting events my office has ALL year. Due to our pretty great work/life balance, we get lots of recruits.

At the end of the recruiting event, we collected the 300+ attendees' sign-in sheets, resumes, and all that jazz and put it into a big box. My coworker is the one who's supposed to take the box because she's in charge of contacting the recruits for follow-ups but she decided not to and left early. She then texts me asking ""Hey, sorry had to run early to get home! Can you grab the papers and put them into the box? You can leave them in your car and I'll grab them from you. Ur the best!"" I tell her sure, and the rest of us who are cleaning up (including one VP) are kinda annoyed with her since she always does this, as far as I can remember. She doesn't have kids and lives on her own, so we weren't sure why she always has to run home early without telling anyone until it’s too late. 

Anyway, this super-heavy box with the papers and sign-in sheets is in my car after the VP helped me load it. We work in a city so parking SUCKS, but our company provides free parking about a 15-minute walk away from the office. My coworker's husband works for the city and she has this weird ""permit"" sticker on her car so she can park (basically) anywhere in the city, including right in front of our office where no one else can park. When I walked into work this morning, she asks me where the box is. I tell her I didn't bring it since she said she would get it from my car. She says it's ""common sense"" to have brought it myself and tells me to go back and get it. I tell her ""No, your mistake does not constitute an emergency on my part. We agreed that I would put it in my car and that you would take it from there. I'm not okay with changing the terms after the fact.""

1625,Not the A-hole,"My brother recently announced that she is a woman to me, my brother, and my sister-in-law. She has not told my father or mother yet, and I think she hasn’t told any of the extended family either. I was especially taken aback at the time because I was living with her in a rented house and this was a very out-of-the-blue announcement.

I texted her afterward and asked how long she had been feeling like this. She responded that she knew she had been non-binary for about a year and then three months before, her pronouns had “clicked.” Afterward, there was no further discussion of it. I have reservations about her decision to come out so quickly after having realized it because our family (other than us kids) is fairly conservative. But I haven’t said anything about it because I didn’t want to step on her toes or question her feelings.

I recently just moved out of the house we shared and across the country. About two weeks after I moved, I received a group text message where she announced what her new name would be.

Backstory—both me and my brother received family names (first and middle name) after our grandparents. I go by a nickname for my first name, and so did she before she decided to change her name. I didn’t really like my middle name growing up, but more and more, it’s grown on me. I really appreciate it as my own personal family heirloom, and I love that I was named after my grandmother.

So my brother texts us that she has chosen my middle name as her first name and well as my cat’s name as her middle name. I replied, “You’re taking my name?” She then told me that I’m not using the name because I go by a nickname. Her other reasoning is that it gives a similar rhythm as her old name, and the alternative name does not suit her.

I got really angry at the comment that I am not using my middle name. When replying, she said that she “offered it first name status and it chose me.” When I said that everything I have (birth certificate, drivers license, etc.) shows that I’m still using my middle name, she never responded and has been refusing to speak to me since.

Last night, I get another text saying that she has chosen to go by the chosen middle name—which is the same name as my cat—but she hasn’t rechosen her first name. 

My bf says that this is just another case of my brother being an asshole (which she definitely has been in the past).

I don’t want to be labeled as transphobic or make her feel like I don’t support her life decisions. But it’s my name, our parents gave it to me, and I find it ridiculous that I have to explain to a person that she shouldn’t take my name. It also feels very disrespectful to me that when I said I wasn’t ok with her taking it, she didn’t care.

1627,Not the A-hole,"Hey all, long-time lurker here. This has been mulling over in my mind for about a week now, and I just want to see what others have to say. Here goes:

I live in an area that is pedestrian heavy. This is not a problem, actually it is good to see so many people out walking. However, I have noticed that when groups of people walk on a sidewalk together, they refuse to make space for a single walker almost 90% of the time. I find myself walking, minding my own business, and suddenly a group of three people are walking towards me taking up the entire sidewalk. 

In my mind, one of them should drop back and let me have at least enough space to walk by. This almost NEVER happens. Instead, I am forced to step into whatever grass/street/mud happens to be next to me. It is just aggravating enough to stick with me, and because it happens so frequently I found myself wondering: WIBTA if I just refused to move over?

Now, the reason I'm wondering is because I would almost always run into a person's shoulder. Not a full-on tackle, but at six feet I'm not a small person. I don't want to throw my shoulder into someone, but still give them that little tap to make them realize they should be willing to get over...

This just happened today. A little bit of context: my gf and I work on the same place and it's located far away from where we leave and the only way to get there is either by company bus or by car. Usually we take the first one but due to a special situation, we are taking my car to work.

Important to mention that she tends to be really late to any appointments. Sometimes I'd wait for two hours until she is ready. we have had a lot of discussions on the matter and she always promises me to be on time but not all the time she is true to her word.

Anyhow, yesterday I told her that I wanted to leave at 5:20 sharp. With or without her. She agreed (I don't know of she was serious or not) and we went to sleep. 
I've told her the same sometimes in the past but in the end I waited a few minutes then we leave. This time she woke up late and took a shower. By 5:20 she was just closing the water. I waited a few minutes while sipping a coffee, she came to me wrapped up in towels direct to kiss me, I responded and told her that we were late, she answered with a soft laugh and dismissed it as usual. 
I got upset and thought that if I did nothing, this would continue to happen.

So I went to her room and told her that I was sorry, but that we agreed on an hour and that I needed to stand up for myself. She told me it was fine and that she would take the bus instead.

I drove to work quite proud of myself. When I arrived, she texted me that she had missed the bus and would have to take an uber. She ended up paying 450 MXN (~23 USD) and arriving late. By her way of texting she was clearly pissed.

1629,Not the A-hole,"My step-dad did some illegal things to me as a child and, when I spoke up about it as a teenager, my mother had already had a child with him and was a SAHM with 2 children from a previous relationship, and my step-dad was emotionally, financially and mentally abusive to her, so they decided that therapy was the best route instead of legal action.

Therapy was basically a coercion to get over it, not let my younger sibling know what was going on, and move on with my life. The therapist used a lot of persuasive language to encourage me to ""forgive and heal"" which, years later, my step-dad uses as a justification for his behaviour. He has not done any therapy since and refuses to acknowledge what he did or what his actions make him.

My family (mom, step-sister and bio-sister) have all moved forward with their lives, while I have really struggled, especially since I am a firm believer in consequences and the bettering of one's self. My mom finally left my step-dad, but she refuses to engage with me when I talk about what happened to me.

For years, while I was severely depressed, everyone would scoff at me and say, ""You need to move past this or do something about it,"" but it was a bluff, because they knew a teenager would never want to carry the responsibility of breaking up a family.

Right now I still live at home with my mother and my younger sibling. I am in university and entering a great job, and I'm ready to do something about this man. Even if it is a settlement, I want him to seek help and address his problem(s) to prevent any future victims, and if he refuses then I will go the full-blown legal route (statute of limitations has been lifted in my country).

A part of me feels like I need to warn my family about it, but they have offered no support in the past and I feel they would probably find a way to discourage me, for my younger sibling's sake. I love my family, but they have Stockholm Syndrome when it comes to this terrible man who ruined my life, and they don't see him as a monster, just a bad man who did bad things many years ago. WIBTA for not warning or informing them?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Re-reading my post and your comments, it feels like a validation post, and it is bringing tears to my eyes that not a single person called me out on it or ridiculed me for needing the affirmation or validation. You guys pulled together and offered me so much strength, and I am so moved and grateful. I have carried a lot of self-doubt and self-loathing over this, and I knew I would be alone if I ever took legal action, so having all of you at my back makes a world of difference. Thank you. Thank you so, so much.

To the people talking about potential future victims, I hear you. It keeps me up at night. Every member of my family can acknowledge that they will never trust my step-dad with their children, so you are right in saying something needs to be done.

As for the people coming after my mom, you are both right and wrong. I live in South Africa, the rape capital of the world. Last I checked, our prosecution stats for rape were something like 3%. My mom is a survivor herself, of much worse abuse, and her family treated her terribly for it. She thought my step-dad was a good man, so she gave up her career and built a family with him. He went on to destroy her and wield money over her, in a country that is already riddled with poverty and unemployment; a single, unemployed mother of 3 would struggle immensely.

We have spent many years rebuilding our relationship (she is paying for my university, partially as reparations) and I acknowledge that she was a victim in her marriage. My youngest sibling is the kid that they got it ""right"" with, and we have all found ourselves making sacrifices to give him everything we couldn't have, like a home with both of his parents. What my mother did wasn't right, but she did what she believed was her best, and also what was advised by a qualified psychologist. It will always hurt, but the adult in me sees the complexity of the situation. I don't believe she doesn't love me, but I resent that she didn't choose me.

That all being said, thank you for the strength you have given me. I hope to move forward with purpose and courage.

To the people who have been through something similar, my heart breaks for you, but I am proud of you for still being here and living your truth. You've all offered me so much insight and advice, and I am grateful beyond words. Thank you, all of you.",102,760,0.96

1631,No A-holes here,"For context, my boyfriend had an ex-girlfriend left him for a girl. From what I can tell, he really liked her, and her coming out as a lesbian really hurt him. He used to get teased a lot about it (some of his friends liked to say that he was “so bad at sex that he turned his ex off of all men”), so it also damaged his ego.

I’m a very physically affectionate person. I like to cuddle with my female friends when we have movie nights. I have a large beanbag in my flat; whenever I have my girls over, we all cuddle up on it with blankets and popcorn to watch Netflix. I am straight. So are my friends. From how I see it, we’re not doing anything inappropriate. 

My boyfriend didn’t see it this way. He said that it was weird, and that I shouldn’t be “so intimate” with platonic friends. He made the argument that if cuddling platonic male friends is considered inappropriate, the same should apply to females. He said that he didn’t want me to cuddle with my friends anymore.

1632,Not the A-hole,"Strap in friendos this is gonna be a long and convoluted one. 

So I [20M] slept with a woman 6 or 7 times over the course of a month a little bit more than a year ago. We met on Tinder, where she said she was 22 and single. Turned out, she was 27 and engaged. Her fiancé found out she'd been seeing other people and dumped her, I dumped her for lying to me. However, the fiancé gave her a second chance when she announced she was pregnant and said it was his. From the get go, I had my suspicions the kid was mine and asked her as much. She admitted it could be, given the dates, but that it didn't matter because she and her fiancé were gonna raise the child as there's, regardless. I told her I wanted to be involved if it's my kid and she flat told me no.

So the baby gets born and she's a little girl. As of right now, she's three months old and I'm convinced more than ever that she's my kid. I've seen pictures of her on Facebook and that and she looks just like I do in my baby pictures. Further, if she isn't mine she's definitely not the fiancés. He's black, baby's mum is white, this kid is very clearly not mixed race. The mother insisted that I was the only person she cheated with and if that's true...this must be my baby, right? 

Honestly, it breaks my heart that I have a kid I'm not allowed to be involved with. I've tried talking to the mother about it and she shuts me down saying I've no proof I'm the father and therefore can't do anything. WIBTA if I demanded a paternity test and pursued trying to see this kid? I'm conflicted because on the one hand I've always wanted to be a dad and I hate the idea that I have a kid out there I'll never meet. On the other, I'm not trying to hurt her fiancé or anything.

**Due to the original post being a mess and feeling the need to add many edits, i'll just rewrite the post to better explain myself. I do apologise for any inconvenience and confusion, i'll try to make it a lot more clear and detailed (without mentioning anyone's name or other personal info that might cause some people to be able to identify the people in the story)** 

This story involves me (18F), my sister (20F), my sister's fiancé (21M) as well as my younger brother (16M) and my parents who are both above 50 years old. For some reason some people find this information important so i'm adding it here. 

&#x200B;

My sister has been in a long distance relationship for about 3-4 years, that i'm aware of at least. This man that she is dating lives on the other side of the globe from where we live. **My sister nor my family has ever met this man in person and my sister is the only one speaking to him at all**. My sister and her fiancé video chat a lot and I have seen him every now and then because my sister likes to video chat wherever she goes. Outside, kitchen, bathroom, everywhere, but I pay them no mind. Despite the fact that we do not know this man whatsoever, I mean my dad fouhnd out what his name was a few days ago, my sister insists on calling us ""his family"" and usually provides a sob story about his living conditions and that he is the black sheep of his family. 

Side note: I don't like this guy, because he and my sister went on a crusade to separate me and my ex who were a guy in my age who was from Germany. They would both spam my inbox with ""proof"" that he is a nazi, a jew (as if it was a bad thing?), would call me a naziwhore and my sister would throw a tantrum if I would not break up with my partner. I spoke with the fiancé and he fully supported my sister. I was having none of it and blocked them both out of social media and my life. He also likes to share and tag memes and posts which includes violance and the right to abuse and rape women. My brother is friend with fiancé on facebook and if they tag eachother in a comment or post it sometimes appear to brothers friends, my parents happen to be friends with my brother on facebook. That was a few years ago though, and people can change.

Over a year ago I found out that my sister got engaged to his fiancé, he proposed via skype and then sent the ring which my sister claim is a 4 carat gold ring. He has given her many more expensive gifts. I thought nothing of it, and thought that they were going to split up before they actually got to get married due to the distance and their on and off relationship. They would break up for a week, then get back together, then it would be a few days, then breaking up, back together a few weeks after that etc. etc. etc. Recently I found out that my sisters fiancé is going to ""visit"" my sister in our country. A few days ago I was told by my sister that they're going to get married once he arrives in our country in less than 3 weeks and apply for a partnership visa and become a citizen of my country. I would be alright if he had somwhere to stay, however, he has not booked a hotel or has a friend to stay with and he has no money to book a hotel. My sister has convinced him that he can stay with us in our apartment. However, she has yet to mention this to our parents. I took it upon myself to tell them a few days ago because I suspect that she is going to demand that he stays with us the day/hours before he arrives in our country and my parents will feel obligated to take him into our home so that he doesnt live on the street. She has done this before and my parents have given in a few times to skip the drama. My parents know nothing of this man, nor do I other than how he has treated me in the past. He could have changed though and be the nicest man on earth, I cant tell, but i'm really not comfortable with having him in our apartment 24/7. 

To the question, would I be the asshole if I told my sister that I do not want to be called ""his family"" whether or not they're married. Am I in the wrong as to not want anything to do with the guy, or should I give him a chance?",94,132,0.84
1634,Everyone Sucks,"Im not sure how to start this but appreciate any advice. Excuse formatting as i am on mobile. 

My husband and I have been together 3 years. While i am definitely more ambitious than he is, that has never been an issue and i appreciate his consitency to my crazy. 

Two years ago i took a job in a specialized field thay paid decently. At this point, i am earning about 15k higher than my husband, but paying 80% of our shared bills (he has student loans and i do not) . 

To put it llightly, i am unhappy at work. I work long hours, and then immediately come home to cook (husband does not, but does yard work and laundry which we decided was a fair trade off) and then straight to bed. I am exhausted.

By contrast, my husband works a lower paying nonprofit job. He doesnt enjoy the work but they pretty much let him do whatever he wants and provide him ample vacation time so its a win. He could earn much more but enjoys the perks that this job affords him. 

I am stressed to the max, and while i have been looking for comparable work, i cannot afford to take a paycut of any kind which has crippled my job search, as i work in a specialty and hiring has been slow here. When i have previously expressed my frustration feeling trapped in supporting our family while being so miserable, my husband tells me to go see a therapist (i do) and talk it out. 

Last night i snapped and told him his therapist recommendations arent helping, and that what would really help is if he got a job that took some pressure off of me. For context, earlier this year he was promoted and told me he would be helping me out more with bills, and then promptly put his pay raise into his retirement and carried on status quo. He also does a job that IS hiring in our area, but is happy in his current situation (which i genuinely dont want to take away from him). 

He got quiet when i said this, and left the room. I feel somewhat relieved to have said it, but also feel like a complete jerk for having brought it up at all. I don't want him to be miserable, but feel like hes not empathetic to my side. 

Reddit please give me some clarity, am i the asshole?

Edit for clarity: we have discussed this before and he shuts down every time, last night I was crying and explaining why Im stressed and he was continuing to skirt the issue/not respond, and finally said ""thanks for sharing"",  which is why I snapped. As for myself, I have tried cutting back on hours and was threatened with termination for ""being unavailable"".",578,2191,0.95
1635,No A-holes here,"I (25F) have lived in my apartment for two years and have a new (21M) roommate. Very quickly after moving in, our shared bathroom became increasingly dirty - orange/pink stains in toilet bowl, dirty tissues in the trash. Our waste also increased exponentially. I started peeking into the trash to see how we’re going through a bag a day and it was filled with empty cookie boxes, cookie dough packaging, frosting containers, candy wrappers, canned diet drinks and more. He will have amazon deliver 5 sheets of tollhouse cookie dough, I’ll watch him unpack it, see it in the freezer - and the next morning it’s all gone and wrappers are buried in the trash. 

I’m convinced he’s binging and purging in the middle of the night. From a selfish POV, it’s his life but the bathroom is disgusting and the waste is not only terrible for the environment but our wallets since myself and our third roommate are paying more to replace items more frequently because of his consumption habits. I’ve gone into the bathroom on mornings where there’s vomit on the floor and in the trash cans. After asking if he got sick and was okay, he said he took too strong of an edible and had to be asked twice to clean it up. This is a regular occurrence - at least every other night and regularly every weekend. 

Is his blatant disregard to hide his ED a cry for help? He’s very distant and insecure so bringing this up would have to be a planned intervention and I don’t want things to escalate and do want him to seek help.

1639,Not the A-hole,"My former husband (42) came out as a transsexual woman last year. As a male he had recently started to get into crossdressing but assured me it was just a fetish, so I was taken by surprise when he came out as he was always a very traditional, masculine guy. She (now Laura) has not started HRT yet but is living fulltime as a woman. Laura and I no longer live together but we share custody of my son (10).

Ever since I moved out and Laura has started living on her own, she has started to dress in extreme clothing. She's gone from wearing relatively normal dresses and skirts to microminis, fishnets, big heels, the full nines, and bold makeup too. Laura is a tall woman (6'4 or so) so in the heels she is very visible and this is what had brought on my current issue.

I am fine with what Laura wants to wear privately but my son is having an extremely hard time with it, especially when it comes to her picking him from school or taking him out for food. Recently he had a breakdown over it and told me that it was so bad he didn't even want to go to school anymore, and that everyone knew him as the ""drag queens son"".

I tried to talk about this privately to Laura, but she gave me the cold shoulder over the phone. My son asked me to come out with him next meeting so we could bring it up together there. The moment she walked in all eyes were on us because of what she was wearing. People were obviously listening and when I gently tried to bring up the topic and explain how our son was feeling, Laura became incredibly loud and angry over it and accused me of feeding my son lines because I was jealous of her confidence. To make matters worse, a table of nearby girls decided to join in and hurl abuse at me and tell me that I was a piece of shit for saying what I was. My son and I left in tears but Laura did not seem to give a single damn about how distraught he was and seemed to just be loving all the attention.

Ever since then I've been torn wondering if my own personal feelings are getting in the way of things and I was a bad person for asking Laura to tone things down, especially given she felt she had to repress herself for so many years. I'm extremely shaken by having a group of complete strangers step in and wonder if I've gotten old and out of touch. It just breaks my heart to see my son becoming so withdrawn and upset over this.

I made the mistake of telling my mom(55f) how much my husband made when he got a new job because I was excited about it.  I've tried explaining to all 3 of my siblings(35m, 32m, 22f) and mother that making more money equates to spending more money,  plus,  I'm in school and we're paying out of pocket for it which they know. 

I have helped most of my family out with money when they ask, whenever I'm able to because I do care.

1642,Not the A-hole,"My (20F) family is a very health conscious family and have always been this way. We all do varying amounts of exercise between us and all eat healthy. To give some context when I was in my early teens I was heavily depressed and used to over-eat as a coping mechanism, and I did become over-weight and unhealthy, so in the past this has been an issue for me. But I started eating healthier, going to gym regularly and lost weight over the coming years. I now go to gym 4-5 times a week, two of which are PT sessions, doing a mix of high intensity cardio and strength training, I eat very healthy and will only drink once or twice a month at most (I am legal where I live). I am not what would be considered skinny or slim, I have big thighs and a very curvy figure. But I am well within the healthy weight and BMI limited for my age/height and have done more precise body scans that also show all my levels are perfectly normal.

My mum has always made comments about how much I eat, how I look, what I should eat etc. since I can remember but recently it has increased. I can't go a day with having her commenting on how I wasn't as skinny as I was, or if I should be wearing what I am. She constantly holds the fact I used to be over-weight over my head and it feels like refuses to see the progress I've made. She has now made me go on this very strict diet and says I am not allowed to go off it for the next 3 months, even though I've expressed how much I hate it and how upset it makes me feel. I have tried talking to her previously about the hurtful comments she makes but she says she's only saying it because she is concerned for my health.

Since then I have started to distance myself from her, I avoid her at home and often will leave the house if she is there. I rarely talk to her now and only do it out of necessity. I am considering moving out because of how ashamed and uncomfortable she makes me feel about myself. Both my boyfriend and Dad say I should try talking about it to her again, but I feel that it isn't my responsibility to fix this but hers and I don't want to put myself in more mental harms way. It's getting to the point where I am starting to dislike her and not wanting to keep in contact with her once I move out.

While we were on vacation we saw a post on my daughter's Instagram that looked like her hand with an engagement ring.  We decided to wait until we go home to talk to her about it, but my ex-wife texted me later that day and said we needed to talk about the wedding.  I replied that there wasn't much to talk about if my daughter and her fiance weren't even going to tell me, and that I wasn't on board with her getting married as soon as she turned 18.  Two days later my ex-wife replied by telling me I shouldn't take the opportunity to have her dad walk her down the isle.  Again I said that our daughter should be the one texting me if she wants me to know.  5 minutes later my daughter texts me and we make plans to sit down and talk , my wife and I, her and her fiance.

We meet at our house and tell them we are completely against them getting married because she is so young, and if you know anything about the JW religion you know that once married women are stuck with the man they marry regardless of what he does as long as he asks forgiveness from the elders.  He could beat her or their future children, cheat on her, molest the children, you get it, and there is nothing she can do as long as he goes to the elders and says he's sorry.  We do not want this for our daughter, she is a bright, smart, headstrong young woman that we saw going on to do great things, not being a subservient wife strapped with a gaggle of kids with no way to get out.  TL;DR - We think she is making a HUGE mistake.  However, at the end of the conversation we said we would be at the wedding and would help them with a little bit of money because as a father, like any man with a daughter, I always wanted to walk my little girl down the isle.

And you know, “Asian Parenting"" is quite real so our mother(father is barely home) is very strict with us, always comparing us and trying to pit us against each other. Fortunately we are quite close despite constant bickering and small fights. 


In recent months my brother's grades fell and he also gained weight due to puberty(or stress eating? I don’t know). My mother had been calling him “fat pig"" and “gross"" and the likes on any fault she found on him, and sometimes it resulted in a shouting match between them.


Me on the other hand, got spoilt intentionally in front of my brother to make him feel bad. Mother would gift me extra allowance and later curfew while my brother would be confined into his room studying. Whenever I asked mother why would she do that to him, she said that boys should be trained to be stronger, and he will learn to improve this way. I don’t agree with this, I just find it unfair that she would treat us both so differently, so I went to my brother and taught him a way to be passive aggressive against mother.


Whenever mother insults him in front of me, he would in turn, insult me in front of her(which we both know we don’t mean it). It would make mother so mad every time as she thought that he was bullying me. Then she will get the response from him that “What hurts more? When a brother insults his sister or when a mother insults her own son?” Once, twice, many times, and now it’s become a behaviour pattern. If she scolds him, he scolds me. If she strikes him, he strikes me(much lesser impact ofcourse).


While mother did lessened her insults towards my brother, she seemed to resent him more and more. Nowadays mother and brother barely even talks to each other. I begin to wonder if I really ruined the remains of a little relationship with my silly idea. Brother does not blame me, he said he agreed to it himself, but I do think I screwed up.

Things were going really well until he started speaking in extremely rude tones to my own team. Without revealing too much about my job, he would speak down to my team, would put his hand in their faces when he wanted to interrupt them, and would snatch things out of their hands. Meanwhile, he continued to do his job well enough to earn him employee of the month. Trying to support my team, I went to his department head with my complaints, letting him know that I didn't appreciate how my own department was being treated by his ""star employee"". Nothing changed so I ended up taking my concerns to HR as he continued to be more boldly disrespectful of my team. 

One day, my team was talking about how awful this guy was to work with when one of the girls in my department (we can call her Molly) mentioned  in a casual way that he said some pretty sexual things to her that made her a bit uncomfortable. I asked for clarification and she told me that he had made comments about her body and had said that our department has ""the sexiest women"". She said she had made it clear that his advances weren't welcome and joked that she constantly avoided him now and that maybe she should report him for sexual harassment. 

As a manager, I've been trained to take sexual harassment mentions straight to HR, so of course I did so. When Molly got an email requesting an HR meeting regarding this, she went off on me. I am currently up for a promotion and she said that I had just always had it out for Robert and was trying to leverage this into a promotion by trying to make it look like I was such a great boss. Now, Molly has a husband and kids and the comments he was making were NOT okay. When I went to HR I genuinely wasn't thinking of myself or my career progression (in fact, his department head is pretty well connected in the industry and the entire thing could have really backfired on me) I was just trying to keep my work environment a healthy one for my team. Molly, however, insists that she can no longer trust me and my motivations were entirely self-serving. 

Robert didn't end up getting fired for this but was asked to stay away from Molly and asked other people in his department to ask her why she would do this to him. He was fired yesterday, however, due to his disrespectful attitude toward other members of staff.

1654,Not the A-hole,"The title probably doesn’t make me look good, and honestly it might be a sign that I’m the asshole here and just being petty to be petty.


To start, my family is pretty strict and sort  of “traditional”. Specifically, for this situation, when it comes to the roles girls have vs boys when cleaning/cooking. My sister and I were taught, ever since we were small, how to cook and clean. I distinctly remember when I was younger being belittled if it wasn’t up to their standards.


So when it comes to holiday dinners, I have a memory I can’t shake because I’m still bitter about it. This was the order of events for that day (17 year old me):


-Had to get up around 5am to help open where I worked because I was scheduled on Christmas Eve.

-Closed around noon, went home and found out I had to help cook Christmas dinner pretty much right then.

-By the end of it my sister and I were the only ones cooking while everyone else drank and talked, Turkey was left to me by the end.

-We eat dinner. By this time, I’m exhausted. With the addition of being stuffed, I wanted to pass out. 
-Got directed by my mom to start picking up the dishes and clearing the table since everyone was done.

-Somehow it turned into me putting the food away into containers and then the fridge, loading the dishwasher, washing the dishes that didn’t fit, cleaning the kitchen and stove, and sweeping. 

-My sister helped a little bit at the beginning, but she pulled the “I’m older” card and sat down with the family to chat. 

-My 2 cousins (5th grade), did nothing except brin gab me their dishes (which I mean, cheers my dudes).

-I was almost to tears because I was so tired, I asked my uncle who went into the kitchen to grab a drink, for help and he looked around and told me “you’ve basically got it” and walked out.

-As the cherry on top, when I was done I laid down on the couch only to have my cousins blast a horn at my face and as I stormed away, it was to the lovely sound of my family’s laughter.


**TLDR;** lowkey toxic family took for granted that I cooked for holiday dinners and cleaned afterwards, and didn’t help when I asked. I don’t live with them, and now I have low contact. 

**Extra info:** I don’t live with my family and haven’t for almost 2 years, I don’t depend on them for anything, when I moved out it was rough they called me a burden, and I pay them back weekly for debts I owe them.

**So Reddit, WIBTA** if after dinner, if my high school aged male cousins aren’t expected to clean and I’m the one expected (not nicely asked, expected) to clean and the “help” I get is minimal, I leave and tell them why? Or leave and not say why unless asked?",38,51,0.85
1655,Not the A-hole,"So a couple of hours from our town is a place with 8 or so mazes. They’re super fun and last time I went there with friends we actually got lost in one for half an hour because they’re huge and quite difficult. I suggested it as a date location for my boyfriend and I so we headed there over the weekend. It should’ve taken up a good portion of our day. Well, because he’s tall, he decided to get on his tippy toes and peek over the hedges of the mazes to see the path out. We completed all 8 mazes within half an hour. It ruined all the fun and felt like a waste of time even travelling out there (it’s a 2.5 hour drive one way). He could tell I was being quiet so I told him he kind of ruined the day by cheating and sucking out all the fun of it. He told me I was being stupid and childish. AITA for being annoyed at something so ‘silly’?

Maybe it's because I(30yr M) grew up before flu shots were a thing, but I don't feel that I should be required to have a shot to hang out with them. If they are worried about their kid they should get a sitter and leave him at home.

My gf got pissed and said I was being unreasonable because the flu shot was inexpensive and you can easily get them at a CVS. I am all about vaccinations, but I am not a fan of being told I need to do something for someone else's peace of mind.

Edit:

Quick edit, that I thought was obvious. I am not going to go if the baby will be there, and I don't have my shot. I don't want to get a baby sick/possibly die. I may still be the A\*\*hole, but I am not heartless.

1657,Not the A-hole,"My (22f) parents separated when I was a baby so I have no memory of them ever being together. Although for the most part that has been great because it's not something I've ever wanted or missed, (they could not be more opposite - I dont actually understand how I was conceived) Christmas has always been a point of contention. 

At first they would take it in turns every year but once I started working that became more difficult, especially because my mam and dad live in a different country. My bio-mum and my mam were always controlling about it, trying to convince me to go to their respective houses every year. I know its great that they want to spend time with me and I love them alot but it's also an immense amount of pressure to consistently have to tell them no because it's not their turn only for them to get upset about it all over again.

Last year I went to my dads and the year before I was at my biomums. I just finished up my masters degree and I decided that I didnt want to have to choose and wanted to do something for myself this Christmas with my boyfriend. My new job also gives us both time off around then so it meant we would be able to take a 2 week holiday over the Christmas break while only using three days of our holiday allowance each.

I know it's not that much of a high difference but it's there. he is constantly shorter then me (like the top of his head is at my eyebrows) because he slouches almost all the time! The only time he dosnt slouch is when he plays the trumpet. While his posture isn't perfect it's still really good, and he just looks so handsome and confident.

Anyway today I was talking to him and he was complaining that he was short and he couldn't wait until he had a growth spert. I told him that he could be like 3 inches taller if he just stood up straight. He just kinda laughed it off and said well that's probably never going to happen. But I was dead serious and I told him all the risks of having bad posture (chronic back pain, spinal dysfunction, muscle deterioration) I also told him that when hes an old man he'll have a hunch back. I told him the steps he could take to get better posture. He got really defensive and said that it was a problem for another day. I wanted to tell him that was a horrible way of thinking but my friend cut me off and said I need to respect his opinion.

1667,Not the A-hole,"I work for a youth shelter in their human resources department. These kids come to us in really shitty situations and my sole job is to find staff with the education and experience that can help these kids. I go through a lot of really bad applications a week; no experience, no training, people just throwing their resumes out there to see what lands. They're a waste of my time (any recruiter's time, really).

&#x200B;

One day I'm going through applications and I see a really familiar name. I do some digging and I realize it's a girl that went to high school with me. She was a couple grades below me but I knew the name. Here's where my pickle is: her Facebook, and her lifestyle in general, is an HR nightmare. Something important to note is that we're not Facebook friends; she has her account set to public. Sexually suggestive photos, posts about violence and sex, and constantly using the n-word. That last one is an issue to me for two reasons, 1) she's white and thinks that because she has two mixed race babies she has the right to use that word (which I 100% disagree with), and 2) we have a lot of black kids that come through this shelter, and if she's using that language so casually on Facebook what's going to stop her from calling a kid that to his face? I can't let that happen and I can't take that risk.

&#x200B;

So I'm immediately thinking, she's out. Gone. Do not pass go, do not collect $200. But then I think, what if I didn't know her from high school or social media? What if her account was private and I saw none of this? (This is where I side note and say please, for the love of God, make your social media accounts private. Jobs really are looking at what you post.) She has pretty decent experience from where she was working before; if I didn't know her would I have called her and hired her?

&#x200B;

I get my associates to look at her application and they say call her. I wanted to ask them so there were in fact non-judgemental eyes on her app. So I called her, three times, on Friday, Monday and Tuesday. I leave messages two out of the three times. I never hear back from her. That's what finally pushes me over the edge to DQ her, because I gave her several chances to talk to me for an interview and I never hear back, and that's very disrespectful to someone who is actively trying to give you a job. So I send her an email letting her know we've moved in a different direction. She emails me back a day later being extremely rude, asking me why I called her if I wasn't interested in hiring her, all these red flags. I just responded that we had moved on to other candidates and thanked her for her application. I wasn't rude or confrontational or petty about it at all.

So here's what I'm asking: am I the asshole for making preconceived notions about a job candidate? Did I let her reputation precede her or did I give her an honest shot?",23,30,0.88
1668,Not the A-hole,"So my (25F) best friend (27F) and I worked together until I was fired (office politics). This happened about the same time that her husband (33M) was given a terminal cancer diagnosis.

At this time I still had a little saved up and even though I was unemployed I was comfortable enough that I asked if she needed to borrow any money just for their first medical payments. BFF refused but then came back a month later asking to borrow 2k. Being that she is my best friend, I told her yes, and let her know that she could pay me back slowly as I knew money would be tight. I brought it up once a few months ago and she seemed really positive about paying me back soon.

During this time I am finishing off my Associates and just got accepted into my dream program at my dream University. (Which is quite expensive). Her husband was also given really good news during this time after very successful chemo and surgery. So, as it's been 6 months since I lent her the money, I send her a text that read as follows:

""Hey. I know it's probably not a good time, which is why there is no rush, but I just found out my cost for my first semester and it's a little over 9k... I've gotten myself an online part time job but it's not enough to cover a payment plan. Is there any way for us to find a way for you to slowly pay me back? I don't mean to nag but I'm just in a tight spot... Of course I don't want you to put yourself in a bad position either. Just let me know if there is anything that works for you.""

Her response:

""I will try my best. But you have to understand that Husband hasn't worked since August. I have been paying for everything on my paycheck alone. I'm not deliberately avoiding paying you and I do owe you the money. But I have to be honest, it's a little frustrating that you've asked me twice now knowing our situation. You are afforded the luxury of not having to pay for much other than a phone bill. And I can guarantee you have more in your bank account than I do. ""

After this I explained to her that I do pay rent, groceries, gas, and have had some medical issues recently. I also reiterated that I don't want it back now, I just want us to get something set up so I at least feel a little more secure as I go to school. I was honestly trying to be nice, but the conversation quickly deteriorated and she ended up saying that if she were in my situation she wouldn't have expected me to pay her back.

So, AITA for asking her for 2k back? I acknowledge that she is struggling but to me that is a significant amount of money.

Edit 1: Thank you all for your responses. I totally agree that I am an idiot for lending her the money. I have never lent anyone a dime in my life and have learned why it is not a good idea , at least without some sort of contract. I ignorantly assumed that since we are friends that it wouldn't be an issue. It was also inappropriate for me to compare expenses, and rather childish. I regret that I even brought it up, but I did... However, I don't expect her to pay right away. In my first message I specifically mentioned that I didn't want to put her in a worse place and to only do what worked for her. As for getting another job to cover the tuition... I am getting in state tuition which is the cheapest, managed to scrape together some scholarships, am currently going to school full time, have a part time nannying job during the day and just started an online part time job as well. If I had the free time for another job, I would get one.

Edit 2: I didn't ever think I would get into Uni. Last year my GPA was a 1.5 and I was on academic suspension, this was a long shot for me. I also didn't ask for the money back because her husband was suddenly not terminal. I asked because we had talked about it previously and had a positive conversation where she stated that she believed she would be able to start paying me back soon. Again, I don't want this money right away, just whenever she is able to make it work.

Final Edit: I will definitely never lend money again unless I am prepared to lose it! Obviously I learned this the expensive way! Some of you had some great points that I shouldn't have brought up my own happiness with school, and that I should have chosen my timing better. I did reach out to her an apologize for being insensitive but it appears she has blocked me on social media and is not responding to my texts. Hopefully this has a happy ending, but I think it might be best to forget about the money. I will start writing scholarship essays. Thank you all!",218,1080,0.96
1669,No A-holes here,"So, for my 19th birthday, I want to have a 1920s theme party, where everyone dresses up and it’s kinda like a speakeasy. My dad is helping me throw it and he and my stepmom are dressing up and helping me with my outfit and makeup. All of my guests are dressing up too.

1670,Not the A-hole,"So, here's the backstory to it.

I've been with my bf for almost 4 years now. In all this time together we have bonded really well together. We get along amazing and I would truly describe him as the perfect man. If there wasn't this only subject bothering me so much. His family.

And what bothers me about it is the fact that I don't know them. It's not like they live really far away and we can't meet. We literally live in the same city. Big city. Yes. But doesn't make it impossible to work it out.

He comes from a big family, he is the 5th of 7 siblings. So most of them are already married and have children.

His mom passed away when we were 2 years into our relationship. He didn't bother to tell me (I know it's his mom and he doesn't have to tell me immediately) but  I literally found out 3 days after when a friend that's not even close to none of us (or even to his family) texted me asking why I wasn't at the funeral when they were there (they told me the day of). I immediately texted my bf asking if he was ok and if he would like me to stop by to support him, to which he responded saying he didn't want me there but instead he would prefer to take me out for dinner (we went out while they were cremating his mother). We ate, talked about it, he cried and I gave him all the support I could before he left to go home. 
I have asked him several times why he didn't tell me about his mom, he basically called me selfish about wanting to make his mom dying into something about me (I didn't, i just asked why he didn't tell me about it and had to figure it out from someone else)

Also, it's not that he has a bad relationship with them. Sometimes he'll talk about them and his nephews. Even when we chat and he is with them he might send pics of the kids doing funny stuff.

I'm the other side, he has already met my parents and they love him, so do my siblings. He has even stayed with us at my parents home. (In a different room of course, because my parents are really old fashioned and traditional)

When he comes over and stays at my parents he tells his family he is going somewhere else rather than telling them we are together. He has even said his father thinks he is gay for not having a girlfriend. Because yeah, no one in his family knows we've been dating for over 4 years. Once we casually encountered one of his cousins and he introduced me as a friend. 

After all this time together, we have started talking about moving in together, getting engaged, getting married and even having children. He has been open with me telling me he is already looking for a ring and asking for my size. Whenever he chooses to propose I want it to be surprise, but I already know that will happen.

However, knowing about it and thinking about planning a wedding, I honestly don't feel comfortable with inviting people that I barely know their names. Because yeah, we already kind of talked about it and it seems I won't meet his family until the literal day of my wedding.

Weddings are supposed to be to share with your loved ones. But how can you share something with someone you don't even know?

AITA for wanting to meet them prior to our wedding? Or am I just being paranoid about it since it really makes me upset he doesn't want to introduce me to them.

Update: 
No, we aren't different races and this is not a gay/lesbian relationship, so it's not like he is coming out to his family or so.

Also, we are both catholic and he even got baptism so we could have a church wedding, but I didn't attend it because he also didn't want me there.

AND no, this is not a second relationship, he hasn't been married before and of course is not divorced.

Yes, I've tried to discuss with him about meeting his family but he just keeps avoiding it. Once he said it was better me not knowing them and to be honest, that really hurt my feelings.

Also, this is something that only happens with his family, everyone from both our jobs (we work in different companies) and both mine and his friends know we have been together since the beginning.

Also since the beginning of our relationship he asked me to not post pictures of us together since he didn't want people talking about us. Which I kind of understand since I don't like of having my personal life being talked about (yes, I know I came here to talk about it but it's because I really need outsiders advice)

And this really doesn't mean there are no pictures of us together, just, sometimes he'll have it as a profile picture for a couple days and then erase it. And yeah, if you look closely in social media it's more than obvious we are a couple. You can see that in some posts or comments we do towards each other.

For those saying that i should just show up at his family's house and introuce myself, since i do not know them i don.'t want to look like the crazy girlfriend showing off of nowhere.

And no, the kids are his nephews, I've seen pictures of their baptism's and it clearly shows how they are the children of his siblings.",150,320,0.95

1672,Asshole,"Today was our Thanksgiving dinner and I come from a pretty secular family. My family (my wife, daughter, myself) were hosting it for our family of some 25 people. My sister has a son, my nephew, who is 14.

I mention we come from a secular family because none of us really practice it or go to church, but we do say prayers before meals and will do baptisms, communions, confirmations, etc. It's kind of what every Italian family does. Do I believe in God? Not really, but I'll still say prayers.

My nephew is at that stage where he's beginning to question religion which I think is great. It's perfectly normal to be skeptical and question ""authority"". If anything, it lets him learn more about his culture and other cultures and become a more well rounded human because of it.

Today, my daughter was about to say prayers before our meal when my nephew gave an exasperated ""hmph"" which I took as cue as maybe he wanted to say prayer. So I asked if he'd do it and he did some big sarcastic speech about how God isn't real, blah blah blah. I consider this disrespectful because a prayer means nothing but tradition, the least he could do is pretend to partake in it, give it at least the tiniest modicum of effort. Not only that, but some of our family who *does* take our faith a little more seriously than others could be offended.

I told him, my 14 year old nephew, he can either say a proper prayer, or he will not eat. He hemmed-and-hawed for a good 3 or 4 minutes before finally giving in and saying at least a respectable prayer.

My sister pulled me aside later that night and said I went overboard but otherwise agreed with my sentiment. Even if we had no faith at all and it was just a little pre-meal speech of thankfulness, the least he could do was give a tiny shit and be a good person and do it.

My parents moved into an apartment last year from a house they were renting and they hate it. I don’t like my current apartment either and my mom won’t stop talking about how we should find a house to rent or a place with a mother in law suite so we could live together and cut down on costs.

1676,Not the A-hole,"So I was leaving the parking lot at the gym this morning around 6:00. Sun was not up yet, and it was still very dark. As I was walking to my car, I noticed to people standing between two parked cars, right near where I had parked. They were kind of hiding, kind of not. 

The two people were embraced and half-pecking at each other, half-kissy talking. The female obviously had Down Syndrome, and the male had obvious developmental disability(ies), which were noticeable by his facial structure and the way he spoke. I honestly have no idea how old they were. Maybe they were in their late teens/early-20s? Honestly, I’m not sure as it can be difficult sometimes to gauge age for folks with disabilities. As I got closer, I realized the girl had her hands down the guy’s pants and was stroking him off. Or, maybe she wasn’t stroking him, but she definitely was touching his area. 

I kinda freaked out and wasn’t sure what to do. I went back into the gym, notified the security guard, pointed out their location, and left. I don’t believe they got into any real trouble, as I just notified a security guard and not the actual police.

The whole situation made me feel very uncomfortable, but I’m not sure if I should have/could have handled it better. It’s kind of been bothering me all day. Honestly, I don’t know that I would have notified security if they didn’t have disabilities...but I also am unsure that two people engaging in the same activity would have been doing that out in the semi-open in a parking lot...I feel like they would just be in a car or something. 

I was also moderately concerned that maybe there was a significant age gap or gap in cognitive abilities, and didn’t want either of them to be taken advantage of. And then, there’s the other side of me that used to be a teacher...sometimes, people with disabilities “get away” with things because people are uncomfortable correcting their behaviors. But, because their negative behaviors are never addressed, they aren’t taught that those behaviors are wrong. So I felt like maybe their behaviors needed to be addressed and corrected? I dunno.

My mother proceeded to yell at me and tell me that she was the most opened minded person around. That SHE ALONE convinced my aunt (fathers sister) to talk to her gay son. How my fathers side of the family attacked her view points all the time, and how hard it would of been to explain that two men can love eachother to my 4 year old sister. She brought up that I wasn't around back then and how I don't understand what it's like to be a mother and have kids. I then told her that I didn't saying that they were in love was to hard to explain. To which she screamed at me and left the room.

The local musician who offered the backline is a person who I am very good friends with. He is married although in the eight or so years I have been friends with this man, I have only seen his wife twice. I know little about her other than she has severe health issues that prevent her from working. I advised my friend to invite her and have her bring some examples of her jewelry. She did and it wasn't finished jewelry but a fishing tackle box full of handmade pieces and parts that she made out of clay. I told her they were lovely which is true. In one tiny section, there were components that looked older and different from the rest and obviously came from a mold and I saw one that was a cameo with a skeleton of a conjoined twin baby. I got sort of excited when I saw it because I had been commissioned years ago to do a drawing and then a sculpt of exactly this subject matter and I never got to see it finished. So I asked, ""Did this piece come from a mold?"" She said yes so I said ""I think I may have possibly done the sculpt for this!"" and went on to explain how it happened, etc. I will note this happens to me from time to time, I have been drawing, painting and sculpting things for other people for forty years. I come across my work from time to time. She replied, ""You could not have possibly done this, I bought that mold a very long time ago,"" I shrugged and handed it back saying, she was probably right - the image is a common one and there were probably many versions of it. I was pulled away then to go make an announcement or something and didn't think anything about it. Later I get a very angry email from the wife asking why I ""accused her in front of an entire room of other artists of plagiarism."" It went on and on at length about my rudeness and how she once had respected me and thought I was talented but now she sees me as cruel and I was utterly dumbfounded. Firstly nobody else heard us talking and also If you purchase a mold, it is by definition someone else's work. That is like buying fabric, making a dress out of it and then having the artist come up to you and say, ""Hey I designed that fabric!"" They aren't claiming they made the dress, they just made part of what you made. I do not see why any party in that scenario would or should be embarrassed or angry.

For a bit of context, the ER is basically like the urgent care unit. It's where ypu go if you need a doctor fast, and don't have time to make an appointment.

So, yesterday, I was riding my motorcycle with my dad, and I took a pretty bad fall, landing on my left wrist and having the bike's handlebars fall on top of my wrist after. It hurt like hell for the rest of the day, and we went to the ER that evening. I was a little worried, because this was just a week after I g9t a cast off for a broken *right* wrist, and the pain felt similar. I got X-rays, and usually it takes a while to get them back. So I'm waiting in the room with my parents, and my mom tries to make a couple of jokes. When I don't laugh or respond, she asks ""What's wrong?"" I reply with a lot of sarcasm: "" I don't know, maybe it's because Im in the ER waiting for X-rays, sitting here with a broken wrist!"" (Turns out its not broken thank god) My dad then makes me apologize, and I do it, however inscincere it was. And that was the end of it.

But it's actually been bugging me lately, was I a complete jackass to snap back, or was I justified?

1688,Not the A-hole,"So I'm 20 and live in my family home, around June my Mom cheated on my dad with a work colleague of both of theirs (they work in the same place together) a thing that had apparently been going on for months via text but had finally become physical when my Mom went away with her friend. My Mom confessed this to my Dad who was obviously traumatised. My Dad has had some big issues with gambling in the past and my Mom tried to use that against him to flip the situation. She then decided she needed space and moved out around 2 months ago which I understood, she continued to see this other guy she'd cheated on my dad with who is trying, bless him, to keep everything together. 

Around a week ago my Mom just burst in out of the blue into the house with no warning and was acting like it never happened, talking to us both normally and such, we even spent the next day eating pizza in our PJ's. I knew my Dad wouldn't have wanted any drama because my Mom was really worried that my dad had 'turned me against her', which hasn't happened, it's their relationship and it's not mine to judge or fix, if they begin to act differently as parents that's when I should be concerned. 

Tonight my Dad text me to say my Mom was back home while I was out and in all honesty I was annoyed. I had to cycle back on my ancient torture device of a bike in pouring rain and was in a bad mood because of this, and knocked on the door; out of breath and tired. My Mom answers the door and proceeds to make monster noises at me like she has done since I was a Kid, probably expecting me to be okay with her just showing up again without any warning or telling either me or my Dad as I was a couple days before. I let my anger get the better of me and just said 'Yes. I know you're here, I saw the car in the driveway' without looking at her in a pretty annoyed tone. She then announced she was going to bed straight away, having been sat with my Dad before I came in. My Dad tells me to go and say Hello and I go on a very quiet yet annoyed rant as to how I shouldn't have to because it's not fair of her to just be walking in and out of the house when she pleases as if nothing ever happened. Guilt gets the better of me and I go to say hello not 3 minutes later but her head's under the covers and she doesn't respond, pretending to be asleep, obviously upset I didn't react well to her being home. 

At the end of the day she's my Mom and I love her, she's a good Mother and it's not my relationship to try intrude on even if they are my parents but I got annoyed today when she just walked straight back in again as if nothing ever happened. I did let my annoyance get the better of me and could have probably handled the situation better, I absolutely hate upsetting people even if they're in the wrong, but part of me is telling me not to be guilty because my anger seems reasonable.

I’ve known my friend since primary school (since we were 6 or 7.) She’s the only person from primary school I’ve stayed in touch with, same for her with me.

Now me and this girl are COMPLETELY different people. My mum says we’re like chalk and cheese. I like heavy metal and indie music, she likes rap and r&b, I’m placid, timid and quiet and she’s very loud and boisterous and abrupt, we’re just opposites in every way.

I feel like because of this my mother prefers her over me. She’s said a number of times over the years she wishes I was more like my friend and whenever my friend comes over to visit it’s just her and my mum talking away while I’m there being the third wheel. Whenever the friend wants to visit she doesn’t text me, she’ll usually text my mum and arrange it with her. I honestly think the reason we’ve stayed in touch for this long is because of my mum. She’s more my mothers friend than mine at this point. 

During her last visit, both of them were sitting on my bed chatting and my mum bought up the subject of who will be the godparents again and my friend said “well obviously it’ll be me.” My mum agreed and I told them I haven’t given it any thought since I’m not religious and don’t see the point. My friend said “well your baby will go to me if something happens to you wont it?” and before I got the chance to think of a response my mum said she’ll get the baby first. I was flabbergasted and just looked at the baby’s father who was pretending  he couldn’t hear them talking about which of them would get custody of his child if I died. They kept talking about it amongst themselves and I went back to being a third wheel.

Their entitlement annoyed me and my mum pressuring me to choose a godmother down to who it should be is making me unreasonably angry.  She’s been acting like this when it comes to my baby for a while, telling people SHE’S expecting a baby, inviting her friends to my baby shower who I’ve never met while telling me the baby’s father or uncle isn’t allowed to come, calling her “our baby”, stuff like that.

Despite all this, my mum has been a massive help with preparations and making sure I’m okay for money and this girl technically is still my oldest friend and would drop everything for me. Should I just give them what they want or stand my ground for once and risk upsetting them both?",15,28,0.9

1695,No A-holes here,"Couchsurfing is a wonderful cultural exchange programme in which guests from far away lands crash on one's couch for a night or two. The idea is to share a meal and get to know foreign visitors. Guests are vetted by the organisers and the system relies on reviews and other background checks to ensure the safety of all parties.

I adore participating in the programme and have had dozens of guests stay at my place. It has greatly enriched my life and I value the connections I've made with foreign visitors. Yes it's a risk but to me it's totally worth it. 

My girlfriend disagrees. She feels that the risk of being a victim of either violence or an unfounded accusation from a female guest outweighs any benefit. She told me this morning that since she has warned me of the risks, if I ever end up in trouble because of a couchsurfer, she will leave me.

My view is that we all fall somewhere on the risk/reward spectrum and I lean towards taking risks. While I respect her view, it's not enough to sway me. Yet she feels that it is disrespectful to her if I continue. Am I the asshole?

She suggested that I ask some female friends how they would feel if they were in that situation.

I live in a suburb where the houses are pretty close to each other and I love to garden. Literally any time I'm outside, either gardening or playing with my kids, the dog is barking. It's constant. The final straw was that the dog barks in the morning after my neighbors leave for work. The husband leaves for work around 6am and my whole family gets a wake up call in dog barking form EVERY DAY at 6am. The wife leaves at 6:45 and multiple times I've dressed at 6:30 to knock at their door and tell her that their dog woke all of us up (me, my husband, my 3 year old, and my 1 year old) she apologizes but doesn't take any action except taking the dog in for 15 min before she leaves. We've also brought this up to her husband and he also apologized but didn't seem to change a damn thing to make things better. 

We finally broke this week and bought a device that uses sound to startle the dog in to not barking. It's changed our lives. My kids went from waking up at 6 to sleeping until 7:30.

1697,Everyone Sucks,"Using a throwaway in case someone from his family sees this. 

My (26F) fiancé (28M) proposed to me last month and last night, we had a big dinner party with our families and friends to celebrate.

While we both believe in God, we're not particularly religious. He calls himself a cultural Jew and I'm a mediocre Christian. We participate in the holidays and traditions, that's about it. His parents are a bit more religious, but they're not orthodox or devout. They're known for their community work and are overall proud people.

His parents weren't too happy about me not being Jewish, but it was his grandma who gave us hell. She used to badmouth me to the rest of his family without even meeting me. When I finally met his entire family, his parents were nice to me. After that, his mom went out of her way to invite me to dinner, shopping etc., but his grandma was still evil. One time at dinner, she was being rude to me as per usual when my fiancé completely lost it, instead of apologizing she told me to convert and she won't be rude to me anymore. Worst part is, his family *loved* the idea.

Even though my fiancé wanted to go ''no contact'' many times, I couldn't let that happen, especially not because of me. He always says how lucky he is to have such amazing parents and siblings and I know how hurt he would be to cut ties with them. His parents eventually realized the same thing and they've grown to respect me, but the whole conversion talk never went away. His grandma lives with his parents and she's the one who pressured me the most.

Fiancé and I even went as far as talking to a rabbi about our situation and hoping he could give us some guidance. He definitely helped me understand that Jewish families have to ''mourn'' their men marrying non Jewish women, but as much as I respect that, it wasn't enough to justify his grandma pressuring me into converting and his family fully supporting that. 

Last night we told everyone that we've set the date for August 16th 2020, and his grandma replied ''gives you enough time to change your mind so you can have a real wedding''. By real, she meant Jewish. His family didn't say anything because they support the idea and I always tell my fiancé to be the bigger man and just let it go, but I couldn't let it go last night. 

When it was my turn to thank everyone for coming, I ended my speech along the lines of:

>And to *fiance's* family, I am never converting to Judaism. It doesn't matter how much you pressure me, especially you *fiance's grandma*, it won't happen. Shame on you for being rude to me, and shame on the rest of you for being cowards and letting her behave that way.

I said that in front of 93 people, a lot of them friends/business partners of his parents. They left shortly after that and called us this morning to let us know how embarrassing, damaging and disrespectful that scene was to them.

__Edited to add:__

I thought that my post made it clear that I did, in fact, announce that I wouldn't convert and I did it many times. That's why my fiancé wanted to go no contact, to stop her/them from pressuring me.

My best friend just got charged with some serious crimes, like fucking 8+ years in jail and his whole life will be down the shitter. I've known this guy since we were 3 yrs old and he is basically my brother, after he got charged with this he called me up basically sobbing and begging for me to help him out with a lawyer. His wife just left him and basically took everything he had and he was in the middle of rebuilding his life, when this shit happened. He has no other family but me and honestly I've never seen him in that state before. I promised him that I'd pay for a lawyer, and through some work contacts I got into contact with one of the best criminal defense attorneys in my city. I paid like 20k upfront but they told me to expect costs of around 150k if it goes to trial etc. I did however tell my fiancee about this and she said absolutely not you are not going to spend that much on him, but I had too. I moved around some other investments to be more liquid and I'm planning to deplete our wedding fund. To be clear, I'm paying for the entire wedding and honeymoon, none of her money is involved in this. Its not like this will make me broke or anything, it just means she won't get her dream wedding next year, it will have to be smaller and we can't go all out for a honeymoon. I told her if she waits 2 more years I can give her what she wants but she's calling me a huge asshole, douche etc and that i'm ruining her big day etc.

And she did not, also people need to learn how to read I explicitly said that I did ask her before paying the 20k retainer and told her it would cost upwards of  150k for his defense and it would come out of the wedding. It doesn't matter anyways, we've decided to part ways as of last night/this morning and she won't make a fuss about the ring if I cover the cost of the last year of her masters program she's in right now. I agreed to this since its fair. Make no mistake, my brother will beat this charge and we will make it out of this tough period in both of our lives.

My brother has never bought me a gift for my birthday directly. My dad will take him to the supermarket and he will get me a £5 generic candle that my dad will buy - sometimes my brother doesn’t even know what it is till I open it. 

As he doesn’t work as he’s a child still I was never bothered - but he gets money for his birthday and I am only around 8 weeks after his so I know he still has money left by this point.

So basically I figured it would be fine to get him some cheap £30 AirPods as he never spends or puts much effort into mine and he knows I don’t make much money. Anyway I bought them, let him know and he kinda flipped and said I can send them back or keep themselves for me as they would either be “used, broken or off brand”. He said I was being ridiculous as they were “£100 cheaper - come on”

I told him to fuck himself and I admit I did overreact and act meanly towards him.

I was in line at a bagel place ordering my usual sandwich (Onion bagel with jalapeno cream cheese, red peppers, and lox). The woman behind the counter helping me was, to put it bluntly, very large. Large everywhere, especially in the chest area. She spread the cream cheese on my bagel halves, then leaned over to reach the salmon. When she leaned back, the bagel halves had adhered themselves to her shirt. She looked down, cocked her head a bit, and then oreo cookied them off her breasts, set them down and continued making the sandwich. I just stood there in shock. I certainly didn't want to eat the sandwich anymore but I also didn't want to make this woman feel bad about her size because had she been an average sized person, this wouldn't have happened. In fact, it had never happened before or hence and I've probably eaten at this place dozens of times since.   


The lady finished making the sandwich and in that time I decided what to do. I went to the registers, paid for my sandwich, took it outside, threw it in the trash, and drove home hungry.  


My wife, while laughing at me, always says that I'm an asshole for not speaking up because that woman might have continued smooshing sandwiches until an actual mean person yelled at her for being too fat.

1713,Not enough info,"\*names changed for privacy

At first, when we all met and hung out together, it was fine; Chris\* and his girlfriend, Melissa\* and my fiance and I. Chris and my fiance talk and joke about everything nonstop. Melissa and I are not that very close but we get along alright by ourselves. However, I feel the socializing and friendship is very superficial between Chris and I and I'd rather do without it.

Example: I tried joining their conversation about tattoos during a backyard party once. Chris was shirtless and has a train on his chest so I asked what the story was and got ignored/talked over, TWICE. I go inside the house to use the toilet and pet the dogs, and when I go back outside, I give it my third and final try. Chris’s response: “oh i told the story but you were inside so too bad…” I stood there just looking at him and trying not to kick him in the balls, then “ahahaha just kidding so the train right? actually, my grandfather- “ I cut him off by saying that I didn’t want to hear it. My fiance was shocked I responded that way and gave me a “aww babe dont be mean” and I said “no, I dont care"".

Fast forward 4 months, we’re actually wedding planning now. My fiance had mentioned he wanted Chris as a groomsmen. He never said he had already asked Chris or that he said yes. Well, Chris made one more stupid joke (an ethnic comparison of Melissa and I) and it was my last straw. I told him that it wasn’t cool and more so, I didn’t even want to be friends anymore. I tried but enough was enough for me with all the jokes.

When I told my fiance I friend-dumped Chris on my own, I also blurted out that I never wanted Chris in the wedding in the first place. Fiance was mad at first but made the decision to tell Chris he's out AND that he and Melissa are not invited at all anymore.

I feel like an asshole he took it that far because I know they’re his friends more than they are mine. I wanted Melissa to attend, even if Chris was her plus one. I could have stomached that, just not having Chris up there with us. I know I never directly communicated there was an issue but I didn't want to seem like the only person with an issue about Chris “because that’s just how he is” and ""maybe I should learn how to take a joke"". I just always felt like I’m not being taken seriously when Chris is around and he has never reciprocated any effort to make any friend-type connection apart from having my fiance in common. so AITA?

Edited to include joke: i was at work and chatting with my fiance who started feeling sick at home (we work opposite schedules). fiance texted me he threw up, missed me, etc. then i get a bunch of texts from Chris: your future husband just threw up. why arent you home. cant you be at home taking care of him? go give him a bath and rub his feet. be useful and go home. the cherry on top was ""MY mexican would never do this to me"".

1714,No A-holes here,"Firstly, I hope this is not violating rule 11, as the central issue is me not telling my friend. Secondly, I know this sounds like a shitpost, but unfortunately it is very real. Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I (27M) was at a friend's wedding this weekend, as was my best friend Brian (27M) and his mother (approximately 50F). It was a great night, and afterward I went to retire to my hotel room. Just a couple doors down was Brian's mother, so we walked to our rooms together, and she invited me in for a night cap. It seemed innocuous at the time, so I accepted.

We ended up having a few drinks, and this is on top of the drinks we had at the wedding. One thing leads to another and we slept together. I know alcohol is not an excuse, but I realize that I never should have done that, and highly regret it. 

Brian is my best friend since age 5, and his friendship means a lot to me. I am worried that telling him could ruin our friendship. I think the best course of action is to just keep it a secret, and I have spoken to his mother and she is on the same page. I just think there would be no benefit to telling him - it would hurt all three parties involved especially Brian.

I know I am TA for sleeping with his mother. But my question is, AITA also for not telling him?

1715,Not the A-hole,"I'm putting fat-shaming in quotes because while it's obviously wrong, I don't think I did so. I'm directly quoting my ex-wife.

I have two kids, Harry (14M) and Sally (17F). Besides gender, they are also polar opposites in terms of everything else. While Harry is a staple of the baseball team, Sally fits in much better in the drama club. I love both of my kids regardless of their interests (I was a bookworm in high school myself).

Where Harry is very in shape, Sally is not. She has always struggled with her weight a bit but over the past two years she's reached the point where she's ""morbidly obese"". I think the overeating is stress-related from the divorce, and my ex-wife refuses to work with me on any sort of diet plan (she'll visit me on a weekend and tell me that the ex let her drink soda the entire time).

Anyway, this weekend I was cooking burgers and taking orders. Harry ordered three patties (he had been practicing all morning and was starving) and I said no problem. Sally then tried to ask for the same. I won't transcribe the whole conversation, but basically I told her she would be better to sticking to one or two because she should be trying to lose weight and that she wasn't burning off these calories. She then asked me why Harry could have three while she couldn't, and I was honest that he was burning off the calories while she wasn't. 

Anyway, Sally is extremely upset and not talking to me, the ex is fuming at me for fat-shaming, and Harry told me he has to eat less to make Sally's diet easier on her. I'm just wondering if I'm the asshole.

1716,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend has always been extremely shitty about getting out of bed in the morning. If we have fights, it’s usually stemming from his behavior and general inability to wake himself up. When we first met in college he would sleep until 6pm or later every single day unless someone woke him up.

So now we live together and for about two years, I’ve woken up early to get him ready for work. He refuses to set his own alarms (we’ve tried but he sleeps through them), meaning I have to set several and try to wake him up several more times a morning. When he finally does get up, he’s usually a complete and total dick. I mean just nasty to me. He usually ends up with about 30 minutes before work to get ready, but likes to take his time and watch the news, meaning he’s usually a little late.

Here’s where I’m concerned I’m an asshole: Recently he’s started taking an additional 20 minutes to smoke weed while watching the news every morning. (Idc about the weed, he works at a pizza shop) But he refuses to get up any earlier, making him around 45 minutes late to work every day. All of this stresses me out *so badly*. I get stressed because I have to do all this shit to get him out of bed in plenty of time and then he’s still willfully 45 minutes late everyday. Not to mention the added stress of him acting like I am doing this just to hurt him. So, I’ve decided to stop waking him up. No more alarms, no more begging, I’m just going to let him get up when he decides is right. 

He will definitely sleep until late afternoon unless I intervene. He will definitely lose his job. I feel the need to prevent that. At the same time, I’m so done being screamed at every morning. WIBTA if I set him up to fail like this?

Edit: This is a really small part of his personality and he’s a completely different person when he’s tired. If he was like that all the time, I’d break up with him. Normally a very sweet man who will work 40-60 hours a week. Not lazy, just AWFUL in the morning.",710,2661,0.96

1718,Not the A-hole,"Once a month I give myself two subcutaneous injections that keep my bones and connective tissue from degenerating (anymore than they already have), and then immediately discard the needles in a sharps container. The syringes themselves are quite large for accessibility reasons, but it still takes me over a year to fill the massive sharps container my specialty pharmacy sends me. 

I keep the sharps container on a shelf in the living room, near where I give myself my injections. It doesn't have a child lock (again, for accessibility reasons) but it does have a one-way opening, and the container is opaque plastic with a biohazard sticker. I bedazzled the outside and added some googly eyes so it didn't remind me so much of a hospital, and I named it Leroy. None of the diseases I have are communicable, each syringe has a plastic ""stopper"" over the needle, and we don't bring children in the home, so Leroy poses zero threat to anyone.

Recently, my brother (rents the spare room from me and my husband) started insisting I keep the container in my bedroom, where he and guests ""won't have to look at it."" And really, I *could* keep Leroy under my bathroom sink, but I don't want to because it causes me physical pain to crawl under there. It  won't fit anywhere else. I put a lot of effort into organizing my home so it's as accessible and painless as possible, and this helps me be as independent as possible. This is important to me. 

My brother has decided that if it's that big of a deal, my husband can just store my needles for me under the sink. And that's true, my husband is more than willing to help me *when I need it.* But I'm fully capable of disposing of my own needles, unless I'm forced to store Leroy in a stupid and inaccessible place. Yes, I can't always dry my hair by myself, or pour my own milk, but when I have a good day I *want* to do those things for myself. In my view, if my brother and his guests are uncomfortable with my disability, it's not my job to make them feel better about it in my own home. I'm not going to strip away the things I'm still able to do just to make other people more comfortable, my world is small enough all on it's own thank you very much. 

Brother says I'm an asshole for pulling the cripple card, so is that true, reddit? 

For the record, the presence of my wheelchair has never been an issue, unless you count me having to ask my brother's guests to stop having wheelie competitions on it, which I kinda do because they usually fall backwards and beat up the chair (which I need), not to mention my poor downstairs neighbors having to listen to all that crashing.

Edit: Every time I post about my disability outside of my community, I prepare myself for a lot of ignorant comments and probably a little outright disgust. Hell, sometimes I even get them when I'm posting *in* the disabled community. But I haven't gotten a single rude comment on this post, and I think that's cool as hell. Way to go, assholes!

My older sister, brother, and five of our friends went out for a few drinks. I tend to be on the frugal side so I had a drink or two at my house before going out. I have always done this, I have always been a pregamer and this is nothing new. I ate close to nothing that day so I felt a bit more tipsy than what two drinks would normally do to me. So I started telling jokes, singing, dancing etc (my usual self when tipsy.) My sister then told me I should “control” myself and stop being so “embarrassing.” I mind you I’ve known her friends my entire life and I’m a grown ass adult. They were laughing and having a good time, and I know this for a fact.

She wasn’t being sarcastic whatsoever, and we all knew. I know this seems like I’m sugar coating it but I wasn’t drunk, only tipsy. I was in a especially good mood because it was Saturday night. I have an extremely stressful job and Saturdays are my time to just let loose, and my sister knows this. I was shocked when I noticed her to be so angry. She was “excited the whole week to party.” When we finally got to the bar she kept her distance from me. I had quite a few more drinks, as did everyone else except for her. I started to dance and sing with a group of people. Sure I was drunk but could handle myself. I was still able to walk upright on my own and have a conversation with my friends. She then comes over grabs my arm and pinches me. This wasn’t you’re everyday pinch, this was a pinch from hell. She goes on this pinching rampage throughout the entire night trying to pull me away from people I’m talking to saying “you’re so fucking embarrassing, and you have ruined my night,” or “you don’t know your god damn limit.” Everyone was fucking wasted, we were at a bar on a Saturday night. Again I will be very clear I was drunk but I wasn’t out of control. She then says “you’re uber is here.” I was confused why she only said my uber but I went with it. So she took me outside (pinching my arm) and practically throws me in the uber and SENDS ME HOME LIKE I AM A FUCKING CHILD. I was thinking she was going to hop in with me but she didn’t. I was pissed. She sent me to my house alone. The next morning she texts and goes “hey sorry I was uptight last night, you were just soooo gone. We all agreed you needed to go home.” I started to really reflect on the night and didn’t think I did anything wrong. Being the apologetic person I am I texted one of our friends saying exactly this “Hey sorry about last night, I guess I was out of control. Hope I didn’t ruin your night! Maybe we can do it again and I’ll stick to a beer.” He responds with “you were fucking hilarious!!! We were sad to see you go so soon! Next time you buy the beers.” I texted my sister immediately and called her a bitch. She blocked my number... and we haven’t talked since. We will get over it sooner than later but I’m still pissed. To top it off I had bruises all over my arms and my fucking shoulders from this girl. I’m just confused as to why she was so angry for me having some fun? I need a second opinion.

My mother got married in June. 

I am happy for my mum, don't get me wrong, but I don't think the guy who marries my mum automatically deserves to be called ""Dad"" because they are together. Also, even if my ACTUAL father was never in my life, it doesn't mean I will just replace him. 

I pointed this out to my mum and her hubby. He was pretty chill about it, telling me I didn't have to if I didn't want to, but mum said ""You didn't have to be so cold about it. You could have put it in a nicer way. Why are you always so blunt?""

I told her: ""You told me to never lie to anyone. I think sugar-coating things is like lying. I have no reason to be 'nice' to someone I have only seen about 5 times over the last year. I won't call him 'Dad' because we aren't blood.""

Mum told me that I should stop the being so cold and cruel in the way I talk.

Me and Mum still get along, but she still looks at me with disappointment.

1729,No A-holes here,"Hear me out, I know this sounds fake.

My (23f) dad works a program in which he gives support (food, money, resources, etc) to people who have just come out of prison and need help. He has done this for as long as I can remember, and I've been helping since I was about 16. We meet a lot of different people from different walks of life, and the service also acts as a support group where we all talk. I met Anna (25f) when she was 22 and she'd just been released from prison for some drug charges. She was put in prison right after she turned 18. She told me that because she was so young, she was pushed around a lot in prison. She was basically forced into a prison tattoo of a swastika, because a group of women were threatening her life if she didn't. I believe her story is true and have no reason to doubt her. 

Anna has struggled since getting out of prison and simply does not have the money to cover the tattoo, nor does she know what she would cover it with. It is right on her chest, so is hard to hide. I know she is embarrassed about the tattoo and she hides it with sweaters and high neck shirts. I've seen her try to cover it with make up, but you can still see it.

She came to me when I announced my engagement and said it would probably be the only time she would have the tattoo visible, because it is a wedding in the summer (next year) and it will be too hot to hide. I didn't really know what to say at the time. It's going to be a large wedding. I can safely assume there will be some people offended by it (I mean, it makes me feel a bit sick but I try to look past it). 

I really don't know what to do. I don't want to hurt her feelings or make her feel more ashamed than she is, but I also (selfishly) don't want this to be the focus of the wedding, or for any guests to be offended. I'm seriously considering making her a member of my bridal party simply so I can pick dresses that will cover it without singling her out. Anna is a really good person now and I don't want to hurt her. My brother, when I told him, said that if she had a giant distracting birth mark, I wouldn't expect her to cover it, so why would I expect her to with this. I feel awful and am genuinely conflicted.

1730,Not the A-hole,"Hi all,

I’m just wondering if this would be an asshole move but a bit of backstory...

I don’t like my downstairs neighbours at all. I live in an old rental unit in a Canadian city that seems to transmit a lot of sound from my downstairs neighbours (albeit I have never heard my upstairs neighbours, or my next door ones). My downstairs neighbours I believe work in the service industry so they don’t have regular weekends or working hours. Now, over the years I have come home when they were coming home after forgetting they left a pan of oil on and our entire first floor was covered in smoke, I have seen both cats and dogs in their unit (we are a no pet building, even though I would rather have pets) and they have, every few weeks, parties on weeknights (think lots of people/music) which will wake me up multiple times in the night. 

The last time they did this, I opened my patio door (but it’s a fake balcony) at 2 am to ask the people on their ground floor patio to be quiet and they apologized and went inside. I’ve never reported them because despite not liking them, I have never really liked throwing anyone under the bus. If it’s weekends, I don’t really care because everyone can let loose now and then. 

So this brings us to the present. It is thanksgiving today meaning we have a public holiday, but they had a party that was going until 5 am. I’ve had some personal issues going on which has put me in a bad mood to begin with, but I know there are people over still and WIBTA if I started my morning cleaning early. To be fair, I am leaving for several weeks so I do need to vacuum... but I could wait until later in the day. I also would like them to know that I can hear them despite my attempts at telling them in the past (there was one other instance where my boyfriend yelled at them to be quiet).

UPDATE: Thanks for all the responses. I read them and thought a lot about my situation. I honestly ended up being too tired to actually get out of bed at 8 am (when I posted this) so I started cleaning at ~9:30 and carried on how I would without really caring if I woke them up as 9:30 is reasonable. Also after reading everything, I think I will write something to them and tell them I will file an official complaint with our landlady if they continue on week nights and just ask them to be respectful, I will also inform my landlady what I am doing to keep her in the loop. For people worried that I would have disturbed my other neighbours, I know for a fact my next door ones and upstairs ones weren’t around this weekend as we have each other’s numbers. Our walls are fairly well insulated from noise believe it or not, it’s just the downstairs people seem to like everything loud and with bass. Retrospectively maybe I undersold how loud they can be and how often it occurs, I was talking to my partner and he was like, “they are the main reason I don’t stay over”. So if they don’t end up being respectful, I will try not to care on the outcome. Thanks again for the input and the laughs",95,367,0.93
1731,Asshole,"Some backstory,  I am a recent University graduate who is living in the city where I went to school. This city is roughly 2.5 hours southeast of my hometown.  My roommate, who we will call Paul, is also from my hometown and last week he asked if I planned to drive back to our hometown for the weekend. I said yes and when he asked if he could catch a ride with me I said yes too.  Paul's car was totalled a few weeks ago so he is unable to drive himself.  

There was heavy snowfall late in the week and the roads were closed to my hometown were closed on Friday and Saturday. On Sunday I got up and checked the roads and they were cleared and safe for driving so I left for my hometown.  Around half an hour after I left Paul called me and asked me if  I had left. After I said yes he asked why I hadn't let him know I was leaving. He wasn't home when I wanted to leave so I just went.  He said ""okay then."" and hung up.  Today Paul sent me a message saying that he thought it wasn't very nice that I left without letting him know and preventing him from seeing his family whom he hasn't seen for a few months. He said he was buying groceries and would have come home if he had known I was leaving. I don't think it's my job to tell him if I am leaving or not. I was planning on going back anyway and he wasn't home. Does that make me TA?",38,34,0.76
1732,Asshole,"My husband and I never thought that we could get pregnant, so we got plenty of therapy after a few failed treatments and moved to fostering with the intent to adopt. We've had a few fosters, but this concerns our current foster, a 9 year old who's been with us for two years. He's a spirited boy, but not a bad kid. Just takes a lot of time, money, and mental energy. 

The child's case plan has now moved to adoption, and we were identified as an adoptive resource. We were taking the first steps towards adoption when we found out that I was pregnant. It was mind-blowing as this is my first pregnancy, and I am now over 40. I had thought I had finally hit menopause, but was in fact 12 weeks pregnant. 

Unfortunately, after thinking we could do both, we did the hard math, and with our work and our finances, the only way we could raise our foster son is if we terminate this pregnancy. We can't financially have both children. I can't emotionally bring myself to terminate what is realistically our only chance at a biological child, who I am already bonding with. My husband wouldn't think of it either. We have to refuse the adoption. 

Unfortunately still, our foster son knows of preparations for an adoption through his therapist and social worker, so now we're taking him away from a stable home and what may be his only chance of adoption as he is older, all for reasons that aren't his fault. Am I the asshole for putting a still unborn child above him?

Edit: 

Baby:
Baby has passed prenatal testing with flying colors.

Finances:

We currently live in a 2 bedroom condo. We are required to give foster son his own room, which is not possible with a baby by social services standards. Us moving into the living room doesn't pass either. Social services is giving us until January to find a larger place, but we would have to stay in the county. We can't afford 3 bedroom places in the county, as it's a costly area.

We don't qualify for assistance with both of us working, and if one of us quits, we wouldn't be able to afford our current place even with the assistance we could get. Both of us working would make it difficult to swing appointments for two children as well. It's a catch 22 basically.",6918,20286,0.8
1733,Not the A-hole,"Backstory: I am recently divorced from a police officer. He is an abusive womanizer, a narcissist, a serial cheater, and a pathological liar. I was his third marriage. We have a child together who just turned 2. I was so happy to get away from the situation that I was going to live and let live, but now he is putting my son in unsafe situations and doing everything he can to continue to make my life a living hell. 
The opportunity: During our marriage he used his duty phone to contact his APs, he would meet women in uniform and on duty. He is now seeing multiple women and knowingly passing 2 incurable STD’s to them without giving them any heads up. He leverages his badge to get away with pretty much everything. I am to the point where I want him out of our lives completely, especially my son. I feel that his lifestyle is reckless and dangerous since in the month that we’ve been divorced, he has brought him around 3 different strange women, one of which was a blind date. If I write the sheriff and detail this out, he would surely lose his job or get severely reprimanded. In turn, he would also lose his apartment because he gets a special rate for being a cop. I am not a vengeful person, but he has ruined our lives and is so toxic. If I do this, I will possibly rid our lives of him, with the added bonus of speeding up karma. 
Added info: I make much more money, so am in charge of all childcare, insurance and medical expenses for our son. He pays ZERO into his care or support. We agreed outside the parenting plan on visitation and ground rules about the opposite sex, etc. In hind sight, this was a stupid move on my part to trust he would do the right thing. 
Also, advice on delivery, if I’m NTA, would be welcome.

1735,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I are expecting our first child soon, like her due date is literally in about 3 weeks.  We are both incredibly excited and nervous about it as neither of us have a whole lot of experience with newborns.  Both our families have been incredibly supportive during the pregnancy and we are both lucky enough to have our parents living within about an hour from us so our support system is nearby, but not too close.  This is also going to be the first grandchild for either of our families, so there's a lot of excitement from both of our parents.

Over the last few weeks, my wife and I have been discussing holiday plans for this winter.  The past few years we have hosted either Thanksgiving, Xmas, or both in our home.  With a newborn this year, that's definitely not happening.  We pretty much decided that we would be staying home for both Thanksgiving and Xmas this year, not hosting large family holidays, and probably not driving anywhere for any overnight stays.  We live in a northern climate and winter travel with a newborn and a dog doesn't appeal to either of us.  

We recently had a small baby shower and told both of our mother's our plans for the holidays as they had been asking if we would be hosting again.  They both understood that we didn't want to host, but seemed upset that we didn't plan on seeing the rest of our families during the holidays.  It was a lot of ""Well Aunt X and Uncle Y will be in town and they will want to see baby,"" and ""Well you can just drive to our place and stay over so that we can get baby time too.""  We stood firm in our plans to stay home and said that everyone will have a chance to meet the baby, but we want time to ourselves and for my wife to recover and develop a routine at home before we start packing baby into a car for overnight stays. 

But just last night my mom called to say an aunt and uncle of mine that live within 15-minutes of us will be hosting Thanksgiving and have invited all of us to their house.  She seemed surprised that we didn't immediately jump at the opportunity to have family meet the baby, since it was close enough for us to just come over for the day and then drive home.  I reminded her that the baby will be maybe 1-month old at that point, and that our plans for staying home haven't changed, regardless of drive times and who is hosting.

I know everyone is excited about the baby, especially as it's the first grandchild, but I feel like us being a little selfish in this situation is acceptable.  Also, we will definitely be allowing family to meet the baby, but we want it to be at our home, on our terms, and in smaller groups.  We might be a bit overly cautious about all of this, but we've decided that our plan is what we are comfortable with and we are sticking to it.  I still feel guilty about it though as both our families love the holiday season and I feel we are taking away some of that enjoyment.",35,37,0.9
1736,Not the A-hole,"So I’m a sophomore in high school and lately there’s been a dilemma in the family. I hate facial hair and a growing unibroe (not horrible noticeable) and I especially want to shave my mustache. It’s ugly and everyone has been pointing it out too. I posted on some subs a month ago and they all said get rid of it and don’t pay attention to my dad who thinks I’m too young to shave. He says it’ll grow back even faster and my mom said that he thinks shaving will make my face look less innocent. I’m a teenage dude, for gods sake, I’m not supposed to look innocent! So I didn’t have access to a razor and I used scissors to snip or mustache hair. Fast forward this weekend my dad confronts me about it. He says he knows I did something to my mustache and he compares it to older pictures. Of course I lie but he persists and finds the scissors. I lose my shit and say it’s BS that he cares about my facial hair so much and he takes my phone, PS4 controllers, and TV remotes. I apologize for lying later but still, I think it’s BS that he cares so much. AITA for getting rid of my facial hair?",119,174,0.9
1737,Asshole,"Healthy eating is super important to me. I have small children at home, and a large part of my mental space is occupied by thinking about how I can ensure that my family has a generally healthy diet. I'm not completely obsessed. The kids eat cake and ice cream at parties. We take them out to ice cream now and then. I give them a few pieces of chocolate in their lunches. We do a special breakfast once a week where the kids can vote on pancakes, waffles, crepes, etc. But I see healthy eating as one of the most important values that I can instill in my family.

The kids usually choose crepes for their special breakfast. These are the richest and least healthy option. I make pancakes and waffles with wheat and oat flour, but crepes I do by our traditional family recipe--butter, sugar, white flour… It's a special treat, and I want them to enjoy it. The only filling we use is pure maple syrup, and the one thing I ask is that we don't use a ton of it. Crepe batter is super rich, maple syrup has lots of sugar, and it is very expensive. I tell them a little goes a long way. Plus, it's healthier to use just a little!

We roll our crepes like a burrito, and just like putting ingredients in a burrito, I ask everyone to apply a single line of syrup down the center along the roll rather than pouring haphazardly all over the surface. Not only does it help us use less, but it’s reasonable given the burrito roll method. (When you cut it into small sections, each bite will have the same amount of syrup in the center.) The kids get the rationale, and I make sure that I lead by example.

My wife can't get behind the single line of syrup thing though. She likes sweet things and uses lots of syrup on her crepes. She pours in a spiral over the whole surface, using about 3x what anyone else does. For a long time, when she helped the kids fill their crepes, she refused to pour a single line, instead slathering syrup all over. I think it was a sort of protest, as she sees me as being too nitpicky. After a lot of complaining on my part, she did change, but it was a real headache.

I want her to jump on board with the syrup thing so that we can send a consistent message to the kids. I have suggested this to her on various occasions and explained my reasoning carefully. I don't think it's unreasonable or irrational to think that we should have a family policy around this, and I have trouble understanding why this should represent a significant problem for her.

She thinks I'm being unreasonable and irrational in asking this of her--that it's purely a matter of preference and that I shouldn't be pressuring her in any direction. I want us to be a team on this. This is the only breakfast for which I feel the need to have such family standards--I don't say anything specific about pancakes, waffles, etc. (you need to spread syrup all over the surface of those, although I do still want people to be modest about syrup use).

I have two kids, one with him and one from another relationship. This year I have my daughter until 10 AM Christmas day. Every year we do the same thing..dinner at his dads Christmas eve, brunch at his grandmother's Christmas day, where we sit there almost all day.

This year I suggested because I have my daughter that my 81 year old grandmother come and see the kids Christmas morning. So I attempted to compromise saying after we drop off my oldest to her dad if we could stay at his grandmother's for four to five hours then come home and have dinner with my family instead of staying there all day. Right away he loses his shit on me saying this is how it's been for 28 years and he isnt changing his Christmas, that I can stay home if I want and just flat out being insensitive. I told him that its not like we arent going there at all but just a little bit shorter so I can see my family too. For the 5 years we have been together it's always been the same.

1741,Asshole,"So, just some clarification, my son works for me; our job is an outdoors type of job, and it depends on the weather. Our weather patterns this year have been rainy, and wet overall, but we’re now on a dry spell meaning work can resume.

So, here’s the scoop concerning him trying to move in, whenever we had downtime, I would always offer to help. The problem is, my son wouldn’t be so enthusiastic about moving (you’d think they would yell “see ya!” After the house loan was official), he would just brush off my offers to help. 

Whenever I ask him if he’s going to at least sleep at the new house, he just responds with “i don’t know”, “maybe”, or he shrugs off the question. 

Like I said before, he didn’t take advantage of the downtime due to the weather, and now it’s too late for that. Work will resume, and be just as busy, I’m short handed, so I can’t afford workers cutting off.  

Recently, my son asked if he could take time off to supervise the HVAC repair technicians, and I told him he can’t, and I explained to him that we’re going to be busy. Yes, he’s worried that the cold will freeze the pipes, but it’s going to be 60 degrees for the foreseeable future. 

Additionally, he wants to move furniture like a couch, bed, and tv stand into the new house. I told him we have work, and he then started acting like he was holding a grudge against me. He claimed that moving would take less than an hour. I politely remind him that we would be way too busy with work to be doing that. 

He then claims that we “won’t get around to it, until work slows down, which is months away.” 

I remind him that part of his situation was self inflicted by not capitalizing on the downtime. I then lay out his three options for getting moved in: 

1) wait until the weather is crappy again, and we will move furniture in then. However, I have my doubts that he’s going to be enthusiastic about moving in then, if he wasn’t enthusiastic the last time we had bad weather. 

2) move in on your own time. The problem is, that it’s dark when he’ll be getting around to moving in on his own time, unlikely he’ll find willing friends to help unless he gives an advanced notice. 

3) if he’s worried about “months”, then he could just rent out the property and at least make some sort of additional income, his house is in a neighborhood that has a tight housing market, everyone wants to live there. 

A fourth option I never mentioned was that he could just take a camping air mattress and sleeping backs up that way, but an air mattress is pretty annoying to sleep on.",125,162,0.89

Recently I went through an awful break up. The boy did things to me without my consent, cheated on me and just really screwed me up. This was about two months ago. My mum seems to have no problem reminding me that he’s moved on from me, knowing fully well that despite what he did to me I’m still in love with him. 

The relationship was incredibly rocky. His parents were nasty to my face, his sisters called me a slut and they all sent nasty messages to my mother about me. His mother sent mine a FIVE PAGE EMAIL essentially calling me manipulative, controlling and crazy when I know for a fact that I was not. His father called mine on my 16th birthday to say that he was cutting contact between me and this boy and that we couldn’t do anything about it. This went on for over a year 

Now for the AITA part: we were just enjoying dinner as a family, when my mother decided to pull up Instagram and look for my ex boyfriends new girlfriend. I asked her not to, and she said ‘it won’t hurt you for me to know’, but I knew that eventually she would tell me and it would hurt me. I told her again, no not to look for it and she continued to search. The amount of pain I’m feeling from this breakup is awful, and the trauma he left me with is crippling.

As I started to sit back down, I hear ""Uh uh"" and EL drops her bag in my seat as I'm halfway down.  The row of seats is all connected and it runs between two columns, so EL literally had to walk the length of the row and around the column to the seat after dropping her bag in a seat that I was in the process of sitting down into.  I was a bit shocked and didn't say anything, but then C proceeds to tell her that what she did wasn't right.  Then she turns to me in a smarmy voice and says I'm such a gentleman that I need the seat more than an old lady (EL was maybe early 60s).  I ended up taking my seat (the man next to me gave up his seat for her because she wouldn't quit harping about me being a gentleman).

When this happened he passed his family home to her, and she and my sister (31) have been living in it until my mother passed away last year due to an accident. Every thing was split evenly between the three of us, but due to my sisters condition despite it legally belong to us all, the family home is being used by her and her alone.

My sister, Talia, does not leave the home and has never held a job. Ever since her teenage years she has shut herself inside and is incapable of even going outside to get groceries. I personally think she has only gotten to this point due to being enabled by my mother, but whatever the reasoning she's entrenched in her ways. Now that my mother has passed, Talia lives in the house and refuses to even discuss the possibility of selling or renting it out.

When I first brought up the idea of selling the home not only Talia but my brother, Robert, got upset. He thinks due to the house prices in our area if we were to sell the home, Talia would have to move to an entirely different area away from her family and outside of her comfort zone. When I suggested to him that perhaps he take her in to live with his own family instead if he found that so objectionable, he told me I was being ridiculous and that wasn't an option. After multiple debates over this topic I relented and let things lie for a few months, figuring that after some time has passed and things weren't so fresh I could approach it again.

My wife and I recently arranged another meeting between Talia, Robert and I and brought up the idea of renting out the other rooms of the house to roommates or maybe converting the lower story of the house into an airbnb. I even offered to set up the advertisements and my wife said she could help tidy things up and create a nice space for people to stay in. We live in an extremely busy area so business would go extremely well and Talia, Robert and I would all be able to benefit from the house rather than just Talia. Talia stormed off mid meeting after saying she would not live with a bunch of strangers. Robert is taking her side and telling me to lay off and drop the topic completely.

I don't think it's fair that just Talia is getting to take advantage of a house that technically belongs to me just as much as her. I'm considering seeing a lawyer to see what I can have done so I'm not completely shafted by this affair, but when I shared my plans with some friends some of them reacted pretty badly and think that if I get the law involved Robert won't ever forgive me, and that family bonds are more important than money.

SO plays it off as nothing, and that MIL is looking at one on eBay, which I can immediately tell is a lie, call her out on it and bam, they have been buying stuff without me knowing, which disappoints me and annoys me.

SO and MIL have no intention of stopping buying baby items and I apparently need to stop latching on to things let it go.

1759,Not the A-hole,"So let me clarify, what I bought her was not cheap, it was simply cheaper then what I got my mom for her birthday and my girlfriend seems to be extremely offensive about it.

So, without getting in to too much detail to keep this nice and vague, I make a substantial amount of money and my monthly expenses are extremely low which puts me in the position where I can save a lot of money and can easily afford to splurge on birthday gifts and such, now I enjoy making the people close to me feel special on their birthdays and every once in a while that means I go all out.

Well it was my mom's birthday about a month ago and well I did just that, I went all out, I got her a butt load of flowers and a great gift, I took her and my family out to a restaurant she has been wanting to go for months, I got her tickets to a show she has been wanting to go to to top it all off, now as you may understand all of this combined comes at a pretty steep price. Now it is good to note that my girlfriend went along on my mom's birthday, they met before and we have been together for a few months so I figured it would be fine.

In comes my girlfriends birthday a week ago, her birthday is about 3 weeks after my mom's birthday, now I got her a nice, big bouquet of flowers, took her out to dinner and got her a gift, but of course nothing as expensive as what I went and did for my mom, cause I am going to be honest here, we have only been dating for a few months and I already splurged just 3 weeks ago, but let me be clear CERTAINLY nothing cheap and more than she got from her direct family.

Well a few days pass and I notice she is sad about something as she is behaving differently and well I keep asking her but it takes a considerable amount of time for her to answer me and when she does I am just shocked, she starts sobbing and saying how I spend way more on my mother's birthday then I did on hers and all she got was a dinner, some flowers and some ""stupid"" gift. Well I got to admit I sort of lost it and told her to get the hell out of my house, now three days have passed and I have been going low-contact with her because honestly I was just pissed and offended about it, but in the meantime I am also worried that perhaps she was right, perhaps taking her along to my mom's birthday was not a good idea and I raised the bar so high that unless I got her exactly that or more she would be disappointed?",106,231,0.92

I always had dogs and Im even a foster home for dogs looking for a permanent home. I also never had kids.

A few days ago, my cousin asked me to take care of her 3 small children for the day because she needed to run some not-kid-friendly errands and the sitter cancelled on her. I agreed because, how hard can it be?

Very hard turns out. Especially when you have little to no experience with small children.

So, I kinda thought ""what would I do if I had 3 puppies in my hands?"" and did that. Basically giving treats for doing as told, playing with them to make them tired, teaching them dog tricks to make them busy (they got treats for that too), I even made an obstacle course out of toys, tents etc and 2 of them were competing for the best dog award. They loved being dogs! And it gave me time to take care of the youngest one (almost 1 year old) without fearing the other two will break something or themselves.

All was well, the day was over. Except I got a call, 2 days later, that the kids still act like dogs, especially whenever something reminds them of the game, including trying to chase a stray cat that they saw while walking to the playground with their mom and barking at other dogs and even other kids. Dont get me wrong, my cousin isnt mad at me or blaming me, but she did seem ultra tired because they wont stop playing the game and I feel guilty for starting all this.

1764,Not enough info,"I've been with Molly for the past 2 years. She is 30 and I'm 27. She's a ''friend of a friend of a friend'' of my sister and we hit it off at a party but were friends for a while before we got together. 

Molly has quite a distinctive appearance/style. She always wears a huge amount of makeup even when she's just hanging out at home, wears high heels all the time etc. She's also had cosmetic surgery such as breast implants and lip fillers. She had all this before we met so it wasn't my influence. 

While I think she's beautiful, many people don't. She gets a lot of stares and comments in the street, particularly from people of the older generation but also from people our age and younger. Some of my female friends have called the amount of makeup she wears ''hideous'' and said that she looks ''scary''. Needless to say I've cut those people off. Even Molly's own sister refers to her as a ''barbie doll'' 

A lot of people assume that Molly is deeply insecure which is why she covers herself in makeup and had the cosmetics but that's not true at all. It's just her personal style. When we first started chatting she was perfectly happy to send me bare faced selfies without any kind of prompting from me. 

Personally I think she is gorgeous with or without her makeup, but since being with her I found an undiscovered kink of sorts; The idea that I'm the only person who gets to see Molly's bare face feels super special and intimate, like she's saving a part of herself just for me. I've never had any reason to discourage her wearing makeup. She loves wearing it, and I love her wearing it (and not wearing it just as much!)

A lot of people assume Molly is some shallow dumb ''bimbo'' but she really isn't. She is a qualified lawyer working for a big practice and makes 3x as much money as I do (and my earnings are themselves above average)

I had a bit of a row with Molly's mother and sister yesterday, when she was sad about how ''insecure''  her sister was, and then rounded on me saying I need to make an effort to encourage her to go makeup free more often, wear flat shoes etc because she's ''obviously unhappy''. She thinks that I ''encourage'' Molly to do these things simply because I always tell her she's beautiful. If she suddenly decided to never wear heels or makeup again I really wouldn't care, because it was Molly the person that I fell in love with, the way she giggles, smiles, the way her face lights up when talking about something big at work. I've never discouraged her from being who she is because it makes her happy, and who the hell am I to argue with that. 

Am I a bad influence on her or should we keep doing what we're doing?",52,219,0.93

D- “So I am a trans male, who has been with my partner for a while. We welcomed a baby recently and announced on Facebook we had a girl. 

After a discussion with my partner we decided we didn’t want to raise our child to be confined to a gender and wanted to allow them to choose their own, so we have decided to use neutral pronouns and have asked people to refer to our child as “they, them” etc.

When talking to “S” about the child, she kept taking ages like she was having to think about what she was saying and was hesitant. I ask her why and she said “I’m trying to make sure I don’t use the wrong pronouns as I’m use to referring to her as a girl, so I’m making sure I think it through” which really annoyed me as it’s not that difficult. I told her she was ridiculous,and that it’s not that hard and if she struggles that much she shouldn’t parade around like a advocate for the lgbt community if she can’t do this simple thing. We fell out over it.”

Extra info is that the baby is now a year old, they decided at 9months to go with a neutral gender. 

“S” is a straight white woman, who we know as she brought her younger brother to pride when he came up because he was too nervous, “d” has always had a chip because in his words, she doesn’t know the struggle of coming out and fighting to be who you are and that’s why he’s arguing she’s in the wrong.


So who is the asshole reddit?

Edit - wow I wasn’t expecting so many comments! I have sent this to “s”, “d” and our mutual friends. 

“S” thanks everyone for their support, our mutual friends have decided that “d” is out of line. 

“D” however has decided that he no longer wishes to associate with someone “so toxic like “s”” And has decided to continue to badmouth her, call her a homophone, transphobe and everything in between. We suspect there’s an underlying issue here and we’re not sad to be losing him from our friend circle . Thank you Reddit!",100,49,0.63

he said I need to calm down cause I don’t even watch or pay attention to sports. He said I wouldn’t know what would be going on and his friend would be better to go with. It’s his tickets and he can take who he wants.

1783,Not the A-hole,"Backstory: My ex and I adopted 3 cats from a rescue. When you adopt you sign a contract that says if you can’t keep the animal it needs to be returned to the rescue. We both signed. Ultimately we divorced and I kept the cats.

I’ve since remarried and been with my husband for 3 years. He has expressed his frustrations with the cats almost daily. He refers to them as “my cats”, he has said multiple times that he hates them, that they are annoying/stupid, he always has a complaint, even going as far as to put energy into situations that haven’t occurred yet. As an example of that, we want to buy new couches and he says they will just claw them up, they destroy everything, etc. I feel like they are really good cats as far as cats go; however, I have become increasingly allergic to them which is a concern for me.

Issue: This morning he was upset with the cats for meowing. I texted my ex to put my feelers out if he would be interested in having them back. I texted him because he has cared for the cats before, they know him, and he wanted them just as much as I did all those years ago. Also, he’s the only other person that signed the adoption contract, so he’s the only one that can take them back.

My husband was very upset when I told him. He said I should have talked to him first because it’s a family issue and not asked my ex which took me aback as he has always made it clear they are “my cats”. He also said that if I wanted to get rid of them, it would have to be because I wanted to and not because of him, which is what I think the real issue is. I think he’s offended that I took action on his persistent dislike of the cats.

The cats could be around for years and if he hasn’t found peace with that yet he’ll be complaining forever, which has honestly worn me out at this point. It stresses me out. I don’t know what to say. The cat is a cat. Sometimes they’re inconvenient. Sometimes they throw up. What’s more, he thinks I should apologize for the cats when they do something irritating. I’m not going to apologize daily for a decade and I feel like that further creates a divide of “my cats” versus “our cats”. I feel like he should’ve accepted the cats back when we got together. It’s not like I hid the number of cats I had. It’s also because of this that I don’t feel like he should be getting upset that I simply asked my ex if he’d be interested. You can’t hate “my cats” and then get upset when I look into re-homing them.

I told him we would have discussed it if my ex actually showed interest in them and if he was a viable option. Obviously I don’t want to inconvenience my husband for years and have him be unhappy in his own home and I want my cats to be wanted and cared for. I personally feel it’s shitty to adopt an animal and not keep it for the duration of its life, but I’m allergic to them so I can’t maintain as close of a relationship with them as I once did.",30,42,0.92

I've always cared for people, as a kid I took care of my grandpa with dementia, my wheelchair bound mother, I was later a nurse aid at a nursing facility and went on to be a behavior technician for children and adults with autism. I like it and it's made me a patient person.

Sadly, I had to resign from my position because it required full time availability and I was returning to school. an old, old friend of my dad's reached out and mentioned she was looking for someone to care for her autistic son, promising flexible hours and I agreed. Her son is pretty high functioning. He has his own house and works a job, but doesn't drive. I aid him in cleaning, staying active, cooking, and running errands.

The thing is, he's kind of....well a jerk. And I've dealt with a lot of people in this condition. He's incredibly demanding - give me this, do that, get me that. He'll request I make something, I'll make it, he'll insult it and refuse to eat it, and then contact his mother on what a screw up I am. He's also incredibly sexual. He mentions my breasts and talk in great detail about assaulting/doing me. When I guide him away from the topic or ask him gently not to talk like that, he flips and calls his mom again, who will then call me and complain about how rude I'm being. I suppose to accept that behavior. To make matters worse, he'll lie and tell her I'm not coming over on my assigned days, so now she calls me on the home phone just to assure I'm there.

So I'm getting married (yay!) in a month and I'm kind of torn on an issue. My sister, Sarah\* had her first kid, Ava\* 2 years ago and she's great. The first grandchild of the family so of course she's adored by everyone. The only problem is, Sarah has a habit of taking her places that toddlers don't really belong and being a toddler, sometimes Ava yells or cries or gets in the way. This would be fine but Sarah for whatever reason will not take Ava out of the room unless someone makes her.  If it's yelling/squealing Sarah has said she doesn't see the problem because Ava does it out of happiness. This has made several family/social events very uncomfortable. 

I really don't want Ava at my wedding. I love her a lot but I know I'll be worried the whole ceremony about her making noises (especially because the church is echoey). I would be very upset if she was loud all through the ceremony especially since she would be in the front row. Ava is very clingy so Sarah won't leave her with a babysitter for the ceremony in case she can't be settled. The only other kids attending are our ringbearer and flower girls who are my fiance's nieces and nephew. The youngest is 5 and can sit still for long enough to get through the ceremony but my sister sees this as me favouring them over Ava. I just honestly think Ava is too young for a long grown up wedding and I don't think she'll enjoy it. I tried to compromise by suggesting Ava comes to the reception, makes her appearance for a few hours and then leaves when it's bedtime so she doesn't get overtired and cranky. Sarah feels Ava should be there as long as she sees fit because she's close family. 

Sarah is furious and has threatened not to come at all and my parents are also pressuring me to include Ava because they want her in the pictures. I told Sarah if it comes down to it and she can't find a babysitter I would understand which just made her even more angry.

Because of that, I have a strict rule with my bf. If he wants any sort of oral action, he must shower. No exceptions. It doesn't matter if he's just showered a few hours back, that sweat builds up and builds up fast. And your naughty bits start to smell funky soon.

He's annoyed at me that he doesn't mind going down on me spontaneously so he feels like I'm not returning the favor. Tough luck for him. He's never complained about the blowjob or the sex, just cleaning up before. AITA here? I would hope not.

Well I called one pitch a ball and the kid looks at me and says, “hey blue, can you call a strike for once?” To which I replied, “yeah once you start throwing some”.

But wait! There was a straggler pack waayy in the back on the middle shelf (too high for most people to reach, including myself). Without hesitation, I kinda squeezed in underneath and pushed it across the metal bars to the front with my phone. Took a bit of wrangling, but I eventually got it.

I was so friggin happy, I turned to leave the aisle, only to see the woman from earlier staring at me with disgust. With impeccable timing, the person she was presumably asking for help with on the phone earlier shows up to offer assistance. She tells him never mind and angrily stuffs a bag of Huggies into her cart.

1799,Asshole,"I have 3 sons. Matt(28), Mark(26), and Luke(5). 


When mark finished high school, I moved from WA to TN to help my siblings take care of our mom. My boys weren’t too concerned. They had other stuff going on and my plan wasn’t to stay permanently, just a year or so. As bad as it sounds, we weren’t expecting my mom to make it due to some health reasons. She completely recovered and doesn’t even live here anymore. She moved to SC. 


In the 3 years I was here taking care of her, I met someone and we had our son Luke. Luke’s dad and I aren’t together anymore but we share custody and he’s actively involved in his life. 


My son Matt gives me a lot of shit for moving. He always takes shots at me about not living near them or moving away. Examples:


Me: I miss you Matt


Matt: well you’re the one who moved to TN


Me: I hate it in TN


Matt: You apparently like it enough that you’d move away from your kids to live there





Most of the time I just ask him to stop or ignore him. We were together recently for my mom’s birthday party in Florida. Matt starts making his jabs at me for living in TN. 



This time I snapped back. I said “look, I have a FIVE year old son here. I’m not leaving him and I’m not taking him away from his dad. You can visit as often as you’d like but I’m not moving back just so you will be happy”. 


He just gave me a sarcastic response and said “of course. Why would anyone care about my happiness?” At that point, i just ignored him and he didn’t  talk to me for the rest of the night. 



AITA for saying that? I didn’t want to but I’m tired of his jabs. I can’t just move back and frankly, I don’t want to. I do hate TN in general but I have my siblings here in addition to my young son. And it’s much closer to my mom. I also have a job here. I moved to WA to be with my ex, mark and Matt’s dad. I had no family there outside of my kids and not many friends. Plus it’s much more expensive to live in WA than TN.



Also, in case it’s relevant, I see my older 2 sons about 5-6 times a year. I pay for their plane tickets twice a year and I visit them twice a year. The other times we see each other they pay for their ticket or we meet up somewhere for a family event(like my mom’s birthday for example).",70,29,0.76
1800,Not the A-hole,"I know that probably sounds bad on my end but let me explain. 

My cousin and her partner have 5 kids and a car that can only fit 3 of those kids. Because of this if they ever want to have weekends or school holidays out with their kids then they need to bring along someone else with a car to join and transport two of the kids. Usually this is me but sometimes it's other members of the family.

Recently my cousin  expressed interest in having another kid and I told her (not me wanting to come off as rude if it did) that ""Shouldn't you guys  either get a bigger car or at least get second one to fit the ones you do have first? So you guys can get out and do things just for you guys and the kids"" . Well that triggered some negativity from her towards me and getting snappy about how they're trying to get another car but it's expensive and that I don't understand because I'm not a mum.

So AITA? I just think that if you're going to have kids you should be able to have your own transportation that can fit them all.

A while back I put a post up here about my now ex-gf, and surprise surprise things didn't work out and now I'm single. I decided to give Tinder a try.

I've never used it before, but I've seen a few male profiles with their height, and a few female profiles saying something like if you're not 6ft don't bother. So I put my height, 185cm/6ft, exactly like that. I figure that way the information is there if they care, and if they don't care it doesn't matter.

Friend number 1, when I show him my profile for advice, gets upset. He says I sound like some bro bragging. He also started talking about it being unfair chicks only go for tall guys, which was weird because he couldn't be that much shorter than me, but also kinda made me discount his opinion a little. I tried to say women are allowed have preferences, after all he had said in the past he wouldn't date a woman with a weight in triple digits, but he then accused me of bragging to him that I was ""more desirable"".

So I spoke to another friend, this time a woman. Friend number 2 said that I was essentially accusing women of being shallow, that I'm putting my height because I think that's all they care about. I said that there was more to my profile than that. But she agreed with my friend that I sounded like I was bragging.

Am I bragging? Am I a bro? AITA?

Edit: A few people have commented about my friend saying he wouldn't date a woman with a triple digit weight. It didn't occur to me to mention we use metric for most things here, so he means 100kgs, or 220lbs. For comparison, that's about how much Mike Tyson weighed.

1807,Not the A-hole,"I'm 19F and I've been friends with Kay since freshman year of college. Our second year started last month and over the summer, she cracked her phone screen really bad and when she first showed our friend group, she joked about how clumsy she is. Her phone had pieces missing from the screen and when someone recommended that she replace her screen before she hurt her finger, she said that she couldn't afford it yet. 

Last week, I was walking with Kay to grab dinner and I slipped, causing her to also fall and her phone to gain yet another crack.

She started crying and saying that her mom was going to be mad. I went to comfort her and I told her that because I added another crack to her phone, I could give her 50% of the cost right there. She got silent and didn't talk to me at all during dinner. 

Our friends told me the next day that she was mad at me and I mentioned that I offered to pay half for half of the screen so I'm not sure what she's mad about and she should just talk to me about any issues she's having.

After giving me the silent treatment, she finally responded to me (because I was trying to meet her at a local shop for an estimate) and told me she wants me to pay for the entire screen. I think that's absolutely ridiculous because she already had destroyed her phone to the point where pieces had fallen off and was making jokes about it.

I'm also a bit miffed at the silent treatment and the gossip because I immediately offered to pay half although I only added one crack to a sea of 20+. And why not just tell me at dinner she wanted me to pay for the entire thing. I would have said no but I did nothing to deserve to be treated this way.

A week after Julia bought Rose the two tickets, she texted me saying she ran out of money and that she wanted me to pay her for my ticket to go with Rose. I have already spent 3x the amount that the ticket is worth for plane rides to be able to go to the show with Rose. I told Julia that I wouldn't pay for the ticket because I had already spent a lot of money to be able to go, and I bought the plane tickets, knowing the tickets to the show were a gift.

If Julia had asked me to pay for my ticket before she already gave them to Rose, I would think differently about this. But Julia surprised Rose with the two tickets a week ago and is just now asking me to pay half of the price.

This resulted in Julia becoming very upset, to the point where my girlfriend, Rose, paid her the money for the second ticket to get her to shut up. Now Julia is texting me saying that it's my fault that Rose had to pay for the ticket and that it's not right for her to do so.

Even though my dad doesn't have the best financial situation he still makes sure I feel no different from anyone else. Now to the story. 




So I was on the subway on my way to meet some friends to go get lunch. In Sweden there's a lot of homeless person begging for money i the subways. So I was minding my own business when I saw a homeless man walking up the train and I remembered I had some spear coins. I always like to give spear coins that I won't use to people in need cus I know what it's like struggling. So when he walks past me I tell him I have a couple of spare coins and that he can have them. He says thank you as I start looking through my wallet.

 While giving him the coins I accidentally pull out the 50 and the 20 kr bills that I also had in my wallet. ( about 7 dollars that I was going to use for lunch.) I reach down to grab the money I dropped and see that he was going for it to. He gets to it before me and I think he's going to give them back to me. He doesn't. Instead he just starts walking away.

This semester I paid someone to fill it out of sheer laziness and told the three they could use it in case of emergency, as long as they replaced exactly what they took. The alternative is to climb down three flights of stairs to the hostel's emergency supply.

My parents do own the house but we all pay the same amount in rent each month so it is not like me and my brother are getting special treatment and living in the house for free. In the past, my mother would visit maybe once every few weeks or come up when we needed something. Now in the past month, she's been here pretty much every day, now I don't mean 3 days a week I mean shes here 6-7 days a week. And when she is here she gets super political and talks about how much she hates my dad and super negative stuff like that. It's not gotten to the point where when shes says that stuff about my dad it messes with my mental health for the next couple days and I had to start seeing my therapist again.

Now today it culminated with a text saying she was coming down to see us for the 7th time this week. She then sat in our living room yelling at my brother while I am trying to study. I then finally went into my brother's room and asked him the questions my mom had been yelling at him for over an hour and got a response about if he wanted to go to the store with her or not. My mom then looks at me and asks why I am so grumpy by her just sitting there in the living room. I respond with your here every day. I didn't yell or use an angry tone when I said this I just said it in normal conversation. My mom then said well I will go home then and looked like she was about to cry when she left.

I feel bad for making my mom upset but I just want to be independent and not have my mother breathing down my neck. My brother too has said that when my mom is over and says that negative stuff about my dad it gives him really bad anxiety.

My youngest's (14M) BFF (15M) sleeps over almost every weekend. We don't have an agreement with his parents, and they never check to see if it's okay or anything, he's just always here and very frequently stays over. I guess my house is fun and we're chill. This is where this weekend's problem starts.

My oldest (18M) had a sleepover party with a metric swarm of HS senior & college friends (mixed gender/orientation, ranging in age from 17-20). Some of the parents asked me if everyone would be sleeping together, and my response was ""We try to keep doors open, there is no booze, and husband and I are here all evening, but I won't police where everyone ultimately crashes."" Any parents who took issue with this made their kids leave the party around 2am. Cool.  Maybe 3 kids went home. I lost count of how many stayed. 

Youngest's BFF Mom asked me the same question, and I gave her the same response. I suggested she too could come get her kid at 2am. She said ""The responsible thing to do is to separate the girls and boys into two different rooms."" I said ""Okay"" and nothing else, as I was busy cleaning up when she dropped him off at my house. It was the first time she's ever escorted him to the door, too. Usually her car just pulls up and he jumps out. I digress.

Well it was 4am by the time the quasi-adultlings were all passed out, and they just crashed wherever. I found some under the table in the dining room, some sleeping in the hallway, but most of them all over the media room since it has the most floor space. 

Youngest's BFF Mom called me this morning livid that I'd promised her I'd split the kids into different rooms. She yelled something about her son being impressionable and that I was sole reason there are still teen pregnancies in America. I responded with ""Trust me none of these 18yo kids were interested in (youngest) and (BFF)!"" She hung up on me and started complaining to other parents. She even vaguebooked about it. Ugh. Anyway, I asked around if I was the AH and got some mixed responses:

Husband: ""There were like 20 genders and orientations represented at that party, there was no way to logically split them up, even if we'd tried."" (NTA)

My BFF: ""She overreacted, but to protect yourself you should have laid out some ground rules when everyone showed up."" (ESH) 

My other BFF: ""At the very least you should have separated the younger boys out to prevent jiggery-pokery."" (YTA and yes she said ""jiggery-pokery"" -- She's a lot older than me and I think she immigrated here from 1800's England.)

1820,Not enough info,"So, i've been running a d&d game for almost a year now. I run a game every Saturday for 6 people and I really enjoy it. Recently though, two of my players have been annoying me to all hell. One of them will make extremely annoying decisions in game that others don't like. Along with this, she will also just decide that she doesn't want to play 30 minutes before the game begins or halfway through sessions. The other is not as bad, but he will just show up late or not at all with no heads up. 

I've been getting really sick of this and am thinking of just reforming the game without them. It would be obvious to them because we would be playing with the other 4. My players are divided here on if i would be a jerk but I honestly am getting suck of dealing with them

1821,Not the A-hole,"     My fiancé and I split up 5 years ago. Our daughter was 5 at the time, 10 now.  Every year since she was age 3, the two of us have taken her trick or treating together, even after the split.
     He’s had a girlfriend for the past couple of years. I can’t tell you how many times they’ve broken up and gotten back together. She also has 2 children. She has told my X that she doesn’t feel involved enough in our daughter’s life. We have a 50/50 split, so she’s with them half the time.  That the girlfriend wants them to be a real family, so she needs to be involved in our parenting.
     This brings us to trick or treat this year. X and girlfriend want us all to go together. Me, my daughter, X, X’s girlfriend, her 2 kids.  I told my daughter that was fine, if that’s what she wanted to do. She doesn’t want to. She wants me and her dad and her to go.
     Her father said that if she doesn’t want to go with him and girlfriend that he won’t go with just her and I. He will only go with gf and her kids.  
     He said that I need to act like an adult and make the decision for our daughter to go with everyone. I feel like he’s putting his gf’s wishes before our daughter’s and I’m not going to force her to go with them. He says I should force her and that it will be ok and everyone will have fun.

He said he didn't love her and planned on moving in with his mistress and her family in another state.  At first, my mother was a typical woman scorned, saying she wouldn't forgive him even if he crawled on his knees back from his mistress's house.  I personally have always had the view that cheating is immoral, wrong, cowardly, and unforgivable.  My mother seemed to feel the same way.  We all thought we would have to rebuild as a three person family (my mom, my brother, and I).  Fast forward to last week, and my mother has started talking with him.  She's becoming increasingly upset that I refuse to speak with him.  I am not ready to face him, nor will I be ready for some time.  I have a sneaking suspicion that my mom wants to take him back.

1825,Everyone Sucks,"Note. My step-daughter, Madeline, was about a year old when I married her mother, Jessica. Madeline’s father died before she was born. 
 
Madeline is currently 15, and she’s rebelling for almost everything. She did something bad, so while picking her up, I set a punishment up for her. Then she said “You’re not my dad. I don’t have to follow you”. Honestly, I got a bit hurt from that. But I understand that she didn’t mean it, and that she’d probably change. I just replied “I’m still your legal guardian for the next 3 years, and as long as your in my house, you have to follow my rules.” 
 
That happened about 2 days ago. So our family was going grocery shopping, when Madeline said “I’m hungry. I need food.” I decide to be extremely cheeky and say “Hi Hungry, I’m not your dad.” My son just started to laugh uncontrollably. My daughter was just quiet with embarrassment. And my wife was berating me “Not to stoop down to her level.” 
 
I honestly thought it was a funny dad joke. And my son agrees. So AITA?
 
Edit: I did adopt her. So legally I am her parent.

 
Mini Update: I’ll probably give a full update later but here is what happened so far. I go to my daughter’s room after dinner and begin talking with her. “Hey. I’m really sorry that I hurt you by the words I said. And I am really your dad. I changed your diapers, I met your boyfriend, and I plan on helping you through college. And plus I’m legally your dad, so we’re stuck together. But seriously, I’m going to love you like my daughter even if you don’t think I’m your dad. Then I hugged her. She did start to cry.

1828,Not the A-hole,"Hello, 

So for reference I have been living in my current apartment building since February. The unit next to ours was empty for the first two months or so, then a couple moved in. Ever since they moved in, they’ve been obnoxious. I’m convinced neither of them work and that the woman is not on the lease, as all they do is blare music and cackle loudly at all hours of the day. They frequently take turns locking each other out and banging on the door for hours to be let in. They throw things around and yell at each other late at night. 

We finally reached out to the on-site land lady, who said this behavior was unacceptable. Things quieted down for awhile, they still played music loudly but I kinda brushed it off as I’m sure we have done noisy things too. Can’t expect them to be silent all the time. 

So, another relevant point is that I have PTSD with recurring nightmares about people entering my apartment/room. It causes me a lot of anxiety, to the point where I obsess about the door being locked. 

Last night our *lovely* neighbors started banging on our door and yelling to be let in at 3:30 am. This immediately triggered a panic attack for me and I woke up my partner in bed while hyperventilating. I was terrified as they relentlessly knocked and called out a name that wasn’t mine or my partners. My boyfriend got up to go near the door which made me feel worse. I kept repeating “don’t open don’t open don’t open!” He said through the door “I think you have the wrong apartment”, and he heard the one next to us open their door. I don’t know if they heard us or if the one next door heard the yelling, but either way it stopped after that. The confusing thing is that in my building you need a fob to get in, up the elevator/stairs, and then a key for each unit. How did these people get in this early in the morning without the unit owner waiting for them or getting them from the lobby? 

I have been a wreck all day since. I’m jittery and still feeling triggered. My partner is tempted to slip a note under their door, saying something like “Don’t knock on our door at 3am ASSHOLE!” 

Would we be the assholes if we did that? I’m just not sure what else the building management can do if they’ve been warned once and won’t listen.",35,152,0.94

1832,Not the A-hole,"Apologies if this seems like a validation post, I have anxiety and it can be hard for me to tell sometimes if I'm being objective.

So I run a D&D group. My players are mostly friends from college and a couple others. I like to think I'm a fairly good DM: my house rules are consistent (I have them typed up and I give them to new-to-us players), I'm lax as long as things are still fun, but I still do my best to make the game fair and at least somewhat grounded. All in all, we mostly do this to have fun drinking and collectively tell some stories about a bunch of assholes who are just dicking around a fantasy world, slaying witches and laying bitches (or, dragons). It's great fun. A lot of work for me because I homebrew everything, but a lot of fun.

One of these friends, I'll call her Abby. She's... pretty ""particular"" about things, she wants things to go they way she wants them to, and gets very upset when it doesn't. At the risk of sounding like a terrible person, she sometimes holds her mental health hostage if other people don't do what she wants, like telling people they're making her depression worse if they don't let her win a game, or if they don't forgive her when she was rude to them. I promise she's not as bad as I'm probably making her sound, but I'm starting to realize that she at least has toxic tendencies, and they definitely carry into D&D.

Abby has a ""thing"" about always being the only one in the limelight. For D&D specifically, she clearly wants to be the main character and have everyone else be her sidekicks. She wants to be the party face, she wants to be the one getting all the glory, do all the speeches, creating and executing all the solutions, that sort of deal. As other people who play know, this is a HUGE no-no. Whenever Abby isn't the main character (often because I'm trying to be fair to everyone else as well), or when the party or I aren't catering enough to her character's edgy backstory, she complains: my group isn't serious enough (but when I took her to another, more serious group, she said she liked me running it because I let more fun stuff slide), I pay too much attention to the others and ignore her (despite the fact that I made a whole multi-session sidequest dedicated to her tragic backstory, and straight up let her derail my campaign because she said ""I was making her depression worse""), the names are stupid (she has literally insisted on re-naming NPCs to names she likes better), etc. When I asked my other players, they said they didn't have any issues aside from Abby's Main Character-ing, but they felt I'm being fair in how I'm dealing with it.

Y'all, I'm at the end of my rope, and I swear to God the next time she complains, I'm just going to tell her that if she doesn't like my group, she's welcome to either run her own, or she can just straight up leave the group and find one that suits her better. I know telling someone to deal with it or get out is generally a dick move, but WIBTA if I told her that?",30,30,0.9

1834,Not the A-hole,"I have a mate who is religious, while we are atheist. We live in London. We normally have an ‘agree to disagree’ approach to divisive topics and successfully treat each other respectfully. 

The incident in the title happened recently and i was (and am) of the mind that i was not wrong to deny her request, however another mate of mine (also atheist) was quite shocked and suggested i was being stubborn just to prove a point, so here i am asking for judgement please! 

So here’s what happened: the night before we were meant to meet up she messaged asking if i can refrain from using the word ‘boob’ around her son as he had picked it up and her hubby was mad. 
I told her i would not go out of my way to use it but that i would not stop from saying it as both my kids (both breastfed, one of them ongoing) use it to describe breasts and the act of feeding. She then asked if in that case i could be subtle in my use of it, to which again i said no. I would not go and address her kid directly with it purposely but I wasn’t going to whisper or hide my use of the word. 

My reasoning is as follows: 
- the word is not obscene / vulgar / swear word

- it is a common word to hear amongst kids, especially within breastfeeding families (she also breastfeeds)

- i have used it around her and her baby and her husband previously 

- refusing to be ‘subtle’ in my use came from a desire to not attribute shame to it for my kids. I was raised to be ashamed of my body and its functions and I desperately wanted to avoid the same for my kids so we use the proper names for all their bits and are quite matter of fact about bodily functions. Starting to whisper about it sat wrong with me, it felt like i was agreeing with this being smth that should be hidden

- we were going to a museum popular with families with young kids so not like she was going to ask every person there to not say boob or breast or who knows what else

There you have it, what do you think?

1838,Not the A-hole,"My two friends and I went to a Thai restaurant last night. We were seated as soon as we walked in. Once someone came to take our orders, we noticed our waiter was extremely hostile and uninviting. Out of curiosity one of my friends looked up the hours online and it said they closed at 6. We walked in at 7:30. The open sign was glowing and turned on and there were two other tables eating as well. I’ve also eaten here plenty of times and they’ve always been open around the time we came in. We figured that since they didn’t tell us they were closed and since there were other tables, that maybe they didn’t update their hours online. The waiter was so hostile that it made us all nervous to ask him if they were closed- literally every time he walked past our table we told ourselves we’d ask but would freeze up whenever he actually was there. So once we got our food, we took a few bites, asked for to-go boxes and our checks and left pretty decent tips. 

On one hand, he was kind of rude, but on the other hand, I totally understand and I would also get annoyed if I was working at a restaurant that closed at 6 and I was still there at 7:30, so I see where he’s coming from and I don’t blame him for that.

1839,Not the A-hole,"I’ll start off by saying that I know I’m a bit of a germaphobe. It’s not like, ruining my life or anything like that, but it’s something most people know about me after spending any extended amount of time with me. 

We have a bi-monthly work meeting with food. Usually it’s a few boxes of pizza and bowls of chips, maybe someone makes brownies or something too. I never eat at these meetings. Basically, I get kind of grossed out watching my coworkers touch two other pieces of pizza in order to separate theirs and get it on their plate, then lick their fingers, then go back for seconds and do the same touching thing. It’s the same thing with the bowls of chips, just all the hands make me lose my appetite. I’m not trying to be rude but I think most people that I work with don’t wash their hands all that often and I just can’t get over the mental image of that at these meetings.

A newer guy asked me on Friday why I never ate any of the food, loudly enough to make it more of a group conversation with the coworkers near us. I initially just kind of shrugged and said “not hungry.” He made a comment about how skinny I am and insinuating I must always be on a diet, kind of laughing about it. I told him I wasn’t on any diets, just didn’t want to eat the meeting food. And then he just kept pressing me on it, like “sure, sure, I’m sure you’re always ‘not hungry’ for eeveryyy meeting.”

I know he was teasing and I didn’t really care, but at this point I was just like “Well, that, and I’m just mildly germaphobic. I usually don’t eat pizza or finger foods in group settings.” He said something like “what does that mean? No one is sneezing on the food!” So I explained what I just said above—the constant “fingering” of foods, and mostly not seeing anyone wash their hands before doing that, the finger licking and then grabbing chips or more pizza, etc. just put me off my appetite.

Some people just laughed but the guy and one other coworker kind of gave me these disgusted or insulted looks. I didn’t mean to put THEM off their appetite as well but I think in my honesty I may have. Was what I said really rude? Does it warrant an apology?",74,396,0.96

1842,No A-holes here,"Okay so my grandmother (85) has been admitted in hospitals about 5 different times in the last two years. She’s pulled through amazingly each time but this time it doesn’t seem like it will be the same. She had two heart attacks back to back and at first seemed like she was going to be okay but took a turn for the worse over the weekend. There was a moment where she was conscious and expressed that she’s tired and she wants to die. She no longer wants to keep suffering and is at peace with it. It hurts to hear but we get it. She was intubated because her breathing was failing and the doctor said we would give it until Monday to make a final decision.

Now the problem is that my grandmother has custody of my niece who has been staying with my aunt while she’s been hospitalized because it’s just a lot more convenient. My aunt lives in my niece’s school district and has a young daughter that is basically my niece’s other half. My aunt is a wonderful woman but she is tough in a healthy way. She doesn’t put up with BS and is very family first (her kids and husband). We all know that my aunt will not stay with my niece for the long run which is fine. My mother says she will step up since “she can’t abandon her granddaughter” this means my mother will come from her home country to the US to take care of my niece. (Niece’s mother is not able to have her right now because of mental health issues)

Another problem is my mother wants to come after my grandmother passes to take the body back to their home country and she expects her sister to go with her. She wants me to take care of my niece which I wouldn’t have a problem doing so except she gets out of school around 4PM and I’m already on my way to my school at 3PM and wouldn’t get back home until close to 10PM two days out of the week and then two other days I leave for school at 6PM and get back at the same time so I literally can’t watch her. I tell my mother this and she says it’s just for a short while until she gets back to the US. I explain to her that I can’t again and she goes “okay I know I can’t count on you” and then says “this is an emergency I’ll talk to her father and see if he can take her anywhere”. The problem is that the father is hot garbage juice. He leaves her alone almost all day while I assume he’s making drop offs because he sells weed because he refused to get a real job in order to not pay child support. He’s mentally and emotionally abusive and belongs in a dump yard.

My issue is that for two days I don’t mind leaving her alone for a few hours while I’m at school but I don’t like the idea of her coming home to an empty house and going to bed alone basically spending her whole day alone outside of school on the other two days. She’s a great kid and really needs to feel the warmth of a family which my husband and I can’t give her until the semester is over and I can rearrange my classes.

AITA for saying no to my mother?

UPDATE:
Hello again, I just wanted to thank everyone for their thoughts, opinions and judgements regardless of what was said. 

So the solution that was agreed upon is that niece will stay with the aunt she’s been staying with. Her husband and her talked it out amongst themselves and decided why move her when it’s all so convenient for everyone. Niece gets out at 4PM daily and cousin gets home by 3PM daily so cousin will be home before niece. My uncle will also be around as he gets home around 4PM so they will both be supervised for a few hours until my aunt gets home from the hospital. 

As far as my mother, at first I decided to just leave her alone and not text her cuz she really hurt me and put me in a tight spot without it having to be. I quickly changed my mind though because she’s hurting and grieving and I’m losing a grandmother but she’s losing her mother and idk what my mind will be like when that time comes for her. I don’t hold it against her since we’re all very emotional and she just basically wants me to be her proxy but she doesn’t understand that I’m not there yet. I’m not ready to make decisions on her behalf that affect the whole family. Quite frankly it’s just not my place. 

The superstar of all this though is my aunt. She’s been strong for everyone in my family. When she saw us getting emotional around grandma she took us to the side individually and helped us do breathing exercises so we wouldn’t upset grandma in her final moments. She made sure ALL of the grandkids were together when grandmother was extubated and we surrounded her bed making jokes and having grandmother cuss at us cuz we kept saying the only inheritance she’s leaving us is our smelly feet and hairless legs up until the moment we found a single black hair on her leg and then the laughter really ensued. 

She’s still with us for the moment and we will continue to make the best out of the most painful stage in this shitty cycle called life. 

Also we had the most amazing nurse like BEST NURSE HANDS DOWN! Nominate your nurses for a Daisy Award if you feel like you’ve received exceptional treatment. We nominated ours and gave her a thank you note because she really is an angel. Some people are just born with an innate ability to comfort people and our nurse is one of them. She was attentive, kind and warm. We even asked to see if she’s like that with all her patience and the answer yes so we nominated her.

Her room is right next to mine and the walls are super thin, so I can here everything she is doing. She also is pretty disgusting and leaves her hair in the bath and her sink. Needless to say, I don’t like her.

1844,Not the A-hole,"Weird title I know.

Here's what happened: It was my birthday a few days ago and with my friends (lets call Sue and Jane, real creative) asked what I wanted to do to celebrate. My plans were pretty simple; dinner + movie + video games. Both were alright with this. I picked a movie to see in theaters, believing both would like/be alright with it. Now here's the thing, Jane is one of those people who love getting her way. If she doesn't, it's not always pretty. I'm very patient with her because she came from a family who never told her no, so I don't blame her behavior entirely on her and she has improved over the time I've known her, but I can also say it can be difficult. Especially in this situation.

She criticized the movie I wanted to see and persistently suggested other movies to go see. She even mistold us the time so we would miss it. Keep in mind she's 28. So I asked her why she didn't want to see it in hope of compromising, and she only said it was going to be offensive, too dark (she watches a lot of dark things, so I didn't think she would mind) and glorifies crime. Apparently there were so many  better movies we should see. Sue kept pressing, reminding Jane it's my birthday, until finally she angrily accepted.

Well we see the movie, I love it, Sue likes it and Jane began to cry. We console her, but she quickly pushes us away and say we were thoughtless jerks. After she calmed down she told us she didn't want to see the movie because how it portrayed cops (her father's one and she is a guard at a prison) looking like the bad guys (I disagree, but didn't tell her that) and how it glorified crime and made criminal behavior alright. In my opinion, I don't think that was the movie's intent, it was far more about mental illness, but Jane was relentless in berating the film and calling us out on taking her.

I apologized and told her she could have told me that, I would have happily found something else to do. She called me selfish and left. So I ended up getting drunk on birthday feeling guilty as hell. Was I the asshole?

I went inside to get him food, something that takes literally what? Five minutes? While I'm inside i hear the doorbell.

It's one of my neighbors, somebody i barely know. She was very pissed and told me that it's illegal to CHAIN dogs. The dog was not chained. He was on his leash. Around the doorknob. I told her that i knew that already and let the dog inside.

 I thought that was the end of it.  

I was wrong.

I understand that it's important for my girlfriend and I to spend time together, so usually dinner time, I'll spend time with her during prep and at the dinner table but I won't eat, with the exception of Wednesdays, where we have agreed to go out for dinner. During those days, I won't eat lunch and then save it for dinner.

Today we were having a discussion and she was telling me how it was important for us to share a meal together. I told her that I didn't understand why it was important to physically put food in my mouth, and expressed that I felt like the time we spent together talking felt like good quality time. I asked her why it was important for there to be food in both our mouths and she said she was unable to explain it, and that it was very sad that I was unable to understand why it's important to have a meal. She then cried and then said she needed time alone.

A: It provides me energy to get through the day. Eating dinner will keep me up at night.  


Q: INFO: can you split your calories between two meals? Does your one meal HAVE to be lunch?  
A: Unfortunately it's just about the timing. Generally when I eat at night, my T3 hormone levels in my blood work just go off. It may be due to just the change in the schedule? But this has been a schedule that has best kept my hormone levels in check.",232,1025,0.96

1849,Not the A-hole,"Some background, husband and I have been together for almost 10 years, during that time a big issue was how little he contributed to the household chores. He would have to be asked to do the bare minimum and when he did would have a bad attitude about the whole thing. We'd have major discussions about how I felt, we'd brainstorm ways to make it better, he'd get defensive and eventually we'd land at him agreeing to make a change, which would last for a couple weeks and then things would go back to the same. Rinse and repeat. 

Cut to the present, we have a toddler, with a second on the way and nothing's changed. I had a heart to heart with him and explained that this way of living was not sustainable, I told him I was resentful and angry all the time due to his behavior. He concluded that he was being really unfair and promised this time it would be different. 

It's been a couple of months and to his credit, he seems to have turned a new leaf. It's not a 50/50 split , maybe 70/30 and I still do most of the mental labor. But there has been enough improvement that I don't feel like a doormat. 

Which brings me to the question at hand. I work 10-5, mon-fri, but I also work from home. I'm 6mos pregnant now. I get up at 8:30, get the toddler ready for day care. My husband's work is such that he's often gone for 3-4 days at a time, and home for 2-3 days. When he is home, I intentionally avoid doing any of the ""hard"" tasks, such as getting her ready for school, dropping her off, diaper changes, and meal time. 

I still have to prompt him to do most of these things, other wise she usually gets to school late, doesn't eat on time and get changed often. . 

I can sense some anger/resentment about him having to shoulder these tasks on his own. Nothing outright, mostly passive behavior on his end, sighs of exasperation, eye rolls, passive comments. I think that knowing his own track record, he feels he can't say much and also if he did, he would have to confront the still unbalanced nature of our relationship. 

Now, I could absolutely help him with these tasks. I could get up in the morning and pack her lunch bag while he gets her dressed. I could ride with them to daycare. I could take turns with meal Time and diaper changes, but im specifically choosing not to do so for a couple of reasons. 

One, I do it all by myself when he's at work, I gets no breaks. Two, even with avoiding doing those tasks, I still do housework, work work, the mental labor and still find myself doing mealtime and diaper changes anyway, playing with our toddler, engaging with her and watching her, no complaints. Three, we have a baby on the way and might soon get custody of our step son, who is an amazing kid btw. It's only gonna get harder and he's gonna have to step up even more. I fully expect to be the primary caregiver for our newborn, since I'll be exclusively breast feeding. 

So, AITA for expecting him do the ""bulk"" of the parenting when he's home? Is there a better way?

EDIT: I make sure she's fed and ready on time, and changed regularly, but that is due to my prompting. Or just doing it, when it needs to be done. The point I was poorly trying to make was that these things would likely not happen in a timely fashion if left unprompted. I'm obviously not trying to test out that theory.",28,29,0.93

1853,Asshole,"This weekend, my boyfriend and I went to the wedding of a friend who I hadn't seen in a couple years. She and I had been part of a sisterhood-type group. I was incredibly excited to get to see all my friends from the group who live all over the country, and to party!

The bride offered her house for us to stay at for the two nights we were there. This is a typical arrangement for the group I am a part of because it requires a lot of travel and the community is very supportive. Before we left home, my boyfriend and I decided to gift $200 both as a wedding gift and a thank you for giving us a place to stay. (Alternate accommodations would have been around $50 per night)

Going to the wedding required both me and my boyfriend to take time off of work (costing me somewhere around $100 and him around $200), required me to buy a new dress to match the color theme ($100), and required a 20hr round trip drive.

Up until this point, everything was fine and I was happy to sacrifice my time and money to be with my friend on her special day. When we got to the ceremony, I knew absolutely no one. I was surprised because the bride said she was inviting everyone from our group. As the ceremony started, I realized that all of the other people in the group at the wedding were bridesmaids. I'm not gonna lie, that really hurt, but at this point I was still fine - maybe she was closer with those girls, and we would still have fun and hang out at the reception.

Then we get to the reception, and there's no alcohol. Or, I guess to be more specific, they are not serving any alcohol, but a subset of people were apparently told that the event would be BYOB and have their own personal alcohol for their groups (again, me and my boyfriend know absolutely no one). My boyfriend immediately said we'd given too much money for a wedding without an open bar and a plated dinner (they had a barbecue buffet).

We stuck around awkwardly for awhile and eventually all the bridesmaids arrived. They came over to chat and it was immediately apparent that they felt incredibly awkward that they were bridesmaids and I wasn't, they had all been there since the middle of the week to catch up and had established a bunch of inside jokes, and they were really just saying hi to be polite (after a very awkward few minutes of conversation, they left to continue circulating around the reception).

I told my boyfriend that I just wanted to go home, and we left as soon as we could without even touching the food and drove the 10 hours home that night. As we were leaving, he said I should cancel the check and save us both $100. At first I agreed because that's a lot of money for me right now, and I don't plan on having a relationship with any of those girls after this. But the bride did let us stay with her and was thoughtful enough to invite us, and after sleeping on it, I'm on the fence.

So we're leaving the decision up to you, reddit. WIBTA if I canceled the check?",841,4238,0.95
1854,Asshole,"I'm a sales manager at a tech company and we have 2 young sales reps at our company who got hired at the same time about 1 year ago. One's a guy and ones a girl, they are both like 22/23 and great at their jobs. Since its been one year at the company from them both and they both have excellent performance (the girl does edge him out every quarter though) we were looking to promote one of them into a closing sales role that would be a large bump in their compensation and life at work. I decided to promote the guy because he does have an amazing sales record in his year here (although the girl has slightly better numbers), he has more confidence, more business acumen and is a great presenter. When I told my wife about who I promoted and why she called me a huge asshole/douche/sexist for not promoting solely based on numbers but I think a lot of variables are at play and the guy was the stronger choice.

1855,Asshole,"I posted this over on /r/Christianity and got absolutely slaughtered over there. You can check it out. I'm not asking for validation or for people to take my side, I just want to see what neutrals think. I've basically been made out by them as though I'm a disgusting human being, an awful piece of shit and a terrible Christian. So I'll leave you to be the jury.

So I was in church this Sunday morning as usual. A family comes in late and sits a little way opposite me. During the section of the service where a passage from the Bible is read, the baby starts crying. Loudly. I can't hear what the reader is saying. I can see people turning their heads as they are obviously being disturbed and I'm finding it hugely distracting. The parents are making little effort to quieten their baby; they're actually seated directly infront of a children's area full of toys and books but they make no effort to use them. I go over and whisper, ""Sorry, but could you take him outside because it's inappropriate for when it's supposed to be silent."" It's important to note that this was the point in the service when we're supposed to quietly reflect on the reading. I go back to my seat. They talk amongst themselves for a bit, I can't make it out. Then they walk out and don't come back. I never meant for them to leave; all I wanted is for them to shut their baby up so that the congregation wasn't disturbed or distracted by the loud crying.",649,837,0.88
1856,Not the A-hole,A few weeks ago my parents went on a trip. I had to babysit my little brother. Now during this time my brother was complaining that he was lagging in his games. Now I have my own mobile wifi router that I use at university (I pay for it myself). I figured he could use it untill I go back to uni (I'm off till next year). My only rule was that he was not to mess with it as he's still young and if he broke it I would have no wifi at uni and I'd still have to pay for it as I'm in a contract. The past weekend he went to a friend and took my wifi with him since his friend doesn't have wifi. He didn't ask me (I would have said no tbh). And when I found out I told my parents that I would be taking my wifi back when he came back and that he wouldn't use it again. So I did take it back and now my mother is mad at me stating it's unfair for me to take it away. Now he's using my wifi that I pay for even though I don't want him to. Am I the asshole?,38,283,0.94

1858,Asshole,"For context, I (19F) live in a shared university dorm with six people. My nanna (61F) and grandad (56M) (the people who essentially raised me) came to visit me today for the first time since I've moved.

We had arranged earlier in the week that they would drive up to arrive for around 11:30am, I would come out to meet them, we'd put their stuff they got me away (they're very generous), and then go out for lunch.

I set an alarm the night before for 10:30 so I had a good hour to shower, get ready, clean my room, all that good shit. 

Alas, I get woken up at 10:18 with a phone call from my nan saying she's 10 minutes away in an hour's drive. I flip at her on the phone, tell her she can't pull this again (she always turns up early, but this is a pisstake), and I won't be ready when she gets here, so I can't let her in (I'll be naked from the shower, getting ready in my room and our shared kitchen is tiny, a mess, and has my flatmates in it currently). 

She says that as I have plans later in the day, they decided to come up early to spend more time with me. I argue with her saying that she could've given me some notice, and she ends the phone call saying ""the more time you spend arguing with me, the less time you have to get ready"", so I hang up on her (which I've never done before, we never argue).

This is where arsehole territory comes in. I make the conscious decision to not rush, and get ready at the pace I normally would. So I scroll on my phone for a bit, chilled out. I'm in the shower, I get a phone call, I ignore it. I'm brushing my teeth, another phone call, I ignore it. I'm getting dressed, another phone call, and they say they're outside, it's raining, and they want to come in. I say I'm naked, you gotta wait. I finally finish getting ready in about half an hour and let them in, where they said I was overreacting leaving them outside.

We had a great day and all, but they brought it up again and I said I still stand by it. One of my flatmates said I should've just let them in, but my boyfriend said it was fine (he's seen them turn up sometimes half an hour early and made both of us rush before, so he understands). And they were in the car, it's not like I left them out in the rain (except when my nan had a smoke).

So, I need to hear it, was I the arsehole for leaving them outside? Or was it justified?

EDIT: We do not have a living room or couch they could've sat on. Just our rooms, bathrooms, and a kitchen.

Also, thank you, I now understand the definition of elderly and shan't be abusing it again!

EDIT 2: They were inside by 11am, half an hour before our prearranged time.

EDIT 3: Again, they WERE NOT in the rain, it was raining but they were in the car.",130,94,0.87
1859,No A-holes here,"Prequel: My mom is mentally ill. Thats not her fault, not the worlds fault and definetly not mine. I noticed tho that she ( her whole behaviour, demeanor and insane beliefs) drags me down so I cut her off from my life like 4-5 years ago.  I was moving around trying to find a profession, or grade I could archieve. When I tried to study programming I moved in with a friend. Also, its well-known around my friend group that my mom is insane as I dont really feel like I should be ashamed about it.  My mom found out our adress  eventually and started to show up like once or twice a month for 15 mins to half an hour leaving behind a creepy altar and ""gifts"". These times have been very straining on me. I had to get a new number as well since my grandmother and mother harassed me on my old one constantly.

Where am I now? I moved to another city after failing to be a programmer, to start becoming a teacher. I moved into a cheap students dorm and currently am happy to start classes like tommorow. Yai me. Today I got a call from my old roommate tho sounding rather disgruntled ( understandably) because my mother showed up and woke him up while hes recovering from a cold and apperently took photos from his house. He told me to do something to which I replied I can't. I can't control her. I advised him to call the police. Not pleased with my answer he hung up on me to write me a message around 15 mins later telling me that she's my problem, not his and that I shouldnt try to make it his.

IM NOT trying to do that. I can't control my mother.

He further explained that if the police doesnt help he will give her my new adress which is a ""fair deal"" to him since its again not his problem.

While I'm annoyed and very angry that my mother is such a horrible person I was quite aggravated. It felt like he was giving me the blame for having a mentally ill mother and at the same time it looks to me like he's immediatly gonna sell me out with my sensitive information.

Well truth to be told. I am not that mad after a bit thinking because I don't want him to be harassed. So I told him: we could take his fair deal.I told him that it feels like to me he's blaming me for behaviours of my mother I can't control and that it aggravates me. I told him we take his deal and then I will cut off contact with him. While I don't want him to be harassed I don't think giving the crazy person the adress of your friend is the right way to handle this. I don't know how to handle this but calling the police. I've talk to multiple government institutions and the police before but its very hard to act on crazy people in my land. So yeah if he doesn't know any better he can sell me out to her but I want nothing to do with him anymore?

So guys wibta?

In my eyes there are no assholes here besides my mother but maybe the way I react is too harsh?

&#x200B;

Little Update: 

I called the police to ask what could be done. As expected ( I have been at this point before) its really hard to do soemthing against this so I have to provide a report tommorow which will get filed and sent to the repsective stations in the different cities. Then if she ever shows up again he has to call the police who will hopefully send her away and add it to her file so the case against her gets stronger.

This doesn't solve his problem at all tho so I told him he should just give her my adress and I'll deal with it. Don' think this friendship will stay tho and we prolly be just acquaintences from now on.",65,154,0.93
1860,Not the A-hole,"Hello. My grandmother is from Puerto Rico and was not all that present in my childhood and even my mother’s life. I have some problems with my grandmother. The first one being that she is homophobic and I am openly bisexual. She is the only person in my entire family who looks down on me for it. She is also incredibly rude and has no respect for the people around her. She had to move in with my family because of Hurricane Maria or something like that.

Okay. Let’s get started. So I had a boyfriend (we’ll call him Alex). So Alex and I were about a month into our relationship and I invited him to meet the family and right off the bat my grandmother needed to be rude and call him a girl (he has long hair which I really liked) and I just ignored it because I wanted Alex to be comfortable. So we are sitting on my couch watching a movie and he has his head on my shoulder. For reference, I have two sisters who had boyfriends who they would literally cuddle up all over under blankets and stuff and my grandmother never said a thing. 

My grandmother decides that it is a truly fine idea to come over and say “ugh that’s disgusting why are you doing that”. I didnt say anything and Alex immediately wanted to leave because he felt hurt and stuff. He ended up breaking up with me later that night. So i told my grandmother the next day and she had the fucking nerve to say “good maybe you’ll be able to be with a girl like you are supposed to”. So I ended up telling her that it is none of her business what I want to do in my OWN house and that just because she is my grandmother does NOT mean that I have to respect her if she doesn’t respect me. I also reminded her that my mother is doing her a favor by letting her stay in my already crowded house and she can choose to go to any other family’s house if she doesnt like what I do.

She started crying and told my mom and my mom was furious because I didnt “respect my elders”. I have no respect for a woman who disrespects me in my own house and I am not at all ashamed of it. Even though I do NOT go out of my way to disrespect my grandmother in any way, I basically don’t care for what she has to say about my lifestyle, or anything pertaining to that. So, am I the asshole for not respecting my grandmother even though she doesnt respect me?",45,151,0.93

1862,No A-holes here,"I’m in my thirties, male, I have 2 step sisters who have been in my life for 4 years but I like them and they are honestly like family to me. 

So my stepsisters live with my stepmom and my dad. They have a gorgeous home and it’s legit beautiful, they have a maid and a cook and in general they live well. Now my stepmom is a really cool lady but she is ANAL about the house being spotless and clean so she often bans my stepsisters from the kitchen because they are 16 and 17 and really really messy. No fault of their own because they were raised in a privileged way but they don’t *really* know how to clean up after themselves. They try real hard, I can’t lie, but they just are messy in the way kids are. They don’t do a thorough job. 

I live close by (same neighborhood) and lately they’ve been begging me if they can come and cook and bake at my place because they’ve discovered a new YouTuber and they are obsessed with him and want to recreate his recipes. They also want to start a YouTube channel so they want to use my kitchen a ALOT as it’s more open plan than my parents kitchen. 

My kitchen is fitted in a similar way to this youtubers apparently and I have a large space as well as appliances that belong to my girlfriend that the girls wish to use. I said no, because a) I don’t have the time to supervise them in my home? And b) I doubt they will clean up properly and unlike my parents I can’t afford a cleaner or maid. 

My step sisters are disappointed but not pissed or anything, but my grandparents think that I should be a good older brother and encourage them to learn a life skill and that Im not being a helpful family member.

My stepmom joked that if I let them into my kitchen she’s not responsible for the hell they cause and said ‘good luck!’ If I say yes but at the same time I feel maybe I should just let them practice their cooking and baking because they’re both obsessed with doing this.",68,296,0.95

1864,Not the A-hole,"My fiance and I have been dealing with a conflict with my parents for just over a year now. 


My fiance is on the Autism Spectrum, so sometimes has difficulty with social etiquette, relationships, body language etc. 

My family has been aware of this for years, even before we started dating. 

They take a lot of issue with him, even back when we were in high school. Him and my dad argued about the name of a restaurant and my dad called him an arrogant asshole for insisting he was wrong. 

More recently, an incident occurs where my fiance tries to have a discussion with my parents about a book that his mom (who is a parenting author) just released. My dad felt offended by this and thought that my fiance meant they were no good at parenting. He went on to yell at the both of us, swearing and calling my fiance names including ""retard"" (which he took offense to given his diagnosis. My father knows this)

They both sort of didn't address it again but we asked for an apology. We did not receive it. Rather, we got several texts that were aggressive in nature from my dad, and guilt-trippy messages from my mom to just move on from it. 

A few weeks ago, my sister made a post on social media holding her friend's baby. My fiance commented jokingly ""Is it yours"". Now, I know it was a joke and sometimes he doesn't understand that jokes can have ""wrong"" audiences and jokes can be badly timed. My parents didn't give him that grace and sent us messages about how his behaviour seems to be reckless and potentially dangerous and the comment was shameful. My mom's message said they did not give their blessing for my engagement. My father's text said the same thing but also included ""Are you really trying to tell me that boy/man with all his mental deficiencies is really good for your life??? That's a tough sell my dear."" 

I chose not to respond because I felt like it was aggressive.

Today I sent a message to my mother to convey my thoughts and make some things clear to her. In it I said that if they didn't give their blessing, they shouldn't expect an invitation to our wedding. 

In some ways I feel unsure about this. My sister recently told me that I'm being disrespectful to them and I should be grateful that they gave me a great life.

I know the whole saying ""family is family"" but I can't help but wonder, where's the line? When is it ok to say NO, you won't put up with it anymore?

Now we were away maybe 10 minutes but the little pup (5month old) kept shouting. Separation anxiety. Pretty irritating but he's a pup and has to get trained. As we got back I told my mom to ignore him. Not even a word or a glimpse at the dog, just get home and inside, a 20min time-out. It always works. As soon as the pup saw me he barked a quick but loud one and my mother started shouting even though the dog was quiet by then. I snapped and while not raising my voice I told her to get inside because she just messed up the whole ignoring process. Dog -of course- went on a barking session after that.

I got some treats and started training him, one stair at a time, slowly making progress. I told my brother and mother the dog WILL bark now so just ignore him (as they do normally by the way) so they weren't in for a surprise. Regardless, my mother came out a few minutes later right when the dog realized I am ignoring him when he shouts. 12 steps of stairs, I had 2 left, it was great progress, never got so far away from the dog without him shouting and mother ruined it again. She came out to shout at my dog to keep quiet while he was quiet. I told her to get back inside or stay quiet while I train the pup to which she got pissed and went on a tirade of how big of an arse I am for telling her what to or not to do.

So, a little back story for some context. I am 21 F and I mainly have guy friends because the field in which I work in is very male heavy. I have made it clear to all my guy friends that I don’t date and that I want to be single. Mainly because they have asked if I was dating anyone. 
So , I have this friend and coworker  (25m) who last month told me that he liked me and wanted to date over text.  I told him kindly that I didn’t feel the same and that I just wanted to be friends. I thought that was the end of it and it was done with. 


Unfortunately , it wasn’t that easy.  Last night after we went out with a group of friends, he again texted me about liking me and then said if I didn’t want to be his girlfriend he didn’t want to hang out anymore. It was late and I decided to wait to reply. However, today I forgot to reply because I was quite busy and just haven’t replied. He has texted me a few more times about how he is in a bad space mentally and I’m the only one who makes him happy.But, I still haven’t replied and I don’t want to. 



He made me feel uncomfortable and almost guilty for not reciprocating his feelings.  Also, we work together and I just feel like I turned him down once before and have also told him that I don’t date. 


However, when I talked to my sister about this she made me feel like I was an asshole for not replying to him because it probably took a lot of courage for him to tell me. I just don’t feel like I should and I’m also just super uncomfortable with the entire situation because  we are coworkers, I have already expressed that I don’t like him , and I have explicitly told him that  I am not looking to date anyone.

So, AITA if I don’t reply to him?


Update/info:

Thank you for all the advice/warnings. Looking at it from an outsider point of view showed me how toxic this whole situation is. He messaged me again telling me he is attached to me and can’t get over me. I decided to tell him in person  when I go in on Tuesday and to completely cut all nonprofessional ties with him. I am moving departments in about 2 months so I am hoping that I can get through the next couple of months without an more incidents like this. As for the info, I saw a couple people say I crossed the line from becoming friends with him outside of work first. I moved to a different country  for this job, so I don’t have many friends who don’t work with me. Also, the only other female is over twice my age and married with kids. So, almost every single friend of mine is from work and are male and I’ve never had this issue before.

Well yes, however because it was my first 'Big Surgery' my Mum insisted on coming with me even though I told her I'd rather my sister came. Alright whatever I can deal with that, Mum is also good at keeping me calm and preventing my panic attacks too. 

So we flew down and it was finally the big day. After sitting in the waiting room for hours a nurse came, Mum promised me she'd be right by my side when I woke up so I let the nurse take me to the pre-op area where they stuck countless needles into me. Now I feel like I need to mention that needles are my biggest fear so this was a nightmare, still I told the nurses to ignore my carrying on and do what they needed to do. 

Alright, everything is going great, I get wheeled into the operating room and speak with my doctor for a few minutes before they put me to sleep. Everything was going great until I woke up. 

I woke up alone in a darkroom, no lights and no noises, that's what I was greeted with. I tried to move but I was still under the effects of the anesthetic, I tired to speak but not a sound came out. I couldn't even feel my left arm anymore. The nurses were alerted to my panic when my heart monitor spiked and rushed in. They calmed me down, explained everything like the simply fact that I wouldn't be able to move my arm for a least a week due to local anesthetic they injected into my neck in the pre-op and I was feeling decent, still drowsy and incredibly sick but better. 

Maybe half an hour later I get a call which I answer without looking at the caller ID. I cried out Mum hoping it would be her but it wasn't, instead it was my out of breath brother who had called. He called me to explain that Mum had missed her train and wasn't going to make it for at least another hour and he was rushing to get to my side.

Here's the thing, we were staying at my Brother's apartment which was less than a 10 minute walk from the hospital, the reason Mum missed her train while I was going through my big ordeal was because she was getting marijuana from someone who lived far away. 

Fucking drugs were more important then me. 

So folks, am I the asshole for being hostile towards her after this, for not just forgiving her simple apology when she gave it?

1874,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because my mother has a record of finding my social mediaspl
So here's the deal: I'm trans and still live at home, and will probably be living at home for another couple of years minimum. 
My mother, while she is aware that I'm trans, absolutely refuses to use the correct pronouns or my name, and she's spent the past few weeks doing extreme mental gymnastics in order to try and explain to me why I'm wrong and she shouldn't have to use the name and pronouns I ask her to use.
For the record, this is not about transitioning. I haven't asked her to support me through transitioning, or to help me get HRT or surgery or anything of the sort. All I've asked is for her to call me by the right name and pronouns.
It's been a couple of weeks since i first asked her (i was out to her already, but i hadn't been making an issue of it) and I'm getting a little sick of trying to explain my position and nicely ask her to respect me, so I'm considering just saying 'that's great but that isn't my name and I won't be answering to it anymore' and refusing to speak to her unless she'll respect me.
Something to consider: my younger brother still lives at home and it would probably be difficult for him if I just straight up stopped talking to my mother.
Typing this out I'm starting to suspect that I might be TA here, but I want to hear what you guys think, so posting anyway.

1875,Asshole,"A few days back I (30 F) was alerted to a news article about a former classmate of mine (I'll call her Mandy for this) being sentenced to prison. I won't go into much detail but she worked in the financial sector and went down for ''white collar crime'' along with a few others. She was sentenced to four years. 

When I looked at the article and saw her police mugshot I couldn't stop laughing. Maybe that makes me a bad person but this girl was never nice to me when we were growing up. At one point she spread rumour that my dad (who is DEAD and everyone knew it) was actually in prison (and that was nowhere near the worst thing she did), so to me this was beautiful. 

I put a picture of the article and her mugshot on my instagram story and said that I bet she wouldn't be as pretty as she was by the time she came out. Keep in mind that I have no connection on any socials to anyone who was friends with Mandy. However, a lot of my own friends have messaged me saying I was harsh to put that up and that I should take it down. They've pointed out that her parents, friends and family must be very upset and scared for her at the moment and that what I posted was insensitive. 

I spoke to my husband about it and he agreed it was in bad taste. I did delete it in the end. 

You people probably think I'm jealous and petty, but I'm not. I have a lovely husband, a job I love (nurse) and a beautiful little boy called Lewis. I think I'm a good person, but I don't know if laughing at the thought of Mandy sobbing in her prison cell makes me a bad one?",154,292,0.87

It’s my brother’s birthday in few days. I planned to go and visit him. My wife knew about this weeks in advance, but of course now suddenly my wife’s mom is sick(nothing serious) and she wants to visit her. We don’t want to leave our son alone for 4 days. My wife said that since my brother lives closer I could just visit him and come back the next day.  

We got in pretty big argument, she said that she needed a break, we were both raising our voices, I said that I’m tired and I need a break too. We stopped arguing pretty soon but she still wouldn’t talk to me. When we were having dinner our son randomly said that he could stay alone and he’d be fine, so he heard us. 

It has been few days since that conversation and our son has been acting distant, he doesn’t leave his room as much, rarely talks to us. I tried to talk to him but he says that he’s tired and doesn’t want to talk.

1882,Not the A-hole,"Edit: they aren't step sisters. I meant to write bio daughter from step daughter.

So, I have been married for 2 years to a great guy who has joint custody of 3 great kids (step daughter SD12, 13 next week, stepsons 10 and 8). They are with us every monday and Thursday (sleeping over and go to school in the morning), and every other weekend).

I gave birth two and a half months ago to a little girl. My SD who had been loudly saying she wouldn't do anything to help once the baby came, instantly fell in love with her and plays with her all the time. I let her pick out her clothes, and basically anything I can to help her feel involved. 

One of my neighbors offered to take the baby on thursday afternoon a few weeks ago for a couple of hours, so I could get some things done. I jumped at the chance for free babysitting. When my SD got home from school she was like where is my sister! I explained that the neighbor, who she knows, took her and she'll be back in a couple of hours. 

Something to note is SD has ballet on Thursday afternoons, so is basically home an hour or so, before she goes to her activity.

This past week the neighbor took the baby again, her family really loves having her over. My SD was pissed at me that the baby 'is never there anymore on Thursdays'. I was like this is the second time! 

So I asked my husband if I'm TA if I keep sending the baby on Thursdays or if I should ask my neighbor if there is a different day she can take the baby. My point of view is that SD is only home for an hour, so she's not missing that much time with her sister, and Thursdays are a very busy day in our family so it's nice to have a few hours where I can go to the gym and get things done without worrying about the baby. My husband thinks I'm TA because SD is only there 2 days a week, but he tends to take the kids' side and SD is sometimes very entitled. I have a good relationship with my SD, and don't want to be TA.",52,79,0.89
1883,Not the A-hole,"My wife dated this guy James in 2014, and then they broke up. They were friends before, and sort of friends after. He lives pretty close by, and we see him pretty often. I am not gonna lie, I feel some sorts of jealousy towards this guy, he is kind of absurdly handsome and fit and a very popular guy. But I see him a lot around the neighborhood, and we sort of get along, but I always felt like he was a bit of a 'bad boy' if that makes sense. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, we were gonna throw a party at our house. My wife was listing people she wanted to invite, and she mentioned James, and I sort of just told her right away, no. I sort of felt like a dick, but this guy, who she dated, was the exact type of guy to flirt with another guys wife. I 100% know my wife would reject him, but even if she did, I know this guy is VERY good looking, and it kind of pains me to think that she might even possibly 'think' of the idea of sleeping with him. Like even if she doesn't, she will absolutely think about it. Shit, I would too in her situation. 

&#x200B;

But I also feel bad, because they have such a history together even besides them dating for those few months. They were close friends in high school, they were basically best friends for a few years, they've had some shared drama with their families (who are friends with each other), even if they've obviously grown apart, and she even said that she never slept with him once in the 2 years in between us dating and them breaking up, and they were good friends in those 2 years. And I believe her, because she is generally extremely honest about her sexual past and this is not the type of thing she would lie about at all (mostly because she has told me about a bunch of times shes slept with friends in the past, James wouldn't be any different). But again, she has told me that he has always been friendly-flirty with her, even the years before they dated. 

&#x200B;

It just makes me incredibly uncomfortable, the idea of this insanely hot guy flirting with her. Even if there is a 90% chance he doesn't (and frankly, I doubt he would, but he might possibly), that 10% chance just makes me super uncomfortable. But she works in an industry where hot guys flirt with her constantly, and she always rejects them. I have no worries of her actually 'responding' to his flirts. Its just that... well let me put it this way, if a hot girl was to flirt with me, I would probably 'think' about her. I wouldn't act on it, but I would think about the idea of it. And the idea of her doing that with James, a guy who just completely outdoes me in the looks department, makes me uncomfortable. Us, all being drunk together at a party, the whole concept makes me feel kinda weird.

I told my wife the reasons why, and she said it was ridiculous, and got a bit mad at me, then went to bed. At one point she called me an asshole. But am I the asshole?",50,44,0.92
1884,Not the A-hole,"My sister Catherine is two years older than me. She's 26 and was with her ex-fiance since she was 16. They finally broke up a few weeks back and she's absolutely gutted. She's taken time off work and spends most of her time crying on the sofa. 

I'll be honest... Catherine and I are... not close. She was always ''the pretty one'' when we were younger and everyone knew it, and she did her best to rub it in my face. She used to tell me that I would always be single that I would die alone. My parents constantly favoured her, like in the example I gave above, if I said the same thing back to her, my parents would interject that a pretty girl like her could never be alone. Things got worse when we got older, because according to them she made all the ''right'' choices. She got great grades got into a super selective place, and did well there and has a great career in finance in the heart of the city. I did OK in school but left at the first opportunity and chose to pursue a more physical job. I don't regret it at all but my parents being the snobs they are deeply disapprove of it and think I'm still going through a ''phase''. 

I have a lovely boyfriend called Howard and he's the nicest, friendliest man you will ever meet. In the past Catherine has accused him of being an actor because ''noone would want to go out with you''.

I was at home making some food yesterday when I brought some for Catherine. She was crying again and I gave her a hug and told her not to waste her tears on that scumbag. In response she lashed out at me and told me that I have no idea what it feels because ''what do you know about relationships''. I saw red and asked her how it feels when I have a BF and she's at home crying about being single. At this point she started full on WAILING. My parents ran in and she told them what I'd said. 

I was ordered out of the house and didn't come back until the evening. My parents were very angry at me and I got a lecture about tormenting my sister while she's hurt and vulnerable. 

I get that she's hurting but she chose to make fun of me and insult my relationship just like she's always done, so I did the same. I don't see why I'm the bad guy.",408,4700,0.96

Fast forward to high school, I had found a solid group of friends and we would often party at each other’s houses. It was never anything too hard, maybe a few beers, but never anything much more. My mom has always been super chill, so our get togethers were often held at my place.

Eventually, word got around that we had a spacious backyard and it became the hot spot for high school partying. People beyond my general friend group were showing up to our parties. It was at this point that my mother met ‘Adam’. Adam was always a year ahead of me in high school (he graduated in ‘15, I graduated in ‘16). I had spoken to him before on few occasions but only considered him a mutual acquaintance.

One night, he and my mom got into a deep conversation and they apparently exchanged phone numbers. He moved away after he graduated to attend university, but they continued to secretly text one another. One night, my mother confessed all of this to me and told me that Adam was planning to move back after his freshmen year of college so that he could be closer to her. He would transfer to a closer university and finish his degree there. 

A few months later, I graduated and moved out of state to attend university myself. Adam indeed moved back to be closer to my mother and they announced they were officially dating. I was just ready to get the hell away from home at this point and not have to deal with what I figured was going to be a ‘fuck buddy’ ordeal. 

Angry at my mother, I decided to stop talking to her once I moved away. I would ignore her phone calls and simply respond with a short text to assure her everything was good. Eventually, she stopped calling and the only time we would connect was through the occasional text message.

Two years later, Adam proposed to my mother. I keep in often touch with my younger siblings. They are now 18, 16, & 13 and keep me somewhat updated on their lives and our mothers relationship. They were all very disturbed by the relationship initially, but they’ve all seemed to have been brainwashed to jump on board with it. My sisters claim he’s a good guy who truly loves our mom. My brother is a bit more doubtful but he still seems to be generally accepting of it. I’ve tried telling them that it’s not a healthy relationship but they always brush me off, telling me they don’t want to anger or upset our mom. 

Long story short, they got married last month. My 46 year old mother is now the wife on my 22 year old former high school classmate. I did not attend the wedding and I have not spoken to her since September of 2016.",445,1907,0.96

So recently coming home after school I've been noticing that my room's cleaned and some stuff has been moved/organized the way I don't usually have it. My dad told me in a matter-of-fact way that his girlfriend was cleaning up, so she probably tidied up my room in the process.

I'm not sure how to feel about that, not that I'm hiding bodies in there but just the fact that she's been going into my room while I'm not at home seems weird.

After she got out of the divorce, she basically became a teenage party girl again and had my brother and I really worried. Constantly going out partying and drinking and sometimes not coming home.

I've play fought (grabbing her snout shaking it and her trying to bite my hand I stop and she stops once i start petting her) with her before and I know what she sounds like when she's playing. My niece is 3 years old and she's speaking more and more and honestly she's a spoiled child mostly because she's our only niece (I'm her only uncle and I have 2 more sisters and add our parents) so yes spoiled. They're both around the same height.

Just yesterday my grandma who is here visiting us has been babysitting my niece while my sister is at work and this is the dog and my niece's first time meeting and naturally my niece plays with her and they're running around I let them have fun while I'm on my phone nothing new, then i hear the dog growl big difference between the sounds she does when we're play fighting I let it slip and I go to eat and as I'm putting a spoonful of rice and beans I hear the dog yelp and growl and see my niece kick the dog right in the face and I yelled at her for it. I kept in my room with the dog after to get her away from my niece about an hour or two go by i go back out to try to lighten things up by teaching her how to pet the dog and i ask her if she can apologize because it wasn't cool which she said no and ignored me I got more upset and kept the dog away from my from her for the rest of the day.

Today at dinner i put the dog in the restroom so we can eat in peace and so she's not giving us puppy eyes cause she already ate. We finish up, the food is still out and the dog is still in the restroom. My mom has my niece on top of the counter and she's giving her bits of the turkey leg to eat and she farts really loudly and we laugh and i tell her to apologize because at least she can have a learning moment on manners at the very least and she doesn't do it but it's cool maybe next time. My sister arrives to pick her up i let my niece chase the dog for a bit. Once she was saying no to my sister on putting her shoes on i tell her to put them on or I'll put the dog up and same goes for when she was asked to put her sweater on this time she throws the sweater at my sister and i tell her to apologize because she's out of hand again and she doesn't do it. I tell her no to petting the dog before she leaves and she starts crying. 

My sister told me before they left that i was being too harsh. It's frustrating to see that no one else backs me up when i ask for her to apologize she kicked the damn dog which is absolutley no ones in the family, the fart was funny it will happen again and her throwing the sweater at my sister is on my sister herself on how she lets her do whatever.",33,72,0.88

A friend of mine left (let's call him Al) enlisted in the military in the summer of 2018, and has a contract that will last 4 years.  Al had a dog he had a dog that he had owned for 1.5 years that he left with his parents upon shipping out. However, about 5-6 months in (around Holiday season 2018 now), his parents decided that they weren't able to care for their dogs anymore, and needed to re-home all of them, Al's dog included. I volunteered to adopt Al's dog, and ended up taking the boy home before Christmas 2018. His family gave me the supplies that they had (crate, leash, some leftover dog food, etc.) and sent me on my way. Ever since, I caring for the dog entirely on my own, from vet bills to food and anything else that he may need.

However, the problem is that he said he wanted his dog back when he got back from his time in the military, and I agreed. Since then, I have found it increasingly difficult to imagine separating from this dog and returning it to Al, because after 10 or so months I am so incredibly attached to the dog, and he and I have formed a very strong bond/relationship. I know that I won't be able to turn over the dog after living with him for 3 and a half years. I know I agreed to returning the dog if Al wanted him back upon returning, but I don't know how he expects me to own and raise this dog for over double the time he owned him and then be able to return it to him. I'm incredibly torn on this issue, and I don't know what to do, Reddit.

About 4 months ago Bf and Andy had their apartment lease run out, the landlord raised the rent by $50/month for them to stay without a new lease. I have no insight as to why BF didn’t try to renew the lease before it was up, since they both seemed to like the apartment and it was located in a good place for them. 
BF started complaining to me about how his mom’s house was too far from his work for them to move back in with her so I said they could stay with me for a few weeks just until they found a new apartment/place to stay. (I am not asking for any rent or bills just that they pay for Andy’s special foods) 

My house is small: 2 bedroom 2bath. The second Bedroom is my office since I work from home 3+ days a week, I need a clean organized space to do my work, and I get Skype calls from the office on my at home days, so I also need it to be quiet. 

Andy is staying in my office on a futon, he only works on the weekends: days that BF can drive him to work, and the rest of the week he spends most of the day playing Xbox or on his DS. 
The main problem is that Andy doesn’t seem to understand that he can’t be in the office while I’m working.

(Example: he’ll ask me to make him chicken nuggets when he is fully capable of microwaving a plate of nuggets himself.) 

I have had to apologize to my colleagues multiple times, and even though they are trying to be Patient, I can tell they are getting frustrated that I have to leave/mute/pause a call for a few minutes at least 1-2 times on my work at home days.  

I spoke to my boyfriend a couple days ago and said that he has to find a new place within a month. I said it’s not fair to Andy that he doesn’t have his own room to go to, Or a real bed to sleep in. BF argued that Andy likes it here and would do him more harm than good to make him move out now. 
I said that it should have never gotten to this point: I offered to let them stay a couple of weeks, a month at most, and now it’s been almost 6! That Andy is regressing; he suddenly can’t do things for himself that he’s been able to do for years.  I told BF that he’s just being lazy and he needs to find them somewhere else to live ASAP, I’m worried about making sure I keep my job, but I’m also worried that this situation is really bad for Andy.

1896,Not the A-hole,"AITA because I want to us (boyfriend, son, and I) to move away from my parents? We currently live in Texas and want to move to Colorado. We don't have a huge support system. He doesn't have reliable family members, and all I have are my parents. Ever since I was a child, I dreamt about living in a woodsy area where I can take my family hiking frequently. When I think of my future, I never see myself living where I am now. It isn't a location that encourages me to spend time outside. It's extremely hot, humid, and there isn't much to do besides shop. We've been living with them since June, and my son grew very accustomed to them. He loves them very much and gets excited when he sees they've arrived home. If we moved, we'd be moving to a place where we don't know anyone, and we'd start completely over. My son is 13 months old, so it isn't like he's started school or anything. We wouldn't be moving for about another year, but during that time, I can only imagine how much closer my son would grow to them. My mom LOVES to make me feel guilty about this and says I should give up my dreams to accommodate and allow my son to grow up with a larger support system.

TL;DR it's been my lifelong dream to move to a woodsy area. My boyfriend, son (13 months), and I want to move states away from my parents (our only support system). My mom says I should give up my dream because it's healthy for my son to grow up around his grandparents. WIBTA if I moved?",29,29,0.91
1897,Not the A-hole,"I (f17) have never been incredibly religious. I was raised with the idea that my religion is my own thing to figure out as I grew older. I was always given an option to go to Christian church, but never forced. This being said, I very rarely attended any church.

Well, after my mother's narcissistic husband and she divorced, she became incredibly involved in the church. Still, it was always a choice for my sisters and I. 

Until recently. About 2 months ago she forced us to all attend church 3 times a week, and gets incredibly angry if we show the slightest unenthusiasm for having to go. She expects us to love it as much as she does. If we express any disinterest, we are punished.

Personally, idk where I stand with religious beliefs. I don't know if I believe in all this God and Jesus stuff.

Now, my mom decided that I am going on a Mission Trip to Japan. Not at all my choice, and the trip goes over my 18th birthday, she MADE SURE to choose one that would start while I was still 17, so that as a minor, i can't fight going.

I really don't want to go. I'm not passionate about Christianity and I have no time to do all of the devotionals and bible studies that are required for the trip, and I KNOW I'm not going to be able to passionately teach people from another country about a religion I'm still not thoroughly convinced about myself. It won't be fair to the group I'm with or the people I'm supposed to help ""save through Christianity"" because I don't even know if i believe in it or not! There are limited spots on this trip, and I believe my spot should go to someone who actively wants to teach others about Christianity, not me, who hardly knows anything about it and doesn't even trust it.

My mother thinks I'm being a total piece of shit for being at odds with my religious beliefs, and she thinks I'm acting entitled and immature for not wanting to go. I've never been involved in church until two months ago and I know myself enough to know that this is not a good idea for me. AITA??",194,389,0.95
1898,Not the A-hole,"So I've (29F) lived in this apartment for the best part of a decade now. I don't own it but I've been saving up because I'm on good terms with my landlord who has agreed to sell it to me for a good price in the next few years since he's starting to get a little bit too old to deal with upkeep.

During this time I've had roommates rotating in and out to help afford rent. The latest roommates are a couple, Dan (24M) and Jess (25F).

A few months ago they announced that Jess was pregnant and due in a couple of months!!! I was really surprised because, I feel mean saying this, she wasn't showing very visibly through her body shape. I congratulated them but when I asked what their plans were for their future family home they said they were hoping that I would move out. I said that goes against my plans that I've had for years and that I was planning on staying here. They insisted that I would ""have"" to move out as they're a new family now and need space. I told them that was great and I respect that need but if they wanted space they would need to find a new place as I was here first.

Shit got pretty cold from there. We haven't really talked much, until now. They had the baby and it's now about a month old. I knew I'd have to bunker down a bit so I took all of my things from the common area (TV, consoles, kitchenware, etc) and with some work I got a pretty nice compact setup in my room with some DIY soundproofing and a makeshift kitchenette so I can ignore the baby's crying. They used my stuff previously and were not happy at all and had to beg on facebook until someone got them new dishes, making sure to shit talk me in all the posts which I thought was pretty rude but whatever.

Because I found out so late about the pregnancy, we're still on the lease for a good 6 months. They want me to break the lease so they can focus on their family. I told them that as I said before this wasn't going to happen. Either they break the lease or they put up with me living my life the way I want to, which includes having people over, listening to music, smoking weed (legal state), drinking, etc. They said they can't afford to break the lease. I said that's unfortunate but neither can I. They said it would be easier for me because I'm not a parent and that I would just need to scrimp a little bit so I can afford to pay two rents. I said maybe but I'm not going to hamstring my lifestyle because they chose to inconvenience everyone around them with their kid. I was admittedly kind of the AH for saying this but I was being harassed.

So my living situation has been kind of a cold war ever since. It's really miserable for everyone right now and while I don't expect them to drop out of the lease I'm kind of hoping they do because them and their banshee kid are really giving me a headache. But I've invested too much into getting this place to leave so even if they stick it out I plan on signing the lease again and maybe seeing if the landlord will be able to not renew them.",1700,11585,0.95

1901,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I got married recently, and thanks to our backgrounds in event management and the restaurant industry we were able to pull off a really nice wedding despite very limited financial resources. Rather than putting money towards our attire, honeymoon (which we plan on taking in a few years), or other personal luxuries, we spent all of our budget on catering, creating a high end looking/feeling event, and an very well stocked open bar - we made a huge effort to make the wedding as nice for our guests as possible, I don’t think anyone felt like they were attending a budget wedding. We both quit our jobs several years ago to go back to university - money is tight, but we budget well and are happy living frugal lives. 

SIL and her husband both graduated several years ago and have been working well paying jobs since, they were able to live and eat with their respective parents (not possible for us) and had no student loans upon graduating. They closed on their second home early in the summer and are doing this “live frugal and retire early” thing, while earning praise form extended family for being so un-millenial-like. According to MIL (whom my husband politely approached to see if the gift/card perhaps got lost or stolen), getting a house and saving for their future left them with no budget whatsoever for a wedding gift. According to her we should be happy they came at all (??? They didn’t have to travel or stay in a hotel or anything). 

At the risk of sounding really entitled, I’m hurt they didn’t get us anything. I honest to god would’ve been happy with a card and well wishes. There were items in the 5$-10$ range on our registry. Instead they brought their own beer (?????), ate the catering, enjoyed their evening, and left without even congratulating us. When they got married I wasn’t yet in the picture, but my husband (who had just quit his job and was about to go back to university, so he wasn’t in a fantastic financial position either) gifted them a 400$ tablet. Again, I’m not asking for anything even remotely in that range, I would’ve been happy with a card or something very inexpensive. It’s far more about the gesture than any monetary value.

I don’t plan on being petty over this (they’re getting a thank you note and Christmas gifts etc), but I don’t see myself making any effort to build a relationship with them as I quite frankly feel a bit resentful and unappreciated/unloved/unwelcome to the family/etc. Am I an entitled asshole for feeling this way?",39,51,0.89

1903,Not the A-hole,"A little background. I hired into a company and went up the ladder, then got busted down to the bottom because I wouldn't play politics. With that being said, the company has kept me around as a worker bee through a lean time, and after massive layoffs.

I was talking with a few friends at the company who have moved up in another department. They work whatever hours they are asked and even do projects at home. They asked me if I would be willing to work from home, on my own time, if they could get me in their department. I said no.

They asked why, and I told them I already did that, and I got knocked back to a worker. Over the course of the conversation, one of them said ""You don't care if the company grows or not, do you?""

Me: No. I'm just going to do my best to do them a good job. I don't want to know all the procedures and policies, just what pertains to my specific tasks. I won't work over unless it's on my project, and I won't offer any of my other services unless it pertains to my project ( I have special certifications no one else at the company has ).

One of my coworkers told me IATA because I don't care if the company loses a million or makes a million. He said IATA because I have other options for employment and he doesn't.

I explained to him that I do care about what happens to him, but when I got knocked back there really isn't any reason for me to care what happens to the company. All I have to worry about I what I am tasked with. He still got mad.

He knows I have other irons in the fire. I'm taking specialized training courses on my own dime, and I have the experience to get a better job in our industry, which is booming. I also have resumes out.

So, I guess the question is two fold. AITA because I don't care what the company does, unless it directly pertains to my project, and because I don't care that my friends have their futures and careers staked to this company?",20,36,0.92

1906,Not the A-hole,"Hi all. I've been talking to a guy we'll call Jack for about 3 months now. Up to this point it's been going well, we're both students attending the same college and with our studies we've been keeping things casual. He's very popular, well-liked by most people and has always been very respectful and easy going.

Relevant to the story is that it's pretty common knowledge a girl from our college went missing a few months back, and since then numerous others have reported things I can't repeat here happening to them without it being removed (but think an unfortunately common thing that happens to a lot of women), or being followed around campus. No one knows if it's all related or not. The police are aware, it's an ongoing local story, no one has been identified.

Two days ago Jack invited me to his apartment just off campus to binge some horror movies for October. The night was going well, until we decided to watch ""Black Christmas"". For those of you unaware, it involves a killer stalking sorority sisters. This led to us discussing the events I previously mentioned and playing detective, trying to figure things out and relating stories we've both heard through the grapevine. 

Jack started making multiple suggestions regarding how and why this girl went missing, how it was related to the events near campus and why these girls were singled out. I got a bit freaked out talking about it and wanted to go back to the movie, but Jack kept pushing it saying stuff like ""think about how scary that would be, walking past the library at night and seeing someone under the light"" and just really getting specific. I told him to stop and he held my hands and apologized then said ""but what would you do if you were alone in an apartment with him right now?"" and stared at me blankly, then cracked a really quick smile before going back to staring.

I felt extremely uncomfortable in the moment even though I knew he was only messing with me because of the movies. I stood up and told him I'd think about it while I grabbed beer, walked towards the kitchen and turned towards his front door and left. He opened the door behind me when I was heading down the building stairs and started apologizing and asking me to come back but I went back to the dorm and talked to a few friends about it.

Jack has been calling and texting apologizing and saying he was just teasing but I haven't been answering and now a few people know and are almost unanimously saying I'm an asshole, I'm making a big deal out of nothing, that it was a Halloween movie night and he was trying to creep me out. And the worst part is I know all that. He's a great guy and no one has a bad story about him, I like him. I don't know why I just feel like I shouldn't be replying to him right now. I don't know if I'm still embarrassed or still spooked.

Am I an asshole for ditching him over something so dumb and not answering? Or is it ok to just give myself a bit of time?",493,1176,0.96

So now I’m graduating high school and my dad casually commented on how he already bought all invitations from my graduation, and when he said he bought for his girlfriend too I was (of course) really angry and said that I don’t want her there, are the end he said that I was being really rude for making him unninvite her and that I should apologize later for “not being able to endure her presence”

My cousin often drops his two sons (5M and 9M) off at my house and leave them there until 9 at night. I understand that the restaurant can be busy, but my cousin usually goes home early and take 3 hour naps before he is willing to take his kids home. On Sundays, he leaves his kids at my house and goes off to the shooting range with his friends.

The two boys are really sensitive. One time, I was wiping the younger one’s hand and he bursted into tears because he said I was hurting him even though I used no pressure. The older one is really hyper and goes into random fits of laughter/rage. He often hogs the tv, which results in the younger one throwing tantrums. They fight often and the younger one has gotten into a habit of sitting on his older brother while jumping up and down.

1916,Asshole,"Okay, okay. I get it, the title, while concise, immediately makes me TA. But hear me out for just a second. I’m using a throwaway for obvious reasons. 

My wife and I have been together for 4 years. I have been a vegetarian for nearly ten years, but prior to that, loved eating meat dearly. My wife enjoys eating meat but has reduced how much she eats by us living together for 3 years and having a relatively small grocery budget, we generally don’t buy things we can’t both eat. She will typically order a burger or buffalo chicken while we are out or ordering delivery, and I have even bought her salami for sandwiches and Italian sausages when she’s had a craving for them. My point being, I have no problem with her eating meat and bringing it into our home. My choices are my choices and hers are hers. 

We live in the northeast and it’s been cold and rainy all week, the first long stretch of time this season that it’s really been cold. Because of this, she’s been talking about wanting to cook her favorite cold weather food, Ina Garten’s bolognese recipe. Bolognese, for those who don’t know, is a thick Italian meat sauce. It’s something she used to love when her mom made it for her, and she has not made it much since because it can be expensive to make and is labor intensive. 

I’m going grocery shopping today, so she gave me the list of ingredients she needs to make the sauce. Typically, if she’s making something with meat, she will make a separate batch of the same food, just vegetarian friendly, or make me a separate meal. I can’t really cook much, so when she doesn’t cook for me I will gravitate toward frozen or canned food, or sandwiches. 

This time, she asked if it was okay that she didn’t make a vegetarian version of this dish, as she’s feeling unwell (she has endometriosis and is having a flare up) and overall this particular dish requires a lot of work, care, and timing, and to make two batches of it would be hours of work and energy that she doesn’t have, not to mention expensive. I asked her if it was possible to just leave the meat out until the end, but according to her it was not, and it was important for the meat to cook with the tomatoes and wine. I asked her then what she was going to make for me if she was going to make this big elaborate meal for herself, and she got defensive and said “you can’t cook for yourself tonight?” in a rude tone. I argued calmly that I felt like I was being cheated out of a nice meal of her incredible cooking, and I didn’t think it was cool for her to ask me to dedicate this money of our budget to a meal that was going to only be for her. She said she would pay extra for the ingredients, but I told her that wasn’t the point. 

She burst into tears and asked why I was being so fucking difficult about this, when she wasn’t feeling well and just wanted to do something that made her happy. Now I feel like a dick. So, Reddit, aita?

1918,Not the A-hole,"I'm (18) lactose intolerant - found out about 3 years ago. I went vegan just this year but I'd been making vegan desserts/dishes for a while then because it helped make it a bit easier for me to avoid dairy. 

My mother was hosting (Canadian) thanksgiving this year. She asked me to make a couple side dishes and dessert - no one else in my family really likes to/can bake, and they like my vegan desserts just fine. I made the same dessert I'd made last year that we all liked - a vegan pumpkin pie. I made it really early this morning because it had to chill and set in the fridge for a good few hours. I carefully wrapped it up and stuck it at the bottom of the fridge behind a couple things so it wouldn't get knocked off. 

I'm not exactly sure how or why it happened, but my brother (30) went to get something out of the fridge and pulled out the pie to get at it and put it on the counter. He ended up knocking it off the counter and the pie plate broke and the pie was ruined. He went to the store and bought a store bought pumpkin pie.

I had no idea about any of this until everyone started showing up at 5pm, as he didn't tell me until it was just about dinner time. I was really angry, as he's a very careless person and breaks my things all the time and this was just another thing he ruined. To make it worse, the pie he bought was filled with cream so I couldn't even eat it. I always feel so awkward being the only one not eating dessert at gatherings which is why I've always liked being the one making them.

He said well sorry and asked if I was mad at him and I said ""obviously, but I need to help mom with dinner now"" and I walked away. He hasn't said anything else to me, but apparently told my mom he thought I was being a brat. I don't feel like I did a fucking thing wrong here - don't I have the right to be mad? Especially when he didn't even get a dessert and could eat and was more concerned I was mad at him then actually ruining my pie and breaking my expensive pie plate (which was a Christmas gift from my aunt that was from France)???",383,2011,0.94

1920,Asshole,"I have long thought that my girlfriend has some minor mental health issues (probably GAD), which, left untreated, have caused many issues for her and for our relationship. They've impacted our sex life, where we travel, what we eat, when we sleep, what we talk about, etc. She cries A LOT, and in a way that's completely disproportionate to the sources of distress. Worse, it's often about our relationship (or me), which puts a lot of strain on things. She has refused to seek out any form of help in the past. I am currently working with my own therapist on actions I can take to deal with the situation, but in the meantime:

Whenever she is really, really upset, I get kind of excited because a part of me gets my hopes up that she might be desperate enough to get the help I believe she needs. It is common for people to need to hit a new low to be willing to try something so ""drastic"" as ""asking for help."" I don't think it's just pure fantasy to hope that that her distress could motivate her to make positive changes in her life, but maybe I'm way off base.

Everyone keeps telling me that I should tell our wedding photographer that I was disappointed with our pictures, but I really don't see the point. She was fairly inexpensive, so I feel like we got what we paid for (about 1/2 the cost of a typical photographer, because we got married on a Sunday and did a bundle deal with her and another vendor). I feel like I'd be the asshole for telling her what we didn't like, because I really don't see the point in saying anything after the fact, but other people are saying feedback will help her future brides have better pictures.

For reference, here is the email I wrote:

""Hi, (Photographer)-

I can’t believe it’s been two weeks already! Thanks for getting our pictures back to us so quickly. While some of our pictures are truly lovely, there were a lot of things impacting the majority of our pictures that are keeping us from sharing them with our family and friends.

Firstly, there are no pictures of just (groom) and his grandfather, which I had specifically asked for;

Secondly, all but one of the pictures of the bridal party and myself walking down the aisle have (DJ) in the background (not setting up equipment, just pacing at the back of the room);

Thirdly, I wish small things such as (Groom's) tie being crooked and my necklace being stuck behind my dress in every formal picture had been pointed out so we could correct them;

And lastly, most of the shots of objects like my ring and purse are crooked or off-kilter. 

Also, most pictures were taken with such a wide angle that we don’t seem to be the focus of the pictures, because there’s so much other stuff visible. 

I hope that this feedback helps make the pictures better for future brides.

Regards, (Me, Bride)""

I invited her to my moms birthday dinner at a very nice restaurant and asked her dress up a little and she showed up in sweats, a hoodie and birkenstocks.

1923,Not the A-hole,"This is actually 'are we the assholes' - my mom (60) and I (19) - here. My mom feels bad and knows I read this sub, so asked me to post this.

My mom doesn't always host Thanksgiving but wanted to this year. This meant \*I\* would also be hosting Thanksgiving, as it's a lot of work so I help her out usually by making dessert and most of the side dishes while she handles turkey, gravy and potatoes. I told her what I was planning on making last week, she said sounds good, and we bought most of the ingredients 3 days ago.

Invited to Thanksgiving was my sister and her husband, her husband's mom, my mom's oldest friend/my godfather, and our elderly neighbour. My sister was to bring wine and the other guests were bring appetizers. Also going to be there would be my mom, dad, brother (30M) and I, who all live in one house. 

Last night, my brother asked if there was anything he could do for Thanksgiving. At that point everything was set and my mom and I were definitely worried about a 'too many cooks in the kitchen' situation as my brother is a chef by trade and has a tendency to take over the whole kitchen just to make salad dressing, so my mom said 'I think we'll be okay but thank you for offering. I'll let you know if you can help out in any way tomorrow.' He started to get a bit insistent on making something but my mom and I both said really we had everything planned, and my dad said as it was, he thought there would be way too much food. 

My brother got up early this afternoon, the day we were hosting Thanksgiving with everyone to come by at 5 and asked my mom to take him to the grocery store because he still really wanted to make a dish. My mom repeated what we said last night and told him it was too late, the stores would be too busy, and at this point another dish would mess up our plans. Additionally, my brother is still getting over a bit of a cold, so my mom wasn't sure if he would be contagious still or not and wasn't really wanting to risk it, considering my sister is very anal about getting sick. He got mad and upset and accused us of not wanting him around and complaining he never does anything around the house but then not letting him doing anything when he does want to. He went down to his room and slammed the door and has been in his room since. 

He is also notorious for throwing a wrench into our plans at the last minute, and he's a very stressful person to be around in the kitchen, as he treats our home kitchen like his restaurant's kitchen and doesn't have much regard for what my mom or I are doing. Personally, I wouldn't have wanted him to make a dish and be in the kitchen with my mom and I at all tonight when we're cooking however if he had asked last week before we planned and bought all the ingredients, I probably would've just sucked it up and said he could make a salad or stuffing or something.

I left for many reasons, and in the weeks following me leaving, I had a new sense of strength and told him I'd be keeping the master bedroom, however I have offered many times if he would prefer to have it, to which he declined.

Anyway, the bedroom has an ensuite, which he continued to use. I asked him to stop but decided to choose my battles and let him continue. However he keeps going in the bedroom to use the full length mirror and to shave his head.

Today I asked him as nicely as possible if he could just give me a heads up that he would be going in there, as I don't like the idea of anyone being in my room without me knowing. He told me I was being ridiculous and as long as he is paying half of the mortgage he will go in whatever room he feels like going in. I said if he doesn't start at least telling me he's going in that room that I will put a lock on the door. He said I obviously have something to hide, which I don't. I'm just a private person.

Was it that unreasonable? I'm not banning him from going in the room, just to give me a heads up.

I think it’s deeply harmful and I am worrying about his health, in a month he has lost THIRTY lbs and it’s just ridiculous. He was 340 lbs before and now he’s 310.  I mean, I get that he wants to lose weight but in a month? I love him and I want him to be okay. 

He is bragging to his friends that he’s lost weight by fasting, etc. Privately I have spoken to him and told him let’s do this the healthy way, he needs to be accountable about this instead of starving himself, etc. I also think it’s unfair that he’s talking about this to his impressionable younger brother and sister when we went to visit.

His younger brother in particular seemed to be hanging on to every word my boyfriend said (his brother is 14) and I didn’t feel comfortable because he was asking about him doing it etc. My bf encouraged it and said he’d lose a good amount.

I mentioned that my boyfriend was not doing this with advice from his doctor and that it was healthier if he (my bf’s bro) just focused on speaking to his doc if he had any questions about losing weight. I also said  ‘bf is not going about this the right way’ which I felt appropriate because I have a close relationship with my bf and his family and felt I could speak freely. 

When we left my boyfriend was furious and said that I was undermining him, that I was making his efforts out to be dangerous etc.  I told him that I was proud he was losing weight but worried at his method, AND I said that telling a 14 y/o to just not eat is the last thing he needs to be doing.

I’ve asked him each time to please not do that—just put the oily dish by the side of the sink and I’ll clean it up. He has no objection in principle to putting things to the side rather than in the sink, and usually does it for things like wine glasses or big pots/pans. And it only stays there for as long as we’re clearing the table and putting away leftovers. I wash the dishes right after the meal. 

So today at lunch we had sandwiches. He made his using the last of a jar of feta in oil. After we cleared the table, he literally dumped the jar of oil with leftover specks of feta into the sink which had a cutting board, our plates and glasses, and a colander we used to rinse some tomatoes. I started to wash the dishes but got fed up—everything was covered with a sheen of oil and there were specks of feta and herbs in the holes of the colander.

Not too long ago, another friend asked for access, and fearing multiple device logouts (I’ve given access to my in-laws as well), I declined. He was very polite about it, and said he was just asking because my other friend said I gave him access. This made me a little uneasy, but I really do think it was an innocent discussion.

1937,Asshole,"

So some context first:
I'm a senior (17M) in high school and I've always had a complex about my height because I don't like looking down on other people, literally. So I prefer taller girls cause I wanna see eye to eye with someone, not eye to nipple lol. I'm also ADHD and have Asperger's so keep that in mind.

So I've been in like 3 relationships, my first was long distance, my second one was.... Unique? And my third ended up getting snatched up by my best friend after 2 months cause I understood they were better for each other (we're all still friends to this day and that was 4 months ago)

Start of senior year I met this Junior (16F) and I really liked her, she was a meme lord (something I really liked) and was pretty understanding. She was 5'2"". About a month into school we both found out we liked eachother and started hanging out, I was happy. We made out a couple times but nothing was official cause we wanted to take it slow, and during our last hangout I made the comment: ""ya know, usually I only liked taller girls and won't date anyone below my shoulders, but your a big exception, I really like you"" and in the moment she laughed and we just kept talking. Fast forward to later that day, I'm at home on my PC and I start getting angry messages from her saying, ""you don't like that I'm short!? Wow! Just wait for your Amazonian woman who's 7'5"" to sweep you off your feet!"" (Almost verbatim) and I'm thinking, ""woah, what happened...?"" So I try to explain to her that I was trying to compliment her but she just kept putting words in my mouth saying stuff like' ""I bet you'll ditch me if a taller girl comes along"". After like 20 minutes of getting nowhere she says ""whatever I'm too tired to argue, goodnight"". 

Now at this point I'm emotionally confused, I used to like her but the way she reacted during that text conversation really turned me off, like yeah we could still be friends but I just.... Didn't like her romantically anymore, it just set off allot of big red flags in my head. So lunch the next day she takes me outside and says ""let's talk"". EDIT4: (During this talk she tried to convince me to keep going with her and possibly form a relationship in a week or so), and basically it just amounted to me saying how we could still be friends but I didn't really like her romantically anymore. This offended her and said ""it's cause my height isn't it!?"" And I was just so done with her so I just said ""okay I'm hungry, I'mma go get lunch bye"" (I didn't really know how to handle her at this point) and since then it's just been akward glances in the hall.

(Sorry if that sounds a little biased, this just happened a day ago so I'm trying to filter my perspective on it)

Am I the asshole?


EDIT: thanks for the criticism Bois, I now realize I should probably think about my statements more carefully before speaking. Also thanks for all the advice you guys gave me, for a first serious post on Reddit, this was good.

EDIT2: Height seems to be a really sensitive topic huh? Im liking the diverse opinions and constructive criticism. Important thing to keep in mind is that we were NOT dating, we just simply knew we liked each other and did some NCMO from time to time.

EDIT3: another common misconception, I didn't dislike her height, I liked her allot and her height wasn't an issue at all, it's just not the kind of person I usually date so yeah no, I liked her and her height didn't matter, it just didn't follow the pattern of people I usually liked/dated.

He told me he was recently divorced, and divulged that the reason was that his wife wanted kids and he didn't. This was great because i mention being childfree in my profile (I'm 31 so this comes up a lot).

We met up again and ended up seeing each other a couple of times a week and sleeping together for a little over a month, before he showed up in my Facebook 'People You May Know' and he was very clearly married with a kid and wife. I confronted Chris (and of course ended things) and he begged me not to tell his wife before he could, because she's PREGNANT and he wants to be the one to tell her. I said I'd give him a week.

Within the week, his wife messaged me on Facebook and said he told her what happened, and I gave her the full story. I told her I was sorry he'd betrayed her like this and fooled me, and that I of course never would have started dating a married man. As we were winding down the conversation, she then told me she wanted me to apologize for sleeping with her husband and that she needed that for closure.

For me, this was a record scratch moment. I did nothing wrong here. I had NO IDEA this man was married, let alone had a kid and one on the way. When I found out I confronted him immedaitely, broke up with him immediately, and forced his hand in telling his wife. There is nothing on my conscience here. I was lied to, too.

- she has another sister who can babysit

- her mother can obviously afford to pay someone other than her, so another babysitter isn't out of the question.

- She never asked me if i'd be okay with her doing this on the day that was meant for us before agreeing to it

- She was aware I took the day off of work to do this.

I expressed this to her, and said i wish she had ran it by me first because i am completely and totally not okay with this. I did not request the day off for her to go babysit for her mom.

However I used condoms and my wife has been on birth control since she was 14, so we were all good.

I go get some
more condoms after, vasectomy happens, and  everything’s all good.

Nope. She’s now six weeks pregnant, I was surprised cause isn’t she supposed to be on birth control? Come to find out that she hasn’t been taking it for at least a few months now.

1941,Asshole,"DISCLOSURE: I'm posting this for a friend who does not use Reddit. However he will be writing it himself.

I consider myself to be a responsible gun owner, keeping all my guns locked up in a safe, in a locked room by themselves. I've always warned my kids that they should never handle them or try to get them without me present and watching over them, but they've never actually been up close with them, only seeing them when I'm taking the guns to the range. My wife is not a fan of guns, and does not handle them, but she knows the basics. 

Last week my wife and I decided that they're old enough to know more, and most importantly how to safely handle them. Rather than using one of my real guns, I bought a spring gun that looks remarkably like a real Glock. It's even got some real heft to it and has a metal slide. [This](https://i.imgur.com/ZEKdZEE.jpg) is the gun in question. I think the majority of people would think this is real unless they're familiar with firearms.

Basically, I sat them down and showed it to them, let them hold it, aim it, taught them all the basics (trigger discipline, never to point it at anything you don't want to destroy, etc) and I thought all went well. I presented it as though it were real. However I later left it out of the safe and my wife got really angry thinking it was real. When I said it was fake, she got mad that I'd lie to the kids on something so important and that it looks like I don't really trust them. My logic is that by using a fake one first, on the off chance they try something dumb like pointing it at each other on a whim, they wouldn't be in any real danger.

My wife thinks I'm an ass, and she mentioned it to my mother and she agrees. My father doesn't really care but pointed out that he trusted me with a real gun when he was teaching me at age 5, and maybe I should have afforded my kids the same respect. I'm kinda uncertain here so I'm looking for your opinions. Was it wrong to lie?

Editing to clarify that that she doesn't think I should have given them a real gun, she is just very principled and thinks I shouldn't have misled them when discussing something so important and mature. Also I wouldn't think it needs to be said but please do not take this as an opportunity to attack my wife. She is an intelligent and caring woman who wants the best for our children, I just want to know if I messed up here, so let's keep to the topic on hand.

Final edit: Discussion is mostly over now, the YTA vote is top by a very wide margin so that's settled. I know now I was absolutely wrong to leave the BB gun out, I tried to set a good example then immediately failed to follow it myself. I've discussed it with my wife and we're gonna have a follow-up discussion.

1951,No A-holes here,"This is my first time posting anything but I enjoy reading thing sub often so hopefully I got everything right.

So, before anyone asks, I (27F) don't drink. My fiancé (27M) also doesn't drink. We don't have any sort of history with alcohol that would make it detrimental to have alcohol around us. We aren't religious either. I have just never drank because I don't see the appeal of it, and though my fiancé has drank in the past, it was less than five times ever and all while we were in college. Our immediate families also do not drink, but our extended families have people that do. A lot of our friends, however, do drink. 

With all that, while we were planning our wedding, we went in with the assumption that there would be no alcohol. We just don't feel like it would be fun to be surrounded by drunk people at our own reception. Basically everyone close to us is aware that we don't drink, but now I'm concerned that there might be people coming (SOs of friends, family we see less often, etc.) that aren't aware of it and they might be offended. We really don't want people to bring alcohol or try to sneak it in (our venue isn't dry but you have to pay more if you want alcohol to be allowed and we aren't planning on doing that - however we could easily afford it so it is not a financial issue). In terms of things that don't require alcohol, we will have performances by dancers but most of the other activities are for the kids. We aren't having a dance floor because neither of us are big party people and we'd rather people spend the time talking. Everyone we are inviting except plus ones knows multiple people coming.

The reason I am questioning this is because my fiancé was talking to his best man (a pretty heavy drinker) and he insisted that people would be weirded out by the lack of drinks and that it would cause people to have less fun. There are a decent amount of people flying in for this wedding because both of our families are spread out around the globe. I really don't want them to come so far and not enjoy themselves! On the other hand, this is ultimately our wedding and both o us would be less happy if there was alcohol served.

Yes, we could have gone to the store and paid for meat that had a much more tortured existence. He thinks it would be preferable because the rabbit would have live a longer life.

1958,Not the A-hole,"I commute to my place of work every day by train.

Bicycles are not allowed to be left unattended, yet this rule is often ignored. People prop them up against seats, doors and luggage racks and then go sit down wherever they want. It is not uncommon for entrances/exits to be obstructed and once or twice I have had a bike fall on me mid-journey.

Yesterday it was cold and rainy, so everyone on the platform was jockeying to get onto the train as soon as it pulled into the station. However, when the automatic doors opened, a bike was completely blocking the way so nobody could board the carriage. We waited a few seconds to see if someone would come move it, but no one did.

Some of the people behind me hurried over to a different door, but I was wet and cold and annoyed with the owner of the bike for being so stupid and inconsiderate. So I made the split-second decision to pick it up it and dump it on the platform. As we boarded the train, I shouted down the carriage “Whoever’s bike was blocking the door, it’s now on the platform!”

A guy right up the other end of the carriage looked up in surprise, jumped out of his seat and ran to the bike. He managed to grab it and get back on the train before the doors closed. As he was propping it back up against the opposite door, he said very aggressively “Don’t touch my bike!” to which I replied “Don’t leave it blocking the door then, dickhead”. There was a murmur of assent in the carriage, so he just scowled at me and didn’t say anything else (but he did sit down right next to his bike, so hopefully that means he learned his lesson).

I had no doubts whatsoever about what I’d done until I was telling the story to my friend later on; she was shocked and told me I was out of order. So here I am asking Redditers: AITA?

Edit: Just wanted to add that it’s highly unlikely that the bike would have been stolen, because it’s a small rural station with CCTV and only 1 entrance/exit. The staff would simply have put it in the back room and waited for the passenger to go back and collect it.

Edit2: A lot of people commenting that I should have moved the bike and put it somewhere else inside the carriage.

My wife runs a guide unit in the UK and I help out, this time for Switzerland summer camp.

 our son at the time was two and a bit.  The wife and I met in the outdoors where I coached canoeing and kayaking.
I’ve been doing it for over a decade.  We take the group down into a narrow gorge that has an amazing grade 6 waterfall and rapids section.  There were two ways down; one via a shale stone path that had the occasional moss covered slippery log step, very steep, and hair pins all the way down.  The other way was through the gorge on see through metal walkways and ladders.   These were in no way suitable for a pram. So the group decide to go down the gorge via the steps. The wife decides she wants to take our son to the bottom in his pram via the path.  I’m not ok with this:

1.  It’s pouring rain.  There is the very real risk of a flash flood.  We would be in the worst place if one did happen.
2. If something did happen whilst we’re down the gorge, the exit is barely suitable for one adult let alone a group of kids and a pram with my son in it.  Our exit would literally be through the gorge walkways.
3. The rain has massively impacted the safety of the steep path as shale stone gets incredibly unsettled when it’s wet.

I said to my wife that I’d be happy to watch our son up here by the bus if she wanted to go down there with the group of her girls or vice versa.  She grabbed the pram and said I was being ridiculous and it would be fine... I really stated my point but she then got some guides to take the pram down the bad path.

Some guides slipped and one twisted her wrist on this climb down.  A lady climbing down behind us slipped and broke her arm!  Thankfully I had my emergency shelter. We were waiting for the air amb to turn up when I noticed the level had risen a lot whilst we were helping the woman.  I go into “safety over everything!” Mode and take over ignoring my wife’s protests.  We have scouts take the pram up the slope and then I take my son and carry him through the gorge, which was so hard to climb up, whilst passing him onto other adults when I literally cant carry him anymore.  I hated this part as a big part of me felt like I failed my son having to hand him to others when he was crying and needed me... But we got to the top mentally and physically wrecked.  My son and all the kids and adults were safe...

My wife kicked off at me though. Said I had no right to start ordering people around like that.  I said when there is an issue of safety I will always start taking control as that’s the right thing to do.  I’d rather have people be safe but angry.  People were very grateful.

I said that her determination to prevent us being safe by staying with our son,  who won’t remember this, was a huge problem for me.

She always seems to make awkward and slightly backhanded comments about my appearance whenever I come through her line, and I’ve always assumed she does it to everyone so I just ignored her and moved on.

Until two weeks ago, my LDR boyfriend was in town and we went to the grocery store to get some ingredients for dinner. We really enjoy cooking together so this was to be our first date together in a couple weeks, it was pretty important. When we got to the only open check line, I was a little annoyed to see that of course Rachel was the only cashier. 

The interaction started out harmless enough, with her asking what we were making. I answered that we were making thai spring rolls, she said she had never heard of those, but then she pointedly looked at BF and said “wow, I wish I had a boyfriend who could cook.” Ok. Fine. Alright. That’s fine. We could have just moved on from then but then she noticed the t-shirt he was wearing (he was ironically wearing an old WWE shirt with hulk hogan among others, even though he didn’t watch wrestling and didn’t know any of the other wrestlers) she then started gushing about how she couldn’t believe there was a man right in front of her who could cook AND knew about wrestling. I was officially majorly uncomfortably but was too shocked to intervene. 

By then our groceries were rung up and I went to pay, and she looks at him and says, “Well if you’re going to be cooking good food tonight and watching wrestling, I get off at 8.” I was literally stunned. (This whole time BF has been responding by nervously chuckling and exhibiting a little more PDA than we normally would) I grabbed BF’s hand, we gathered our groceries and left.

My wife and I had our second child only 2 days ago. Our first child (2m) has been with my in laws, and was back at home meeting his new baby sister for the first time.

I decided I wanted to film their first encounter. It was a short video of my wife holding the baby, while our young son sheepishly checked her out. It was a moment that could not be recreated.

I thought it went well, but after watching it back, I realised my step father (64m) had been taking photos. Not only was his shutter noise noticeable several times in the clip, but his phone appears 4 times in the corner of the frame, moving in and out as he got into position . He then posted 2 blurry photos of the encounter to his Facebook page before I had even thought of loading my video.

I have a relatively good relationship with my step father, and he is a good grandfather, but his photography has always been an issue within the family. He has taken some lovey photos over the years, but often at the expense of enjoying the moment. This has only gotten worse since changing to a smart phone in the last 2 years, and now photos are taken whenever he feels like it, and uploaded without any consideration for anyone in them. They are often terrible quality and far too many at one time.

He does not take criticism well, often storming out of rooms, and never apologises. Due to this behaviour, my brothers and I often run issues past our mother. When I told her I was upset with the clip, and my step dads behaviour, she took his side, stating he wasn’t hurting anybody, that the clip was fine, and he can upload as many bad photos to Facebook as he likes. She couldn’t understand why I was upset, saying he was only being a doting grandfather.

AITA?

Edit

Thank you everyone for the feedback, most was constructive.

Just to answer some questions and address some assumptions. 

I was never concerned about the Facebook privacy issue, and did not plan on sharing the video myself, my social media footprint is not large. The Facebook post was more frustrating because I feel that he is taking photos more and more just so he has more content for his page. The poor photo quality got to me because his interruption of my video didn’t even result in a nice photo, if that makes sense.

A lot of people are saying I’m being petty and he is simply being a caring grandfather. He is definitely a caring grandfather, and perhaps I am being petty. I was just hoping in that moment he could let me take a video without being involved. There is a lot of context that is hard to show in a short description, but 20 years of often intrusive photos paired with his inability to take criticism has been difficult at times. This probably explains why my brothers and wife are on my side but I have been generally labelled the arsehole here.

I agree I could have addressed my frustration better with him. This was probably the result of some recent poor behaviour on his part, which caused me to lash out at the “last straw”. Also doesn’t help that it’s been a stressful and sleepless time with a new baby.

This may seem like I’m making excuses, and maybe I am. But I do agree I should have handled the confrontation better, set up more ground rules, and cut him some slack.",178,648,0.92

She initially struggled with the job hunt as she has no formal qualifications and no experience, other than the company that we both worked at. She eventually found a position that offered accommodation. The salary was terrible and the reviews of the company were even worse. 

When she arrived, I picked her up from the airport, got her settled in to her accommodation, took her shopping and also took her out to show her around. 

I invited her out loads of times, but she starting turning me down as soon as she got to know her colleagues and joined an expat social group. Suddenly, she was apparently going to all kinds of fun parties and events but never inviting me. I was a little offended as it was stuff she knew I loved and I'd invited her out all the time. 

As predicted, the job she moved for turned out to be awful but she managed to land with her bum in the butter and supposedly got an offer from a very reputable company in the country. Within a month of being in a new country, she (according to her) had landed the most amazing job with a high salary, loads of unheard of benefits and made tons of friends. At this point, she was only contacting me when she needed something or to rub in how amazing her job was.

I was jealous as I worked really hard to get where I am, which didn't seem anywhere near as good as what she has, even though I have a masters degree and lot more experience than her. 

I was tired of feeling inadequate and hearing about how well she's doing. I lied and said I was interested in working at the same company. I asked her if she could help me get a foot in the door and she became weird and said she had no contacts, other than the main office number that's on the website. 

A few days later, I lied again and said I'd met someone who knew the HR manager at the company and that they were putting me in touch. I asked my friend if she would mind if I used her name when I contact them. She got freaked out, begged me not to mention her name and told me that she's in a ""secret sales department"" that not even HR of the company is allowed to know about and other absurd, VERY obvious lies. She sent me multiple voice notes begging me not to even mention her name to anyone at the company at all. 

It's very clear that she lied. I told another friend the story and she basically said I'm an asshole for being nosey and causing her to panic. She says it's none of my business and I should have left it alone.

TL;DR My friend rubbed her ""amazing new job"" in my face, I did some digging and it seems like a big fat lie.

1974,No A-holes here,"Mostly relevant backstory: my cousin’s (24f; called Mary) divorced when she was young, and her mom moved to CA with her (we live in VA), so I (23f) didn’t grow up with her (I want to clarify this before people ask why it’s bothering me *now*). She recently moved back home and began working in the family business. Mary is trying to settle in, but most of us have grown up together, so it’s hard for her to just step into it, even though she has as much of a right to be there as any of us. To help her get settled, I’ve tried eating lunch with her. It’s not going well. 

Mary is a messy eater. I mean sauce all over mouth, open-mouthed chewing, finger-licking, and loud burping messy. To put it simply: she disgusts me. I have went from starving to nauseated within minutes of sitting down with her. I now just sip water at lunch and eat a larger supper. 

Sunday breakfasts are difficult as well. My family traditionally gets together in the morning to eat. Again, however, her behavior kills my appetite. I’ve taken to getting up extra early on the morning to do work, so I can have breakfast sent up beforehand. It sucks, but I figured I would live. 

Except, no. Mary is now convinced that I have an eating disorder because I “never eat and always look grossed out around food.” She’s apparently brought her concerns to most of the rest of our family, but she only just got the nerve up to speak to me. She won’t shut up about it now, and she keeps sending me these pitying looks. Mary is kind, and she means well, I think. But if she doesn’t drop it, I’m going to have to tell her something.",34,193,0.94
1975,No A-holes here,"Alright everyone, I need some judgement on this one...

My wife and I have a happy, healthy (no chonkers) cat that we love except for on weekends when he will sit outside our bedroom door and meow non stop until one of us gets up to feed him. This only happens on weekends.

Monday-Friday my wife wakes up for work first at around 6:00 am and feeds the cat. However on weekends we both try to sleep in, so come 6:01 am our kitty alarm clock goes off and won't shut up until one of us gets up to feed him. He will literally cry for 2 hours straight if we try to ignore him.

Here's where the story takes a twist. Awhile back we bought a timed self feeder to use when we are away for vacations. When we tested out the self feeder we discovered the amazing benefit of the cat no longer crying to us for food because he gets fed at his usual time each morning. I thought this was fabulous and we should use the self feeder all the time to save our sleep sanity.

My wife disagreed. Her reasons range from:

Concerned that the self feeder might not drop the correct amount of food each time.

Concerned the cat might be able to reach his little murder mitten up the food chute and steal extra food between meals.

Concerned the cat won't ""love"" us anymore since we aren't the ones directly pouring his food into his dish.

Concerned it's a waste of batteries.

I've told my wife I understand all of her concerns but I still think the benefit of being able to sleep in without being woken up by a cat banshee outweighs the risks she has laid out. She still disagrees.

So I did the only thing that reddit hates more in relationships than cheating and gave my wife an ULTIMATUM! 

I told her that we either use the self-feeder or come 6:01 am Saturday morning when the cat wakes us both up, I'm kicking her (not litterally) out of bed to go feed the damn cat.

So reddit, AITA?

EDIT: I'm seeing a lot of people proposing the compromise of using the self feeder just on weekends. Unfortunately my wife has shot that idea down in the past too.

EDIT 2: Many people have been demanding I pay the ""cat tax"" and post a picture of the real AH in question. Sadly I am a Reddit failure and can't figure out how to attach a picture to the post. If anyone knows how to do this and can direct message me, I will gladly comply and pay the cat tax.

EDIT 3: Hopefully this works...

1979,Not the A-hole,"My friend (44 f) has been staying with me and my husband (35 m)for 2 months now. She is looking for a job and has issues with her family so she stays with us. She didn’t tell us how long she was going to stay with us or that she has lost her job. 
She just told us that she will be with us for some time. her plan was to get a job and support her nephew who needs help. 

I have a history with this lady. We know each other since childhood and our families know for more than half a century. When I  finished college about 10 years ago, I stayed with her until I got a job. I paid her rent, paid for my groceries and some other stuff around the house. She paid for my meals if we went out to eat at that time. I did not ask for this but I truly appreciate she understood it. I have given her more than a few generous gifts too. She also bullied me while I was there. Ex: She would insult me in front my friends then later will say sorry; ask me to behave badly with chosen person and I had to or she will be mad; made me paint her garage and other places; yelled st me and told me I didn’t know how to be proper.  We were single at that time and I shared her bedroom with her, while another person lived in the guest room. 

For last 6 years she has had  a fall out with her family and she hasn’t talked to me because she considered me siding with the opposite party. She told me she wanted to stay with me like a week before she bought her came to our place. She is now here ; she tells us that she doesn’t have money but then spends a couple of thousand dollars on life coaching. We didn’t mind her staying with us but she wants to be in charge of the decision making. This reminds me of the time I got bullied by her.  My husband doesn’t understand why am I helping someone who doesn’t like me and tries to put me down in general. She has behaved selfishly. She doesn’t help with household chores unless she absolutely have to. When I ask her to do something she says she would do it later and then doesn’t do it. I pay for everything food, rent, gas etc. she doesn’t have car insurance so I don’t let her drive my car. She doesn’t want to share our insurance either. 

Today she yelled at me because I told her that we should arrange a guest bedroom for my in laws  who are coming  for an event at our place.  She heard me many times but wanted my in laws to arrange stuff with her once I go to work. I wanted to do it my way before I go to work. My father in law had already arrived and other family members were couple of hours away. He heard me getting yelled at by her. The old feeling  of getting bullied by her rushed in. I told her this is my house and she is welcome to move out.

By doing so I ruined both family’s relationship. She has a history of depression or she says tells us she does.

We don’t want kids, so we want to have a cat instead to liven up our lives. After some researches and preparations we were ready to welcome one home.


We searched on social media for a kitten for adoption and came across this woman, Lilo(not her real name), a retired lady in her 60s(probably) spending her free time fostering animals. She had a while kitten for adoption and we contacted her.


Lilo was a very knowledgable fosterer, she spent hours communicating with us, asking for our backgrounds and experiences before asking for a house visit to check if we were indeed ready for a cat. We let her in, and she pointed out a few safety mistakes we made and made us adjusted our furniture and recommended us companies to install safety gates and grilles. She was very patient and detailed and would offer us all the advices we asked.


During the time we prepared our home to be safer and more cat friendly, the white kitten Lilo fostered had been adopted. We were disappointed, but Lilo said she would keep us informed when she foster more cats. However, she had been recommending adult and special needs cats to us, instead of a kitten we requested. She tried to push us to adopt them by saying how we could afford financially and how much they were better than kittens and scolded us when we were reluctant.


Around that time, a colleague heard of me trying to get a kitten and introduced me to his friend, who’s cat just had a litter. They were Ragdolls and I was offered $60 to adopt one. I made my pick in the litter and brought him home after it weaned. We named him Kovu(Lion King 2) for his black eyeshadows and he is currently vaccinated and in good health and is the best behaved kitten I've ever seen. 


Lilo was furious with us, however. She accused us for supporting breeders and worst of human filth for buying instead of adopting and wasting her good faith on us. Ironically, her cat adoption fees were around the same price $30~70. While we grateful for her advices, we did tell her before that we wanted a kitten, and she had been fostering other kittens but kept pushing the adults and special needs ones to us. As a result, we got ourselves a kitten elsewhere. AITA?",515,1653,0.95

She recently finished her training as a surgical subspecialist and has extremely high standards of what she expects in her partner.

She also has strict physical requirements (at least 6 foot tall even though she is 5'2"" , under 40, full head of hair, athletic but ""not too athletic"" etc). 

she basically eliminates like 99% of the male dating pool with these silly requirements. 

Its hard to judge as  a brother but I'd say she's average to above average in the looks department. She could definitely try harder with makeup and hair and whatnot. But she acts extremely masculine - aggressive, confrontational, and dismissive to those she feels are beneath her (my words not hers). Its been like this her entire life. If another woman had that personality I wouldnt want to date them.

We decorate our side of the wall differently too, as I hung up pictures of my drawings and Eva's with pictures of people dressing oddly, such as crossdressing or obscene gestures implying LGBT or fetishes and the likes of that. I don’t mean it in an offensive way, just that I don’t know how to see them the way she does and don’t find any beauty in them. None of my business though, she didn't need to hear my opinion. 


After a term break and a trip home, I brought back photos of my family and proceed to redecorate my wall with them. Eva pointed at a few photos and asked if the person I am kissing in it was my boyfriend, to which I replied no, he is my brother, Eva then pulled a disgusted face. 


I explained that my brother may look older, but he is only 13 and we always take pictures like this. Eva then stuck her tongue out and pretended to vomit, saying it’s gross and I am having a disgusting relationship. I don’t really know about her, but it was not as if the pictures were suggestive or what, just me and my brother hugging, kissing and making weird faces at the camera.


It disgusted ME to think that Eva had such a vile mind and would be creeped out by pictures of siblings messing around. I pointed at the pictures on her wall and said that it was not as if I pulled any face at her weird tastes, I am just putting up my family photos on my own wall and she should keep her comments to herself. She got really offended and said that I was rude to call her's “weird"". I said it was rude to call our sibling relationship “disgusting"" too, and unless she takes that back I am not taking mine back.


After a while I found it really childish. I mean, just over some wall decorations? AITA and should I just make peace with her? We still have a good while as roommates before graduation after all.

I pointed out he said he was going to fix it with wood.glue, which i bought for him. He said its too heavy for it. Im a little annoyed by the fact he basically neglected to tell me this for three years now. 

We go on and he eventually jokingly says ""ill mever move anything again then!""   I retort back
""You didnt help with the furniture last time anyway, mark and tom (our friends) moved it all for us!""

He got really defensive, saying im telling him he doesnt help with anything and when i tried to remind him i remember them doing the moving because, one, he was at work, and two, because they pranked us and tore off the ties off the garbage bags id brought our clothes over in and put one on every doorknob cause guys are weird.

He got huffy and stormed out of the room and is huffing and puffing in the living room as i type this.

For the record heres some info: one, he really didnt help much with that move but i tried to.make it clear i wasnt implying that even though between us, its true. He had a mental breakdown and when he did help kept throwing and breaking things until i finally just did it myself includinf loading the moving truck alone. But i tried to be understanding and havent really brought that up cause i know he had a tough time then. We were nearly homeless and stressed. Its whatever. 

Two: he quit his job without warning almost rhree months ago now. I told him to take one month for mental health cause my job pays the bills (as long as we are really tight on our budget). I told him as long as he played house husband and helped clean up the apartment i wouldnt mind him taking his time finding something.

Needless to say he hasnt and ive brought it up maybe two times tops since the first month passed.

S/O's brother (BIL) is getting married and future sister in law's (SIL) bachelorette party is today. We announced the pregnancy before BIL and SIL got engaged... and the wedding is 10 days before our due date...

Back to the topic...Its a lot of bar hopping and cover charges for not being able to drink (and saving for maternity leave). My biggest concern is issues I have with my SI joint (connects your hip to your spine) and that I wind up with swollen feet after an hour of grocery shopping. Not to mention it is 3 hours from home for me and braxton hicks contractions LOVE me these days.

I love SIL, we get along well, but the only people I will know is future sister in law and my s/o's mom... all the rest of the attendees are at least 4-5 years younger than me and none of them have children (including SIL). IATA or WIBTA for not wanting to go?

&#x200B;

Edit for questions: No one has said IATA for not wanting to go but S/O did put me on a small guilt trip because its his only brother. MIL bought me a maternity dress (for the required dress code of all black) because she knows we have a tight budget, which also makes me feel guilty and like TA  (it's not an expensive dress and I could always wear it to the wedding still!)

It is an overnight trip. The best man decided to plan the bachelor party last minute the same night so we had to find someone to watch our 4 year old overnight (her first time spending the night somewhere that isn't MIL, which is also giving me anxiety).

I did pay for my portion of the hotel stay, so I wouldn't be strapping anyone with my portion.

There is a dinner planned (after the in-hotel drinking games) at a fairly pricey restaurant (again, we are saving for maternity leave). Then the bar hopping for the rest of the night.

Edit due to Timeline: S/O called me a stick in the mud but I called SIL and explained as some of you elaborated... It's a culmination of the drive, the stage of the pregnancy, and the physical discomfort... I want her to enjoy her night. She was understanding but I could hear a bit of disappointment in her voice.

My boyfriend really enjoys his relaxing time. He comes home from work and after food will spend the whole evening watching TV/playing games on the sofa. On the weekend, he gets up around 9 and stays on the sofa until about 11:30pm unless we have something planned. I do not mind this, he works hard and deserves to spend his leisure time how he wishes, however I really worry that he will remain this way after having children.

I want our kids to socialise often and have extra curricular activities (if they want) so we will both need to be willing to take them places, pick them up etc. but I am very worried he will be too lazy to do this.

We ended up talking about kids today and I said I need to know he can change before we have kids. His attitude is 'Of course once we have them I'll change' but I cannot just rely on that, having kids is too serious imo.

There are also many things that have come up over the years that we don't agree on: such as what they can/cannot watch on TV, religion, punishments etc. but he refuses to talk about them. He says we'll deal with them when they come up but I don't want to have a child and then argue at the time because we haven't already discussed whether we 'ground' them or something else.

So, my (26f) mother (53) comes to visit me from out of state twice a year. She gets a hotel room in town because she doesn't feel comfortable staying at my house (doesn't care for my boyfriend, iffy neighborhood, etc). When she visits, she always books a room with double beds so I can stay with her. And the place is about five minutes from my house.

Here's where I get frustrated. She goes to bed around 9pm and is one of those people that absolutely cannot sleep if the room isn't completely black and quiet. I'm a night owl and don't go to bed until 1am most of the time. So, obviously not able to watch TV and even my phone light bothers her. I'm also a smoker but she tells me I'm not allowed out of the room after she goes to bed.

It's the only part I dread about her visits. So, my boyfriend offered to pick me up from the hotel when she's ready for bed, and he'll drop me off the next morning on his way to work about the time she usually wakes up.

Her response is that she's heartbroken I don't want to spend the entire time with her, but I asked her ""what's the point of me staying there when you're sleeping and I'm going to be awake and bored so I'd rather spend the rest of my night at home. I'd be back first thing in the morning. I'd just rather sleep in my own bed and shower in my own shower. It's not my fault or problem you refuse to stay at my house and rather get a room.""

So, AITA for holding my ground about wanting to go home at night? Or should I aquest and deal with it?

Edit: I'll throw this out there. I have weird issues with my mother. Like, essentially she has this weird hold over me that I feel like I severely fuck up if I hurt her feelings or negatively impact her in any way.

Edit 2: I wanted to thank everyone for all the responses and advice. I took them to heart and stood my ground this weekend even though it was uncomfortable and I still couldn't help but feel bad when she consistently guilt tripped me the entire time I was with her but, hey, I did it. To help try to alleviate the situation, both mornings I brought her her favorite coffee and breakfast and it helped a little. It's ultimately sounding like she won't be coming up next time she usually does though because along with me not staying with her, there was a couple other things that she was ""displeased"" with but I won't bore anyone with those details since it was essentially just general nagging.

1997,Not the A-hole,"I was talking with some friends when this guy, probably a few years older then me, sneaked behind me and snatched my water bottle. I snatched it back. He tried to take it back and I said ""what the hell?"". He said he wanted water. I said he couldnt have mine and offered to buy him one. No. He wanted mine. He kept trying to snatch for it and I was getting annoyed. I asked him if he really wanted it. He said yes. I said I could buy him the exact same one. He refused. 

He tried unzipping my bag and taking something. I was so confused. I asked him to fuck off. He said no. He then tried reaching into the inside pocket of my hoodie. I grabbed my water bottle and emptied it onto him. He ran away screaming. My friends told me I am a prick and I apparently have bad morals. I disagree but I want some other opinions.

1998,Not the A-hole,"Usually, I get along with my mum well with little to no issues and I'm honestly kind of surprised this happened.  
Anyways I was at home and I get a phone call from a random number and I decide not to answer it as it was probably some scammer.  
Fast forward a few hours and my mum gets home and asks if I got a phone call which I answered yes. She then tells me it was her boss and to save his number in my phone. I got pretty pissed off about it and started ranting about how I don't want her boss or any of her friends/colleagues to have my number.  
She said I was acting like an asshole and said I should just put up with it because he might need to call me to get hold of my mum.  
I ended up blocking his number and ended it by telling my mum to please not give my phone number to her work colleagues.  
So AITA?  
Edit: I'm 14 and she wanted to give my phone number to her boss so that he could contact my mum through me if he could not contact her directly.    
Update: I talked with my mum and we came to an agreement that he can have my phone number but can only contact me for emergencies. Also, a lot of people asked who paid for the phone bill and the answer is my mum does.",93,169,0.93
1999,Asshole,"A while ago I found out a person I work with knew my boyfriend. This person is very friendly and outgoing, always helps out. Typical good dude. They went to school together and apparently were really close.

When I brought this up with my boyfriend, he explained how badly bullied he got. According to him the bullying from this coworker and friends made life ""unbearable"". Some of what he said was honestly hard to swallow (don't want to break any rules here). Like what school would allow someone to be targeted that badly and allow it to occur and not intervene for years? At my school if I got called a something like ""slut"" the bully would get an internal suspension. I believe that he feels/thinks that he got badly bullied.

I kind of wanted them to meet and clear the air. So put together Friday after-work knock-off drinks with some of our life friends and work friends. Boyfriend was up for it at the start but when he found out my coworker was going to be there, he cancelled last minute and left me a few angry and insulting messages. It was kind of childish of him to be honest.

We're in our mid/late 30s and high school was half our life ago. People grow up and change. I feel it's time to grow out of childish hangups, grudges and rivalries and actually act like an adult and recognise that it's possible for an former ""asshole"" to become decent.",726,789,0.74
