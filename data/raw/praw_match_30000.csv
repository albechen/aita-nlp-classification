1,Not the A-hole,"Hear me out, I genuinely don’t know.

So I (M 20) live in a three bedroom apartment with two other guys (both M 20). We all have girlfriends who come and go, but one girlfriend (M 19) lives with us permanently. The three of us guys pay rent out of pocket, while the girlfriend in particular (we’ll call her Amy) has a room on campus that she has never once slept in, and that room costs more than what she would pay to live here. She hardly ever visits her own room. 

Amy eats food that her roommate pays for, uses up utilities with us, uses our bathroom, etc etc. She doesn’t buy food. She doesn’t pay for anything, except for herself. This is typically fine, she can pay her own food and expenses. But she wastes money paying for a place on campus when it could make living at my apartment cheaper for both of my roommates and myself. Even she would pay less.

This is something I’ve never voiced to my roommate who dates her, because I know the girlfriends me and my other roommate bring over don’t pay rent either. The difference is they come temporarily and leave. Half the time they’re not here. And while they temporarily take up space and do the same things as Amy, they leave just as often to stay at where they live.

Amy and her boyfriend knew prior to moving in that Amy would be staying with us full-time. She’s cool as a roommate, but she also takes up a lot of space, makes the place dirty, sits on our couch all day, uses our shower and bathroom constantly.

My parents wonder why I live with 4 people full time and three pay rent. It’s more of a burden for them when they help me in affording college, and it would make rent cheaper for the other three.

The main reason why Amy doesn’t pay rent, is because her parents don’t know she lives with a bunch of guys. Her, and her boyfriend, have no plan on telling her parents. I can understand, but her parents are also paying thousands every semester for a room she’s never slept in. Amy and her boyfriend would rather not approach the issue then pay less for where they’re living because their parents cover most of it. I pay out of pocket for where I live a lot of the time. It’s tougher for me, when I feel it’d be easier if she paid rent.

I approached my roommate who dates Amy, and low-key asked that since he knew beforehand that Amy would be living with us full-time, why she didn’t pay rent this year. He maintained the fact that since there’s only 3 people on the lease, it shouldn’t affect me at all and it’s not my problem. If she didn’t exist it wouldn’t make a difference. 

It’s a small apartment, and she’s constantly around. She takes up a lot of space. 

I don’t know, I’m really unsure if I’m in the wrong place even asking.

Am I an asshole for pulling my roommate aside after several months this morning, and asking him why she doesn’t pay rent?

2,Not the A-hole,"I (19F) have basically had the same group of friends for 6 years, of about 8 girls.

Every year I watch these people buy each other presents, and I myself spend $30-$50 on every one ($400 each year). I am also the most financially independent out of these people so it takes a toll.

Then when it comes to my birthday, which is near Christmas (5 days), nobody has ever bought me a present.

This could be because it’s close to Christmas or just because they are bad friends.

This year I decided to stop buying anyone presents. 

This means that I’ve had to show up at birthday events empty handed whilst everyone else is giving gifts (that they would never do for me).

Does this make me an asshole??

3,No A-holes here,"Update: ordered meat again on the second date. Haven’t heard from her since. No biggie 😎😎😎

EDIT: I should add that the vegan thing isn’t a diet choice but more a morality choice, she avoids using animal products whenever she possibly can. 

Went on a date with a girl I had pretty great chemistry with, and I knew she was vegan beforehand (just it not occurring to me about the leather/suede jacket). 
She was the first one to bring it up and it hit me then that I screwed up. 
We got Mexican after and I ordered beef nachos (again, simply was not thinking) and again she brought that up but was still super cool about it all. 

The date went well and we have another (which I will be more thoughtful about) but still think it’s a pretty major dick move to have at least not considered it.

6,No A-holes here,"Hello, I'm forty y/o for the last few months my Step dad and my mom (both in their 70's) have been creating their wills. They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. (They did not ask permission of my parents to do this.) The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. 

Stepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.

I don't hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. There is a lot of history here and writing this just gets me mad. But as an example: They have stolen from their dad and my mom, cars, cash, credit cards and even pictures hanging from the wall. They have gotten me fired from a job by using my discount and identity. They moved into my house and didn't pay rent. They have cheated on their spouses, clearly in the wrong and blamed it on the spouse. They have abandoned their children on the side of the road.

So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing through the dinner but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. Exact words were, ""I don't want anything, but I'll be happy with anything you give me.""

The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken. I have learned not to engage and shortly left.

There must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.

AITA?

7,Asshole,"I'm gay and have no intention of ever coming out. I have a fake boyfriend who's also gay.

I've had this friend since I was 14 and basically been in love with her since I was 16. I'm almost 20 now. I always knew she was gay too even though she never told me. Luckily, nobody ever suspected we were gay because we don't ""look gay"".

We were hanging out in a park like two weeks ago. She just suddenly randomly came out to me. She seemed really nervous and was like ""And I..."" and went quiet.

I assumed she was just going to explain more about how she's gay, so I tried to spare her the discomfort by saying I understood what she wanted to say.

The rest of the conversation was something along the lines of:

Her: ""You know?""

Me: ""Yeah, I've kind of known for years""

Her: ""You should have told me""

Me: ""I just wanted to wait until you felt comfortable enough to tell me instead""

She started kinda stumbling over her words and said something like, ""Is it the same for you too?"" I can't remember exactly how she phrased it, but it was in a really awkward, vague way.

I hesitated a lot, but I forced myself to just say yes because I trust her.

That somehow led to her kissing me in the park IN PUBLIC, and I freaked out. I panicked and looked around to make sure no one I knew was there and was like ""Why would you do that?""

I just went into full-on closeted denial mode and was like ""I can't believe you just did that, I'm not gay, I have a boyfriend"" etc.

She looked on the verge of tears and apologised and made up an excuse to leave.

Later that day, I texted her that I was sorry for freaking out on her, but she didn't reply. She also started avoiding me for days.

My friend has a very close friend. (I'll call her ""Emily"".) I asked Emily if my friend was ok, and she told me my friend spoke to her about the situation. She said it was a misunderstanding because when my friend asked if I was the same, she was apparently asking me if I had feelings for her, but that I must have interpreted it as meaning something else.

She said my friend wishes I'd let her down gently instead of rejecting her the way I did, and that it was really humiliating for her.

Also, Emily somehow figured out I was gay from the story. I was very anxious because I was worried she'd tell someone. My family and most of my friends are extremely homophobic.

If it was ok for me to be gay, then I'd definitely want to be in a relationship with my friend. But it's not, and I'll lose everyone I know. Plus, I don't wanna end up in Hell if it exists.

However, I also don't want to lose her as a friend because I care about her a lot.

I'm pretty upset with my friend for telling Emily about what happened because Emily then realised I was gay. I'm also upset that she kissed me in public because someone we know could have seen.

My friend is hurt and embarrassed by the way I acted and is still avoiding me.

Am I in the wrong here, is she, or are we both in the wrong?


EDIT: This isn't really relevant to the post, but I just wanted to say thank you all so much for the encouraging comments. You guys are all way too kind. Posting this, I was genuinely expecting to get a lot of homophobic comments, but I barely got any. Thanks guys. Hope you all have a good day",85,51,0.82
8,Everyone Sucks,"I know the title already sounds like i'm a major asshole, but there is a few more variables that need to be discussed before you make your decision. 

Also, this is a throwaway acct for obvious reasons

So I meet a girl on Tinder named ""Kim"" and we exchange a few messages before deciding to meet up for coffee.

The date is going OK, although it was a bit boring, we grabbed our cup of starbucks (i paid) we chatted for a bit and decided to drive to a cool little outdoor park to go for a walk. 

We drive around 30 mins to this park, listened to a bit of music on the way, still getting to know each other a bit and everything was going fine. 

I parked, we got out of the car and walked a bit, still chatting, nothing deep, but the usual what you do for work, hobbies etc etc.

I had to take a leak, so I go to the bathroom and when I walked out, I noticed she was talking to a guy and he was being very flirty and when I walked up to them, he asked who I was and she responded: ""oh he's just my friend hahaha"" and he said he wanted to grab her number to go out for a drink sometime. She was all too happy to give him the number and they hug with a kiss on the cheek before he leaves. 

At this point I was just over it. I wasn't that interested in her and if she's the type of person to show interest in another guy and exchange info in front of me I have no future with her.

I decided to make up some random excuse to get away from her and just got in my car and drove home. I didn't want to have to deal with her company for a 40 minute drive and was over it. 

Oh well, I honestly feel like a bit of an asshole, but also feel it was just in a sense considering what happened....",681,19784,0.93
9,Not the A-hole,"Right now, I'm seeing a woman in a fairly casual situation. I'm 27 years old and she's 25, and the incident I'll talk about happened on our third date.

On Saturday night we went to a gourmet burgers and fries place (think Pulp Fiction John Travolta/Uma Thurman car in the wall joint) for my birthday dinner. It was her choice and I thought it sounded like a grand idea, as corny restaurants are always a blast. A while after our burgers came the waitress paid us the typical ""how is everything"" visit, and stuck around for a short chat after. During the course of our talk I ended up mentioning that it was my birthday, and she told me that it was hers too. It was a nice little coincidence and we all seemed to get a kick out of it.

Eventually our waitress excused herself. After we finished eating we ordered a couple of shakes, at which point the waitress and I nicknamed each other ""birthday girl"" and ""birthday boy,"" respectively.

Our check came, and to my surprise my date didn't make any indication that she was going to pay. I didn't raise a stink about it of course, and I didn't think it was exactly a huge deal. I thought it was normally for the non-birthday party to pay on someone else's birthday, but again, different people may be used to different things.

I checked the bill and saw ""Happy Birthday!"" written at the bottom with a cute smiley face. I put in the cost of the meal with a standard tip, and we got up and put on our coats. At the last second I told my date to hold on a bit, opened the bill back up, and slipped in another $100. I wrote with the provided pen ""You too!"" next to her message. My date noticed this and gave me a sideways look.

In the car I asked what she wanted to do next, and she gave me the silent treatment, just kind of sighing and looking out the window. I figured it had something to do with the tip I gave the waitress because that's when she started acting like that. I asked what was wrong and she just responded by settling deeper into the seat. The next few minutes were completely silent and I just started heading towards her house.

She abruptly blurted out a bit later that I was wasting my money and she couldn't believe I was so irresponsible. I asked her what was wrong with giving $100 to our waitress for her great service, and she said that I should have spent the money elsewhere, or at least given it to a deserving charity. Again, I reiterated that I felt it wasn't a big deal, and couldn't get a decent answer out of her.

I took her home and without a word she just stepped out of my car, walked to her front door, opened the door, and walked without even turning her head back. Last night she texted me saying that I overtipped the waitress and asked how I felt about giving the waitress $100 when I haven't given her (my date) a single gift yet. I haven't responded and it is kind of keeping me up.

10,Not the A-hole,"First of all, I come from a strict (Filipino) family. I (22 F) have graduated from law school and I have a job at a law firm. I don’t live at home anymore and I currently live with my boyfriend (22 M). I have always tried to help my family whenever I can. But I’ve been accused of forgetting them and abandoning them. 

For example, my dad suggested to go on holiday to the Philippines this summer as a family. But I’ve said I can’t come because it clashes with my own plans to travel and I’ve only said then because the topic of holidays came up. I have planned to go interrailing. He got very angry and said that I’ve only thought of myself and placed more importance on my boyfriend then them. He said I should have suggested interrailing to them but it’s not like a family holiday. It’s what students and young people do. I may have been selfish here. He said that I should have told him earlier about it rather than now. But I thought what difference does it make and I haven’t completely finished my plan to travel yet but I’ve already committed to saving that date to travel. 

My mother then sent abusive texts and called me 10x wishing the worst for me and swore and disowned me. I said that I wasn’t going to answer if she was going to shout and be rude. But she said she doesn’t care and that I should answer her calls. This was during my birthday lunch yesterday which bf treated me to as today is my birthday. (No messages from them still and I didn’t expect to) 

They say that I am an asshole and I’ve never been useful. When a few days ago I applied a loan (£4K) on their behalf so they can go on the said holiday and I’ve always given them money when they need it. Like my dad I have him £250 for the car and this weekend. It just hurts as everything I do for them is always wrong. 

TLDR; parents get angry and disown me because I couldn’t go on a family as I’ve made my own plans even when I try to help them financially to go on the said holiday.

11,Asshole,"So, my 14yo daughter's hair was very damaged. This was a result of her not taking proper care of her hair. On top of that she even has lice from somewhere. 

So I had no other option but to get her hair cut short into a short pixie cut. I know it sucks and she hates it but there is nothing much I can do about that. But she's pretty depressed and not talking to any of us. My husband thinks that I should get the same haircut as my daughter got to make her feel better. I refused and they think I'm an asshole. AITA?

Edit: Some of you assume that I dragged her to a salon or something. No. She agreed to this. Her hair was very damaged. And damaged hair doesn't look good. She told me that she's just mad because it doesn't look that good. She got a wig too. This is not some punishment or anything along those lines.",116,92,0.84

13,Not the A-hole,"So I have a group of friends (around 9 of us in total) that I hang out with a lot. I was introduced to them by a really close friend(J) when I switched schools. It wasn't frosty and we had some good laughs and chats but I have felt like an extra wheel at times. 

So the situation that brought me here is that X planned an outing for the whole group and they all went out and had a great time, and I was woefully ignorant of it all. So cut to a few days after the outing and we're all chilling together and they bring up their outing. I'm confused because I don't know what's going on so I just bit my tongue and kept silent. Afterwards, J pulled me aside and said he didn't know I hadn't been invited because X and Z told him I had been but I'd declined. They told I was busy with things coz my folks are getting a divorce and I couldn't make it so J just didn't press it. 


I didn't say anything because nobody had even asked me to come yet, and then a day later I heard about a concert they're all planning to go to. Cool. But here's the thing. When tickets came out for this concert I was the one who brought it up and said we should go. They call said it wasn't a good idea on our group chat and left it at that. So I didn't buy a ticket coz I didn't want to go to a concert on my own and my boyfriend had plans that weekend when I asked him. They're a favourite band of mine so I had really wanted to go with some company. Now I learned that my friends got tickets and didn't tell me so I'm left out again. So X and Z and P are saying that they changed their minds and brought it up again but I said I didn't want to come so it's not fair for me to be upset now. This convo they're talking about never happened. And J pulled me aside to give me another I didn't know talk but I was like really because how come you have a ticket? 

So we'd been planning a gaming session at my house this coming weekend and I cancelled because I just feel upset and used, and I decided I'd rather have a gaming session with my brother and my boyfriend instead. But after I cancelled with friend group they started making me feel like shit and saying I'm petty and can't complain about being left out if I'm leaving them out of something as well. And now I'm conflicted because they're my friends and I'm upset but maybe I'm overreacting by not having them over this weekend? J said I'm behaving like a prat and that stung a bit because we've been friends since the sandbox.

I'm a 17 year old male living in Canada and both of my parents are antivaxxers. My aunt and uncle are also anti-vax and my situation took place earlier today because it became a large topic at my family dinner. My grandparents are provax because they've lived through polio and know firsthand how bad it is, so they helped my Little brother and I try to argue it into my mom and my aunt. 

My aunt doesn't believe that vaccines cause autism but she believes they cause allergies and asthma. Is that really worse than measles? Really? Anyways, that didn't work. I am vaccinated, my Little brother is vaccinated, because in Canada, at 15, you can choose to make your own medical choices. My two little sisters are not, because they aren't old enough to make that choice yet.

About 4 hours away from my house, there is a measles outbreak. This scares the shit out of me because one of my Little sisters is immunocompromised. Which is one of the main reasons why my mom chooses not to vaccinate. I know, completely counter productive and really fucking stupid.

 I'm trying to convince my mom to get my sisters vaccinated against measles. When I found directly talking to her was ineffective, I thought that talking to my sisters might help. Like, if they thought that they were in danger, my mom might vaccinate, for their peace of mind. I showed them a picture of a child with measles and said ""this kid might die"" and 'mom could vaccinate you and protect you but we have to convince her"", but she's already convinced them that vaccines are bad. I will break that, trust me. They told her and my mom is now furious and told me ""I'm really starting to piss her off"" and ""when [I] reproduce I can choose to vaccinate my kids"". She also told me that it wasn't fair to ""harass"" such a young, immature age group. I'm naturally very argumentative, so I responded quickly and told her ""I tried to 'harass' you about it but I guess you're too immature"".

 I have no doubt in my mind that vaccines are incredibly helpful, but am I the asshole for showing pictures of measles victims to my 9 year old little sister?",115,199,0.98

18,Not the A-hole,"To start, I married into a large Mexican family and I am the only caucasian and American born woman in this entire family. My husband's family only speak Spanish, which I am not fluent in or even close. I try to communicate with them all but I can only speak very simple sentences and I don't understand most of what is being said to me. Belive me when I say I try to learn the language but it has been super hard for me to do so. Most of the family stop speaking to me once they realize I can't understand the language and with that I cease to exist. My husband tries to include me but after a bit he gets caught up with his family and I am left to myself, usually in a corner on my phone. Eating is a big part of getting together and and I try to include myself in the preparation but I am always cast to the side because I am a ""gringa"" and some how that means I am unable to cook anything. Tonight dinner has been prepared and as usual I have been left out, I am used to it so I just stayed out of the way. Time had come to eat and the table isn't large enough for everyone, seriously there is one chair and spot short, which means I am left out from eating. I was asked to wait until everyone was done and then I could eat. All the other wives are sitting with their husbands eating, talking and having a great family time. I am near tears, so I just got up and walked out and am now sitting in my car. I have refused to go back into the house to wait for my ""turn"" to eat, when my husband came out to get me. AITA for refusing to wait my turn to eat? Even though I'm sure everyone is wondering why I left and refuse to go back in.

He's always been what people refer to as 'heavy set' but he's nowhere near obese, not even close-still he thinks he is because teenagers are dicks.

Recently however, he has quit eating. Like straight up, stopped eating, considering he used to eat a lot on a daily basis his body isn't handling it well:
•his arms and legs are in ridiculous pain
•he stumbles and occasionally falls
•light-headed with many headaches
•fucked up/blacked out vision

A lot of issues and he keeps bringing it up saying that 'it hurts' and 'eating isn't a necessity' and I can obviously tell he's trying to lie to himself. I keep bringing it up and he seems to get frustrated and almost angry, (and background on me, I'm a huge pushover) so I stay quiet and try not to raise my voice and when i do he's more angry and frustrated. 

I've told him to go to the doctor and he refuses and smart-mouths me every time i bring it up, when i went to visit him I forced him to eat and he ate today saying that he would eat because it makes me happy... but later he told me he wouldn't eat tomorrow.

I kept bugging him about it and when we finally got deep into talking about it I broke down crying and so did he (sincerely), but I know he's stubborn and may revert back to not eating.

So, despite him getting mad at me am I doing the right thing? Or am I an interfering asshole?



Update: I tried my best to convince him and kept my patience, I did get him help even involving friends for support and he's eating regularly again. It was a rough start though, I bought him a lot of food but it's all worth it to see him healthy again.

He quite frequently throws stuff when he's angry, including the game controllers, and has broken other things such as kitchen utensils too. It took him over a year to replace a ladle of mine he broke, and that was with a lot of prompting and I ended up having to order it myself and he paid for it.

I waited until the next morning, and told him very clearly that he needed to either fix it or pay to replace it today. That I wasn't okay with him ignoring it, and he needed to take responsibility for his actions. 

He responded by making fun of my voice, telling me I'm an idiot for getting upset about a cheap piece of furniture (we received it for free, but it costs about $100 from Ikea), called me names, and told me I'm making a big deal out of nothing. The tone of his voice ranged between being moderately angry to laughing. 

To me it's not so much what he broke, but the fact that he broke it,  refused to deal with it, and then verbally berated me over being upset about it. If he'd just taken responsibility and fixed it or replaced it, I really wouldn't have cared. 

His solution is to throw out the drawer as he wasn't able to fix it, and is telling me he made it better by breaking it.",42,30,0.89

It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work.

I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? ",83,446,0.98
25,Everyone Sucks,"So here is the back story.  I work full time and sometimes two jobs since my wife won’t work. She says it’s too much to deal with kids and work.  She has been sick today in her defense and I am VERY aware that a stay at home mom job is extremely draining and full time as well.   

Here is where I have some frustrations.  When I was working two jobs she would get mad that I wasn’t doing the dishes or the laundry or cleaning the bathrooms when I would leave at 7 am and get home at midnight or later 6 days a week.  Also she would stress the importance of giving the kids time and attention (which I completely agree is vital).  When I get home during my normal work week (one job only now) I play with the kids, make my own dinner, and then usually do bedtime with the kids and lay in their room till they fall asleep. Then I get to anything I wanted to try and do at home that day and finally sit and watch a tv show or something in bed on the iPad (usually my wife is trying to go to sleep now so I massage her legs while I watch)

So tonight really pissed me off because she was watching tv and has been sick today.  I’m fine with taking the kids all day on days like this.  I took them to church, played all day, did laundry, and the dishes today.  While I was putting away laundry our 3 year old kept trying to get my wife’s attention while she was cuddling with our 6 year old.  She finally left the room and said “I’m going to bed”.  That never happens so I went to check on her.  She said mom won’t play with me (she said look at this and my wife was too focused on the tv. So then my daughter said “mom, I love you...” and my wife said nothing because of the tv). This pissed me off so I said to my wife that or daughter was sad since she wasn’t getting her attention and my wife shrugged her shoulders like it was no big deal.  This pissed me off so I said that she shouldn’t dare shrug her shoulders like it’s no big deal her daughter was sad.  We started to fight and she pulled the whole I play everyday with them (I don’t disagree with that. She does, but also she goes out weekly with her friends and I always make sure they give her space when I’m home.) I said that’s great but she doesn’t need to play the victim over it and recognize that the fact that a 3 year old felt the need to leave the room and be sad is a big deal.  So am I the asshole here?

26,Asshole,"Please first and foremost understand that I am not in the slightest homophobic or against gay rights or anything of the sort. My sister is lesbian and I had no problem accepting that. I have several gay friends and we treat each other no different than straight friends. 

Now today my sister and I somehow came across the discussion of what happens if my son (my wife is 20 weeks along her pregnancy with him!) turned out to be gay. Well I said to her I hope he isn’t, but if he were I would still accept him the way he is. My sister BLEW UP and accused me of bigotry and that I was “closet rejecting” her lesbianism this whole time. I tried my best to assure that is not the case and that I believe there is nothing wrong with simply hoping your child is not gay, I would just prefer if my son could have a biologic child with a wife, in the same way my wife and I are having him. The way I think about this is like if I owned a business and I hoped one day my son would take over it, now if he didn’t that’s fine I would love him all the same and he can choose any career he likes but there is nothing wrong in my eyes with having a preference for that to begin with, the same way someone can like chocolate over vanilla ice cream but no harm no foul if their son does not.

27,Everyone Sucks,"I’m not even sure where to begin here. 

Today at lunch I was out with a friend. It just so happened that my little brother was at the same restaurant (I’m 26, he’s 17 for reference) with a group of his friends. My brother is not a Trump supporter persay but he loves being a jerk to people and where we live outside Portland, the number one way to get under people’s skin is to talk about Trump. 

My brother thinks that Jussie Smollet allegedly staging the attack on himself is one of the funniest things to happen in a long time. I will save my feelings but I don’t think it’s funny no matter what happened. My brothers latest thing is saying “This is MAGA country” instead of saying hello, goodbye or thank you.  So at the restaurant  he was seated sort of fatty corner to us and every time the server would approach his table and leave he’d say “this is MAGA country.”

I heard him say it maybe 5 times and then I lost it. I got up and told him that he had to shut the fuck up or I was going to kick his ass. I sat down and he screamed at me “hey sis, this is MAGA country!” I got up and screamed in his face that I never wanted to hear those words come out of his mouth ever again and I warned him. He said it again and i just left paid my bill she left because I couldn’t take it anymore.

I’m so furious that he would do this to me but my parents are mad at me saying that me “attacking” him in a public space on encouraged him and is counter to how they are dealing with him which is to ignore him until he grows out of it. In light of what they said, am i the asshole here?",99,83,0.79
28,Not the A-hole,"I was casually seeing this girl for about 2 months. She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows:

&#x200B;

1. I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of ""don't shit where you eat"". I don't want the unnecessary drama.
2. I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. I want to date someone who likes me for me, not for the fact that I play football.

&#x200B;

I didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said ""is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?"". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?

&#x200B;

TL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?

EDIT: Just to avoid confusion, its not about the fact that she's slept around. It's specifically WHO she has slept with. I don't really care about partner count, I do care about having slept with my friends/teammates.",547,678,0.91
29,Not the A-hole,"I've had a couple of issues with accounts getting hacked, before being with current GF but she is aware that for me this has been issue, and that I reticent about sharing accounts because of this.

I originally started sharing a Netflix account with her. A few months later I suddenly get a warning that someone logged in on Netflix on another country. Worried about it, but seeing as it was from my GF's homecountry, I asked her about it and yes, she had given account access to her mother. I told her I didn't appreciate it the fact that she didn't ask me about it first, honestly if she had done so I wouldn't have had an issue with it. 

About a week later, I get another notification, same country. Took me longer to find out, but apparently her mother had given her brother the account as well. Now I was pissed, because at this point I felt like I had no control over who was using my account. She was telling me her mother didn't think anything of it, which fine, I think it's rude but let's give her the benefit of the doubt. I told my GF that if there were going to be more new login or access requests to please tell me first and I would be fine with it. It costs me nothing per month, and it's a major plus for them. 

But then this dude started to log in on different devices, and I got in about 2 weeks repeated log in notifications from Netflix (about one every 2-3 days), and every time I would ask my GF to please check with her family. Every time it was. The tipping point came when my subscription got changed, supposedly I guess because the maximum number of simultaneous devices had been reached, and her bro (according to her not knowing English) just saw some pop-up  and clicked ""OK"" to continue and watch whatever. 

I was mad at this, I felt that at the very best case scenario her brother did not give a shit about using someone else's service, not understanding that this was lent as a favor, and should be letting me or my GF know before hand when logging in or asking if he didn't know what he was doing. At the worst, I now had a bunch of unknowns using my account. 

My GF ended up getting her own Netflix account, which to me is a relief. But she still says I am a mayor asshole for making a big deal out of nothing and still gets incredibly upset when the topic comes up.

I honestly fail to see how sharing something of mine with people I have never met, but asking the to notify me on Whatsapp/FB/Skype/whatever before logging in on different devices is asking for THAT much. Especially having told my GF time and again that sharing accounts and passwords is difficult for me in general.

I ordered the pizza and the guy called me when he got to my building. He told me he was really busy and that it would help him if I came downstairs to pick it up.

I want to start off by saying I love my parents more than anything. I'm not really one to care about gifts (unless it’s something really meaningful) and would rather just spend time with my loved ones. That being said I have noticed my parents give horrible gifts (wrong sized clothes, discount bin items) They are very wealthy so it’s not that they can’t afford nice things, they just aren't the best gift givers.

I never told my parents what I wanted for Christmas before, but I did this time because I REALLY wanted some Air Pods. I saw a wrapped gift under the tree and it was the only one with my name on it (the exact shape and size of Air Pods) and I was looking forward all month to opening them! When I opened it, it turned out to be apple ear pods (normal earphones with the wire and everything). I don't know why but I got really really upset about this.

That's ok but the thing is she doesnt bother to dress them. On the weekend, they will run around in only a nappy (diaper) and nothing else. I feel so bad for these kids they will literally be in what looks like the same nappy for the whole day. I really think they are well old enough to be using the toilet and some of the other children in the street including mine ask them why they still wear nappies. It doesn't really seem to bother them though.. the only one using the toilet is the 7 year old. 

The other thing is they come inside my place without pants on and want to sit on the couch and watch tv and I feel like a arsehole coz it grosses me out these visibly wet with pee nappies and I ask them to please go home and put pants on or play outside.

Should I tell their mum to pull her head in and toilet train her kids so they stop being teased at school. I have to add there is nothing stopping them from wearing underwear and using the toilet its just their mum being lazy.
Or should I simply mind my own  business?
AITA ?

*UPDATE*

Thanks for everyone's responses and replys. In the end I decided for the sake of the kids I had to say something. Their mother was outside yesterday and I popped my head over and asked if she wanted to come over for a coffee. She did.. we started chatting and the kids came up in subject. I asked how they were going and she said fine.. I said I noticed the younger two were still in nappies and she instantly got defensive. 

Mum reckons school has already talked to her and they only wear nappies at home?! (WTF) she says has tried to toilet train but they're just not ready. I wasnt rude at all and tried to give her some tips etc she didnt want to know. Things turned ugly and she said I was being a busybody they are her children and none of my concern!! I said I understand but I cant stand by and watch them running around filthy and if shes going to have them still in nappies then she has to at least change them and put some clothes on them!! 

I dont know what happens now. I hope she takes on board what I've said. I'm not sure she will let the kids come over anymore but I'm still going to keep an eye on the situation.

40,Asshole,"This happened on my cousin's 21st birthday a couple of weeks ago, she goes to college up in Maryland and my brother and about 45 mins away in Virginia. We wanted to go out and treat her to some drinks after we got some dinner. 

So we went to a local bar restaurant to start the night and we wanted to grab some drinks, which is were the big problem started. My brother and I moved to VA about 7 years ago for college when we were 18 and got the state standard 'vertical' license for underage people which don't expire for another year, so I've never seen a reason to spend my whole day at the DMV. Additionally, before this night, we've NEVER had any issues due to the vertical license since anyone that takes a second to read can see that I'm actually well past legal drinking age. 

So we tried to grab a couple drinks at the bar, as we have now in several different areas in several states with no issue, and the bartender starts acting strangely by getting defensive by asking all 3 of us about our addresses, birthdays, etc. likely thinking they were fake (even though VA licenses are incredibly hard to fake). When we asked if there was an issue, he says ""hold on"" and takes our licenses away and goes off to talk to the manager. This was not only sketchy but I felt extremely disrespected as their customer. 

Afterward the manager comes over and is acting very defensive and very in a very aggressive manner comes over and says ""yeah, we're not going to accept these IDs since they're vertical"" when I asked why he said ""because we can't confirm you're over 21"" (again he could take 2 seconds to do some mental math) . When I asked what  he meant by this since I've gone to MD bars before without issue he said ""look we're not taking these ID's and if you aren't going to order I have to ask you to leave"" 

We obviously left since we were not going to sit there and be disrespected and have out legitimate IDs called fake by some dude too lazy to take 2 seconds to actually look at the dates. After we left, we were all understandably pissed off by this guy's attitude and we decided that since he was the manager, there was no one we could really complain to. I was pissed since he never gave us a chance to explain so I decided to get a bit of petty revenge and called the Alcohol Control Dept. and said that they were not ID'ing people and serving them, thinking at most they'd sweat him a bit with some questioning and maybe a surprise investigation. 

But we found out last week through the grapevine, that the restaurant has actually gotten caught several other times serving minors and their alc license has been permanently pulled for them.  

WITA in this scenario? The guy definitely needed a wake-up call for his shitty treatment and I feel I may have gone a bit far, but I don't really feel too bad since the manager clearly selectively applied the ID rule and clearly has no training in customer service.  ",36,33,0.72

She asked me why the water looked cloudy and I said garlic salt. Then she suddenly starts shouting and shrieking at the top of her lungs ""NO! YOU DON'T DO THAT!"" I asked her why.

45,Not the A-hole,"So this happened last year, with my now ex. But it keeps bugging me, for some reason. 
I'm a 16 year old girl, and I go to a public school in Colombia (if that's any relevant). My classroom is on the third floor, so I have to forcefully take the stairs to get to class.

So it's class day, so I normally wake up and first things first I get dressed. Shirt, socks, skirt, etc. My school's uniform also includes a kind of sports short that is skin-thight, and you have to use it under your skirt to prevent any kind of situation where your panties can be shown.
But, oh no! Mines were dirty that day, and it was too late to change into pants. So i said, i don't fricking give a heck, and just went to school with my skirt.

So, in my way there, when I was about to arrive my classroom, the wind blew and my skirt went anime tits and I think a fraction of my butt showed, but as far as I know no one was around to see. That was it, that was all that happened.

So after class I arrive home, and text my bf to see how he is. Naturally, we talk about what happened in our days. So I tell him about the skirt, and about what happened before I entered classroom. No biggie, just a qUiRkY embarassing moment, right? 

Nope, he went fucking feral on me.

He got extremely mad for something I though was so little. He first said, that how was I so stupid to with no shorts (he's from my school so he knows) and that anyone could have seen below when I was taking the stairs. He told me that the girls that went like (me) at school were sluts, asked me if i liked showing myself (???) to others, and said that I have no respect for myself, or for him. Basically he spoke to me like I was a whore.

I tried to explain myself, but he just didn't listen. I literally didn't understood anything. I thought what I did was harmless, heck, I didn't even put thought into it, i just did it. But i definetly thought that it was unfair he was mad at me, for something I didn't have control over.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole?

TL;DR: I went to school without shorts underneat my skirt, like how girl uniform is supposed to be. I told my boyfriend, and he got furious, saying that how could I go around displaying myself like that, and talked to me like I was a whore. AITA for not wearing shorts? Is he in the right to be mad? 

Edit: Guys!!! I'm sorry worded it wrong, english is not my first lenguage. My school doesn't *make* female studets wear anything under their skirts if they don't want to, it's completely optional. What I meant was, since the skirt is pretty short, you have to wear it *if* you don't want it flying in the wind, or when you bend over, etc. 
And the short skirt is not obligatory either, you can get a longer one, use pants, or just use the skin-tight shorts alone! (They're long enough to pass as sports short, but I wouldn't dare, my thighs wouldn't cooperate lol). 
I'm sorry for the misunderstood! Again, english is not my first lenguage. I'll edit the post as well. And thank you for all your kind comments :)",41,63,0.88
46,Not the A-hole,"(I’m on mobile, so I’m not sure how the formatting will be.)

My husband (28M) and I (27F) been married for three years and lived together for a few years prior to being married. We’ve always handled our finances the same way and he has never expressed any issues with our way of doing things prior to recently. 

Our finances are kept completely separate other than when we pay bills, which we split equally. Every month I add up what we owe for mortgage, electricity, gas, internet, etc., and divide it in half, then tell him how much his half is. He sends me his portion and I pay the bills. I prefer being in charge of this because I have anxiety and will worry constantly about whether or not he paid something on time, and I am also the more organized of the two of us. He’s never complained about this and I’ve even asked him if he minds me talking charge of the bills and he said he doesn’t. He’s happy to just send me the money and forget about it. He says he is still happy with this arrangement, as am I. 

Other than the bills, all of our finances are completely separate. We have separate bank accounts, we both work and both make close to the same amount, but recently I’ve begun making more than him. We could both support ourselves if we lived alone, with some left over. We aren’t rich, but it’s not like either of us is living paycheck to paycheck either. In the past, the only purchases we had to check with each other on were things that affected the other person, such as a new pet, new furniture for the main area of the house, etc., because that’s common courtesy. 

Recently he’s been wanting us to have a joint bank account where we put all our savings, and to talk with each other before making expensive purchases. When I ask him why he says he wants us to be better at saving money, and he wants to feel like we’re building a life together. He never used to care about what I spend my money on, but recently he’s begun getting annoyed when I make expensive purchases. We own our house and are not planning on having children so it’s not like there’s a joint expense we both want to save up for. 

I really don’t want to change the way we handle money. I’m better at saving than he is. He pretty much just blows his money on whatever after the bills are paid, and I put a good amount into my savings account each time I get paid. He doesn’t have any savings, I do. I don’t care what he spends his money on as long as the bills get paid, which they do, and I’m feeling annoyed that he doesn’t extend me the same courtesy anymore. It bothers me that he’s begun complaining about my expenses, even though they don’t negatively impact him at all, and I’m not comfortable with the idea of having a joint bank account since we have very different ways of handling our money. I’m happy with the way things are. He isn’t. AITA?",28,30,0.94
47,Not the A-hole,"I (17m) recently had a big fight with Dad about him forcing his religion on the entire family. I have been atheist for almost 2 years now, but I kept it a secret because both my parents are very religious. It wasn't a problem until recently when I started working part time (also a HS student).

Before I started working, I simply went to Mass since I would have the whole day to rest, go out in the afternoon, and get my schoolwork done. Now, I work weekend afternoons (I start at around 2) and mornings is when I get my schoolwork and volunteering done. I really cannot afford to lose 2 hours of my morning time, it really sets me back.

I tried to tell them respectfully that I did not wish to attend Mass anymore, but they would not listen and still force me to go. I tried so many time, every Sunday for 2 months, that they have he right to believe what they want, but so do I. But nothing worked :(

And then came this morning. I have a lot of schoolwork at the moment and I'm applying to this summer program across the country, so I have spent a lot of time on my application. I've been in the zone typing my essay for about an hour when my Dad walks into my room and tells me to get ready for Mass in 10 minutes. I tell him I don't want to go, he tells me he's not asking blah blah blah just like every Sunday. Finally he shouts at me (for the first time in our arguments, they had been somewhat civil in the past) and tells me he""ll throw away my new computer, which I bought, with my money.

I say nothing and don't move, he reaches for my laptop and I just snap. I move my computer away and just start screaming that I'm done with his BS and I how I really feel, that I haven't prayed once in 2 years and I just lose it. I then took my anger out on his beliefs. I point out the flaws, hypocrisy in the church, the molestation problem, the nonsense and homophobia and blah blah blah.

Later he comes and tells me he's expects me to apologize to him or he'll take away all my electronics and that tomorrow he's taking me to confession to ""apologize"" to God.

So AITA for what I said? Did I take things too far? Should I apologize?

Update: Thank you for all the replies, I really appreciate all the advice. I apologized to my dad for what I said and told him that I respect his beliefs, but I also expect him to respect my decision to not attend mass. As I expected, ignored what I said and told me I have to go.

So plan B: I talked with my sister earlier (who is also an atheist and also moved out when she was 18 for the same reason) and she said she can rent me a room at her place (which I can afford). So I guess I’m moving out in a few months when my 18th comes around. I also told me boss to schedule me in as many Sunday mornings as possible. 

Been a shitty day but thanks for all the support. On the bright side I didn’t have to go to mass today lol.",95,146,0.94
48,No A-holes here,"Gf and I have been together for 4 years.  We’ve talked about marriage, kids, the whole nine yards.  

Last month we had a tough conversation.  She wanted to try an open relationship for a month.  I was one of her firsts and she wanted to explore     She’s also bisexual and never acted on it and wanted to explore that as well. 

When we had this conversation I was in internal meltdown mode.   I was considering ending the relationship.   I honestly felt that this was the death of our relationship, but just a slower death than usual so maybe I should just end it quickly.  

After I had calmed down though I decided to at least try it.  I love my gf and if this is what she needed I can at least try. 

So February came around and it began.  I’m also bisexual so for the first time I downloaded grinder.  A gay dating app.   I’ve never used it before.  Right away I started getting messages.  I really didn’t want to go straight into sex at first so it took a couple days before I found someone who actually wanted to go out on a date.  

It was like a part of me was revived.  I had forgotten a huge part of myself being with my gf and having that night woke that part of me up.  I started meeting more and more people.  Men and women.   Dating in my early 20s was always so hard for me, but for some reason with these apps it just works.  

Gf wasn’t having the same experience.   She went on a couple dates, but didn’t feel a connection to any of them.  She said they made better friends.  

Gf asked me today if I just wanted to end the month now and I said no.   I could tell she didn’t like that.  I don’t want to hurt her, but I’m not ready for it to end.    ",101,494,0.96

50,Not the A-hole,"This incident happened Friday night and I’ve been thinking it over all weekend, I made an account just to ask. 

I have twins, a son and a daughter, age 16 (17 in March) My son has been dating his girlfriend for over a year now, and very rarely do I allow her to stay over at our house for a night. On the rare occasion that she does, one of them has to sleep on the couch. On school nights she can stay at our house until 10:30, on weekends I’m fine with her being there from midnight-12:30. 

My daughter recently came out as bisexual, and introduced us to her girlfriend. She asked if she could come over to the house Friday night, I said yes, but she had to leave by midnight, the same rule my sons girlfriend has to follow. 

My daughter threw a fit saying it wasn’t fair she wasn’t allowed to stay because she is also a girl. That is not my issue. I know that teens will be teens, and they will have sex. I know my husband has provided condoms to our son, and I know that his girlfriend is on birth control. My rule about when girlfriends or boyfriends have to leave has nothing to do with sex, it’s just a rule that I had to follow as a teen, and I think it’s a good rule to have. 

My daughter has not spoke to me since Friday night when I wouldn’t let her girlfriend stay the night, and I’m not sure what to feel. She thinks I’m the biggest Ahole around.

My husband wanted to know if I wanted anything from the local Chinese place. We usually get sesame chicken and white rice. So when he asked my dumb brain asked if he could get me a egg roll. He brought the food home like we always get plus my egg roll and lo mien for himself. Keep in mind he got a family large meal so I assumed it was for both of us like always because we never get anything else.

I had to breast feed our baby so I asked him if he could make me a plate. He immediately gets mad. He told me if I ate any of the food that he would get pissed. He said asked me what I wanted and I only asked for an egg roll. So I don't get to eat any of the other food since I didn't ask.

I feel like an asshole for assuming we would share the meal. I didn't think too ask since its what we always get and it was a family large meal. If he just just got a small or combo i wouldnt have asked. I am not proud of myself but I ended up crying which made him even more mad. I understand it was dumb to cry but I couldn't stop. I was looking forward to Chinese food and just having a baby hasn't put me in the best mental state.

Now he is upset with me and I feel like a jerk. There was so much food and I didn't think it would be different from any other time. He was so upset with me he couldn't even sit down and eat so now most of it is now sitting in the fridge.",288,422,0.93
54,Not the A-hole,"I love to go to raves and edm shows, I love the culture, and the openess at these events.  I will not lie or try to humble brag, but I love my body, I work out and lift 5 days a week, and I feel blessed for having some of the features I have. I get lots of compliments on my body, I love showing it off and wearing cute sexy costumes to these events.  Normally I'll wear pasties with a mesh shirt and very showy booty shorts, or cute lingere, so I am definantly one of the most underdressed ladies at these events. In the past when I had a different group Ithey had no issues with what I was wearing. Now I am in another group, and most of the guys in the group have girlfriends, which is cool. Im not a flirty person nor do I want to deal with someone trying to sleep with me when Im just trying to party and enjoy the show. I am pretty strict with how I interact with guys in relationships, and Id never dream of so much as flirting with a guy who I know is taken. 

&#x200B;

The issue is with this new group is one of the girlfriends (T) of a guy (L) in the group saw a group picture of us. According to L , T pointed out the way I was dressed was innapropriate for her boyfriend to be in close contact with, and how she doesnt feel comfortable with her boyfriend being around a girl who is basically naked and single, while being inhebriated. Her boyfriend does stare once and awhile at me and the other girls at the venue but that is none of my concern. Last week T asked me if I could dress more modestly at the next show, she said that while I look amazing she doesnt feel comfortable with L hanging out in group with a girl who is basically topless. I let T know I'd think about it but it is not my responsibility to keep her boyfriends eyes in check nor should I change for how she feels.  T told me that she just wants to be the prettiest girl in her boyfriend's eyes and its hard when she sees him looking at girls who look better then her. I feel bad how the way I dress is hurting T but I also feel like it isnt my responsibility to accomidate her and buy new clothes. T also argued that dressing in lingerie and pasties is indirectly flirting because the clothes are meant to entice, not for utility.  My group is mixed on what to do but they are very annoyed by T, and they also know I'd never flirt muchless fuck a guy in a relationship. But they seem to want the issue resolved so T stops feeling bad. 

TL;DR: Taken girl in my rave group is insecure and wants me to stop wearing sexy clothes to raves. ",93,60,0.81

56,Not the A-hole,"This is my first post. So lets just jump right into it. My sister wanted our family dog, so a few years ago ( around five) she talked to our parents and adopted him into there home. Hes always been a great little dog and a awesome friend to all of us. He is a little on the older side around 14 and he didnt do much over the last year. just lay around, played here and there but he wasn't as active as he used to be. Then last year a trend started,  she kept mentioning putting him down because he had blood coming out of his nose in little droplets ( somthing he even dis as a young dog) when he sneezed, or she would say it's to much having him and there new puppy. I told her it may just be allergies so we had him looked out and the vet confirmed he was fine and that he just needs some alergie medicine ( his sinuses were very dry) I dont quite remeber the details other then him giving a clean bill of health. After that he was back to playing and taking long naps, you know  a normal old dog routine. Cut to same season this year and we were at the same place. She ask if my parents would take him back( they are old and cant take in any more dogs as they have enough to deal with) we ourselves have 2 dogs who would not get along with him if we brought him home. She said if no one can take him she was going to put him down. I mentioned donating him to someone who could use a old support dog pretty much trying to find anything other then resulting in killing him when he still had a good quality of life. I started to look into it but the hard deadline of yesterday was set and hes gone and buried in a shallow hole in the backyard of there home. I'm hurt and kind of mad that someone could kill somthing just because they didnt want them any longer. I understand animals are just animals, but this seems wrong. Maybe it's a normal practice and I'm the odd one who is just dosent know when to let go. Either way I'm sorry to a old friend who I didnt take in sooner and gave him a place to spend the rest of his days. I should have taken the threat more seriously. Right now I dont want to even speak to them any more. I have so much other stuff they have done that I find selfish but this one cuts kind of deep.

EDIT: I just wanted to add the deadline was a time she had set. It was not mentioned to anyone ( I did find out the day before from my parents)

57,Not the A-hole,"I'm M25, she's F26 and we've been together for 3.5 years now. I am brown and she's white to give more context. Since I moved out at 23, and into my own place I've been giving my parents around 1k-1.25k a month to help them out. They need the money and I make around 150k a year so I can afford it. Sometimes I give them more depending on situations etc. My gf hates this and always tells me to cut them off and that they're problems shouldn't be mine and how they're bleeding me dry. But my parents need the money for their mortgage, bills etc and they're in their late 50's to 60's now so they can't just supplement their income like that. I told her its a cultural thing and that I being a South Asian son have a duty to take care of my parents, which I truly believe I do. My parents raised me from nothing and I've always wanted to be where I am now in life to help them out and make their lives better. 

Last week my gf and I were talking about this again and about marriage etc, she brings up the fact that I need to stop helping out my parents so we can save more for a house and a wedding, vacations etc. I told her that I can't do that because my parents don't earn a lot and need the money. She got really mad and we argued about how they're ""toxic"" and how her parents never have and never would ask her for money and that I've been giving money to my parents since I was 16. I just told her white people are different and her parents are wealthy so they never knew and she doesn't know what the struggle is like. She basically ended the convo saying its either them or her and on Friday after a few days of hard thinking I broke up with her and told her why. 

She was super mad/sad calling me all sorts of names and that no girl would sit by and watch me waste my money like that. Called me an asshole mama's boy etc etc and it was really sad for me too. I love her but I love my parents more and I can't stop supporting them.

58,Not the A-hole,"My gf keeps telling her friends everything about our relationship.   I had thought there were some limits to this, but word got back to me from my friend who is dating one of her friends that my gf was mocking me about a really embarrassing sexual incident that happened.  

I was so humiliated.  We have the same group of friends so I have to see these people a lot.  I talked to my gf about it, but she really didn’t see what the big deal was.   She told me that all women do this, it’s just how they relate to one another.   I told her I didn’t care about all women, I wanted our private stuff, especially sexual stuff, to just be between the two of us.  She still argued that I was overreacting, but agreed to keep the sexual stuff out of conversations.  

Fast forward to about two hours ago.   I’m talking to my friend about a minor issue he’s having with his gf.  I kept telling him that all he needed to do was just set firm boundaries with her like I did with mine and he gets quiet and starts acting uncomfortable.   


I pressed him a little bit about what’s wrong and he tells me that he promised not to say anything and I couldn’t say that I heard it from him, but my gf never stopped making jokes and talking about our sex life.   She just told them that I freaked out about it and just swore them to secrecy, but her friend told her bf, my friend.  

This is all so high school drama I know, but I really feel like the problem is my gf doesn’t empathize and maybe a dose of embarrassment for her could make her see how all this makes me feel.   I have no shortage of embarrassing stories about her.  ",34,72,0.94
59,Not the A-hole,"Sorry for vague title, I'll try to explain. 

I argued back to my dad about a rule he has that I don't like. I didn't yell at him or anything but he definitely didn't appreciate me arguing back. I'm wondering if his rule is actually pretty reasonable and I was being a lil bitch by arguing back, or not...

I'm a 19 year old girl and my dad has always had the rule that whenever I see a friend outside of home I have to give him the friends name and telephone number, or I can't go out. I guess this is pretty normal. But I'm 19 now, technically an adult, and I feel really uncomfortable asking my friends if I can give their phone number to my dad... The reason I ask is because it has happened that he calls them, if I'm not picking up. (I almost always pick up my phone, except for the rare occasion when I didn't hear) My friends are 19-22 years old and find it weird if my dad calls them to ask about me or even just feel uncomfortable if my dad has their number. These are people from my new school that I hang out with but they're not THAT close to me yet. 

I guess it's a safety thing. But I hate this rule and I wish I could see friends without giving him their number. I tried to tell him the reason I didn't want to do it but he said that I couldn't go out unless I did it and that it was absolutely necessary.

61,Not the A-hole,"Recently I broke up with my girlfriend of about 4 months. I took her on a walk because we live fairly close together and she wanted to see me and walk the dog. I planned on ending it on her porch where she could just go inside, and I would know she was home safe, but when we got closer she saw her mom was outside smoking and she just turned around.

So we walk back further up the block and we sit down. I start explaining how I only have a three months or so before I have to leave because I’m enlisting in the Marines and she’s a year younger than me and on a completely separate path. I explained how we are delaying the inevitable and that we needed to break up. She starts freaking out. 

Her voice gets high pitched and nasally and she starts talking really fast. She seemed to not even think that it was even a possibility of we would end things. She starts talking about how “Oh, during WWII the men would leave and the women would stay behind and wait” and all this stuff. She wanted to do long distance and I just can’t. I explained I don’t do long distance because of trust issues I have since ex #1. She interrupts me and says “but you know I’m not like her” and all sorts of things. Anyways, I keep my ground and I’m still kind to her when we break up. 

This is where things get messy.

So anyways, we get past the hard things and I ask if I can walk her and her dog home to make sure she’s okay. She said no, but I waited and let bad because she was still crying. She kept saying “I don’t understand why it has to be now” and such. I continued to keep my ground and be firm so that I wouldn’t be pressured into continuing the relationship. I ask again, and she starts throwing a tantrum. I stood up and literally begged her to let me walk her home. I said “it’s cold, your dog is shivering, please let me walk you home” and she got really upset and literally said “I’M NOT COLD. No, I’m not getting up, I’m not moving. I’m not leaving this spot.”

So after asking her multiple times and getting the same answer, I told her goodbye, “text me when you get home so I know you’re safe,”and walked home. Then I went to hang with some buddies who knew I was ending things. She ended up texting me later and told me she got home. I said “I’m glad to hear you’re home safe” and she said “it’s only because my dog was cold.” I told her I was sorry. 

The next day I was gone from school for medical reasons. Anyways, while I was gone she would ask my friends about how I was doing etc, they would say good, he’s waiting for this stuff etc, and she would say “Well that’s good because his ass left me in the cold for 40 minutes.” 

I felt like I did everything I could in the situation except physically pick her up and carry her which would have been completely inappropriate given the context.

62,Asshole,"**Note:** Due to having Aspergers, I'm not good at social context.

First some back story. I went out with someone for around 3 years. Relationship was amazing for the first 2 years but became began to become toxic when they began to withhold affection, sometimes blanking to me whenever together. This also went to the point of them showing me their Facebook/Phone password in an attempt to find out mine to their own admission. It became worse overtime as they began to start talking more and more about another person rather obsessively, to the point I was suspicious that something more may have been happening. I found out that my ex had cheated on me with this person, however to find out this information I needed to access their Facebook account without them knowing and see a private message they had with someone, confirming to me that they had cheated. I wouldn’t normally have done this, however after months of not knowing, the anxiety of this overwhelmed me and caused me to do so. This broke my heart, causing me to lose any trust I had in them. However, due to the way I found this out, I couldn’t admit to knowing they had cheated on me as I would have needed to have said how I found this out. Due to this, I held my tongue on the matter and they broke up with me a month later.

After all of that, with the anxiety of not knowing if our relationship was going to last for months on end, making it the only thought I had in my mind for months and realising how controlling and manipulative this person actually was afterwards, it left me very distrusting of people and made me numb emotionally and romantically for over a year. Now whenever I think of this person or see a photo of them, I get very anxious and angry at the emotional roller coaster they had put me though and do not want to associate with them ever again. 

In the present, was at a meeting in a pub for a society I’m a part of, which I’m on the committee for. Great night until I noticed that my ex came along, to which was the first time I had saw them since we had broken up. A friend of mine took me outside since they said I looked anxious when my ex came in and wanted to know what was up. From telling them why, they said I should talk to the President (one of my best friends) and see what can be done. Messaged them later to ask if we could prevent my ex from coming to meet ups due to the rather bad history I have had with them (there are more things that had happened, but omitted due to word limit). They replied in surprise saying that they didn’t want to since they haven’t broken any rules at the society, to which I said that with them around I don’t feel I would be able to perform my duties for the society with them present.

TLDR: Was in relationship, suspicious of cheating, accessed their fb, I was right, left devastated and emotionally numb for over a year, they come to society meet-up, I leave due to their presence, try to ban from society, president rejects due to not breaking rules

63,Everyone Sucks,"So for some background information: I have a dog, a short haired german pointer. He's the sweetest, but kind of hyperactive around other dogs. And that plus being really really strong doesn't make my life easy. Our family loves him so much, he s part of it. Especially my mom who spends most of the time with him because we re 
busy with school, uni or work. 

Anyway, two days ago my brother wanted to go for a walk with him but somehow lost his collar and couldn't attach the leash to anything. He also somehow improvised and before he left me and my mom told him hundreds of times that he will break it or run if he'll see other dogs.

Of course, because of his stubbornness, he decided to ignore us.

After one hour he came back desperate, balling his eyes out. We couldn't understand a word because he was crying and screaming at the same time. Told us that our dog run away and because he's black and fast, my brother couldn't keep up or see him.
Me and my dad went to search for him, while my brother and my mom called our neighbors to see if he stopped at their house (they re very friendly and kind to him).
Couldn't find him so we came back home just to see my mom screaming at my brother. After maybe 10 min of screaming, I got sick of it and told her to stop. Nothing. Again, nothing. I started yelling at her because she was about to hit him and say the same shit over and over again, hurting her lungs at how loud she was.

I never yell at my mom, never. She was shocked, honestly I think she gave me a murderous look after she left. But when a person loves a dog as much you do, the worst thing you can do is to blame them. Believe me, he did fucking hate himself after that.

But my doggo came back, with some rope around his neck, a sign that someone tried to take him. Sorry, not with this bull. My mom is really mad at me but I don't feel the need to apologize.

I even talked to the girl who he supposedly cheated with (after getting the ok from her friends), and she confirmed it as well. This all came to a head when one of my friends told me that she had walked in on him with her roommate the other night.

65,Asshole,"So this month I was flying across the country on a long 5 hour flight, which I had booked and seats selected for. I specifically chose an aisle seat in a row of two, so no middle seat — just the aisle and window. 

Well, a very obese man boards and I can tell instantly he is going to have a tough time fitting in any of the seats. I assume maybe he bought two hence why he’s even attempting to board. I’m mentally crossing my fingers he’s not next to me, but sure enough he ends up pointing to the window seat next to me to let him in. 

I get up and let him in politely, wanting to at least give him a chance. Well, he sits down and is easily seeping into about 1/3 of my seat. I sit down and am pressed up against him, making me uncomfortable. After a minute, I decided to be upfront and tell him:

“Sir, I’m sorry but this situation is not working for me, you’re taking up quite a bit of my seat”. 

He wasn’t rude, but sort of gave me a shrug as if there’s not nothing he can do — although he did sort of tighten his arms in to try and be narrower. It just wasn’t enough, though. He still was overhanging over the armrest about 1/4th into my seat even when squeezing his arms in. I’m talking about fully hanging over the armrest into my seat. 

I end up stopping a flight attendant and ask her what can be done about the situation. She instantly tells him that he is likely going to need to purchase another seat. She goes to the front and comes back saying that there aren’t any open seats on this flight, so there wasn’t a way to move people so he could have two. This causes a very awkward silence. 

The guy seemed embarrassed and didn’t want to get up. He mentioned how he can’t wait for a later flight. I felt bad for him but I was also thinking about my own comfort on the long flight — the comfort I paid for. The flight attendant tells him that unless someone on the flight agrees to let him take up part of their seat, he’ll need to book another flight. The guy seems really flustered by this ultimatum, and here’s where I made my offer. 

I told the guy, “Look, I’ll put up with this if you give me $150 — that’s half the cost of this flight and that would compensate me enough for the circumstances.”

He instantly agrees, pulls out cash and pays me. He even told me he appreciated it. 

Well the people sitting behind me (who keep in mind didn’t volunteer to sit by him) were making under their breath comments about me being an asshole for doing that. I just ignored them and put the cash in my wallet. 

From my perspective, I gave the guy a valid option to stay on the flight and I was compensated for literally having only 75% of my seat max (let alone the feeling of a person’s body pressed against you involuntarily). A win-win. He wasn’t angry at all, if anything he seemed quite relieved we could work it out privately.

My two sisters (early 30s), my three aunts (two who are my mother's sisters and one married in to the family and married my aunt), and they have an assortment of close friends of the family all of which are women that also go to these events. 


About 3 years ago, my mother had an idea to do a 'girls only' weekend. Originally this was to see one of the Magic Mike movies, and because it was such a hit they started to do these weekend outings once or twice a month. Originally it didn't bother me, because I'm an adult and I have my own life, and my own house, and I really didn't even think about it. But an incident recently made me annoyed at the whole concept. My aunt's birthday was in January and normally we go to her favorite restaurant for her birthday, which also incidentally is my favorite restaurant. So I bought her a present and a card, and waited for an invitation and none came. 


When I asked what was going on for her birthday, I was told they celebrated it early on their girls day because she was going to be out of state during her birthday. This kind of irked me because when I mentioned I bought her a present my mother told me to just drive over to her house and give it to her. I felt pretty left out since I am the only male in my immediately family, having a 'girls day' is the equivalent to saying 'hey let's celebrate my birthday but not invite him'. 


I griped about and was told that I was basically being self centered and that she can celebrate her birthday however she wants. I agree with that, but once again, I'm the only one being left out and it feels shitty. The proverbial straw that broke the camel's back was I was just also just informed that they were planning a summer vacation this year as 'girls only' too, and when I asked my mother what about the vacation we normally take as a family, she told me that they can't afford to do both so they are just doing the girls only vacation this year. 

At this point I was VERY annoyed and had a loud argument with my mother and sister, telling them that it's really shitty that twice a month they have group activities and specifically exclude me, and on top of that are now even taking vacations and excluding me. Nothing came of the argument and they wouldn't budge, so I decided I needed a break from my immediate family because they don't consider my feelings relevant. So I removed myself from the family group chat and deactivated my Facebook. Now my phone is being blown up and I'm being told that I'm immature and I need to grow up. I responded that a lot of grown people don't see much of their family at all and I'm just going to follow that example.

67,Everyone Sucks,"Hi all,

So this has been eating away at my conscience for years and this happened about 10 years ago when I was 8. My mom was living with my stepdad  and we lived in Arizona. A year before that, my stepdad sent us away to my grandma's house for no reason at all, but my mom saw some dating sites in his cousin's computer history, so she accused him of ""cheating"" on her with girls on the internet. Well, the next year my mom and I went on a little ""trip"" to Mississippi because that's where we were originally from. Well, my mom completely lied to my stepdad about what happened when we got there. About a month prior to us going to MS my mom met this guy on Myspace named ""Mike"" but my mom wanted to keep him a secret so made me refer to Mike as ""him"". When we got to MS she sold her engagement ring to a pawn shop and then we went to Mike's place and I honestly thought he was gonna be my new dad. Mike and my mom would spend most of the day in the bedroom doing god knows what in there while I would be in the living room playing Tony Hawk's American wasteland all day. Well, it didn't work out the way mom thought and we ended up going back to my stepdad. She completely lied to him and even said she ""lost"" the ring and was with her friend over there and he actually believes it still. Now, I would let this stay buried, but almost ANY time they get into some sort of argument (usually my mom screaming at my stepdad while he tries his best to ignore her) she ALWAYS mentions how he ""cheated"" on her because of the online stuff and she still has NEVER told him the truth. It really boils my blood and I don't know what to do

EDIT: It seems like the best thing to do is wait till I'm financially stable then confront her then him if it doesn't work out. Thanks for all your support.",91,434,0.97
68,No A-holes here,"This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. I’m feeling like a big asshole and you’ll see why below. I’m afraid to talk to anyone because I don’t know what the right thing to do is here. 

The background to this story is that I moved in with a roommate, let’s call her Hannah, in August. We didn’t know each other before but got closer as one does when living together. Hannah was an artist, funny and we got on super well. She passed away just before new year’s in a bike accident. This was very hard for me, but nowhere as hard as it was for her family and friends. Her boyfriend Jake in particular was devastated. 

A few days after Hannah’s funeral, Jake asked for her keys to get some of her belongings. I was at work that day but when I got home that night, he was a sobbing mess. I don’t know Jake well, but he was crying in my roommates’ room, so of course I tried to help. Jake asked if he could stay the night because he could not handle going home now. 

Over the next couple of weeks, Jake sometimes stayed in Hannah’s room which I did not mind. I don’t know what it’s like to lose your partner but losing a roommate hurt so much already, so I can’t imagine what it’s like for Jake. Sometimes other friends of Hannah and her mom would come too. As her heir, her mother offered to pay Hannah’s part of her rent until they felt ready to deal with all of Hannah’s belongings. I told them to take as much time as they need. 

After that, Jake stayed over almost every night. But it started to change from him trying to be close to Hannah to him kind of living here. He would sometimes cook in middle of the night or watch movies without headphones, which would wake me up. As I was on semester break and was only working part-time, so I didn’t say anything about it. For context, Jake is a freelance producer and doesn’t have standard office hours. 

They have started to empty out her room about two weeks ago, and I’ve decided to stay out of it because it’s part of their grieving and I didn’t want to disturb. Now, the room is empty except for her bed and her piano. 

On Monday, my semester started again. I told Jake about this, that I would have to wake up early again and that I’d try to not wake him up. He promised to be quiet at night too but hasn’t. 

Additionally, with the third rent coming up, apparently Hannah’s mom is unable to pay for it. Like for most people, having to pay for another place must be expensive for her. The landlord has been amazing and simply put the rent contract on my name in January. But this means that I’ll have to come up with the rent money from now on and this is a big burden for me as well. This is why I’m considering looking for a new roommate. 

It’s Sunday afternoon, I’m sitting in my room while Jake is in the kitchen making lunch for himself. And I’m asking strangers on the internet if I would be the asshole if telling Jake about wanting to find a new roommate and asking him to go back to his apartment.",44,118,0.9

70,Asshole,"For context, my sister lives with me. It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?",160,472,0.92
71,Not the A-hole,"Okay so this was a while ago but I just discovered this sub and had a rather long discussion with a friend of mine about it:

I  was sitting on a train in one of those seating groups with 2 pairs of chairs facing each other. Of those four seats 3 were occupied.

PIC for reference: [https://imgur.com/MBbJr8G](https://imgur.com/MBbJr8G) (I was sitting on the red seat,  empty seat is marked green, other two are occupied by innocent bystanders).

&#x200B;

I am a tall guy and these seats are notoriously uncomfortable for tall people, ESPECIALLY the one at the window, because of these little trash cans that always get in the way of my knees and make my legs cramp because I have to sit in a weird way. So I always sit corridor side to have a bit of legroom.

&#x200B;

We make a stop at a train station and many people enter. Because it was a busy time of day the last remaining free seat was the one on my right.

&#x200B;

These two women aged around 40 come by, carrying a bit of luggage and one asks me if I can scoot over to the window so she can sit down. I say to her that I would really prefer to not sit at the window because it is really uncomfortable for me because of said trashcan, to which she answers that she wont squeeze through to sit there and that she has luggage that wont fit. I then tell her that I will hold her luggage for her so that she can sit there but that I wont scoot over.

Now at this point she is giving me ""the stare"" and mutters something to her friend like WTF is this piece of shit doing.

I however have somehow decided that I will not back down on this and that her need to not squeeze through is not bigger than my need to not sit uncomfortably for the next 20 minutes. Also these women were not frail or elderly at all and quite small so I was under the impression that it would be no problem for her to take the empty seat.

&#x200B;

Over the next 5 minutes this women then proceeds to mutter to her friend and give me the looks, until I decide to repeat my offer that she can sit in the corner and I will hold her baggage. She angrily agrees and sits down. For the next 15 minutes this women continues muttering and telling me outright that I am a dick for not scooting over but at this point I am not listening to her anymore and just sit there reading shit on my smartphone. Which is about when she gets up and leaves the train with her friend (about 3 stations later I guess).

&#x200B;

So, AITA or not? Did I make a scene for nothing and she was in the right? I don't know why but I find myself thinking about this situation a lot.",77,258,0.97
72,No A-holes here,"My girlfriend and I met a year and a half ago through a dating app and at he time she joked that I had just made the cutoff in regards to what she is looking for in height since she set 6’0” as her minimum and I happen to be 6’1”. She also happens to be fairly tall (5’10”). 

Since we have been dating she would periodically say how she wishes that the height difference between us was larger because she feels that because of her height and stature that she doesn’t feel womanly enough when standing next to me. She does has self esteem issues that relate to how she thinks she is perceived because of her height/weight. I always tell her how much I love her and how beautiful she is which is absolutely true in my eyes.

Flash forward to last night where we are hanging out at a bar and she is sitting down and I am standing up next to her. The stool she is sitting on is fairly low so her head is probably about 5’5”-ish from the floor. She jokes that she wishes that she was that y’all compared to me. I then proceed to ask her the hypothetical question of “If I were to magically become 5’5” tomorrow would you still date me?”. She responds with “I don’t think it would work out.”

I got a bit upset since I thought that at this point in the relationship that regardless of the fact that we now live together and I treat her with kindness and love that it isn’t enough if I were to suddenly become shorter (in this hypothetical line of questioning). I know that she has issues on her self esteem but I always try to make her feel better and make her feel like the beautiful woman she is. She said that if I were to be shorter that she would feel “like a big gargantuan person and not feel like the woman in the relationship”. 

I think her answer also hurt me because I took it as “in the end of the day no matter if I give her the most amount of love or care in the world my height will always be the underlying factor of what keeps the relationship afloat”. I also have some self esteem issues where I wonder if I am good enough for anyone. Since me started dating I’ve been so happy knowing that someone actually does care for me but now it stings knowing that my height is a fairly large contributor to that. 

We went to bed that night where she could tell that I was a bit upset over the situation and as a result was making her a bit emotional about the situation. I hate seeing her sad in any way but I too was feeling sad about it. I ended the night by saying “Well hopefully you don’t meet anyone taller than me because I may be replaced”.

AITA for being a upset that my girlfriend holds my height above everything else about me as a critical trait to our relationship?

Edit #1: So obviously it is a silly hypothetical that doesn’t affect the current relationship at all. I think that I took issue with the fact that the answer to the hypothetical revealed to me her priorities of what she values in me and was hurt about that. It is perfectly ok for people to have preferences of what they are attracted to. I felt that after 18 months of dating that she would see my personality and who I am as a person to be above all else.

I appreciate all the responses. Definitely gives me different perspectives on the situation.",142,196,0.94

74,Not the A-hole,"All happened 2 days ago I was in this bar with a couple of friends for a drink night, we were given a table right in front of the bartender and since we do that a lot and I know my tastes when the menù arrives I didn't even bother looking at it knowing what cocktail I wanted, my friends took 2 spritz and a ""japan iced tea"" while I took an italian iced tea.

This said while we were chatting I saw the bartender brewing mixing a couple of orange cocktail and a green one probably being the ones my friends took, but the last one was a bit odd, whenever i take the Italian Iced Tea I expect the bartender to lenghten it with Sprite but he was putting Coca Cola in my drink, at first I thought that this was for another table since spritz are common and a green cocktail could be anything, but the waiter came right to our table to give us the cocktail, a bit reluctant but I accept to drink the cocktail thinking I should know better next time and read the menù because every bar can make their own little twists on cocktails and could've put Coca Cola in it.

Second cocktail round came in and this time I checked the menù, and there was written Sprite in there. Maybe the bartender made a simple mistake, it happens but I do want that cocktail so I ordered again hoping that this time was right, the waiter takes the orders and the menù back and we kept chatting, I said joking to my friends that if there's coke again in my cocktail I'll send it back.

FF to when the bartender was making our cocktails again and here it is, he is pouring coke in my drink, again, so when the waiter comes in I gently ask to change my cocktail since it is not properly done, so the waiter goes speaking to the bartender which replies that he does cocktails like they are written in the menù if I wanted my own twist I should've said it earlier.

Since I don't want to make too much of a scene I said that most probably I was wrong and didn't read the menù carefully enough (but I was 101% sure I read it carefully) so I said that I'll accept my cocktail like it is, if in the menù there's coke and not sprite, so I'll ask for another menù since the waiter took ours earlier when he took the orders to double check. And Yes I was right from the beginning the cocktail is made how I said, and on the menù in that bar is written like i recalled.

In the end the waiter apologized and changed my cocktail making a little joke saying this time it will be exactly like I was supposed to receive it  and after that he offered us a round of free shots.

I felt really bad while my friends started poking at me saying the next drink will contain spit and that probably the bartender was fired (which for the record he wasn't) but after that I felt really bad, I'm no Gordon Ramsey shitting on everything unless is perfect and was actually my first time sending something back, so in the end AITA?",52,250,0.92
75,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR at the bottom. 

I am going to start this by saying since my dad died she ""forgets"" stuff all the time. My dad has been gone 6 years now. I've begged for her to go to see her Dr but she refuses.

I live an hour from my mum and I think because of this there is a lot of out of sight out of mind. 

In the weeks leading up to my Daughter's birthday everytime we spoke I would remind her that it was M's birthday on the 27th. She'd tell me she knew as it was on her calendar, that she wouldn't forget.

On her birthday nothing comes through the post. Mum actually called me on the evening. I figured she'd called to wish M happy birthday but she had called to rant about how my sister had lied to her. (my younger sister is going through a very hard time as her 8yr old daughter has incurable cancer but she still managed to wish my daughter a happy  birthday!). I eventually managed to say ""that M has had a good day today and we've just got back from tea"" which is responded with ""oh, that's nice.. I have to go now"" and before I had chance to say about her birthday, she hung up. 

Anyway, I get a phone call the next day saying she's going to post M's cards out so she can get them by the next Tuesday (This was 3 days after her birthday)
I asked her why she never asked to speak to M when I spoke to her yesterday She then starts telling me it's my fault I never said anything, That I should have put her on the phone. I would have, had I been given the chance. I kept calm and explained why I was disappointed all the while she was screaming at me. Screaming it was my fault, that she can't help being forgetful then she hangs up then refuses to answer the phone. 

I send her a message saying I wouldn't apologize for standing up for my children. All she was bothered about is that this whole situation was my fault and to not speak to her ever again because she's my mother and I shouldn't speak to her like that. 

Tuesday comes and goes and the card arrives. I give M the phone and she calls my mum. She says thank you and has a small conversation with her. When M had finished she asked my mum if she wanted to talk to me and I heard her say no and hung up. 

A month goes by and I hear nothing. One day she rings and I answer. She tries brushing the whole thing under the carpet by calling me a liar. She tells me she sent the cards out before my daughter's birthday. I sent her screen grabs of our conversation with the date stamp above showing the day after but she calls me a liar, says that I changed the date on the messages etc. She then tells me I am trying to kill her and that I won't be happy till she's dead. That couldn't be the furthest thing from the truth.

TL;DR : I reminded my mum that it was nearly my daughter's birthday, she forgot. She blames me. Calls me a liar when I show her proof. Tells me I won't be happy till she is dead and in a box.

77,Everyone Sucks,"Okay, so backstory. My friend Betty is very emotional at the best of times, and has a constant craving for physical contact that she often makes people uncomfortable to get; our group are all very comfortable with each other and enjoy platonic contact, but she takes it much too far. We've tried to explain to her that this is wrong, but she's never listened.  She also can't stand falling asleep before everyone else at sleepovers. My friend Liam and I have been flirting online very explicitly for a while, and have been waiting for some time alone to do the dirty.






Both of these friends were staying around my house, where there was only one room available for all of us due to my family. Throughout the day, me and Liam have been fooling around underneath blankets whenever we got the chance without Betty noticing, but Betty did notice that we were cuddling up a lot and got madly jealous, often muttering bitter things under her breath which we both just ignored. 




Eventually, I'm fed up of her shit, so I decide to just pretend to fall asleep while cuddling Liam so I don't have to pretend to not pick up on the hints that she wants to cuddle him instead. Liam gets what I'm doing and starts acting tired too, but Betty gets very angry and rants to him about how he knows she needs physical contact to feel safe and it's so rude of him to be cuddling me instead with everything that's going on in her life right now, etcetera. Liam is giving tired, half-assed responses. She starts crying, gathers all of her stuff, and walks straight out my door.




Me and Liam spend a good 10 minutes really wanting to fuck, but being unsure if the other feels bad about Betty. We eventually both come to the conclusion that neither of us care too much about her melodrama and we just get to it. About twenty minutes after we start, we hear the door open and throw on our clothes as fast as possible to pretend we were asleep the whole time. Betty walks in and turns the light on, walking very loudly, so me and Liam both pretend to wake up. She says that she just went to her sister's and had a panic attack, so she hopes we're happy we had a good night's rest.





Eventually she calms down and things mostly return to normal, with me and Liam texting each other cockblock memes the rest of the night.

At the end, she asked to go to here sister’s house and I said sure(I had nothing to do there, but whatever, I don’t mind).

The guy who introduced me to Sabrina (let’s call him Snoopy) was an old friend of hers, and as time went on I learned she was old friends with really about every one of Snoopy’s friends (which is important later) 

Anyway we went out tonight and had a good time as usual, talking about whatever when the subject of how we met comes up and we start talking about Snoopy and her friend group. I asked her when’s the last time they all hung out and She told me she hasn’t hung out with this guy (let’s call him Richard) in a while and the conversation ends there.

We were at Snoopy’s house where all of his (and her) friends were when it began nearing time to take her home. I left her in a room with Richard (remember him?) to talk to Snoopy and the rest of the lads to decide to take a trip to the supermarket for some snacking before I go

At this point I go back into said room to ask Sabrina if she wants to come with us to the store (it’s pretty clear in hindsight they weren’t sober but he was more drunk than she was), and she says she wants to stay. 

I say okay and we dip, and when we come back I find out they had sex while I was gone. I didn’t say anything and acted like I didn’t know but it was pretty obvious to me what had happened but I shrugged it off and waited in the car to take her home. 

We drive home and she’s really quiet the whole ride so I start suspecting she knows I know. I get to her door and she asks me what’s wrong but I don’t say anything, I mean what would you say? 
 
This is when she starts getting jumpy and desperate with her questions about what’s wrong as she realizes I know. She started to cry and tell me she was sorry and she didn’t mean to do it, that she didn’t mean to throw away her happiness, that she didn’t mean to fuck up so badly but I didn’t say anything in response other than a goodnight 

She is trying to convince me as hard as she can now over text she is sorry, that she regrets it, that she doesn’t want Richard, that she didn’t mean to throw everything away like that, that it was a stupid decision and she wishes she could fix it

Was on my first date with a woman related to my friend. Its going good, we're eating dinner, chatting when she starts playing the question game. ""Whats your favorite movie?"" , ""Whats your favorite song?"" ect.

I ask her ""Whose your favorite president?""

""Hmm. It would have to be JFK, Ben Franklin, and Obama in that order.""

""Oh, but Ben Franklin wasnt president.""

""What?""

""He wasn't president. He was a founding father though and its a mistake a lot of people make.""

""Maybe its a mistake that you made? Because I guarantee you he was.""

""No, he really wasn't im serious."" I think its still light so I laugh.

""Ok, one sec."" She smirks and reaches into her purse/wallet thing and pulls out a 100 dollar bill.

""Who does that look like to you?""

""Ben Franklin?""

""Ha, there you go!""

I now realize she thinks you need to be a president to be on dollar bill.

""You know Hamilton wasnt president and is on a bill?""

""Google it! Google it!"" She shouts in like a fed up laughing tone.

So I do and recite the Wikipedia article on how Ben Franklin was never president.

""Hmm. Ok?""

89,Not the A-hole,"So I saw reddit posts on this a while back actually. Some mom was doing something very similar and she was called an abusive parent by almost everyone. Just like some feedback for myself.

I'm a single mother with 2 kids (12F, 15M) and the older one has had some issues with video gaming and internet use which heavily affected his grades. So now I have a system where the internet is always disabled right when they get home. They leave their smartphones downstairs and they have 2 hours after school each day to finish their homework. Once they're done or if the 2 hours is up, I reactive the internet and they can do as they wish.

I thought I was being responsible with this. Before, I'd frequently find them both surfing instagram or social media while they claimed to be working on homework. Now I know they're working because they show me the work and I can at least be satisfied that some things are being completed. My younger daughter is ok with this system although my son has argued that I'm too controlling and even ""abusive"" for limiting his internet access. He says internet is basically a right for modern day adolescents and I can't restrict and isolate him just because I don't understand how important it is. But the thing is before I implemented this system he was making constant Cs in school. He played online games all night or would just chat with his friends. Now he's actually completing schoolwork.

AITA for enforcing this rule? I was surprised when I saw similar situations pop up online and people saying the mother was abusive for limiting internet. Is this really the case?",104,120,0.92

91,Not the A-hole,"So, me and my partner have been together for 10 years. We have two children together, and we have always had shared finances with a shared bank account. This is because I have been the breadwinner up until this year while she has stayed home with the kids. 

We have had lots of arguments over money, she thinks I'm too controlling because I like to budget and don't want anything spent unless it has been budgeted. (Too often mid month she would bring up some expense that she failed to mention until the last minute, leaving me having to adjust the budget, which frustrated me.)
We were using budgeting software, and once or twice a month we would sit down and try and budget together. This would usually end in an argument about me trying to control where the money went, even though I was trying my hardest to get input from her. A typical comment would be ""why are you asking me, you'll just do what you want anyway"".

Skip to now, and because our youngest has started at daycare, she has been able to get part-time work. She has set up her own account and is keeping her money there where I can't see it, and doesn't think it's reasonable for me to want it in the joint account. My thinking is that with this extra income in the monthly budget, we can pay off our debts faster, or save up for a holiday etc but we should make the decision together. She wants to save it herself in a separate account so she can see the fruits of her labor (my wording). She says she won't be selfish with it but needs it to feel better about working and missing out on seeing the kids etc.

92,Not the A-hole,"This happened about 2 months ago. I have a friend who went to get a check up at my family’s doctor office. He’s a very good family friend, practically considered to be family honestly! Well something happened at the office that made me uneasy.

After his appointment, he gets a text on his phone saying nothing but “hey”

He replies and asks who is this?

It turns out it was the nurse who took his blood and thought he was cute. They start texted and she even sends him selfies... not explicit ones. But definitely suggesting that she wanted to get with him.

This is so illegal it’s not even funny. She got his number from his medical record because she thought he was cute? He trusted me and told me everything and showed me the texts.

Because she was a single mother, my friend and I made a deal. The deal was he tells her that she needs to never do that again and he’ll just drop it. 

A week goes by and I ask him, “...did you tell her?”

He didn’t tell her. 

So I told the people in charge of the office and she was fired within 30 minutes. 

Am I in the wrong here? Can’t the office be liable for things like this? Thankfully it was my very good friend she did this to and not just an average patient!!! Does this make me an asshole?

edit: my family owns the practice. I am not jealous that she texted my friend in the slightest. mainly worried of the repercussions of her violating HIPPA and the liability the doctors office has.  ",247,405,0.93

He's recently gotten into baking, which is great, but he always wants me to have some and he doesn't always make it vegan.

I don't hate her friend, in fact, I think she's pretty nice. We we're all shopping together when we started discussing how best to build a shelf. My girlfriend was saying how they did something similar during high school and asked if I did something similar, when her friend, well aware of how my humor was, dropped the line, 

""I bet he wouldn't, he was homeless!""

Now it was obviously a joke and the way she delivered it, it made me want to laugh, but I never shared that with her. I had no idea how she knew this. Well, my girlfriend told me she had shared that with her, when she had asked ""what my story was"".

Well, the air kinda got awkward and I really couldn't do anything but kinda cringe and walk away. It just made me really uncomfortable that she had known this. After my girlfriend was done chatting she came to find me looking over some bubblegum and I explained why I was upset.

She took the stance that she didn't understand why it was a big deal. I had told others about it, why couldnt she? I explained that, yes, I had told others and yes, maybe my attitude was a joking one at the time, but I felt okay with that because I got to choose to tell them, it was up to me. When she did it, I felt like it was taking the choice away from me. I really did not want her friends to know this information as it's pretty embarrassing and shameful to me.

She responded with that her friends love me, which I do believe and that I shouldn't be ashamed, which I agree, but I feel like she wouldn't address the issue that she shared something kinda personal about me without at least telling me. I told her I wouldn't do that to her and she said she didn't care if I did.

She apologized but she's kinda cold and I can still tell she's bothered it. I love her with all my heart and I'm not worried if she'll break up with me over it since I know she loves me just as much. I'm not even mad since I didn't tell her this and I can't expect her to read my mind. What's done is done and I already got a memo page full of bad jokes and her favorite gummy snacks to make her smile again, but I just wanna know,

97,Not the A-hole,"I know the title already makes me sound selfish and ignorant, but please read through and give me different opinions and judgments. TL;DR at the bottom.

My girlfriend(17F) and I(17M) have been dating for about two years.

With that being said, about 4 months ago I was depressed and I didn't want to be in a relationship with her. We sat down and talked it over. We used to spend everyday after school together, and we decided that we would hang out on Tuesday and Thursday and I would get Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to myself and have some alone time. She cried a lot about this, saying she was scared I would use that time to cheat on her. I didn't, and I kept pushing to have some alone time. She agreed, and I enjoyed her company; however, my depression was still there so I enrolled in boxing gym to help.

Long story short, it did. I enjoyed going every day to workout and box. My gf was happy, and I was happy. Last week, my trainer told me that there was going to be some amateur boxing fights and asked if I wanted to fight. I said yes. My trainer then said that it would be better for me to go to the gym all week to train (I have never sparred with anyone or taken punches myself but I have always wanted to box with somebody).

My trainer mentioned that the fight would be in 3 weeks, and said that it would be best for me to start training immediately. I was really excited and brought the info to my girlfriend. She was excited for me too, but that changed when I told her I was going to start going to the gym all week. She broke down and said that I don't think about her at all. I tried to tell her that I would be willing to hangout after the gym on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and even hangout over the weekends, but she didn't want to do that. I also mentioned that it would only be for 3 weeks, and after that everything would go back to normal. She wouldn't listen.

This week rolls around, and Monday night she texts me and says, ""I want you to choose either boxing, or me tomorrow."" I felt sick and I didn't want to lose her, but I also really want to go box and fight. I chose to go box instead, and I later got a text saying it was over. At first I was heartbroken, but then I think that she shouldn't have given me an option, rather, understand where I was coming from. Now I am not broken, but I still question my decision.

Yesterday I get numerous texts from her friends saying that I am heartless, stupid, and a lot of other vulgar insults. I no longer have feelings for her and I am focused on my fight. Am I an asshole in this situation? What can I learn from this experience?

TL;DR - I box 3 days of the week, and spend 2 days with my girlfriend. I have a fight coming up and I want to train all week for my first fight. I tried to make a compromise with my girlfriend, but she said no and we broke up when she made me chose to either box or spending time with her.",77,119,0.93
98,Not the A-hole,"Background: Me - 34f; SO- 44m, my son- 5m; stepson- 15m. 

My SO annoys me because he’s a lot harder on my kid, who is only 5, than his own. They both do similar things because my son looks up to him, yet the 15 yr old doesn’t get in trouble for being loud, leaving his garbage everywhere, and being rude. My son gets in trouble for the smallest things, like talking to much. Everyone has seen and noticed this and I’ve brought it up to the SO, but he just shrugs it off.  He’s also really negative and acts pissy all the time but denies it. Example - he’ll open the fridge to get the milk but it’s pushed to the back of the shelf. He’ll heave a huge sigh and mutter under his breath and slam things around. But if anyone says anything, he denies it or ignores them. He does little things like this constantly. 

This afternoon, we’d all just taken naps because we got up early to see a movie - it’s cheaper that way. We were sitting in the living room and my son came out of his room to show me something he built with his legos. Stepson was sprawled all over the living room floor so my son had to step over him to get to me. In doing so, he accidentally stepped on the dog’s paw. The dog squeaked a bit. Stepson starts yelling at my kid about stepping on the dog. So I looked at stepson and said in a slightly raised voice “Stop yelling and calm the frick down.” After which my SO turns to me and growls, “You shouldn’t be talking! You’ve been in a pissy mood all weekend!” I haven’t, I’ve been in a fine mood and I’m thinking he just said that as a rebuttal for me chastising his golden child. I’m basically not allowed to chastise his son, but he’s allowed to yell at mine even though I’ve told him not to. His son broke my hand once out of irritation but I wasn’t allowed to say or do anything and I never received an apology. Try talking to him about it and he usually gets mad and turns it around on me. Every time we have an argument, he plays the victim because when I tell him the things he does that are upsetting, he says I’m calling him “evil and abusive” and it “totally changes” his view of himself. If that’s true and you see how what you’re doing is bad, then why are you still doing it? Just so irritated with all of this. When I’m told I’m doing something upsetting, I make an effort to stop doing that thing. I feel like I am putting in tons of work into this relationship and he isn’t. 

Edit: He might have thought I was crabby because he tends to make snide comments about things like dishes not being done, floor needing vacuumed, etc. So I mentioned the fact that he can do those things too. I work 60 hours a week as a nurse and he works maybe 30. ",75,87,0.94

101,Not the A-hole,"Some quick context: I am a homosexual 17 year old guy. I came out of the closet about two years ago in a pretty liberal country. Virtually everyone in my area accepted it.

When I told my classmates that I like men, noone really had a problem with it except this one guy, who was really shocked. It was the prankster of the classroom and was into football, which made him behave a tad macho. He told me that he had difficulties with me being gay, but liked me as a person so he would try to get over it. I said I respected that, we made a lot of jokes about it, we talked to eachother sometimes and untill he changed class, we had regular contact.

This valentine there was an event at our school that made it possible to buy roses for people you liked. You could send them and write a little card attached to it that said who it was from and a reason why you sent it. I send some to a few friends and decided to send one to that guy too as a prank. I wrote my name on it and a little heart.

I always used to joke with it a tad, but have told him many times that I could never be into him, so I thought it would be a good prank. He apparently didnt think so.

When I was walking past them that day, his entire friend group was staring at me. I asked (already laughing on the inside): ""Did you like the rose?""
He exclaimed ""So it was really you?!"" And I laughed loudly and walked away, signaling that it was a joke. I didnt see him again that day (school was ending at that time) and went home. The next day everybody in that clique was staring at me again. When I went away I heard someone whispering ""dirty faggot"". Some friends (who thought it was a hillarious joke) also said they heard them insulting me loudly in frond of a lot of pupils.

I honestly don't care about the insults. I have heard worse and have quite a thick skin, but it made me realise that maybe I crossed a line.

Edit: we have done way worse jokes to eachother. He has shown his bare ass and asked ""you like what you see"" and other verbal jokes that went further than this. I also joked a lot.

102,Not the A-hole,"Hi AITA,

Today we had a family lunch with myself, my parents, my fiance, and her parents. It was brought up that my godmother will be attending our wedding but her husband can't make it. My fiance and I were informed that in his place, a close friend of hers and my mother's side of the family will be coming.

Since the beginning of the planning experience, we have been adamant that no one is allowed a plus one of their choosing; anyone who has a spouse or a significant other that is known to us and who they have been dating for at least 6 months was extended an explicit invitation to bring them along. My godmother's husband was invited explicitly, but obviously this friend was not. We have been completely fair about this and have actively turned down requests that others have made for plus ones that we did not invite.

My fiance and I were both upset that my mother made this decision, and after a stressful day of moving to a new apartment and dealing with our family being around the entire time, I didn't want to ignore this and decided to nip it in the bud as soon as possible. I called my mother when I got home and told her that she needed to reach out and explain that the friend can't come.

My mother has been my rock-solid source of reasonable emotions and comfort for my whole life. The last thing I expected from her was to break down on the phone and tell me that I'm acting like an asshole, which is exactly what happened. She told me that other people in her family know this friend and are excited that they will be coming, and have emotional investment in both my godmother and her friend coming. My godmother won't come unless she can bring this friend.

I told my mother that I didn't think I should feel like an asshole for not wanting people that I don't know to be invited to our wedding without my explicit permission, and that it's unfair that we have turned others down and now this gets to be an exception. Through her tears on the phone she expressed that she couldn't bring herself to turn this friend away now, so I just ended the call by apologizing for making her cry because that wasn't what I wanted at all. I told her not to turn the friend away and to just let it be. Now she is mortified knowing that this decision upset myself and my fiance.

AITA for trying to exert some control over our wedding and the guest list? I love my mom and I hate the thought that our relationship was strained over this, but I don't want to let that be the reason that wedding decisions are made without my fiance and I having input.

TL;DR: AITA for telling my mom to call my godmother and explain that her decision to allow my godmother to bring an unknown friend in place of her husband to our wedding was uncalled for and is not approved by my fiance and I?

EDIT: Thank you to everyone for the awesome insight and perspectives on this situation. We are very close to the wedding and honestly, the more I thought and the more I read what people are saying, I just want the wedding to be as free of drama as possible. My mom and I spoke and reconciled. She understood why we were upset, and I told her that I don't want to make anything more awkward for her at this point. Especially because it would make it awkward for my fiance and I by association. No more out-of-line invitations will be given and we will proceed as it is true that this well-liked friend will be a happy addition to the wedding for many people.",31,47,0.98
103,Everyone Sucks,"First, sorry for the wall of text there’s a TL;DR  at the end 

(FYI: I personally DON’T like porn for ME, I can’t get off from it. BUT *PLEASE* I don’t mind my SO watching it, *DONT ASSUME THAT*. My dislike for porn ISNT why I’m mad.) 

So me and my SO just got into an argument where I absolutely lost my shit. 
For starters, we have had multiple fights in the past about his lack of communication / lying habits.

This fight in particular started because my SO was watching porn and masturbating, in the bed with me while I slept... I initially thought he was looking at my nudes and got turned on and we ended up having sex. Afterwards, he asks to shower. I showered last night so declined and just went back in bed after cleaning up. I was curious as to what nudes in particular he was looking at, so I opened his phone and found the porn. I was a bit sad, ngl I felt like I wasn’t good enough because I was RIGHT there and he has so many of my nudes... I was just shocked. 
When he gets back into bed I simply ask him what he was looking at.

(a little while back, I bought a dildo and wanted to start using it - his response was “what’s the difference between that dildo and another dudes dick” / “you have me, you don’t need the dildo” so I was curious to see what the fuck his excuse was for watching porn if I’m “right here” ) 

He ignores the question and just says “reddit”, then I ask “why were you touching yourself then?” And he lies to my face and says “no, I was just touching my balls I wasn’t masturbating”  (I KNOW he was masturbating, I’ve been with this dude for 3ish years..) 

After a while I keep asking and he finally admits to watching porn. I ask, “why didn’t you tell me in the first place? Why’d you lie?”and his response is “I was embarrassed.” I get it, I do, but he still lied...

I then ask him what the difference between me using a dildo and him watching porn and fantasying TO the porn: “the dildo is a physical object, porn is not.” 

I’m honestly pretty pissed he’s able to go ahead and say “no I don’t like the dildo, it’s basically cheating” and further discourage me from using it, to him just watching porn and masturbating? He also said that it was a “substitute” for having sex with me?! But, I can’t have one?! 

I brought that up and he said “Nono I never said you COULDN’T use it, I said I didn’t like it” (oh yeah, so telling me it’s basically cheating is really going to make me feel great about using the dildo).

I generally wouldn’t care if he watched porn IF he wouldn’t put me down for using a dildo?? Is it just me, or is he a hypocrite?

Sorry for the long post, wanted to get as much info in here, but finally I just want to ask: Am I The Asshole here?

TD;LR : my SO hated the idea of me using a dildo, told me it was “basically cheating” because he’s “right here”,  then goes on to watch porn in our bed right next to me and expects me to be a-okay with it.

Edit: I don’t mind him watching porn, I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST IT. Yes I know I said that I personally don’t like it, but that doesn’t mean my SO can’t. I never said that. I thought I clearly said that I’m just frustrated he was treating me unfairly, PLEASE. I have NOTHING against OTHER people watching porn. ",128,140,0.93

106,Not the A-hole,"So when I graduated high school my parents made a deal with me that they would pay for 2 years of my community college with the college fund they had for me and I was on my own for the final 2 years of my bachelors degree. I agreed and thought this was definitely fair. I ended up getting a job my senior year of high school at an engineering firm doing some drafting work and decided to work there part time while attending community college to get my associates in engineering. I didn’t realize this company had tuition reimbursement until about 1 semester before I graduated with my A.S. They ended up reimbursing me for my whole entire 2 years of community college (about 10k). I decided to give this back to my parents and they were very happy as one would imagine. I then asked them if I could put this toward my final 2 years of my bachelors degree and they said no. 

This caused a lot of arguments between us because in my mind they basically didn’t have to pay for any of my college when the deal was that they would pay for 2 years for the college fund they had built up.

They are pretty well off financially. The summer of 2016 after I got my A.S. they bought a new house and since then they have been purchased 3 brand new cars just for reference.

Also another reference since I know this post might make me seem like a spoiled kid, I have spent about 35k of my own money built up from working the same part time job to pay for my final 2 years at my state university that I commute about 90 minutes 1 way to get to so I don’t have to go through student loans.

EDIT: So my hypothesis is that the people who are saying YTA are older folks/parents and the ones saying NTA are younger folks/college students. I would be interested to see if this is correct. I appreciate everyone’s opinion none the less.

The first day when I moved in, I found my room and realized that Dave had been there for an entire day before the official move in day and had taken over half of the room for all of his stuff. I didn’t say anything tho because I didn’t have much of my own stuff so it really didn’t bother me. 

Now, me and Dave got along fine, but in total silence.  At first I tried to at least exchange pleasantries, good morning, how was your day, etc, but I hardly ever got more than short one word responses so I gave up. 

At some point like halfway into the semester, the RA has to do a check of our rooms to make sure we aren’t hiding pets or drugs or anything like that. When he did ours, all he said was that my side was really messy, and admittedly it really was.  I had loose papers everywhere, there were wrappers all over my desk and receipts from fast food places everywhere but I was always really careful never to actually leave food anywhere. The RAs comments made me worry that I might be making Dave uncomfortable with my messiness so I asked him if he was bothered by it, and he said, “ Nah, it’s cool.”  So I tidied up a tad bit, but not much.

Especially in relaxed settings, I use slang and curse a little more than I should, but whatever.
I’m on the train this morning on my way to work, and these friendly-looking European tourists ask me for directions. I’m listening to music so I take out my earbuds and they ask again. I tell them what train to transfer to and they ask me to elaborate- as I answer, I notice this big dude leaning on the doors look over at us and it was pretty obvious he was listening. The tourists moved back to their seats and the big guy approaches me.
“Why you talk like that?”
I’m confused, obviously. I ask him what he’s talking about and he comes at me like
“I asked you why you talk like that, like us.”
(He was African-American.)
I’m going, whaaaaaat. I notice people are starting to look over at me and I’m still mad confused. Not by what he’s asking, but because I don’t know how to answer. 
“This is just the way I talk, man. I’m sorry if that offends you but I don’t have control over it.”
I figure that’s the end of it but he retorts, louder.
He tells me he thinks it’s fucked up that his culture is being cheapened and replicated by other races because it’s “popular”. This is 7AM in the morning and I just wanted to listen to music so I snap.
“Look, I said I’m sorry if it offends you. You’re bugging if you think I’m gonna apologize for how I talk.”  I’m kinda yelling, whatever.
We’re nowhere near my stop but I get off, cause I hate confrontation and people are staring at us.
Personally, I feel that the way I talk is not a reflection of a particular race but of how I was raised and the culture of my neighborhood. However, I also know that cultural appropriation is a legitimate issue. I’ve seen all people’s culture being mocked and appropriated and I don’t know if I’m part of the problem.

Okay so I'll give some necessary background information, I'll put an TL;DR at the bottom.

One of my friends is really rich, and the first of us to get married. We'll call her Mia from now on. In our friend group we have 'karen', now Karen has always been a bit defensive and hostile towards Mia. Not enough to have Mia notice this but enough for me to notice.

Mia never made a big deal about being rich, whenever we planned a girls night we would have dinner as places all of us could afford, but she would always cover us if needed. Her gifts for us were always personal, and it took Karen at least a year being in our friend group to discover Mia is rich.

Now upon hearing about Mia's engagement it came to no ones surprise that we would be her bridesmaids. Now I have to say I've known Mia the since high-school so I know that she has been low-key planning her wedding for years. So Mia is going all out, it will be a themed destination wedding. Now before anyone says anything about it being a destination wedding she will pay for anyone's travel expenses, she will also pay for all our custom made dresses.

Now here is the issue were I could the potential a-hole. Karen is one of the bridesmaids and I've heard through some other friends, that aren't invited to the ceremony, they are for the reception that takes place at a later date in our country so more people are able to attend. That Karen is badmouthing Mia to a lot of other friends, saying how she is unreasonable, spoiled and a b-word for wanting her dream wedding apparently. Now Mia has no idea yet, and might throw Karen out of the bridal party if she knows, Mia may be sweet but has a low tolerance for people who are nasty behind her back.

Now of course I don't want Karen to act like this to Mia, I'm not even sure why she is in our close friend group. Although I am not sure if it is my place to tell Mia about this.

So WIBTA if I tell Mia about Karen's behaviour and might get her kicked out of the bridal party.

TL;DR my friend is getting married and generous enough to pay for everything, another bridesmaid is being nasty behind her back and now I want to reveal the truth about her and might get her kicked out of the bridal party.

Edit: I'll talk to Karen first we are all going for drinks later so I get the chance to talk to her. You guys might be right it could indeed be a misunderstanding. I'll keep you guys updated on how it goes.

Update: okay so I made this post a few hours before seeing either Mia or Karen. Now I have a conclusion for the people who are interested. First off Mia knows, no I wasn't the one who told her. It was her fiancé, so apparently Karen uses her Snapchat as her personal diary and put a whole rant about Mia in her story forgetting that Mia's fiancé is friends with her on snap chat, maybe because he never sends her snaps.

So I went to the maid of honours house for girls night, where I find a crying Mia on the couch. You might ask what happened so let me tell you. Apparently Mia's question to Karen about which shade of blue she would prefer set Karen off so badly she went on a whole rant about Mia on her Snapchat story, saying about how awful she is, how the only reason she stays friends is because of a free vacation and all sorts of nasty stuff. Mia's fiancé sees this and tells Mia immediately, because who could blame him, this happened not even that long ago after I made this post. Well the Snapchat story was made in the afternoon the fiancé just saw it in the evening.

Now me, the maid of honour and the other bridesmaids were all hearing Mia out and comforting her, before Karen shows up. Now the maid of honour went off on her, which I can understand being Mia's best friend and discovering how Mia is being used. Karen now being full on thrown out of our friend group, sees this moment as an opportunity to tell us all off. Blaming Mia's fiancé and saying how he had no right to share this, because that's why you posted in on Snapchat I really don't see Karens logic in this but okay.

Now the truth is out in the open, I was fully prepared to talk to Karen first because it could have been a misunderstanding. But I didn't even got the chance to, thanks to everyone telling me to talk to Karen to make sure it weren't just nasty rumours, even though it wasn't necessary in the end I still appreciate it.

111,No A-holes here,"This is a stupid non-issue and I'm embarrassed even asking but my sister's wedding is coming up and I dont want to fuck up her photos or anything... I'm really hairy but really lazy, and some people are really grossed out by seeing a girl with really hairy legs/pits in a culture where it absolutely is not the norm. It garners way more shock than you think it would and now I'm afraid that it's not worth making people uncomfortable (or even grossed out, unfortunately). We are going to a hot beach-y place for my sisters bachelorette party and (it is probably self-centered to think this) I'm worried that it in some way will wreck it for someone or her... but again, you would be amazed at how much shit I get for it. AITA if I don't shave my legs and armpits at least for my sister's wedding/bachelorette party? Is it like a scruffy beard situation where at the very least it should be groomed?

112,Not the A-hole,"Edit:  Had the talk, it did not go well ha ha.  I just told her our money situation wasn’t working for me anymore and we needed to figure something else out.  I told her I wanted her to starting paying for her phone, the electric, and the internet.  Combined usually around $175.   

I didn’t bring up her attitude from last night, but right away she knew what that was.  She said I was being stupid, petty, a bitch, and some other things that I can’t really remember atm.  She said she wasn’t going to pay it so I told her that if she doesn’t the next time those bills come around she can find a new place to live.   More insults before she stormed out.   I haven’t heard from her since.  So I’m enjoying some jack and cokes and feeling pretty good about things for the first time since last night.  Cheers for all the support and advice.  I appreciate it.  













Gf and I live together.   She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. 

We went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she’d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn’t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. 

It was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven’t been able to get it out of my head since.   It’s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn’t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it’s time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.

113,No A-holes here,"Background: during a late night with our fussy daughter (6 weeks old) I opted to get up and feed her.  She finished about 3/4ths of a bottle of breastmilk, leaving about a quarter of an ounce in it.  We left it on the table.  2-3 hours later our daughter is peckish again and I gave her the rest of that breastmilk and then gave her a small bottle of formula until she fell back asleep.  My wife was awake for the first feeding but was asleep for the second.

That morning I mention I gave her the rest of the breastmilk bottle that she didn't finish.  My wife was upset, telling me that she could get really sick from stale milk because she had drank from the bottle a couple hours prior.

I decided to look up online if it was true.  For formula you need to throw it out after an hour, regardless if it was touched.  But for breastmilk there doesn't seem to be any issue with it being reused, at least for up to 4 hours, since breastmilk can fight against bacteria better than formula.

I sent her a link to what I had read, and the next thing I hear is a very sarcastic ""Clearly you're the better parent here, why don't you take care of her and I'll go back to work instead"" and now she'll barely talk to me and has just been livid with me all day.

114,Asshole,"So I’ve been pretty ill for the last week but today it culminated in me needed to go to see the emergency GP with acute bronchitis. 

Most of the day my boyfriend has been in and out running errands and doing jobs around the house, while I mostly just try to keep breathing on the sofa!

Around 4 hours ago, after completing the things he wanted to get done, he starting gaming on his PC. His PC is set up in our open plan living room. After an hour or so I asked if I could have some cuddle time. I have been feeling really down in the dumps, especially having to spend the warmest weekend of the year inside! 

He didn’t want to come cuddle with me because he was in the middle of a game, so I asked if he would later. He said yes. 40 minutes went by and I asked again. Same response. Another 40 minutes and I ask again. He says he doesn’t see the point because he’d be bored and it wouldn’t make me feel better anyway. He says he’s been supportive by getting my drinks and food all day, taking me to the hospital etc but all I want is a little bit of emotional support!

I know he’s been there’s for me all day physically but it’s been 4 hours and I just want a hug. On a normal Saturday night we’d cuddle and watch a film but he’s just not interested. For the record, it’s not that he doesn’t want my germs, we’ve still been sharing a bed etc, if he was going to get ill, it’s too late for that now!

I've only seen my kids' cousins once or twice in almost 10 years, since the divorce. I'm sure they're great kids and my kids love them, but I can tell their cousins feel awkward around me. I completely understand that, because we were never close enough justify keeping contact after the divorce, especially since they were young when it happened. I just don't want to spend my weekend with my kids feeling that kind of awkward tension.

116,Not the A-hole,"Okay first off, this is a throw away. Second of all, I know this sounds childish as hell but hear me out.

I recently had a major jaw surgery which has lead to me having my mouth wired shut so everything heals correctly, and I can't open my mouth at all. The day I was discharged, the nurse gave me a pack of straws that are just like normal straws, but have a very narrow bit at the end which slots through the tiny gap behind my wisdom teeth so I can slurp up my soups and smoothies and stuff.

So today I woke up around 5pm after finally getting some sleep with the help of some painkillers, grabbed some soup and went to take a straw and it was gone. The last straw in the pack was gone and I instantly start worrying because there's literally nothing else I can use to eat until my next appointment. I asked around the house and my step-brother says it was him and that he didn't think I would mind. 

I tried asking him what the fuck was he thinking, I was only given enough straws to last until my next appointment and he just starts laughing, mocking the way I talk because I can't open my mouth, all I can do is move my lips, my teeth stay clamped shut. My dad hears all of this and comes in, tells me I'm overreacting, that my appointment is on 2 days and my step-brother doesn't know any better. He's literally 2 years older than me and acts like a 6 year old, it's so frustrating.

Just some things I want to add, the packet that the straws were in were clearly labelled with mine and the hospitals name, and they clearly don't look like normal straws. My step-mum tried using a syringe, soup went everywhere.

I will say that the shitty liquid diet, lack of sleep and the terrible discomfort of this whole experience may have added to my frustration, but this incident honestly frustrated me so much that all I wanted to do was cry. I can't even stop by the dental hospital because it's not open on the weekends.

I've been thinking about it for a while now and I feel a little guilty and embarrassed about making a big fuss about a straw, but at the same time I don't care because without it, I can't eat. I'm torn.

119,Not the A-hole,"My BF (26) and I (23F) have been dating for 3 months. He Likes a lot of right-wing meme pages on Facebook (Count Dankula style stuff) and watches lots of comedic offensive YouTube videos. I can date someone with different political beliefs or humour to me as long as they aren't hateful. 

&#x200B;

I hate r\*pe and p\*dophilia jokes and asked my BF to stop making them bc of my trauma, and he mostly has. While he's toned down the offensive humour around me, he makes a lot of anti-Semitic references. We live in a place in England with a .7% Jewish population, I think he gets most of it from the internet because he references Jewish people controlling everything, which they blatantly don't. He used to enjoy spouting random Holocaust denial things to get me riled up. One time I got really upset by him doing this, I raised my voice and said if he was an actual Holocaust denier I was going to break up with him. He laughed, recorded me saying that and sent it to his friend. Later he said he's not actually a Holocaust denier. He calls taxes ""Jew taxes"", when KFC stopped delivering to him he called it a ""nosy move"", and when he's angry instead of swearing normally he'll throw around words like ""k\*ke"", ""f\*\*\*ot"" and the n-word. 

&#x200B;

One time we were drunk and I told him his offensive humour is upsetting to me and he said he wanted to unlearn it bc he accidentally fell into it. I think he started to get involved in it when his ex dumped him in Feb 2018, he had 7 months of breakdowns and drunken blackouts. When sober, I said unliking the FB pages would be a good step (he spends 4+ hours a day on FB). He said he would, I'm not sure if he did or not. Later he said ""you know I do actually care about minorities, right?"" I said I didn't, the only time he references them is when he's being mean about them. He says he'll stop being offensive, then he'll say stuff like ""I'm 26, I don't exactly see my sense of humour changing at this point"" and is proud of that stubbornness. He says I'm too sensitive, but the anti-Semitism in particular seems to come from an unironic place because of how persistent it is. I've learned to just shut down and not reply because he enjoys getting me aggravated.

I've had awful boyfriends in the past so I'm patient because I know everyone has flaws. The reason I haven't broken up with him is because he did stop making the r\*pe and p\*dophilia jokes and stopped saying the n-word so I thought he might stop the anti-Semitism too and that I'd ""unradicalised"" him or something.

Every day we drive to work together since we work fairly close to each other, this used to lead to a lot of arguments about her being late.
I wake up at 6:30 to get ready, ‘she gets up at 6:45’ but she loves the snooze button on her alarm clock. We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.
So every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.

My parents and I have never had a great relationship, I was adopted by them when I was 5, and honestly a pretty hard headed kid, so was my brother who was adopted with me (blood brother), that being said I always lied to them, did stupid kid stuff, and we fought I am not exaggerating, daily. 
 
Onto the story.
I turned 18 in January of 2018, 
On may 18th, 2018 in Santa Fe Texas, dimitrios pagourtzis brought a sawed off shotgun to school, around 7:30 ish I believe it was, a fire alarm went off, I was doing my makeup in first period, as it was the end of the year and we didn’t have much to do in class. 
Everyone thought it was a drill, until we were outside of the school, we heard a shotgun go off in the art wing. 
Everyone ran, everyone was terrified, we now knew this wasn’t a drill, and ran to the nearest safe place. 
8 students and 2 substitute teachers passed away.

Now that you have the gruesome details, here is how I decided to go about it. 
The Sunday after the shooting, I went to church as well as most of Santa Fe. I shook hands with governor greg Abbott, he asked me a question or two about school security and what we can do to improve it, and I gave him an honest answer, telling him the doors are not secure, And this is coming from someone who would have teachers cover for me to sneak out of class and go home early almost daily. 
MSNBC saw my answer with greg, and asked me to do an interview, I texted my mom after the service and she was very excited...
Then my dad heard about it 
He threatened to take my truck if I did the interview, he felt like I would ruin his business by saying something stupid, but I told him I AM doing the interview, because I NEED to inform other schools on how to make things a little safer, as in, locking doors during school hours (dimitrios came in after class had started through an unlocked door) as well as being more strict in certain things 
I did the interview, and immediately got kicked out and went to live with my boyfriend. 
I have tried apologizing but they just don’t want to hear it. My whole life its been “their way or the highway” and this time I actually had something to say that could benefit other schools.

Recently, a female joined us. She is pretty attractive and interesting, so she is often the centre of discussion since the past few months. This is all completely fine for me.

The problem started about a month after she joined us. She took a week off because of period pains and stress. Now this put us behind schedule and each of us had to work 2 hours extra to cover up for her. My boss was apparently fine with her week long breaks.

Last week, when we sat for lunch together, I asked her to give a medical certificate for suffering such intense periods because it seemed like an excuse to me. Everyone else told me to let it go and I saw her insta post talking about how some men never realise women's problems the next day. I shouted at her saying how unprofessional this was and that she is just giving excuses and expecting us to work more everyday for a week without any proof of her condition or if her periods are painful enough to take a week off.

I personally found nothing wrong with it, but I received a strict hearing from my boss.
I don't think she has given my boss any proof either. My boss just told me to respect a women's pain and become a better man. 

EDIT: I understand that I am a massive asshole, sorry and thanks a lot. I was just frustrated because she had a paid leave while we worked 25 hours more per week for only 50 dollars. She has given no proof to my boss about it.

It was unprofessional of me to shout at her during lunch, and I shall send an apology letter to her.

It also helps for me to clarify and I AM mostly getting fired, so don't you worry about it. I understand that I came from a really negative place and that women do have it really hard. I am sorry to everyone here, I thank them for making me snap out of it and suck up my misogynistic behavior. 

I shall definitely send an apology letter to her.

EDIT 2:I got fired, rightfully so. I also sent her 800 dollars, all the money I received from working extra hours during her leave. She obviously isn’t going to talk to me, but she needed the money and so hopefully it shall make it better. I am not saying this to come off as less of an asshole. I know I am a piece of shit human and a really bad, sexist moron. I just wanted to tell you that while I have not redeemed myself in anyway, she might be in a better condition now. This wasn’t to earn sympathy points or anything, I am a bad person, and what I have done isn’t redeemable. I just wanted her future to be better, I hope that she doesn’t come across an asshole like me. Women do have it infinitely harder than me and this was to take nothing away from that.

129,Everyone Sucks,"My spouse and I are at an impasse over my not wanting to share. 

Some relevant background first: we have two kids (5&2), we've been together off and on for around 7 1/2 years (mostly on). And we're smokers.

Now for the entirety of our children's lives I share my stuff with them. That's not an issue. We would order pizzas (3 because they have a deal and we like left overs) I would get one with toppings I like, spouse would get one he likes and then the other would be for the kids. I would normally eat total about half my pizza, the kids would switch between mine and there's (fine with me) and he would ear all of his some of the kids and the rest of mine... Okay sure that's fine. 

We get cases of pop and don't I've the kids any, so I expect half the case to be mine to drink as I please and the other half his. He'll blow through his (an admitted bad habit) and then start on mine. 

We'll get a pack of smokes and he'll blow through a bunch while im sleeping and then smoke the last one... Which bugs me because if I did that he'd be mad. 

So just in the last two days, we had some people over so I expected if we shared anything it would come out of both our portions. Out of a case of pop he had a bunch, his friend had a bunch and I had two cans. Annoying but okay.  Last night, his friends stopped by supposedly for a minute, he asked if I wanted to offer them some of the pizza we had delivered (showed up just before friends did) I said no because I only had a medium (pizza place screwed up the order, they're discounting our next one) and would be sharing with the kids for lunch today. I went to change the baby and get him resettled to bed and when I come back one of the friends are eating some of pizza... Later in the night when I asked spouse about it he said he offered his own and she didn't like his because of the jalapenos he gets on his so he offered mine instead..   wouldn't have been an issue except I already said no..

And then before bed we had two smokes left, one of his and one of mine. He had his, I didn't have mine, was saving it for later. I dozed a little and when I woke up went for my smoke. It was gone. First he said he didn't know it was mine and thought it was a splitter. But he didn't wake me to see if wanted to split it or ask if he could just have it. This has turned into a huge argument because I'm tired of having to share literally everything all the time. I don't get anything that's just mine. He thinks I'm being selfish.

Edited to add: we noticed in the first year things were way off balance (one person finishing everything and the other getting little to none) and we've been discussing since then over and over that things are to be split half and half.  I'm okay with sharing if it's discussed before hand. Or if it's one can or what ever. It's just after I've said no he goes ahead anyways, or if it's the last one.

132,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

Background: two weeks ago I found out my girlfriend of 5 years has been cheating on me with her much older supervisor. It is devastating because I'm getting my masters in engineering, have a job lined up at an almost Fortune 500 company, I'm in good shape and decent looking and she's been fucking the out of shape alcoholic manager at Applebee's. My self esteem is shit right now.

My friends decided to take me to a strip club last night and I was finally having a good time. I really likes one dancer and my friends bought me a couple of table dances with her. She asked if I wanted to go VIP and I told her I didn't have much money. She said don't worry about that my friends told her I was having a hard time with a break up and she just wanted to chill anyways. So we wend back to an essentially private area. She danced for me and I gave her the $100 I had but after that we just sat and talked for maybe 30 minutes and then she kissed me and we made out for maybe like 45 minutes. When she first kissed me I told her I didn't have any more money and she told me to paraphrase ""I'm a 20 year old college girl, I like to kiss cute boys."" It was an incredible experience and it felt amazing to just not think about my ex for a few hours. 

The club was closing and I asked her if I could see her again, she said she had to change and I should wait for her in the parking lot. My friends told me she was just messing with me and all left. I waited for about an hour and she never came out. Using some stuff she told me I was able to triangulate her Instagram and tried to send her a message. She instantly blocked me.

I got an uber and met my friends at Waffle House and they are being so harsh saying that she wasn't really into me and I told them I didn't give her that much money and what she said about me being cute. They say that she was like a drug dealer and offering me the first ""hit"" for cheap to keep me coming back where I'll start spending real money and maybe even she was a prostitute and that's why she blocked me oh instragram and why she never came out. Basically they say she played me like an asshole. I want to go back tonight and try to explain to her I'm not a creep and I just had a nice time. My friends say I'd be a real asshole then as she'd call the cops on me or worse see me as a sad puppy dog with a well paying internship and want to bleed me dry. 

I've been through so much turmoil over the past few weeks I don't even know which way is up so am I the asshole? ",160,212,0.89
133,Not the A-hole,"AITA So my mom has always been some what (okay a lot) of an authoritarian style parent.  There were a lot of time growing up where I didn't agree with her about something but was not allowed to voice that. And honestly even now, there are some of those times.

I love my mom, she's the strongest person I ever met.  But because of this I have never shared much of my personal life with her.  I try to open up more now, because I want an open relationship with her.  And, to her credit she has tried a lot harder to be less strict but she's still her own way.

Well because of this I have made it a point to involve my son in our lives as much as makes since given his age etc.  he has always been given a voice.

Okay so let's get the background over... I'm a single mother to a 5 year old boy with several allergies. Some severe and some mild.  Including an array of food allergies. My mother babysits him while I am at work.  This generally means she is feeding him about one meal a week by my request, and sometimes he gets junk or treats there too.

Well recently my mom was feeding him and the other kids (cousins) some dinner which happened to be cooked with an ingredient my son is allergic to.  It's complicated to explain the nature of that particular allergy but while he will likely not die from it, he is still usually caused a bit of discomfort when he eats it.  Hives, itchy mouth, etc.  Typically if it is cooked and he gets some, it's okay. But he has reacted to cooked too. So even though his epipen isn't for that specific food, we avoid it.  Basically he *can* eat it and not die but really shouldn't and he and I have decided together he won't. 

Well mom told him he had to eat his dinner or he was going to be in big trouble.  When he said no again she told him he was grounded from
Screens all night until he cleaned his plate.  My son's reply was ""Fine. I don't care how much trouble I'm in I am NOT eating that.  You can't make me.""

Well of course my mom was livid when I got there to get him.  And she had told me he has to apologize before he can come back.

I told her that I can't make him do that. I have taught him from day 1 that he can refuse to eat any food he's allergic to. No adult can make him poison himself. And I will 100% back that up.  

Now mom is saying we are both AH's and need to apologize to her.  That she knows which foods he is deathly allergic to and which ones are ""fine as long as he has antihistamines if he gets hives."" 

So, AITA? And was my son holey-jr?

135,Not the A-hole,"Basically I have a little sister who turned 15 two months ago, whose beEn getting texts from a guy in my highschool whose 17 about to be 18 in a few months.

I have seen how this guy talks about sex and girls and I get weird vibes from him. Ive told my sister this but she keeps telling me to butt out but I know this guy is sort of like a wannabe gangster type (but also like a wannabe intellectual as well, very weird combo but its true).

So i told him directly to stop messaging my sister, hes too old and too freaky for me. After trying and failing to buck me down (getting in my face and asking me to repeat myself) he then tries to say im ""sexually gatekeeping"" my sister and that hes gonna tell other people that im weird/possibly incestuous.

136,Not the A-hole,"Im 17, my sister is 15 and very annoying.

I had my friend come over to play his xbox one x and watch movies on it. She entered my room to look at it but then refused to leave.

She has a habit of entering my room and refusing to leave until my parents make her because she knows it pisses me off. My parents weren't home so this was a lose lose for me.

She also insisted on playing candy crush on her phone really loud while we were watching movies. She also hogged my bed so i had to sit at the end of it.

Finally I had enough and while getting up to supposedly go to the bathroom I sneak attack her while her eyes are on her phone.

I sat on her head and dropped some mustard gas on her face. It was one of those farts that make your butt clap which made it even worse. She started smacking my ass (i have a mark even on my ass) then ran out the door coughing and crying.

My mom called me later and made me send my friend home, and im no longer allowed to have people over which sucks because i dont have the gas money to drive to other peoples houses.

138,Not the A-hole,"I am 46, from Switzerland and come from a pretty dysfunctional family. 

When I was 9, my parents divorced and I went to live with my mother and her new boyfriend, whom she married a year later.My stepfather was extremely abusive to me and my sister, both emotionally and physically, and my mother (and the rest of the family) always looked the other way. My mother and him had a son, and he was never abused. I left the house when I was 18 and moved out of the country but kept in touch with my family sporadically. 

Over the years, my stepfather changed a lot, attending AA meetings (he has not had a drink in 15 years) and has expressed his regrets for treating us the way he did. I thought I got over my childhood issues and could move on with my life, until a recent incident : last September, my sister, half-brother and I were summoned to a family meeting. There, my stepfather announced that he had contacted a lawyer to ensure that when he dies, his money would not end up in my sister´s and my pockets. 

Basically, according to the law, if he dies before my mother, she gets half of his estate and my half-brother gets the other half. And then, when my mother dies, what she owns gets divided into 3 equal parts going to her 3 children. But my stepfather sees that as unfair and he does not want the part she´d get when he dies to go to anybody else but to his son. He asked my sister and I to sign a letter the lawyer wrote which said we would give our part of the will to our half-brother.

Of course, we refused. My brother looked embarrassed but did not express any objection. My mother, as always, was silent. Seeing how we would not sign it, my stepfather asked us to think about it.

Fast forward and here comes Christmas, and we are all again reunited. The subject comes up and my stepfather becomes very irritated when we tell him we would not budge. That same night, all the abuse I suffered as a child started to resurface and the next morning, I decided I was going to pack my bags and leave. My stepfather was not there so my mother took the brunt of my anger : I told her that I would never forgive her for not protecting us, that she was as guilty as he was and that I was going to do something that I should have done when I was 18 : break up with them and never see them again. 

My sister respects my decision but my brother said I was being too harsh and asked me to reconsider. Apparently my mother and stepfather are devastated by my decision and have tried to reach out to me, but I am very reluctant to accept them back into my life. I don´t think I could ever forgive them. And it is not even about the money, I would actually prefer they donate everything instead of starting this drama.

EDIT : the response to my post has been so overwhelming that I cannot answer everyone directly. Thank you so much for all your advice and kind words of support, I really did not expect this. Some people said my header “breaking up with my mom” was weird, and I agree I should have worded it differently. I’m new on Reddit and still have a bit to learn, and obviously English is not my first language.
For those who said they think I only care about the money : I don’t. It is not even my money to start with. And it’s not the point. It is about a stepfather who decides to be a father when it is time to control, beat, punish, torture and assault, who said that he regrets everything he has done but then bails out when he has a chance to treat us like his own.
And yes, I have a biological father, who remarried long ago and has children with his new wife. Me, my sister and his wife will inherit from him, as well as my other brothers from that relationship. And my brothers (and my stepmother’s son from her first marriage) will inherit from their mother (my stepmother) and we won’t, which is only fair as we haven’t been raised by her. I have a good relationship with my father but he has lived in Spain with his Spanish wife for over 30 years so we don’t see each other as often as we’d like. I told him about everything and he is stunned. Himself as a stepdad he cannot even imagine treating his stepchildren differently to his own blood.
Some asked, what if my mother dies first? She has almost nothing to her name, but what little she has will go 1/2 to my stepfather, and the rest to my brother, sister and I.  And then when he dies, we get nothing, which is fair enough as it’s the law.
Thanks again everyone, you cannot even imagine how much you helped.",646,8027,0.95
139,Not the A-hole,"I’m on mobile sorry for the format. 
My boyfriend and I have been together for 8 years and we have an almost 2 year old daughter together and we both work full time. Last Wednesday our daycare provider cancelled on us for Thursday, Friday, and we no longer have a back up baby sitter (my grandparents were being our back up sitter but my grandfathers health is declining so that’s come to an end and everyone else we know and trust works 9-5’s). My boyfriend works 330am-1130am on a normal day and I work 830am-4pm (but don’t NEED to be at work until 10 as the first hour or so is considered “administrative time”) I suggest that my boyfriend take one day off and I’ll find coverage to take whatever day he doesn’t. He is very adamant that he cannot take any time off bc they’re very busy and are working mandatory 10 hour days for the next 2 weeks, so essentially I’m on my own. My boss was kind enough to let me take our daughter to work with me BOTH Thursday and Friday but she wasn’t happy about it. So fast forward to Saturday evening and our sitter cancels on us Monday AND Tuesday. So here we are again, I ask him to please take a half day Monday or Tuesday bc I can’t take her to work 4 days in a row and if he takes a half day he gets home by 830am and then I can be to work by 9-930. Absolutely refuses. Nope! He can’t do it bc “10 hOuR dAYs MaNdAToRY fOr TwO wEeKs.” So I bite the bullet and I work for someone else on Sunday so they can work for me Monday and I switched with someone so I could have Tuesday off and now I’m working Saturday (today) Now it’s Wednesday and my boyfriend decides he’s going to leave work at his normal time bc he has a tattoo appointment (so he doesn’t work the mandatory 10 hours)  and then comes Friday.. the real kicker. I text him as soon as I wake up to let him know our taxes have come (we split them in half bc we file separately) and this mother fucker tells me “I’m gonna take a half day today. Can I meet you at the bank and we’ll split the money and have lunch?” 
So I stewed on that for awhile and come lunch time I go off. Tell him he’s selfish. He can’t take a half day to watch our kid and let me go to work so I don’t have to work weekends but you can leave early for a tattoo and some fucking tax money? I told him he’s selfish and he told me I’m an asshole... so am I? Bc I don’t think I am.m, but maybe I’m wrong... ",128,743,0.95
140,Asshole,"My wife's been on this ""detox"" type of diet, she's trying to lose about 40 lbs in total and has lost maybe 10 ever since she started doing the detox. She is consistently getting on and off this diet, the most she lost was probably about 25 lbs and then she went back on it. 

When we first met, she was very thin. Now all she does is go on and off on these lose weight quick diets. Would I like her to lose weight? Yeah, but she's good looking to me, she doesn't feel like this though which is why she's been on new diets on and off.

so let me move on, when I came home from work I was unwinding and talking to her in the living room. She's sitting there eating ice cream from the carton with a spoon. I joked with her, poking her stomach saying ""wow I didn't know cookie dough ice cream was apart of your detox""

141,Not the A-hole,"Obligatory “I’m on mobile” preface.

My partner and I are not married, however we have been together for upwards of 6 years now and have started to really get into very serious discussions about the future. I’m 24 and she is in her late 20s for context. I am currently still in school pursuing a professional degree with a future annual income of $200k+ assuming I do decently well in my courses. She has a degree and currently is in a position where she makes <$30k but she is very happy.

I have always been supportive of her career choice as it’s exactly what she wants to do. I have no issues with contributing significantly more to the communal pot and understand that, once married, this is shared money. However occasionally I will talk about the 2 nice rewards I’ve planned for myself after paying off my debt. (Added together they cost <$40k and I don’t see them as unreasonable or unnecessarily spendy in a “just to show I have money” way).

When we discuss these, she always belittles them and tries to steer me away from them, continually asserting that “this is exactly why she will be in charge of the finances”. It irks me but hey, I’ve grown used to it.

What really rubs me the wrong way is that she knows absolutely nothing about finances or anything other than simple depreciation in cars and similar items. Despite this, when I showed her the hotel I wanted to stay in for a honeymoon or big vacation, she said it would be too much and would be a waste of money.  Am I an asshole for feeling really resentful of the way she tells me I will be able to use my future income? Or, in the inverse, is this an indication that I will grow resentful over time if she’s not contributing and still controlling? 

I’ve told her I’m perfectly happy with her being a SAHM if she would like, as she wants several children. She likes the idea but doesn’t want to be responsible for cooking if I end up taking more hours to afford that. I just feel like there’s a lot of take and not much give. She’s so kind and has offered to help pay off my debt with her savings (something I don’t intend to accept whether we’re married or not) but I just feel like it’s been such a sensitive topic when my career path and success thus far should point towards the exciting exotic life I’ve imagined..",55,67,0.96

144,Everyone Sucks,"My brother(M17) and I(F14) recently moved from Hamburg to Munich to live with my dad. This was planned since 2016.My dad's gf also moved in with him even though they've only known each other for 3 months by the time he asked her. 

DGF is an extreme clean freak and has shouted at us multiple times for not being clean enough. Going as far as to tell us that there's a door and a train back to Hamburg as well. 

Yesterday I shouted at her that if she can tell us we can leave, I can say the same thing to her. She then got mad and started bad mouthing my other siblings and my mother, calling us homeless people.

Update: My dad, who has been actually involved though he didn't do much to ease the situation except to tell her that she has to calm down, has officially told her that if she doesn't like it, she should leave. This happened because she told him to ""get rid"" of us to which he totally exploded. ",54,165,0.98
145,Not the A-hole,"So small background story before I explain, I currently work at a sushi restaurant and I've been working there for over a year so I pretty much know the restaurant and how it functions like the back of my hand. It's to the point where the owner of the sushi restaurant trusts me with account for DoorDash, Grubhub, UberEats, etc. (Mainly because she's not tech savvy, so she pays me extra to make any adjustments with the menu.)

Anyways, our last call is 10:30 PM and we officially close the restaurant and kick customers out by 11:00 PM. Roughly around 10:40, we still had 5-7 customers finishing up their meals and a customer walks in with her husband and says, ""For two,"" holding up two fingers. I simply told her, ""I'm sorry, our last call was 10 minutes ago."" At this point, our sushi chefs and kitchen staff were already cleaning and getting ready to leave while us servers have to wait until the customers pay and leave. She starts begging to me and explaining that it's not fair for us to serve other customers and not serve them. We still have to refill the customer's, who are still eating, their drinks, but we don't accept any more orders from them; hence LAST CALL. We inform our customers 5 minutes before last call if they need or want anything else to be fair. At this rate, explaining to the customer was like talking to a brick wall. I was slowly getting frustrated because she started to yell at me and start attracting the other customers who are currently dining. I didn't want to make a scene so I simply said, ""Stop embarrassing yourself and your husband. Please leave."" The husband's face started getting red and the wife was even more pissed. She started screaming how she's a regular and that she demands to be served. They ended up leaving and she flipped me off. My manager was currently in the bathroom and she asked me what was all that noise about. So I explained her the whole situation and she was mad at me because the husband and wife come 3 times a week and how my actions or how I dealt with the issue may have lead to losing a regular.

I feel bad now because my manager is telling me how I did something that was wrong/bad and now I feel like an asshole. Reddit community, am I the asshole?  


TL;DR Customer comes in past last call I told them that I won't/can't serve them. Customer makes a scene and manager is now mad/pissed off at me for not serving a regular. Manager is afraid of losing regular customer.

148,Not the A-hole,"Made this account just to post this.

I met a girl through online dating.  I was very into her.  Unlike most other people, she was willing to have long verbose conversations with me with before we even broached the topic of dating.  We’ve been talking for over two weeks now, usually sending about two long messages each per day(usually about three paragraphs each).  So anyway, earlier today, I asked her out.  She said yes!

So then we started working out logistics for what we were going to do tomorrow, where we would go and whether I’d pick her up or she’d meet me there.  

I gave her four options, and without going into detail let’s say the options were going to a park, rock climbing, ice skating, or going to a very unique, but expensive, museum.  The museum is right up my alley and we’d discussed this kind of thing during our conversations.  She’d expressed interest in seeing it so I was happy to take her.  She chose the museum.  But she also said “Oh, I’m also bringing a friend if that’s okay.”

Tickets are over $50 per person(not including refreshments, as there is a unique bar there that we’d definitely want to go to as well), which is, again, fine.  I offered, and I wouldn’t expect anyone to pay that amount on a first date, so I’d be willing to foot the bill.  But paying for a friend out of nowhere is pretty weird if you ask me.

On top of that, I would have been completely fine if she would have said, when I asked her out that she didn’t feel comfortable meeting me for the first time by herself but that she wanted to meet me and if it was okay to bring a friend along.

The way she said it, I no longer really had a choice in the matter.  I can’t really say “I’m actually not okay with you bringing a friend.”  That would be weird.  I also can’t say “Well, is your friend paying for their own ticket?” which is also weird.


So I took a different option, which was “I’m sorry, I don’t think this will work out.  I wanted to go on a date, and if you want to bring a friend then you don’t want what I’m looking for.  Best of luck finding what you want.”  She just responded “WTF” and neither of us has texted the other beyond that.  

AITA?

Edit: Well, thanks everyone.  Anyway, things are resolved and we’re rescheduling to a time when my friends are free so we can do a double date sort of thing so it’s less awkward for me.  For the record, she thought ME wanting to bring a friend was weird LOL.  Also in all this, she told me she’s going through a divorce right now and that she grew up Mormon.  Shes 20, so Im definitely judging her for her poor life choices so far.  Also being on a dating site without mentioning that she’s married.  Anyway, we might do the date next weekend or I may just decide I don’t want to meet her, this whole exchange has made me extremely uncomfortable and meeting someone to hang out and chat really shouldn’t be this hard.",66,60,0.9

I worked as a house cleaner for a company. From the start, I felt like my boss took advantage of me. For example, he scheduled me for a small apartment notorious for having dog poop all over. He told me to wear a face mask and vacuum around the dog poop (we are not allowed to clean body fluids). It smelt so disgusting that I gagged when I walked in, with all that poop confined in one space. I sucked it up and did this job for my boss bc it was a new company and I knew he needed any money at this point. I feel like I should have quit after this, but I continued working there. 

I begin to break out in severe cystic acne bc of stress. On another job, a customer made fun of it and would not leave me alone while I was trying to clean. She was talking bad about my skin to my co-cleaner in Spanish (I know a little). I left this job bc I started getting really upset. He was sticking up for the customer saying I should have gotten over it. 

I was one of his best cleaners. I would often get the job done faster and more efficiently than my coworkers except one. She quit. Leaving me and 2 other cleaners to be the only ones. I told him a week in advance that I was going to take 3 days off bc I was getting burnt out and I really did not want to leave him high and dry like my coworker. I purposely wanted to come back on a Tuesday bc I had a regular house that tipped well and I cleaned her house for the past 10 weeks and she requests me.

My boss was salty that I was taking these 3 days off. Coming into work, I already felt like I was going to put my 2 weeks in soon. I go in expecting my regular house, but out of spite, he gives me a 6hr new house that usually he would have split between two people bc it really means 8-10 if it is dirty. On top of this, he gave my house to a person who has worked for the company for 2 weeks. I feel like this was the straw that broke the camel’s back.

I go to the house and do a walkthrough of the house and based on how dirty it is it was going to take at least 10 hours to clean, vacuum, and mop. (5bd, 4bath, 1half bath, 2living, kitchen,dining). There is no AC and it was the hottest day of the summer. I begin cleaning the baths but I feel dehydrated and overheated. I clean for a total of 3 hrs. I sit down and try to continue but I am fed up that my boss gave me this house in the first place instead of my regular so I left and did not tell him. 

I write down the 3 hours I worked and do not show up to work the next day. I feel bad mostly for the family that had to show up to a house they thought was going to be cleaned. However, I know my boss will send someone else (probably two cleaners) to finish the job. My boss calls me a few times and texts but I don’t pick up. I eventually text him saying that I quit bc I can’t handle the stress of this job and my skin keeps progressively getting worse. ",47,82,0.96
153,Not the A-hole,"Im (M27) and have lived in the same apartment for 5 years. I’ve been married for two years. My previous upstairs neighbors were great and I never heard them. In fact if I didn’t occasionally see them I would have assumed the upstairs unit was vacant. 7 months ago however we got new neighbors up there. It’s a single mom with a daughter I estimate to be 5. 

The first week of them living there was fine, but then tragedy struck my peaceful and quiet world. I work from home mostly and all day I would hear loud music, and what sounded like they were dropping bowling balls on the floor for hours. They then got a puppy they would leave alone for hours on end that barked non stop. The mom would bring countless men over and have the loudest sex I’ve ever heard. Also they would let her child run and jump around until 2am. 

After talking to them about how loud they were I finally started to complain the landlord and nothing has been done. So I decided to take matters into my own hands. I bought several google homes and a canary view security system, and whenever I’m gone or they get to loud at night I’ll yell up and ask them to be quiet, and when they fail to do so I blast some music or an annoying noise. 

Still that didn’t help, but I finally found a solution after telling them I can’t sleep and they’re making my life miserable and her only response to me this whole time was, “sorry you think you’re better than me.” And “You have no idea how hard it is to be a mom!” I started waiting for them to sleep, and I placed my security alarm by the vent and randomly will turn on the alarm in the middle of the night until I hear them wake up and about something. Then I turn it off and wait for them to sleep and do it again. 

I’ve only done it a few times, but they’re much more quiet now. 

So... AITA? 

EDIT: 
One thing I forgot to mention is that I’ve done my best to be an ass but not a super duper ass. The 5 year old  will be gone for 2-3 days a week (probably at her dads) and that’s when they are usually doing wild thing or playing loud music which is what the alarm is for. However I’m not denying that there’s a chance I woke up the kid if she was home too but that was generally a last resort. It’s not really the kids fault. But still I was pissed and will accept that it could be an ass move haha. I actually did tell the landlord if the neighbors resume their antics and that if the landlord does nothing I will contact my city because they have a department for renters and the landlord could be fined for not taking action.

154,Not the A-hole,"I’ll start this off by saying I don’t really care what people do in the shower on their own time. I know a lot of guys pee in the shower, and girls do too. If you wanna pee, or brush your teeth, or masturbate, or whatever you wanna do in your own shower, more power to you. 

But my boyfriend and I live together, and we often enjoy showering together. We have a fairly large shower and enjoy each other’s company.

Anyway, more than once now he has decided to pee in the shower while I’m in it. I’ve asked him not to do it. I even asked him not to do it today directly before he did it, but he did it anyway. He stands to the side and aims for the drain, but I still can’t help but think some of it gets mixed with the water swirling around the floor of the shower and I don’t like it. 

So after he did it today, I got out of the shower right away and haven’t been speaking to him since. I know I could solve this by taking my own shower separately, which I do sometimes, but I do like showering together sometimes and id really appreciate if he wouldn’t pee in there while we’re together. Am I overreacting? ",100,147,0.92
155,Asshole,"Lee and I met and immediately knew we were the right fit. We were both 22 and never had such a strong connection. After 8 months together and some trips across the world, he was offered a great job in a foreign country. I decided to follow him and find work there. He was terrified I would be deported if I don't find work. As a fail safe, we looked into ways I can stay with him on a companion visa. Marriage was the most obvious answer. Neither of us care about weddings and titles; his parents have been happily together for almost 30 years and never married, and I just never saw why it would matter. But I knew, even after only 8 months together, that I wanted to be with him the rest of my life, no matter what that might bring. We were on a short timeline as we were leaving the country soon, and didn't have the time to sort the logistics of including our families in this. We went to the county recorder's office on our lunch breaks and did the deed, and it was perfect. We couldn't bring ourselves to tell our families because of the drama it would cause.

&#x200B;

We married, and are living very far from our families. Everyone here knows us as husband and wife, which we are enjoying. I found work. Both our jobs are very international and we are relieved that our marriage ensures us staying together is taken seriously no matter which culture we are in. Our parents still refer to us as boyfriend and girlfriend, which feels a little strange by this point.

&#x200B;

We've been married over 2 years and together almost 3. Lee's parents don't care at all about marriage, but my parents definitely do. They've been asking incessantly if he is going to propose. My mom is so excited for the wedding, is saying she has dreamed of my wedding since I was born. Originally I was counting on my little brother to fulfill her wedding dreams, but she now says it's ""not the same when it's your son. The wedding is about the bride."" We are feeling guilty (we didn't think weddings mattered this much when we did this), but also so thankful because a wedding sounds horrible and stressful (we are very very introverted), and the benefits of being officially married are coming to us.

&#x200B;

We talked before about holding a ""fake"" wedding, but we would hate it so much and it's a waste of money. We could tell my parents but my mom might be more upset than we originally expected about ""not being invited to her daughter's wedding"".

158,Not the A-hole,"Here are the basics.  My mother is disabled with a host of medical issues.  She is 66 yrs old and does not have any sort of dementia. She does have some memory issues though. A year ago, her license was suspended after she reported to her doctor that she had fallen asleep in her car.  She drove to a store, parked, and fell asleep slumped over the wheel for several hours.  Passerbys knocked on her window to check on her and she responded but went back to sleep.  She did this over three hours.  

Once she lost her license, I set her up with GoGo Grandparent that uses Lyft and Uber to shuttle her around at a moments notice with just a call.  No confusing apps, no 24 hour notice. There is no cost to her since I pay for it.  I get texts when she is picked up and dropped off and it helps me keep track of when she actually goes to her appointments. Sometimes she gets her dates confused.  Complicating this is that she had just purchased a car just days before the incident and she desperately wants to drive again because she wants to drive her new car. To help with this aspect, I use her car on some weekends so she can at least be in her new car while running her errands. 

Another issue is that three months ago she was hospitalized and since then she is on 24/7 oxygen and she feels trapped in her apartment because she has to use an oxygen concentrator which has limited battery time. This has only exacerbated her desire to drive her own vehicle.

She has been pretty good about not driving up until a month ago. But a month ago she decided to start paying a friend to drive her and she found a second friend who is an Uber driver who takes her to appointments, or so she says.  My concern here is that she is telling me she is getting a ride when in fact she is driving herself. The change that happened a month ago is that we figured out what caused her sleepiness and adjusted the medication to address that issue and added new medication to address the hallucinations she admitted having ""for years"". She now feels there should be no barrier to getting her license back but I don't think the doctors will sign off on it. It has become an obsession.

So my question is, would I be an asshole if I hire a private investigator to see if she is being honest about not driving?  Since she isn't using the service, I have no way of knowing if she is driving or not.  I trusted her before and I don't technically have any evidence that these people are not driving her.  But she has the psychology of a rebellious 13 year and doesn't like being told what to do. I had some assurance with the car service.  Now my gut tells me there may be cause to worry. If I learn she is driving, I am taking the keys away.

161,Not the A-hole,"This has bugged me for years. I worked in a corporate office. One of the paralegals there had some health issues (used a cane). She was also enormous. Bottom line, she needed to use the handicapped stall. Fair enough - - bathroom is 4 stalls, I never used it.

Except that one day. I was alone in the bathroom, in my regular stall, and discovered I had a little monthly visitor and no mitigation apparatus. So, I fished through my purse for quarters, put some toilet paper in place, and quickly sprinted over to the Cotton Apparatus Dispenser and dialed up a solution.

Seeing as how I was only half zipped and in distress, I ducked into the handicapped stall to insert said apparatus. You guessed in - - in the literally 30 seconds I was in there, she showed up and started yelling at me that I was thoughtless and entitled. There was no room to interject ""30 seconds"" or ""emergency"" or ""you weren't even here.""

163,Not the A-hole,"So sorry for the long post; I tried to cut down as much as I can!

After graduating from college, I took a break before applying to law school. For the past few months, I worked as a teacher in rural China (this becomes relevant later), and put my home address as that of my parents. 

My application cycle has been successful, and I am extremely grateful to be in my current situation. However, my parents have this irritating habit of announcing my law school acceptances before I have the opportunity to do so, and it has gotten to the point where family friends will sometimes find out that I've been accepted to a law school before I do. Law schools typically send out an acceptance email to applicants first, followed by a formal hard copy of the acceptance letter. Because I worked in an area without internet on top of the infamous Chinese firewall, I didn't receive the emails. However, my parents happily rip open any law school mail they receive, even if it is clearly addressed to me. They then proceed to call and brag to their friends that I got into X Law School.

It probably seems petty, but I have worked my entire life to get to this point, and I really looked forward to finding out for myself if I got into X Law School, and opening that envelope to see the hard copy of my acceptance letter. I worked and paid my own way through college, and also paid for all my law school applications. The fact that I have to find out about my own acceptances from congratulatory texts from family friends or posts by my parents on social media is infuriating. 

I have asked my parents in the past to not open my mail, and to allow me to decide what news to share with family and friends. They have pulled this kind of stunt in the past, especially with my college acceptances and scholarship award letters a few years back, but whenever I ask them not to, they act hurt and tell me that they only ""want to share good news with everyone"" and how it doesn't matter if whether they find out first or I find out first. When I told them that I thought it was inconsiderate that they would deliberately ignore my requests, they were extremely offended. My dad even sarcastically offered to send photos of any future acceptance letters if, as he put it, ""reading those letters is SO important to you."" 

AITA for telling off my parents for more or less stealing my thunder over my acceptances? I know that they're just excited, but it feels like they prioritize being able to brag to their friends over my personal preferences.",32,90,0.98
164,Not the A-hole,"First a little back story:

My husband and I first started dating 10 years ago.

When we first me, he was in the process of divorcing his ex-wife for the 2nd time. I told him that I never wanted to be the ""2nd"" woman in a relationship, so I refused to date until his divorce was finalized. He came into work that day, dropped the completed divorce papers and asked if we could go out for wings and beer.

He was the first guy I ever dated (22 and **very** sheltered life), and things were going along pretty well. However, issues started happening when I went out to the west coast to help him get the last of his items from his former life out of storage. After we got the moving truck home and unpacked it, her stuff was every where....To the point that the first thing I would see when I walked through the door was a box with her framed picture on the top of it.

He refused to get rid of any of her stuff, insisting that he was going to send it to her. After dealing with it for a year (and a year of seeing her face every day when I would come home), I'd had enough. Called the fam, packed up my stuff, and moved out.

After a few months and a bad rebound bf, we ran into each other attending a gig of a mutual friend. Sparks re-kindled, and much to my family's dismay, we got back together. When we got back together, he made some serious promises, such as minimizing contact with his ex unless absolutely needed (they ran a business together and had unresolved tax issues from the dissolution of the business). Fast forward a few years and we're married and moving out to the west coast, while she's remarried with kids on the east coast.

Over the years, he's kept minimal contact, but over the last year they've become full blown best friends again. FB posts, chats, emails back and forth, and while I've tolerated it, we've been fighting over it more and more. To the point that during one argument I told him he broke his promise to me when we got back together.

Now, he's significantly older than me and is turning 50 this year. It's going to be a huge birthday bash for him, but he wants to invite his ex-wife. The one who I really do not ever want to meet face to face, and have told him so on multiple occasions. His reply is that it is his birthday and even though he expects me to organize it, he wants her to attend.

AITA for absolutely refusing to invite her and giving an ultimatum that if he wants her there then I will go visit my family instead?

&#x200B;

\*\*\*EDITING FOR ADDITIONAL INFO\*\*\* The kids his ex-wife has are hers only and with her current husband. They didn't come into the picture until after she remarried. She would be flying across the country to attend, and is contemplating leaving her husband with the kids so she can attend. I have walked in on him writing emails and FB messenger IM's between them that he will immediately close out when I enter the room. He leaves them logged in on the computer, but I haven't read them and I think it would be 100% a breach of all trust and a point of no return. I am working with a counselor to try and resolve my own insecurities, but he's refused to come to counseling at this point.

166,No A-holes here,"My group of friends, all mid twenties, have planned a big bar crawl across town for St. Patrick’s day this year. We’re generally responsible, tax-paying adults and all that, but every year for St. Patrick’s day we revert to total degenerates. It’s a wild time. 

One of my friends just discovered that she’s pregnant and we’re all pretty thrilled, but some people in the group don’t know yet because it’s so early. I didn’t invite her to the crawl. For one, I didn’t want her to be backed into a corner if people who don’t know she’s pregnant ask why she isn’t drinking and for two, she’s pregnant and it’s a rowdy bar crawl. I just assumed she would have no interest. 

She found out, however, and was pretty upset. She said that she felt left out because of her pregnancy. I never meant to cut her out and we still invite her to everything else we do, even going out to bars at night, but she rarely comes to that anymore so I assumed she just didn’t want to be around alcohol. She told me I was incredibly rude to invite everyone but her, but I assumed that a pregnant woman wouldn’t want to deal with a city full of drunk people and bar crawls.

168,Asshole,"This happens a lot, but it's a very specific example... She will start a conversation with the phrase ""should we"" when what she actually mean is ""can you"". Examples: ""Should we order pizza soon?"" ""Should we talk to the children about their bad habits?"" And I know she's asking me to do it myself but I always answer something like ""Yeah I don't have a problem if you want to do that."" And then nobody does the thing because neither of us actually requested or offered. I'm asking because I know I get a little frustrated whenever she does this and I can't really tell if I'm being righteous or just petty.

Edit (INFO): A few times I've asked if she is offering or if she is requesting, and she never gives me a direct answer. I don't think I've ever said ""you say 'should we' a lot and I never know if it's a request or an offer or just information gathering"", so maybe I could be a little more direct, but somehow that feels like more of an asshole thing to do. More and more I just default to taking her literally and leaving the clarification to her.

Edit 2 (conclusion): While it might be a minor thing, I'm definitely the minor asshole, because I'm deciding to derail the whole thing instead of clearing up her intent. There have been some great suggestions and I definitely have new perception here! Thanks everyone.

Edit 3: There have been a few responses here that seem to be reading too much into my mood as it relates to the relationship on a larger scale, or how I view my girlfriend in some fundamental way. I don't mean for this post to shame her at all - I am fully aware that I am peeved my a certain interaction and not the person underneath it. I know that one of the responses is ""NTA (but the other person is)"" but if you're calling one of us an asshole, it's minor and circumstantial. I don't think she's an asshole; I'm just wanting to better my perspective and myself.

169,No A-holes here,"I've been with my gf for nearly a year now. I'm head over heels in love with her and she is with me too. When we first got together, I found out she was poly-amorous, as she was in no other relationships at the time and as I was used to non-committal beginnings to relationships, I was fine with this. After a year, she has just begun to see someone else. She was very upfront about it and asked before if I was ok with it. We had a long discussion where I coming from a very monogamous background agreed that although I was uncomfortable with the idea of it, I couldn't think of any real cold hard logical reason why it was wrong. She certainly doesn't spend less time with me or treat me differently and her other relationship is barely beginning. I also said though that I was ok with it but I may if suddenly I became too uncomfortable with the situation ask her to stop. She said that was fine. However, she rounded out the conversation with a couple of statements saying that one of her friends had said “She couldn’t imagine her ever being monogamous” and also that she was happy to wait for me to understand but at some point, she was going to run out of patience. Which to me was a clear threat of a breakup if I wasn’t ok with this idea. Am I the asshole if I want us to be exclusive because this genuinely causes me to stress and worry despite all rationality?

TL:DR Partner wants to be poly-amorous. I don’t. Am I the asshole if I say that she can’t be with other people?

Edit: I am a moron  


Final Ideas: After everyone's comments. I've decided that I'm going to try and embrace her poly-amorous side meet her other partners and try and be as civil as humanly possible. I'm also now reading a few books on polyamory in order to try and better understand everything that works. If after all this and a few months of trying if I can't change my feelings I will have to have a conversation about whether we are compatible as people.

Though I completely respect that it was ultimately HER decision and will support her regardless, I can’t help but feel quietly angry about it. She was attending a big 10 college, is smart, beautiful, and had what seemed to be a bright future ahead of her. I know that teenage pregnancy doesn’t automatically “ruin” a woman’s life, but I’m afraid she won’t ever return to school and instead choose to maintain a steady job/care for her child.

172,No A-holes here,"So this post is inspired by the current top post on this sub.  I have a fairly similar situation and figured I will put mine out there. 

So I have been dating this girl for a few months and for the most part things have been going really well, except for our dietary differences. I grew up hunting and fishing with a meat heavy diet and she grew up vegan and we have both carried those diets into our adulthoods. 

When I cook things seem to work out fine, I cook the dish without the meat, serve it for her then add the meat in for myself. Or I just make 2 entirely different dishes.

But occasionally she will cook for me and will want me to try her vegan dishes. But goddamn is it gross. I am not sure I will ever understand how people eat tofu.

So recently she said she wanted to try and make something new. I told her that I will happily try it but that I wanted to bring over a venison steak so I would have something to make if I didn't like it. Because up to this point I haven't liked any of the dishes she has made (I didn't say that last part but she knows it already).

After typing that it sounds more dickish than I think it is so let me add that whenever I cook for her that I make sure to have an easy fall back dish that I can quickly throw together if she doesn't like what I made.

This past 6 months have been that all over again. We are moving in the next few days and he still has no where to go, he is expecting us to just let him back in with but my mom has already said ""we don't have any room for anyone besides me the dog and -myname- in the new apartment.

174,Asshole,"My wife and I have been married for 10 years. We met in college, and she has been my best friend for almost 14 years now. She is beautiful, supportive, kind, classy, and all around amazing as a wife. 

We went through a really rough patch about a year ago, mostly due to issues on my end. However, she told me she was pregnant. I was overjoyed. She told me she would only keep it if I was 100% in on the baby and the marriage, I said I was fully committed, and we kept the baby.

As time went on, I became increasingly insecure about whether or not the baby was mine. I did the math and thought it was unlikely it was mine, on top of having a gut feeling. I was internally agonizing over this for months, and after the baby was born, I could barely even hold him because I was so convinced he wasn't mine.

I told my wife I wanted a paternity test. She was upset but told me to get one if it would ease my mind. The test comes back two weeks later and it says I am not the father.

I'm absolutely livid. I had an out of body experience. I stormed into our house and just let loose. I felt like I couldn't stop myself, I was completely broken in that moment. I cried and screamed and asked her what I did to deserve this. I absolutely never laid a hand on her.

The whole time, she's just sitting on the couch, trying to comfort the baby. This made me even angrier for some reason, so I kicked her out right then and there. Told her to pack her bags and just get out.

She calls me the next day and tells me that I deserve to know that the baby is mine, and asks me to get a paternity test from another company. I figure I have nothing to lose at this point, and another paternity test can only help me in a divorce, so we get one at the company she suggested, and I sent a third to another company, just to be sure.

I get the results from one and they say I am the baby's father. I wait a few days and don't say anything, then get the second set of results, also confirming I'm the father. I feel like the weight of the world has just been lifted off my shoulders and I can finally be the dad I want to be.

I call my wife to give her the good news and she tells me she's not moving back in. She says she's disgusted with how I acted by asking for a paternity test and my reaction to the false one. She tells me I can come see my son, but she will be filing for divorce.

I don't think my reaction was over the top for a man who thought he was being lied to about one of the most important things. I never showed any sort of violence and I was so emotionally broken at that point.

It’s huge and has many battle scars and she admitted that this dog killed a few dogs and cats before she adopted it. She has a huge heart and I get that these breeds get a lot of hate but that doesn’t make me less fearful of them and I don’t want him around me or my cats. I don’t want to be a person who let a dog with a fighting past around me thinking I’m helping prove that “it’s the owner not the dog” and he ends up hurting me or my cats anyway (you can say media blows it out or proportion and they might but don’t pretend it doesn’t happen.)

My friend wanted to come visit me and my fiancé and I told her sure. So when she’s practically down the street she texts me that she’s bringing her new dog to meet us because “he needs to be socialized.”

Not wanting to be rude, I told her I guess it was ok but to please ask first next time. I wanted to be nice and try to get over my fear but nope. So when she gets here, I see she’s BARELY able to hold onto this dogs leash. I should have said no.

When they come in the dog is barking and growling at me and my cats. 2 of my cats ran but 1 of my cats is a 21 year old deaf girl. She tried to run but the dog kept lunging for her so I scooped her up and put her in the room with the others and closed the door. Her heart was pounding, I didn’t want to leave her in there but I didn’t want to come off as mean. After a lot of convincing from my friend the dog finally calmed down a little but it was on edge. All my friend said was “sorry bout that lol he’s still learning.”

We all sit down to chat and she just let him off his leash to roam around the house! I asked her nicely if she could keep him close but she glared and said that “he’s fine he just needs to learn.”

We keep talking but I can’t focus because I can’t not watch this dogs every move. He ate all the cat food and kept going back to the door my cats were in and growling. So I asked her again if she could keep the dog next to her. She rolled her eyes and got the dog to sit next to her. For a bit everything seemed to be ok and I started to relax, we turned on the TV and we were focused on the show. I then felt something grab onto my leg and making weird movements. I looked down and this dogs was humping my legs!

I freaked out and pushed the dog off of me and yelled “NO! ABSOLUTELY NO! GET OFF OF ME!” The dog got off but he started growling and barking again. My friend got up and started yelling AT ME! “Don’t push my dog! He’s not hurting you!” I told her to get out don’t ever bring him back. She left right then.

I know I could have probably handled it better but in the moment I wanted the dog gone. She didn’t even ask if she could bring it over in the first place! And it was scaring my cats! Our friendship is pretty much moot at this point, but was ITA?",105,76,0.93
177,Not the A-hole,"I own my own home and have a friend and his kid staying with me for a week - his school has a different schedule and he is off for these days.  To make a long story short, this kid (16 years old) is extremely loud and has been keeping me up at night with his gaming. 

 I can understand the occasional outburst, but his yelling and screaming will go on for hours on end during the night, and as a working professional, absolutely need my sleep to have a productive work day.

I have asked him (and his father, my friend) several times to please quiet down during the evening/night, but his screaming has persisted for the past two days.  My neighbors to the side of me (town home development) made a joke out of it last night, laughing at the fact that they have heard everything -- I was quite embarrassed.

 So this morning before leaving for work, I disabled the WiFi to my home - it just so happens the router is in my room which I locked.  I live in a residential area where the closest shopping center is about three miles away.  I felt a twinge of remorse as I got to work, but hopefully he'll learn a lesson.

178,No A-holes here,"Hey guys I met this girl on tinder and we have gone out twice before our third date. Things where going pretty good and we where getting along well until our third date. We where eating outside at a restaurant and she leans out of no where and asks why I'm always wearing a hat and pulls it off without asking. I wasn't expecting that and it really annoyed me.

&#x200B;

She had no way of knowing I always wear a hat (yes on all our previous dates as well) because of starting to bold around the sides of my head and I'm pretty insecure about it. My immediate reaction was to take back my hat fast and tell her that was rude. She laughed it off and said she was just joking around but I was pretty ticked off for the rest of the date. Despite that I think we had good chemistry and I just got to annoyed and surprised at the moment by the sudden intrusion so I didn't react to well. But since then she has been blowing me off, I think I was right to be annoyed by her snatching my cap without asking but now shes the one thats acting like her feelings are hurt it's left me wondering if ITA.

179,Not the A-hole,"Some background info - I am young in my field by 20+ years. My colleague's are all old enough to be my dad's and as such, I put up with a lot of teasing and razzing from them in that spirit. 

Recently, I adopted two cats. I have never had pets before and I have been so excited to have them in my life. This was my first time working since we adopted them so I was excited to share the news about them. 

This lead my coworker (Bob) to say how much he hates cats and essentially saying that I am silly for caring that much about them. He's aware that I'm not really up  for having kids, so this is as close as I'll get. He has dogs, children and grandchildren, and talks about them a lot. I had mentioned them maybe 3 times in 18 hours. 

Last night we were walking back to our hotel, and my boyfriend sent me a video of one of the cats coming out and exploring and I got so excited and said ""Awe he's coming out exploring! That's so good!"" 

Bob then tells me how his SiL had a cat and it scratched and bit his Grandson so they let it out in the woods for Coyotes to get it. 

I was appalled. The rest of the conversation goes as this: 

Me: What the hell? You killed a cat because it scratched your grandson?

Bob: Well I didn't do it, my wife did! I wanted to shoot the damn thing. [Laughs]

Me: You could have rehomed it! Some cats don't do well with kids because they are grabby. A childless person could have given it a new home.

Bob: Well it scratched my grandson, so it had to go

Me: Fine, I get that, but sending it out to die because it doesn't know better?

Bob: It's just a cat

Me: It's a living domesticated animal! Should we send you out to die when you do something stupid? No!

Bob:[Laughs] 

Me: And that's why people don't deserve fucking animals to assume that a cat would just do well with children and let it out to die because you're a fucking idiot. 

And I stormed off. Haven't seen or spoken to him since.

I got upset. Him and I have worked closely for two years. He knows I'm an animal lover. He knows how excited I am for these cats as we've been looking to adopt for a few months now, but that I am also very nervous that we won't do a good job. And to follow up my good mood about my cat with a story like that upset me to no end. I had shared my adoption news with a few coworkers who have cats to ask questions and had been dealing all day with people telling me how much cats suck and they hate them. This pushed me off the edge.

I called my boyfriend after and he tried to reason with me that Bob's Grandson is important to him and would do anything for him. Bob probably doesn't understand someone's love for an animal he doesn't care for and that maybe I was a bit harsh because I don't have kids.

Because of that convo I'm starting to feel bad, and that I'm an asshole for getting mad at him.

182,Not the A-hole,"I'm 30, and have always been called hard-hearted and cruel by my family. I hate drama and don't hesitate in telling off a family member if they're being stupid, which is why I've removed myself from them for the most part and live quite far away. I also am extremely empathetic and very sensitive to situations. Sorry this will be very long.

Background: My mother is a nagging narcissist who insists on having her way. My dad is a lifelong addict who has recently relapsed. They are codependent and emotionally and verbally abusive to each other.

My mother would call me nearly daily to unload on me and vent all her frustrations with my dad. Arguments, sex life, I heard it all, and none of it positive. I don't make much money, but offered to pay for therapy and couples therapy for my parents, and rehab for my dad. I was shot down every time. Their solution was to ""pray to God"" for help, and buy a timeshare (that they can't afford) against my advice. The whole of last year I reluctantly acted as a pseudo-therapist and mediator between my parents. It was awful.

This past Christmas I traveled to my hometown, and my dad showed up drunk and high. The next day my mom screamed at him so much he admitted himself into the hospital for suicidal and self-harming thoughts. I encouraged him to go, and my mom blames him and me for the extra medical bills.  Lately my dad will leave for a couple of days at a time when they have arguments, and my mom will call me to vent.  She visited me a few weeks ago for the first time in three years on extremely short notice, and it came out that he told her to get out. She told him she would visit me then, and he told her to ""stay there"". She did go back a couple of days later. 

A few days after she returned, she was venting to me yet again, and I just couldn't take it anymore. Told her they needed to divorce because they were toxic for each other. She hung up on me. The next morning my dad was blowing up my phone about how selfish and uncaring I was for telling them to get a divorce. How he had raised me to be a good person and couldn't believe I was being so self-centered. That I was ignorant of how marriages work because I haven't been married for decades like them. I didn't back down, but since then have cut nearly all contact with my parents, and refuse to initiate any. My mother has called me twice since, but the calls lasted less than five minutes when she realized I refused to talk. 

Am I the asshole for interfering in my parents' relationship? For telling them to get a divorce? For punishing them with no contact? Part of me says no, but the rest says I'm being petty about the whole situation. ",29,28,0.98
183,Not the A-hole,"I was just at the gym working out and minding my own business. I noticed this guy on a machine next to me but I didn’t think much of it. As I was leaving and walking through the parking lot, a car with tinted windows rolled one down and it was the guy from inside the gym. He asked me my name and if I had a boyfriend, to which I responded yes. He asked if we could be friends and if he could have my number. Mind you, I am completely uninterested and I know how dudes are. He obviously doesn’t want to be just friends, but I’m also a small girl and with today’s weirdos I get paranoid about creepy men. So these 3 thoughts go through my head: 
1. Do I say no right here and make it awkward?
2. Do I give him a fake number and risk running into him at the gym later and him being pissed?
3. Do I give him the correct number, and politely tell him that I’m not interested in being friends. 

I felt pressured so I opted with with third choice. He texted me within minutes and called me twice, to which I responded “I’m sorry I do not feel comfortable being your friend. Have a good day”. I really don’t think his intentions were bad, but I just didn’t want to have to deal with the awkwardness face to face or risk him getting pissed and abducting me (I’ve been watching too much Ted Bundy documentaries). 

I told my boyfriend immediately and he got extremely angry that I would give my number out to a random guy and thinks what I did was so wrong and hurtful and fails to see my side of it. I need honest feedback because I cannot read between the lines on this one. Am I the asshole?",132,83,0.93

186,No A-holes here,"2 important things before I get started. 1. Me and my husband recently got pregnant. 2. My FILs wife is a truly repugnant person. 

Most people on her side of the family and my FIL side can't stand her. In fact I used to be a care giver for her mom (as a favor) so I would talk to her brother a fair amount. He once told me, ""as devastating as it is going to be when my mom passes, the silver lining is that I will never have to talk to Karen (fake name) again.""

Neither me or my husband can stand her and she can't stand either of us so they don't invite us over for the holidays and we wouldn't go if they did.

But in spite of that my husband and his dad are still really close. They golf once a week go to a lot of sporting events together will usually hang out once a week on our patio drinking whiskey and shooting the shit.

By I recently told my husband my his dad won't be allowed to babysit our kid because I don't want Karen sinking her claws into our kid. I told him his dad is welcome to visit whenever he wants but we never drop our kid off at their place.

Do I honestly believe that she will harm our child? No probably not. But I absolutely wouldn't put it past her to say little things in our kids ear to try and undermine us once our kid is old enough to understand.

But this upset my husband. He talked about how excited his dad was to be a grandpa and how we need to trust him to take care of our little one. And he mentioned how few people we have that will be willing and able to babysit.

But my position hasn't changed. Am I the asshole for making this demand?

EDIT: Since I am getting this suggestion a lot let me address it here. I wouldn't have any issue with my FIL to someone and babysit. In fact I would love it. But I don't think he would be willing to leave his wife behind for hours to watch our kid alone. And I think that would cause drama in his own life.

187,No A-holes here,"My girlfriend wants to become a freelance artist. We both still live at home, but have plans to move out soon. Currently she is making money off of commissions, but it’s not even enough to pay for her car insurance, so she is going’s to have to give up her vehicle.

I had to give up my dream of becoming a professional musician, because amateur musician and artist trying to make a living under the same house is recipe for disaster. 

Anyway, my girlfriend is so set on following this art career, and originally wanted to pursue 2D animation. Unfortunately, 2D animation is a dying business. 

I feel horrible for discouraging her from her dream, and she promised to take up a part time job until her art is financially sufficient, but she wasn’t able to work a part time customer service job living at home because of her anxiety. This worries me because our area has extremely expensive housing.

I have the mentality that our hobbies and careers should be independent, but she completely disagrees and wants to do everything in her power to make sure she works a job that she loves every second of.

Am I wrong for being worried about our future financial stability? She’s taking art classes in school right now and she’s stressed because she can’t afford her next semester of school. 

(EDIT) I should clarify, I love her art and there’s nothing wrong with her wanting to pursue that. I just wish she didn’t want to pursue it as a career and instead as a passion outside of work.

188,No A-holes here,"Gf moved in in January.  We've been dating since August.  When we agreed to move in I was over the moon about it.  Due to work I didn't get to spend nearly enough time with her.  It was a huge mistake though.

She's always been this awesome mix of sweet and sarcasm.  One of the funniest persons I've ever met and humor is my favorite trait in a person so I fell hard fast.  She was living with her parents, but being 24 it was not ideal for her.  So we talked and I invited her to move in.

It was like a switch flipped.  Right at the beginning I noticed a change in her personality.  The sweet part of her just seemed to disappear.  It's been nothing, but negativity.  I enjoy sarcasm, but when it's constant with no break it gets wearing.  There's also a ridiculous amount of complaining.  It's like she's miserable 24/7.  I'm not over stating it, if there's a few minutes of silence she will break it with the most asinine complaining.  She's also become really mean spirited.  The way she talks about her ""friends"" behind their backs just makes me feel bad for them as well as makes me wonder how she talks about me behind my back.

I've tried talking to her about it a couple times, but it always ends in a fight.  The last time she kinda pouted and said that she just wouldn't talk at all then, and to be honest I wasn't mad at the prospect.   It didn't last very long though before she sarcastically asked me if she was allowed to talk yet.

She's just become such a pill to be around, it's draining.  I don't look forward to going home after work at all anymore, and I dread weekends.  I know if I tell her to pack up it's most likely the end of the relationship, but I honestly don't even know if that's a bad thing.  The only thing that's holding me back a little is that there's this shred of hope that the girl I fell so hard for is still in there and this is just some phase or something.  It's been less than two months, I haven't really given it a ton of time.  It just feels like it's been forever.",24,25,0.94
189,Not the A-hole,"Long edit at bottom of post. 

Just wondering if this is normal or maybe I am over thinking things. So my mother in law and my husband have a very odd relationship. She was abusive when he was a child but he has since forgiven her and tried to move past it. She acknowledges that she favored her other children over my husband and she often took her anger out on him. She beat him and was just a generally unloving presence in his life. Because of this my husband is very protective of our 2 year old daughter. My MIL has never been allowed to babysit her. This is not our of malicious intent, we just don't fill comfortable leaving her alone with my MIL for long periods of time. But we do visit often and have stayed at her house overnight. 

Lately MIL has taken to showing up at our apartment on special occasions and basically staying for hours. I think she believes that we will take advantage of her being there and go out on a date or something and let her watch our daughter. Last year she showed up on my birthday, our anniversary and on mothers day (we spent the entire day before mothers day with her and expressed that we were going to spend mothers day at home with just the 3 of us. She received cards, flowers, and we treated her to dinner so it's not like we were trying to exclude her). It completely ruined the mood and several plans that we had, especially on our anniversary.

My birthday was on Wednesday. I don't like doing things for myself so my plan was to  take our daughter to jump zone (a play area filled with bouncy houses) and then out to eat. My MIL texted me that she was in the area and would be stopping by. She didn't give a time frame and didn't acknowledge my birthday at all, even though I know she knew about it. 

I was frustrated and told her we had plans to go out. We were coming to visit her this weekend, maybe we could just hold off until then. She seemed upset and then stopped replying. We were convinced she was just going to come by anyway (which she has done before) so we ended up cutting our activities short. 

Is this normal behavior? Our anniversary is in May and I really don't want her intruding. Last year, she brought a card and flowers which was really sweet but she insulted my dress, we had to cancel our dinner plans and she ended up staying for hours and demanding things. Would I be the asshole if i stressed that special occasions are for immediate family only, especially our anniversary? 

Edit: Thank you all so much for the advice. It has been so helpful and JustNoMIL has been a gem so far!! 

I just want to clarify a few things. My husband has spoken to her multiple times about this and it always ends with her in tears rushing out to her car; or her crying and apologizing for the past and just wanting my husband to comfort her and it ends up being the MIL show. He's never rude or anything but she cries at the drop of a hat. He knows her crying upsets me and I think he avoided telling her to leave on those days because it honestly makes our already ruined night even worse. 

I need to learn that no is in fact a sentence and stop letting her do whatever she wants. If I don't let her in the house, she most likely will sit in her car and cry. From now on if she cries, she cries and it's not our problem, fault or responsibility. 

I've enabled her much more than my husband has. He would be fine with not answering the door when she comes. Like I said in the comments, southern hospitality was deeply engrained in me. I've brought this up to my side of the family and they basically told me to try my best to accommodate her but I see they were wrong now. 

And she will never babysit our children. Thank you to those who understand my POV on that matter. We have received alot of grief from in laws about her not babysitting.",128,1384,0.97

Their slides still aren't done and we present on Monday. My slides are up to the top notch on the rubric and everything. 

In regards to the trailer, I told them at the beginning of this project (2 months ago) that we needed to get it done because it'll take awhile to edit due to the fact that we all have 0 experience editing and I knew they'd fuck around. 

Twice every week I'd propose a new plan to get together and film this shit to get it done. Each time I was blown off or told they were busy. It's ok to be busy but every single time I proposed it they shot me down.

He’d been talking about going vegan for a while now and how everyone he follows online says it’s changed their liv s and how they’ve feel they’ve made a difference blah blah blah

Now I’m supportive but I tell him I can’t do it. The three youngest barley touch the food I make now and the oldest are somehow even pickier . I can’t introduce a whole new menu for just him (the budget would be the same). Besides I’m inexperienced with vegan food. My “signature dish” is lasagna with beef and cheese up the wahoo’

I offered to take his bags and help him walk wherever he needed. It turned out he was on his way to the hearing clinic, a 2 minute walk away for someone my age and health. The trip ended up taking an hour, and we sat down every 5 minutes, so he could catch his breath - I didn’t mind, I was happy to help and talk with him about his life. On one of our stops, he begins telling me about how his wife died a few weeks ago, his house was broken into and the police took his license. I greeted this conversation with sympathy and let him pour out his feelings. 

On one of our last little stops before the clinic, he asks my age, and I told him I was 18, he looked shocked and I told him I don’t look 18 because I don’t dress it (I look very young and wear no makeup, coupled with track pants and men’s shirts) he then laughed and said “how do you look when you’re undressed?” i brushed his comment off with a laugh and explained to him what I meant. This was the first red flag, I’ll mention we are on the main street of my city and there are MANY people around. He was also making very blatant racist comments and telling me how beautiful my fair skin is. 

About a minute later, he starts forcefully rubbing above the crotch area of my pants, I move away from him but he continues, I took his hand off of me and told him it wasn’t okay, with a laugh, out of nervousness and I didn’t want to hurt his feelings after what he’s been through, although he responded with “why isn’t it okay?”.

After this I uncomfortably walked him the full way to the clinic and then left, I called my friend straight after and cried on the phone to him in public, not because of what had happened to me, but because this man had such a hard life, and that I don’t know who else would have helped him if not for me. I felt too ashamed and embarrassed to say he had touched me, and i don’t know if it’s my place to say anything.

198,Asshole," 

Married for 8 years. 3 kids - aged 3 to 8. We live in a large 1980's house. When we bought it the plan and my promise was to completely refurbish. We've done about half the house - thoroughly, but not too much in the last years b/c of lots of work, small kids.

My wife now insists we refurbish the kitchen. The kitchen is now over 30 years old, originally very expensive but now shows its age. It is totally usable though, and in my eyes it's not that bad, though I agree it's not what we really want. But I don't want to fix the kitchen, not unconditionally.

She has a low income job, I'm high income. She works 70%, I work well above 150%, many evenings, weekends. I pay 90% of our bills from my salary. The new kitchen will cost $100k+. This will be all up to me to pay. We've had a few rounds of redecorations earlier, with contractors, and even though we didn't do much of the actual work ourselves - all the things like making plans and detailed decisions, dealing with contractors, buying materials, etc - I had to do it. She prefers to distance herself from these projects, just wants to ""get it done"" but doesn't want to be very involved in the ""doing"".

Furthermore, I've developed this feeling that she doesn't really deserve a new kitchen. She has no real interest in cooking dinner - and thinks that I should be the designated ""gourmet chef"" in the house. Dinner is usually just thrown together in 15 minutes. She has recently turned vegetarian, which I - a meat lover- is decidedly unhappy with. But even these new veggie meals are usually just the same goop as before - minus the meat. I can hardly remember 2 occacions where she made a well-planned and tasty meat meal for me. Otherwise, her dinner priorities is it has to be quick, for the kids, for her, and I just have to eat with my mouth shut.

So I've told her that she's not getting a new kitchen unless something changes. I want her to gain interest in cooking. I want at least once a week a meal of my liking. I want the purpose for a new kitchen to get better food, not just something to show visitors. I want her to more involved in the project itself, not just showing me pictures from magazines. Things like editing work plans, find serial numbers for items I must buy, and actually talk to contractors herself and not just through me.

She oppose this. Says I owe her and promised her this kitchen. She does most of the cooking anyway (I make dinner 2 times a week), and if I'm not happy I can just cook more myself. She must have something in return for all working nights and weekends where she has been left with the kids alone, and that I act like a Scrooge. She feels unempowered since I have veto on major decisions. Since I'm paying this and has to see it through, I feel it must be done on my terms. 

We have a decent marriage, but this kitchen conflict has become sort of locked.

200,,"So for reference, my name is Shanshan. Yea I know, weird asf. It means “blooming flower” in my native language but it hasn’t done me any favors growing up in America. I got teased so much growing up and even to this day (I’m 19) I get weird looks when introducing myself. When people see my name at work on my name tag they ask me if it’s my real name. Whenever I’m ordering from Starbucks or any situation where I don’t have to use my real name I always use a different name (my personal go to is Adelina, I love that name)

I was talking to my mom yesterday and somehow the topic of names came up. I told her that she should have picked a different name for me when I was born, and she was like “why, your name is beautiful” and I was like “yea not here though” and she seemed hurt by it.

203,Asshole,"My boyfriend, 29, is a director at a youth theatre. He directs their shows and I’ve been to see a lot of them. I used to work as a receptionist/admin assistant at a performing arts school, which is how we met as his company rented rooms at ours and he chatted and one thing lead to another 

However a year ago, I got diagnosed with severe depression. I’d had it a while, but it got so bad I ended up with suicidal thoughts and had to leave my job. My boyfriend has stuck by me through all of this even though it hasn’t been easy 

So for a year I’ve been out of work. I’m at a point now where I’m better and have been trying for a lot of jobs. But none have been successful.


My boyfriend tells me his company are looking for a admin assistant and I’d be working for his boss, who I’ve met, who’s the company director.

He’s told him before about me and my struggle so knows how desperate I am so my boyfriend and I think great! Let’s put my name forward. 

He asks me for an interview. It goes great and it’s clear I can do it. However in the interview he says something which hurts me. “I know it’s been hard for you, and being second best to your boyfriend all the time can’t be easy, in terms of career success...” I leave feeling hurt but brush it off as I really want the job.

He asks me to come for a “second interview” even though he knows me well, but I do it. My boyfriend tells me there’s no way I can’t get this job as he knows what I did before. And has recommended me. 

After that, I get an email telling me I was unsuccessful. My boyfriend is confused so I write an email asking for feedback. I get a call instead, he says “Don’t take it out on us please.” I explain I’m not and my email had been professional. He says “Look, we don’t want you and that’s that. Don’t act like a spoiled child. We saw more talented candidates and even though I know you personally I can’t take someone on out of pity because they’re not doing so great”

Now this would’ve been an okay answer if I was still struggling with depression but I’m not and told him in the interview I’m ready to go back to work. The role was exactly the same as the job I had. Same admin work, literally the lowest paid job, sorting papers, taking cash from kids. Phoning the parents. I’d just be with him in an office doing that. It’s hardly “talent” so he doesn’t make sense.

I found him very arrogant.The way he spoke to me proves he thinks less of me. My boyfriend agrees he was rude however refuses to say anything as his job is important Since this guy will be in the audience in my boyfriends shows I told him I don’t want to come see them or support his work at all.

We argued and he’s mad at me because it’s nothing to do with him. But I don’t want to be involved in his work anymore. I’ve been judged and made to feel like someone who isn’t worthy of being a part of the team. Also I’m finding it hard to discuss his work whenever he talks about it

Am I overreacting or should I tell him I’m standing by this?

204,Not the A-hole,"I and my best friend are friends for more than 12 years. We are neighbors and basically see each other every day. We even were pregnant at the same time, and we both were overweight (238 lbs.).

After my second child I decided to lose weight and managed to lose 70, 50 lbs.

By then, it was already a difficult period, because she doesn´t (want to?) made the effort and I didn´t push her. But I was doing so well, that our relationship changed. I had that feeling that she thinks that I am now judging her for not losing weight. I was definitely not. I just changed my eating habits and let cake, snacks and soda untouched, when I was at hers (she didn´t listen when I told her, that she doesn´t have to serve me these things, I will not eat/drink i anyway). She even nag once in a while, because of my new behaviour and that I should go easy on that. I just thought she was jealous and didn´t want to argue about it, but sometimes her comments were just annoying. I just did my thing because I felt great for me, and sorry for her. No need to risk our friendship.

After years, our kids grew and it was visible, that her daughter (a few months younger then my son) already struggles with her weight. At one point my friend said herself, that her daughter should lose some weight, she already complains that her feets hurt. The daughter had almost 117 lbs. at the age of 8.

I tried to give some advices, carefully since our relationship is already different since my weight loss. I told her only basic things and offered my help. She was not mad at me, she mentioned it first, but she was neither happy about me not being more supportive in that way she thought I would be (to say things like “she will grow out of it”, “when it starts to border her, she will lose weight on her own”).

Needless to say, that our friendship suffers even more and that’s why I struggle with my decision. Because, I was at my friend´s house yesterday (after not seeing them for a while) and when I saw her daughter it hits me right in my face. She gained so much weight, I couldn´t believe this was even possible. Of course I didn´t say anything, I was just happy to see them. But I am really concerned about her health. My friend´s mother told me, that her granddaughter has now 172 lbs. at the age of 10. Granny is also worried and argues a lot with my friend, but she just refuses to listen.

I want to tell her to take professional help. First from a doctor, than from a nutritionist, and of course the help of family and friends.

**WIBTA to give my best friend this wakeup call even if I know that this could be the end of our friendship? Or is it just non of my business?**

EDIT:

Thank you all for your replies. All your comments are exactly what is going on in my mind since yesterday, and you are right. All of you. My friend is a very good person. A real helper and friend. She just has issues on her own (from her childhood) and I think she thinks that she can't do better. There is another big problem, her husband. An ignorant, shallow, unsupportive douchebag. If my friend ever finds the courage and strength to act, he will definitely make things even more difficult. But I think I will wait until this matter comes up, and try to start a serious conversation and just be there for them. I just don't know, why I didn't do it years ago :( ",116,229,0.96

I don’t like that now he is just waiting for me to say it. It feels like he isn’t willing to put himself out there unless he receives gratification straight away.

209,,"TLDR: Friend lied to our friend group for years. I eventually call her out on Facebook, it causes relationship issues for her.

I was in a friendship for over 8 years with a person. We were very close, but she was very manipulative and a huge liar. She made up things on the spot, even faking two suicide attempts to me and me alone (because if you asked her family-that she lived with-they had no clue what you were talking about). Some lies were minor, but as I stated before, some went too far. When we got in a fight, she’d message me pretending to be other people (her friends, boyfriends, etc.) to make me feel bad. Looking back, I wish I saved some of our conversations because they’re probably pure Quit Your Bullshit subreddit material. 

A lot of her lies surrounded her family. Now, I’m aware that a lot of this is he said/she said, but I had evidence that she was lying about being a victim of abuse. As one myself, I take this very, very seriously and it was clear she just wanted attention. Most of these “injuries” would appear after either I myself got injured/was going through something or another one of our friends did and most of the time, she couldn’t even prove they existed. She lost a lot of our mutual friends due to lies and drama. I became the only friend she had left from that time and she cut off her entire family after they called her out on BS.

She treated me like crap for a long time, then got a new boyfriend and pretty much dropped me. We’d only talk occasionally and when we did, it was all about her. Eventually, I told her I couldn’t do it anymore. She was still treating me like crap and I deserved better. She took it surprisingly well, but looking back, I think she just wanted to appear like the bigger person.

We still remained Facebook friends, though never talked or communicated. However, I can still see the stuff she posts. A few weeks ago, she made a long post about the abuse she suffered. She was getting sympathy and a lot of people that weren’t close to her back then were saying stuff like “I had no idea!”

I got a text about it from another friend and I made a comment, basically calling her out for all her lies. One big one was that she claimed to have not drank in x amount of years, but we’ve only been not speaking for a year now and I know she was drinking before then. I called out some other things that she had told me that didn’t add up to the post she was claiming as well. I told her that she needs to stop finding new people to lie to and that she takes away from real abuse victims, and that she needs to get real help.

She deleted my comment and messaged me saying that I had no right. I told her that everyone was tired of her lies. She had so many problems with people and that the common denominator was herself. She blocked me after that. Some of our friends agree with me, others say it wasn’t my place and that it’s caused some problems with her and her current boyfriend. Was I an asshole here?",20,43,0.94

211,Not the A-hole,"During dinner prep/ I was tidying the kitchen, with my wife and our kids. I went to put a coffee cup away, that has my oldest kids hand print and my youngest kids footprint. On the other side say ""Worlds #1 Okayest Dad"". She said she was offended that I never use it. I confessed while I loved the food/hand print, the message on the other side hurt a little.

&#x200B;

While it's meant to be a continuation of an joke from my Mom said I ""turned out ok"" despite every reason to not be.

&#x200B;

Maybe this is just my own reflection of how I see myself, seeing what I think is a truth my wife doesn't think (she quickly said as much). During my first born's first months, my wife was unable to get paid mat leave (another short story), I took on an additional 25 hours on top of my full time (44) to be working near or above 70 hours over 6 days a week, coming home long enough to basically have dinner with them before him having to go to bed, all just to pay the bills. I felt like crap for the 8 months I had to do it, but feel like I screwed up and while I spend all my free time with them now (and work normal hours again), I feel like I lost something I can't get back.

So seeing a travel mug that says ""Okayest Dad"" just feels like a punch, to which I confess and I she seemed hurt, she responded with ""so are you saying I don't pick good gifts?"" to which I said I loved everything else, except the message. It wasn't discussed further as I was making dinner, and now I just can't tell.

Is she right to be mad and should I just suck it up and use it?

213,Not the A-hole," So, I (mtf 31) had been a virgin up until a few hours ago I was a virgin, out of desperation I chose to hook up with a random guy on grindr. Not the romantic way I wanted too but I don't have much choice.

We decided to meet up at his place, ""while I can still host."" Which should have been the first clue but I didn't ask anything. I got to his house and it didn't really look like a single man's house and I didn't ask anything, I was really too nervous to talk let alone ask questions. I guess I convinced myself he was divorced too because he had talked about men and other transwomen he had been with, which he still referred to as ""guys"", but I didn't argue or ask questions cause again, desperate and horny.

so 45 minutes later in the middle of sex he picks up his phone and freaks out cause his wife had texted him that she was on the way home. I frantically got dressed as quietly and quickly as I could and on the way out I found out he also has an infant baby if not two kids.

So, am I the asshole for not asking in the first place and ignoring the signals that are oh so obvious now?

215,Not the A-hole,"My two married roommates have a 9 month old puppy. She is a super hyperactive large breed in a rare color they paid a hefty price for. She requires literal constant attention or she goes ballistic. She had torn up every carpet in the house, eaten the corners off all the furniture, shredded shoes, pulls food off the counter, barks constantly. One is away on frequent business trips and the other works 12 hour shifts daily. I work a lot as well but not quite that much. I take care of the dog when they are not around. 

When nobody is home, the dog is kept in a cage. Everyone likes to say crate or kennel but it’s a cage. It’s about 2 feet longer than she is and about 8 inches taller than she is. The kennel is in their closet and has a blanket on top. The dog is in the kennel whenever someone is not home. The only alternative is to leave her downstairs where she shreds everything. She is also put in the kennel at night when it’s time for bed because she will bark at my roommates faces to wake them up to play if she is not in her kennel.

Because I’m home the most, I take care of this dog the majority of the time. 

I was gone a few weeks last month. Because one of my roommates was also on a trip, the dog was in the kennel for the 12 hour shifts plus however long the remaining roommate slept. So right around 18-20 hours for several weeks (longest time was 21 hours in a 24 hour period). She was let out for breakfast, dinner, and to pee. I did not make arrangements to care for the dog because it’s not my fucking dog and shouldn’t be my responsibility. 

The other night I snapped and here is where AITA comes into play. I told my roommate that he shouldn’t own a dog because he is a terrible and irresponsible dog owner. They obviously can’t take care of it. They don’t have time for it. They put it in a cage for 12+ hours a day and don’t give it any of the things it needs to be happy. They have a baby on the way and I am moving soon so the dog will have even less attention and those 20 hour cage days will be every day. I told them the dog can’t be happy here and deserves actually training and shouldn’t have spent 50% or more of her young life in a cage because you didn’t take that into account. I told him the dog would have more space and attention at a shelter and maybe go to a home that would actually give the slightest shit about her. He flipped out and went on and on about how he loves the dog more than anything in the world and she is his best friend. I asked him why he keeps his best friend in a cage for 20 hours a day and he stormed off. 

My roommate told everyone at work a cliff-notes version of what I said and everyone thinks I’m an asshole now. I am holding my ground. 

Note: I’m aware “crate training” is a thing. Crate training is not putting dogs in a cage for all but 4-6 hours a day.  

So, AITA for confronting my roommate about his dog?

222,Asshole,"Me (25 M) and my family live in a fairly small town. It‘s one of those places where everyone knows everyone and word always spreads fast. Of course that can be annoying sometimes, but oh well.
Two years ago my little brother (16 M) came out as gay. Everyone in our family immediately accepted him, but of course that didn’t stop other people from gossiping and talking shit.

I‘ve always been very close to my little brother. He used to get bullied in school for being „too feminine“ (it‘s better now, but some guys are still rude to him), so I always saw it as my responsibility to look out for him and keep him safe from those assholes. After coming out to us and his friends, his self-esteem has improved a lot  though and I‘m super proud of him!

One thing my brother loves is make-up. From what I can see he‘s pretty good with it too (we always joke about him becoming a Youtube MUA after he graduates) and even though I don’t know too much about this kinda stuff, it makes me happy that he‘s found a hobby.

A few weeks ago, my brother was hanging out with friends and left the house with full make-up on (brows, eyeshadow, eyeliner, etc.). When he got back, he told me some guys he ran into were really rude to him and called him names. He was scared they would get violent so he just ran away. I comforted him and added that it might be a good idea to stop wearing make-up in public and just do it at home for now. He was pretty upset by that and accused me of victim blaming and trying to stop him from expressing himself. Before I could even say anything he left the room and now refuses to speak to me.

I feel like my brother twisted my words here. He can do whatever he wants as long as he‘s happy and not inconveniencing someone else. The reason why I suggested it is because I‘m scared something might happen to him. I don’t want him to get assaulted or insulted by close-minded people when he‘s outside and I‘m not there to protect him.

I put on my make up and throw on the new dress I just got and rush back out to so we can take off.

Now I'm not a bah-humbug sort of guy.

My sister started dating this guy she met at a strip club. In my mind, he was just some new dude until my mom commented on how serious they seemed and her concern with how he makes money.

Met him at my mom’s and... weird impression right away. Doesn’t make eye contact, drops your hand during handshake, grumbles instead of conversing. Gives off an arrogant thug vibe.

Mom and sis both ask what I thought and I said he made it hard to know but I didn’t like the first impression. My husband had stronger opinions. 

I’m pregnant at the time and they also move in together. So my sister starts becoming very insistent that we get to know him and asks to bring him over so the guys can “bond” over football. I refused over and over, knowing my husband, but once my child was born I felt obligated to say yes since he was supposedly excited to see the baby. Instead, he sits on the edge of the couch, eating the food they brought, not talking to us. He even left trash on the floor.

We were both so disgusted but the holidays were coming up and so we decided to be “extra nice” to him at the family gathering as an experiment. This time, my cousins noticed his weird behavior and decided he wasn’t welcome at their upcoming family party. My mom talks me through the conversation she’s going to have with him, but it never happens. 

I planned to talk to her next time we’re alone. She doesn’t drive and would take Ubers everywhere until this guy started driving her. So she’d be out “running errands” with him until 11pm and then ask to come see the baby and throw a fit when I refused, saying “he’ll only come in for a minute.” 

It all blew up when I asked her to take an Uber and come spend time us. My best friend was over and we could have girls night. She waited until she was walking up to my door to text me that she brought her boyfriend, saying they won’t stay long. I told her no, forget it, I wanted to see my sister alone. Stay and I’ll take you home. 

She then told me if I couldn’t accept who she was spending her life with, that I had no place in it. 

My mother didn’t talk to me for three days, then told me it was my responsibility to fix my relationship with my sister. That they’re going to get married and have kids and it’ll be my fault if my kid grows up without an aunt. That my sister and I didn’t have a great relationship growing up and now I’ve ruined our progress. That the guy didn’t do anything bad enough to warrant being banned from my house, and I hurt his feelings. That he treats her so amazing and she’s finally happy, and now I’ve ruined that too. That she is so excited to finally be an aunt. She really made me feel like shit. Meanwhile, their pictures on social media make it seem like they’re having a great time.

After months of radio silence, I’m feeling like I might be the asshole. 

Am I?

229,Not the A-hole,"A little backstory, my wife has become vegetarian a few months ago and I have changed my diet to support her. Both our families are meat eaters, and as my sister has young children I sent her the menu weeks in advance to see if it was OK, to which she replied ""I don't think they'd eat any of that, but don't worry I'll get the kids something"". A few days before I'd also made a general remark to my mother that we (as a human race) don't need to eat meat, as she'd asked what kind of food was going to be there.

Fast forward to the day before, my wife and I spent a lot of time and money preparing a wide variety of vegetarian dishes such as pizza rolls and quiche, with other finger foods and snacks. We'd also been planning the party for a long time, getting a cake made, hiring a hall and arranging a soft play for all the kids.

It gets to the day and the whole time my mum is making strange comments to me about the meat industry, asking if we've made our cats vegetarian too, and even goes up to my wife with some chicken they brought, and goes ""mmm tasty chicken!"". All of this was quite rude I thought, but ignored it as we were there to celebrate our son turning 1.

My mum, step dad and sister all come back to ours afterwards to present a gift to my son, where all hell breaks loose. The three of them begin shouting at us about how we are ""imposing our values"" on them and how we didn't give them a choice for food. This all apparently stemmed from my flippant comment about not needing to eat meat, which seemed to have been marinating in their minds ever since. 

My sister's point was that they always accommodate us whenever we see them by preparing vegetarian dishes. My point to them was that the food wasn't the main focus, it was just an extra. The  party was supposed to be about my boy. The whole argument got so bad that my wife was crying and now we don't speak to any of them.

Please let us know... AITA? We're really trying to work out if we were in fact assholes for not preparing any meat dishes. My wife is very much against the meat industry so wouldn't have bought any meat anyway, but they wouldn't accept that either. We didn't realise a 1st birthday party would come down to what food we provided. My wife's family didn't even care about the food.",418,348,0.89

231,No A-holes here,"Alright please bear with me, we've been dating for about 3 months and it's been going great, I really like her a lot but we can't have sex.

She suffers from Vaginismus which basically a condition where muscles in or around the vagina shut tightly, making sex painful or impossible.

I should note she *never* mentioned this to me once before we attempted, I don't really expect someone to tell me this on the first date but at some point, it would've been appreciated. 

It's about a week into the relationship and she invites me over, one thing leads to another etc etc

We're in the bedroom and it just isn't happening, she looks close to tears so I immediately stop and ask what's wrong, did I do something? 

She then explains her condition and I tell her it's alright and we stop for the night.

Since I now know about this, I don't initiate sex at all, I wait for her to lead, not all days are the same and some days are better than others.

A week later we try again and it's the same story, so we just mess around, do oral, cuddle etc

I suggest we go to the doctors as she's been too shy to go before now, we go together and they show us some relaxation techniques and some exercises that can help you gain control over the muscles. 

She's given herself a strict exercise routine that's she's stuck too for nearly a month now.

She's feeling confident so we try again, it's better than it was before but I can tell she isn't enjoying it and it just makes me feel bad when she's noticeably uncomfortable, so I stop.

I thought to myself this is likely going to be a long term thing so I thought about maybe using some toys to spruce it up a little while she works on her exercises. 

I order a fleshlight and don't tell her, I wanted to surprise her, I also picked up some small toys for her that she could enjoy.

She invites me around the weekend like she normally does and I bring my new gifts, I explain we could maybe try them out and see if we can enjoy ourselves in other ways. 

Well, she flips the fuck out and starts crying and screaming at me, I was taken aback, I didn't expect this type of reaction at all. 

Her main argument was ""Am I not good enough for you!??!"" and ""How do you think this makes me feel?"" She didn't really just say much else, just continued to bawl her eyes out. She runs upstairs and slams the door. I try and talk it over but she's having non of it.

Honestly, I'm kinda annoyed, I thought I was doing every right, I've supported her continuously through this and she has the cheek to say I don't care. 

I got up, left and went home, I haven't heard from her since.

Our table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.

Got home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.

10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).

10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm

11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.

It was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...

She came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...

236,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway for this post. Backstory

Dec 2017, my bf\[27M\] and I talked about getting engaged. I gave him a link to my pinterest with ring styles i liked, and left it at that, expecting him to propose.

for context, a lot of my bf's friends were getting engaged and he was helping them plan and execute their proposals-- and he seemed to enjoy doing so. There was one friend, however, who decided to propose at his gf's home in an ""ordinary"" manner ( which is great if thats what youre into!) My BF, however, thought it was lame because in his mind proposals are grand events. He made it a point to mention this to me...god knows why.

&#x200B;

Anyway, one day in his car he pulled over after our date and started saying sentimental stuff. my face lit up because i thought this was gonna be him proposing.... On seeing my reaction, he laughed at me. Said he wasnt proposing at that moment, but watching my reaction was ""hilarious"". This was right around christmas time.

Fast forward to February and he announces we're engaged?  No proposal. Instead, his family came to my familys home and asked my parents for my hand (which is tradition).  He tells me to pick out a ring online and use his credit card to pay. I did pick out a ring  (but ended up paying for half of it myself). His family then mocked me for my choice of ring (I didnt want diamond, went with moissanite).

Anyway, its a year later, we've since gotten married.  i voiced my dissatisfaction with how the engagement happened. He wants to ""re-do"" the proposal, but i told him I dont want a ""re-do"". He thinks that makes me an asshole (not letting him fix his mistakes). AITA?  


Edit: I dont keep bringing it up to him. He's the one caught up on it because he gets embarassed whenever he's asked about how he proposed. Thats part of the reason i dont care for a re-do. He would be doing it to save face rather than to create a special moment (if that makes sense)",42,76,0.92

239,Not the A-hole,"So my SIL calls me during the day to put forward an idea for throwing In-Laws a wedding anniversary party and a general excuse to bring the whole family together. I think it's a great idea and dispite the fact my In-laws haven't treat me the best I do love party planning and the rest of my husband's family are so lovely. 

So she tells me she wants it at a local venue that has a huge beautiful hall and good catering. I agree it's a good setting. She then tells me she will organise contacting everyone invited making calls ect. Devise a ruse and bring parents to the said venue. She will do everything so my husband and I don't have to worry about a thing. Could we just handle the venue? 

I say sure what would you like me to do? Get prices? Sort the menu options? Book a date? 

She informs me she wants to pick the menu. But yes could I cover the costs. I'm like, wait up? What am I doing? She tells me I cover the venue she will sort out everything else. Ends the call. 

So confused I relay back to my husband I'm unsure of what exactly she's putting into this? Also worth mentioning this particular venue and catering are about £1000 for the amount of guests possibly coming. 

Hubby calls her up later to try and figure out what she means. Baisicly she wants to plan and organise the party but we have to pay for it. 

She lives at home rent free and has no children or commitments at the age of 33. 

My husband and I have a house. 2 kids and various bills and simply cannot spare this amount of cash on a party. She's insisting we are being awful people and that we don't care about or appreciate them.

She's funny, charming, and attractive.  I thought I'd hit the dating jackpot.  At no point during any of these dates did Sarah mention having a child.

Well during our most recent date we went out for drinks and a few minutes after we sat down Sarah came clean.  She admitted she has a daughter from her previous marriage, and that she was afraid to tell me because she knew I'd turn her down if I had known ahead of time.  I asked her if that was why she had no reference to her daughter on her profile and she told me she'd been turned down so many times because of her daughter that she had to make a new profile.  She said she figured that if I got to know her better she thought I could overlook this ""no kids rule"" that I have and be happy with her.

I told her that I couldn't just overlook this.  I paid for our drinks and left.  She sat there quietly staring into her drink as I left.  I didn't hear from her until this morning when she texted me asking if we could talk.  I told her there wasn't much to talk about, but that I recommend she be more honest in the future to avoid hurt feelings.  She told me I was being a selfish asshole and that my hatred of kids was a very ugly trait.  I blocked her.

In the lot, there’s a garbage can, but people still use the edge of it as a dumping area. E.g. There’s an old toilet, lumber from recent constructions, and random litter. 
 

Today as soon as we go to the lot, from across the street, this old lady leans out of her window and yells, “Are you going to pick up that dogs poop?” And I said, “She hasn’t pooped yet, but I always do”. Then she said she was asking if I’m going to when she does go and I said I always do again. “I’m a good neighbor!” And we both chuckled. My dog pooped and the lady was still leaning out of her window. Feeling as though I was being watched to ensure I was going to pick it up, I felt irritation boiling under the surface. Once she was done going, I leaned over to pick it up, and to my surprise, there was a crack vial next to it. Utilizing the bag, I picked the crack vial up too and held it up so she could see. Thinking I was waving dog poop at her, she goes, “I don’t need to see it” while smiling, and I said “oh, I’m showing you the crack vial. Did you happen to catch the person that left that?” And her smile dropped and she just looked at me. I said, “Yeah, I’m sure next time you’ll lean out your window to make sure they pick it up”.

247,Not the A-hole,"I (18m) have been dating my gf (19) for about four months. We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. 

However, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like ""she's dirty"", ""kids are all feral"" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. 

Recently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. 

This really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. 

Also at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.

On the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of ""kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is"".

250,Not the A-hole," I'm(20F) currently attending university in the US northeast, and I share a townhouse style dormitory with 7 other girls. The A/C in the house is controlled by 3 thermostats, one per floor. My best friend recently got a boyfriend, and he sleeps over in her room every night of the week (we have single rooms).

Some new girls moved in this semester, and they like it cold, so my friend and I bargained with them that they wouldn't move the dial past the middle mark between ""Cold"" and ""Hot"". Cool, we all agreed that if someone is too hot, they open the window in their room to let in the freezing air outside. Glad we could agree.

I noticed a week later that in the mornings I was waking freezing in a bed covered in 3+ blankets. I told my friend about how I keep finding the A/C dial moved to halfway or all the way ""Cold"". She casually told me that when her boyfriend comes over, it’s too hot to sleep, so she and he have been moving it down at night. I was baffled. She and I just told other people to stop freezing us, and she turned around and was the one doing it now!

This started in January. I asked her at least twice a week to stop for reasons including:

1. We told the other girls not to make it cold, so you shouldn't do it.
2. They agreed to open their windows if its too hot, why can't you?
3. I don't sleep in pajamas, maybe you guys should try sleeping with no blankets or clothes to reduce how hot you get.

Her corresponding responses were:

1. But I can't sleep when it's hot, and someone keeps turning it up in the morning, so then I wake up. (Plot twist I was the one who was turning it back up to half way)
2. Well <boyfriend> said that if we do that then the heat is just going to turn on more often, so I figured it isn't worth trying it out. (There’s no way of knowing where the temperature reader is)
3. Maybe sleep with more clothes on? I've slept in long sleeves and pants since I was little, and I'm not going to change now. (So why do I have to change?)

Fast forward a month, and I was convinced by my boyfriend to buy a space heater because this petty argument is not worth having for 3 more months. Now I'm comfy and warm in my room regardless of what the other girls adjust the A/C to. I even had a conversation with her about why I bought the heater, and she said she felt bad.

Today, she messaged me and said something along the lines of ""ugh <boyfriend> and I didn't even sleep together last night, and the other girls turned the A/C all the way cold. so annoyed with them making it cold all the time"". I just froze. Was she seriously complaining about other people making it cold in the house at night when she ignored my complaints for a month?

I responded ""Well I unfortunately have no sympathy for you when it comes to the A/C bc you and <boyfriend> forced me to adapt to the cold, so the cold no longer effects me and I dont care about it anymore.""

AITA for telling her that I have no f\*\*ks to give and blowing off her complaint?",141,857,0.95

After telling her to put on her pants she ignored him and kept running. Then he told her something like ""that's nasty; you need to wear pants."" I gasped from the kitchen where I was preparing dinner and said, ""That's not nasty. There's not one nasty thing about our baby girl."" Then I told my daughter we are about to eat and we wear pants at the dinner table in case we spill hot food on ourselves and she put on her pants and helped set the table. My husband says I shouldn't contradict him in front of her. I explained that he should tell her it's too cold to be without pants or it's unhygienic at the dinner table, but not to use the word ""nasty"" as I don't want her to feel shame about her body. He explained that he is her father and when I contradict him in front of her that undercuts his role in the family, and I said, ""And I'm a mother and a woman. I protect her like you do too but I also know what it's like to have  a complex about your body and that's not what I want her to even think about at 3.""

252,Not the A-hole,"This story needs a lot of context so buckle up. So my parents have been separated since I was a kid and I grew up with my (awesome) single dad.  My mom was (and still is) a crazy narcissist with a bit of redeeming qualities that make her bearable. When my parents were still together she was abusive and living with her sucked.  I know now that she is a survivor of sexual abuse and a generally fucked up childhood so I have worked on understanding and forgiving her but our relationship over the years has been fraught, including a couple of times that I’ve gone NC.

When I was 22 my dad passed away suddenly, leaving no will (or money to his name because disabilities suck). Unfortunately my parents were still legally married so not only can she call herself a widow, but she is also able to collect his Canadian pension (total bullshit since she cheated on my dad and left with the guy on his Harley in the most dramatic way possible 15 years prior).  I guess she was grieving, but when I think about it all I can remember is her basking in the attention of being a widow. She talks about him now and cries. I really don’t know whether she’s just putting on a show or not, but it seems genuine and like I said I’m really trying to love her so I’m taking her at face value.

About a year ago my paternal grandfather passed away and I knew there was going to be some drama about the 6 figure estate so I didn’t tell her. She has implied for years that she “deserves” part of my grandparents estate. This has always made me furious. She already collects my dads pension, its been 8 years since he died so that’s almost 30k in money that she did absolutely nothing for! 

Finally today she asked me out of nowhere whether my grandad was still alive. I didn’t want to lie about it so I told her yes, it was a bit ago and I didn’t want to bring it up. First thing she asked was “Well what happened to the estate?” so I told her it’s gone (truth, it’s settled, she soa) and that I didn’t really want to get into it. She immediately started crying and acting like I just stabbed her in the back or something, telling me she ought to just never call me again, that I must not want her around. I know what she’s doing, but I still feel terrible. I was involved in the divvying of the estate and ended up getting 1/3 of it. She would absolutely lose her shit if she found out what I received. I don’t think she would ever forgive me because I’m guessing she would think I “stole” it from her. I don’t even think any of this stuff with my paternal grandparents is her business at all but she seems to think it is (and that my exclusion of her implies we’re not family). Honestly I just want to have a normal relationship with my mom, but she is making this almost impossible. Did I cross a line by not including her? Am I the asshole?

She said, ""why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died"".

258,Asshole,"Ok so I know how this sounds but I have to know because it’s really getting to me.

So my sister is four years older than me and right now she is living at home having just left University and is looking for a job. When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don’t know how my parents didn’t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She’s come a really long way since then and I’m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I’ve never been depressed or self harmed so I’m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can’t even begin to imagine her point of view.

However around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it’s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I’m being selfish by saying that because it’s not about me but it’s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I’m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don’t know how to fix this and I need to know if I’m being unreasonable.

Edit:

Thank you to lots of people. You put this in perspective for me in a way that I never could have done on my own. I’m an idiot. A massive fucking asshole. I thought that because I loved her it meant that what I was doing was the right thing for our relationship. I want to clarify that they don’t make me ‘uncomfortable’ they just make me want to sob and hug her forever. But yeah, that’s my issue as many of you stated and I have to deal with that without shaming her (which was never my intention). I’ve read every single response to this throughout the day and I want to thank people for their honesty. My sister always refused to talk about it because she didn’t want to upset me and that’s her choice. For now I need to book a reservation at her favourite restaurant and apologise. I will reply to as many comments as possible.",248,1436,0.94
259,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because I don't want to risk getting identified by people i know who use reddit. Last year my dad discovered that mom had been cheating on him with one of his close friends. The only reason he found out is because his friend's wife snooped through her husband's phone and found old convos between him and my mom. my dad was hurt and devastated like i'd never seen before and that affected me deeply. she had been cheating for almost a year apparently and in the months leading up to them being found out my dad's friend was trying to break the affair off. This explained a lot of things that were going on at home. My mom had been acting very aggressive and was extremely unpleasant to be around during this time. she said some very hurtful things to me due to my appearance (i am overweight), me going to community college because i couldn't get into a decent uni and my lack of friends/social life. 

My dad kicked her out of the house not long after the initial shitstorm. Mom went to live with my aunt and she's been there ever since, but yesterday she called dad and told him that she needed a place to stay because her sister was going to move and wants mom to get her own place. She said that she can't afford an apartment right now and that she wanted to come live with us again. My dad told me right off the bat that he had no desire to live with mom again but that he wouldn't keep us separated if i wanted her with us again. 

I haven't spoken to my mom since the day she moved out. She sends me texts every now and then but they're always ridiculously long and I rarely read them and I've only replied a few times. To be honest I am still very hurt due to how she treated dad and how much she hurt him by betraying his trust. I am still very angry at how she took it out on me and dad when her affair was going sour. I am still very angry at how depressed and anxious i felt because i thought that there was something wrong with me, that i was making her unhappy and that's why she was constantly attacking me and putting me down. i don't think i can ever forgive her for the way she treated us because the man she was fucking  wanted to end things and she didn't.

i told dad right away that i didn't want her anywhere near the house again. that i wasn't ready to be around her again. 

but last night i had a lot of trouble sleeping. i feel guilty and petty for saying no, and it makes me fucking angry that i even feel this way because i truly do not want to see her again. i hate feeling responsible for what happens to her. I am dreading having to work today while feeling like this. 

do you think i am taking things too far by telling dad not to let her live here again?",45,123,0.95
260,Not the A-hole,"It's basically a fundraiser from my daughter's daycare. The winning amount gets free tuition for a week. The mother gets the winnings, not our kid.

:: Background:: The mother is my ex. I pay close to a grand in child support a month.

Update; I decided to support the fundraiser, mostly to keep the peace. The mother and I aren't on great terms so I'm reluctant to help her directly but I'm justifying it as a way to help our child indirectly.",30,42,0.88
261,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because of normal reasons.

Some background for this first, my partner and I have been together for a while (like over 5 years). We live together, but the last few months have been tough. We've been having a few issues and we've both been working together to hopefully change our relationship for the better and get past this.

&#x200B;

Also relevant is the fact that I had substantial disabilities, physical and mental. I don't use the mental ones to excuse bad behaviour, but it means sometimes I have to do some damage control if I feel like something will cause a flare up of symptoms (I'm in therapy to try to manage it the best I can). The physical disabilities mean that I can't do some things that other people would do without thinking, like cooking food.

One of the changes we have made is for him to go out with his work friends whenever they have plans. As long as I have enough notice to sort out something to eat, I try to have it as a rule that I'll never say no to any of these plans. If I can make it work I will, because I understand that he needs his space and some freedom.

Last week I had to break the rule. He scheduled something for thursday. Valentines Day. Once I realised it was Valentines Day I brought it up, and he said he didn't realise that it was Valentines on thursday, but he still wanted to go. I put my foot down and asked him to reschedule, feeling that as a couple we should be spending Valentines together and that sitting at home alone on Valentines would be a magnet for mental health issues, and would be very upsetting. I asked him to reschedule it (since apparently nobody in the group realised the date) and he did so.

&#x200B;

They rescheduled it into two separate meet ups. Both this week, Wednesday and Friday. Not the easiest thing but I thought manageable.

Then Tuesday night my grandpa died. It hit me hard. I was close to him and loved him very much and he deserved much better than the end he got.

&#x200B;

My brother came around Wednesday so my partner still went out. He told me it wouldn't be a late night, but he ended up later home than expected, so I was on my own for a few hours. It was bad. I always find my mental health symptoms are worse at night, which combined with exhaustion and grief left me a wreck. It was incredibly distressing and I wish he had been there for me.

He's meant to be going out again Friday, and this time my brother won't be there. It'll just be me, on my own all evening. I know these evenings are important for him, and I already said no the first time. I also know that the group probably won't reschedule it for him (bit different to valentines when a lot of the group couldn't make it). But I'm hurting so much and I don't want to be on my own. WIBTA if I asked him to cancel and stay with me?

&#x200B;

If I am the asshole, please be a little gentle, I will accept it but it's been a rough few days.

Edit: Thank you to everyone that replied. This post did exactly what I needed, it allowed me to see from different perspectives and decide what was best. I spoke to my partner. He offered to stay, but we ended up compromising that he will probably still go, but plans to leave a little earlier, that way he still has the important time for himself but I'm not alone for the whole evening.

262,Not the A-hole,"UPDATE!!! 

We’ve talked it over. He’s very sorry for his inconsideration, and he has made arrangements with an Italian friend to replace it ASAP so I can give my gift. He understands why I’m upset and understands why it’s not OK and he can’t keep ignoring boundaries even if it’s without malice. We’re gonna label snacks and ingredients with yellow stickers if he needs to ask first, because it often happens without thinking about it. He genuinely is upset for his behavior. Thanks for all your advice! 

Ps. Please no SO bashing. This is just one shitty thing he does and I have my fair amount of asshole behavior too I’m sure, like always leaving empty containers etc next to the sink instead of tossing them even though he’s asked me to just toss it. It’s not because I have a blatant disregard, it’s just forgetful / neglectful on my part. 
 

Original post:

My SO is a giant, so of course his hunger levels are different than mine, I buy a lot of snacks and I cook enough to feed the Russian army. And occasionally I bring back special foods from our travels to give as gifts or get some gourmet snacks from special stores for us to enjoy with some wine.

And my SO eats everything, repeatedly, without asking or sharing. I've kindly asked him to not take all the special snacks as I wanna enjoy them together, and to stop eating gifts we bring back. Sometimes he also eats ingredients I need to use in a meal, like a tub of sour cream. He promised many times he'd be more attentive of what he grabs.

&#x200B;

Flash forward, we've just come back from Italy and I got some fancy meats for a friend of mine there. I put it in a gift bag, audibly and repeatedly said it's a gift, and placed it in the bedroom so it wouldn't get eaten. I woke up this morning with the sausage almost completely gone. I am angry, like, *really angry*. He's said he's sorry, which I'm sure he is, but I really want to label foods. 

&#x200B;

Green = *take whenever*, yellow = *meant to eat together*, red = *don't eat it*.

&#x200B;

I'm worried it'll come off passive aggressive and like I'm hoarding stuff, and I don't wanna make him feel bad for needing to eat, but I also want to find a way for us to not have to have this argument anymore. Would I be the asshole for labeling foods?

My sister and her 2 children live in the next city over. Sometimes they come to stay, and as we only have a 2 bedroom home, I let my sister and her kids have my room and I sleep on the sofa, which I’m fine with. However, I ask that they only come to stay when I’m not working the next day, as I struggle to sleep on the sofa. 

My sister was originally supposed to be coming to stay Friday and Saturday night this week, which is fine, as it’s my weekend off. However, I was informed this morning, they they are now coming tonight too (Thursday).

I have work tomorrow, and was never asked if this was okay. It was just announced. 
So now, I have to sleep on the sofa tonight too. 

I mentioned to my parents how it would have been nice to be asked at least and now I don’t really feel it’s fair that I’m expected to sleep on the sofa and get a shitty nights sleep when I have work the next day.

He spends money at bars - and he says it is “me time” but then we don’t get to do things like buy groceries or do laundry.  I made him a Christmas and Valentine’s day card and painted him a picture of his recently deceased cockatiel for Christmas.  I used an amazon gift card money and bought him a valentines gift.

I found free things to do tomorrow and told him a week in advance what they were and that I’m excited for our late Valentine’s Day.  The past two nights he has spent a load of money at some bar he won’t tell me the name of and hasn’t shown up until 5am, drunk as shit.

268,Not the A-hole,"I walked in to the tea room in my workplace today to find two colleagues who I generally get on very well with, who are a married couple, in the middle of a conversation regarding outlandish workplace pregnancy rumours that had them in stitches. 

Almost as soon as I entered the room, they added me into the joke, laughing that maybe I’m pregnant.  I felt like a bit of a stunned mullet.. it was pre-7am, I just came in to put my breakfast in the fridge, and suddenly I was the centre of a joke that had origins way before my time.

The husband (Dave) had a quick laugh and moved on, but the wife (Susie) carried on with the conversation, noting that I frequently ask to be moved out of areas at work using xray, am of childbearing age, and often complain that I can’t eat first thing in the morning because it makes me feel unwell.  Dave actually said to her ‘stop now, or this rumour will stick’ and others said the same, but Susie carried on, thinking she was being hilarious, and getting payback for me briefly hiding her pen yesterday.

As we all know, fake pregnancy pranks are rarely funny, and you often don’t know what people around you are going through in regards to pregnancy and fertility. I know, for example, that one person who was present, but not involved in the conversation, fell pregnant when we were at school, was forced into terminating by her parents, and regrets it.

Personally, I love kids and desperately want my own.  I am very aware that the way things are going for me it seriously might not happen, and that feels like a failure, but I try not to let on how upsetting it is for me.  So I tried to get her to knock it off by joking ‘are you saying I look fat?’ (As an aside, I’ve previously told them a story about another totally oblivious colleague who, while talking about how pregnancies seem to come it waves at my work, asked if I was pregnant. I wasn’t offended that she asked, and laughed it off by replying ‘no, I’m just fat’, but WAS offended when she didn’t believe me!)

Unfortunately, Susie didn’t take the hint to knock it off.  Someone else said quite bluntly ‘pregnancy rumours aren’t funny, you don’t know what people are going through’ and I chimed in ‘right! maybe I’ve been trying to get pregnant for years’ but she still tone-deafed away, laughing ‘I’ve got three teenagers, which one do you want?’

So I lost my shit.

Told her ‘well aren’t you lucky to have had three kids.  Not that it’s any of your business, but I’d desperately love to have a child but it really looks like it’s never going to happen and I worry that the miscarriage I was so relieved by when I fell pregnant at uni might have been my only chance. But sure, laugh it up, I’m sure I’ll have a super fun time explaining to all the people who hear your hilarious story that no, as much as I’d like to be pregnant, I’m a big ol’ barren failure and Susie was just having a funny joke. hilarious! look how we’re all laughing!’

then I finished strong by telling her stunned face to get stuffed (I know, harsh words) and turned heel.

AITA? I feel like I overreacted, but then I also feel like she was given plenty of opportunity to take a hint before I blew up at her, and clearly wasn’t going to let up.

Recently shes been walking around saying that nothing scares her, and that she could watch any horror movie. Shes saying this because i freaked out at a scene in hereditary recently and she scared me. I wanted revenge.

So I went into my moms closet and found an old porcelain doll and placed it in her closet with my friends baby monitor hidden behind it.

Then at night I stared into her room and started talking into the monitor.

""Come play. Come play. Come play""

When she gets close I smash the doll against her window and say.

""YOU CANT GET RID OF ME BLPBLPBLPBLPBLP""

It doesn't get so bad that I can't function but I will twist myself in unnatural ways to try and rid of the pain. It has caused me to pass out numerous times, however. 
My dad hates it when I try to take ibuprofen and the like and says I should only take it when I really need it and that I'm wasting it, but I do take them rather sparingly.

272,Not the A-hole,"So this past winter break my good friend from college, Caroline, invited me on a 10-day trip to Germany. 

I knew Caroline “studied” in Germany for 3 weeks during summer while she was 15.

We arrive in Germany and she says she’s reconnected with a friend, named Jack, from when she studied there and she asked if I’d be up to meet him. I said sure.

Jack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack’s friends, Paul. She’s so into Paul that she’s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. 

For the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn’t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. 

I’ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. 

The next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.

Apparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if “he still felt anything” AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. 

I refused to apologize, I told her I’d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.

It’s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she’s still demanding I apologize for being a “slutty bitch” and “ruining the trip.” I see no reason to, but she’s being so insistent I’m starting to wonder if I’m in the wrong.

273,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

&#x200B;

My husband has... or, had a cat which he adopted several years before we got together. We've since gotten a couple more, but he always considered that one to be his original fur-child. I loved her too, which is why it guts me to share what happened last week as I was returning home from work one night.

&#x200B;

The cat is a full black cat, and she roamed around outside often - something that I always didn't like and made me nervous, since we live in a fairly busy area where there are a lot of cars going by. It was dark when I was driving home, it was night by the time I got off work and as I was coming down the street she darted across the road just outside our house, I didn't see her in time and... you already know what happened.

&#x200B;

I felt absolutely horrible and I immediately parked the car in the driveway and broke down in tears. I couldn't even look at the cat without wanting to vomit - she was definitely dead - so I went inside, and my husband was also out at work so I was desperately trying to calm down and figure out how I was going to tell him. A couple hours later I'd calmed down a bit and was trying to draft up something to say, when my husband storms inside and starts yelling and swearing, going on about how some fucker ran down the cat, saying he was gonna be the shit out of whoever did it, etc. I understand he was just angry and really upset - normally he's the calmest person I've ever met - but at that moment his rage completely shocked me and I just sort of froze up, and I didn't have the heart to tell him I'd been the one to kill his precious cat, even by accident. I was worried he'd turn that anger on me, so I just let him think it was some random person and grieved along with him when we got her out of the street and buried her in the backyard.

&#x200B;

That was about a week ago and the guilt has me eating me alive, but I feel like saying something now after all this time would be even worse than admitting what I'd done right from the beginning. So, AITA for not telling the truth to my husband about his cat?",50,64,0.87
274,Not the A-hole,"So I've been vegan ever since I could cook for myself, coming up to 13 years now, nearly 14. I'm a bit of a foodie, I love going out to eat and seeing what new up and coming veg options there are because it's 2019 - times are changing and I'm living for it. 

&#x200B;

My 25th birthday is coming up soon. My mum created a group chat on Facebook that was family and about 20 of my closest friends so we could discuss some birthday plans. We all (most of us anyway, it's a lot of people to get in one place at one time) decided on a date fairly easily, and when it came down to venues etc, I was asked where I wanted to go. There's a new vegan restaurant in my city that I haven't been to yet. They've got veggie steaks, chicken, roast mock meat, pretty much anything you'd get at a fancy restaurant, but vegan. And it's cheap, maybe $30 for a meal and a drink. You'd be looking at $50+ anywhere else. So being the food obsessed being I am, I suggested it. I tried to sell it a bit, linked the menu to everybody and pointed out the diversity of it and that there was something for everyone - even people with allergies and intolerances.

&#x200B;

Mum called me up seconds later and yelled at me for not being inclusive of everybody, and that I needed to pick somewhere else. I asked what she meant about being inclusive, and she screamed down the phone that I was being insensitive and nobody wanted to eat my ""rabbit food bullshit."" I told her anybody can eat vegan food, and she babbled on a bit more and gave me three options for my birthday - two of which were steakhouses, and the last option being a restaurant with nothing vegan on the menu except a quinoa salad. And honestly, if I wanted a quinoa salad I'd make it, not buy it for $28. 

&#x200B;

She told me I can forget the idea of having a vegan cake - they were going to make a ""normal one"", and then buy me a cupcake from the local vegan bakery and stick a candle in it while everyone else had ""normal"" food.

6 Family members and 9 friends left the group chat too, right after complaining about my suggestion??? Honestly, I feel sick to my stomach. It feels like my own birthday has been taken away from me, and nobody's respecting my boundaries. I don't think I'm being unreasonable here, but the fact that all these people have taken an aversion to this event has me doubting everything.

275,Not the A-hole,"Im 6'8. Very tall by most people standards. I get a lot of looks in public, the occasional joke. Some more enthusiastic strangers will call me big guy.

But I have never been asked to be ridden around (by a stranger) before until this weekend.

I went to the zoo with my visting cousin and her husband, plus my sister and my friend. Thought it was kinda lame but whatever we did it on the spur of the moment.

While we're walking from exhibit to exhibit a small asian girl keeps following me at the heels, closely followed by her family. I saw what looked like a dad with another girl on his shoulders pushing a stroller with another baby, an older woman holding an asian boy, another middle aged asian couple, then two old asian men and a granny. Plus some kiddos running around like the one following me. So a big family that would laugh and giggle every time they looked at me and i looked at them.

A little more background, we are all in Texas and I was wearing cowboy boots and a hat (you dont have to say it i know i look good). 

I believe they thought i was like a tourist sighting, like a giant cowboy in texas. I dont mind that at all really. Im not self conscious.

However it got weird when one of the asian women approaches me and says ""You hold her on your shoulder"". While smiling and pointing at the kid.

She wanted me to do what the dad was doing with the other kid so the little girl could see into the gorilla pit while also getting to ride me.

The girl was very young and had a binkie so i thought she also had diapers and i didnt want diaper neck or someone on my head. Plus id need to take off my hat and carry it around and it was just a hassle.

So I say ""Oh no thanks.""

""You pick her up so she can see.

""Oh no thanks.""

""No you pick her up its ok.""

""No thanks.""

I dont think she understands english very well so I start shaking my head from side to side and start saying ""No"" forcefully.

The little kid starts pouting and crying and the asian family start giving me mean looks. Then the grandma pulls a zoo worker aside and points to me, at which point i assume they realize that im not a zoo attraction for tourists. But it was just awkward and my sister just said i should carry around this kid on my neck.

277,Not the A-hole,"Am I the asshole for asking my husband not to grab my boobs? He rarely initiates a kiss with me, or cuddles with me, or never cradles my head in his hands anymore, but usually goes straight for the boobs, fondling them and burying his head in my chest. He does this as soon as he gets home from work. He does this while I cook. I've asked him to stop repeatedly, that I don't like it, that it makes me uncomfortable. Especially when I feel he ignores my face just to bury his head in my boobs, like when he comes home from work without saying hi or kissing me hello. We've been married 5 years, but this behavior probably started within the last 2 years with increasing frequency.

He does this again tonight, tries squeezing them, and I start to shrink in on myself as I again ask him to stop. He asks why. I say it makes me uncomfortable. Again he asks why. I repeat my phrase. We do this about six times. He says that's not a good enough reason, and we're married, and I should stop being such a prude. My reason that it makes me uncomfortable is not enough, and I have to provide further justification as to why I don't wish to be grabbed at - justifications that I've provided in the past, but I've realized it's my body - I shouldn't have to provide a justification beyond ""it makes me uncomfortable,"" right?

Now he's being all pissy (didn't talk to me for an hour), asking semi-sarcastically ""is it okay if I touch you now?"" before kissing me goodnight (for once - I usually kiss him goodnight) and basically makes me feel like the bad guy. Am I the asshole?

\*EDIT\* Thank you for your responses so far and for the suggestions to cross post. It was suggested that I clarify a few questions that keep coming up:

1. I've asked for kisses and hugs and hand-holding and cuddling instead, numerous times.
2. I've explained that that when he focuses so intently on my chest it makes me feel like he only cares about my body, not about me. I've been told that my boobs are a part of me, so he's still giving me attention.
3. I've said this behavior makes me feel like an object.
4. I've said that it hurts me physically when he grabs me like this, that my nipples are sensitive, and that I feel like he's not listening to me when he disregards my wishes like this.
5. I've said my body is not his, and he calls marriage: what's mine is his and vice versa. 
6. We (currently childless) want to have kids, and I've said that I don't want any child to witness this behavior as acceptable/normal (""well we don't have kids now..."").
7. I've even ""compromised"" (from my POV) and asked for that the boob-nuzzling /honking be limited to the bedroom!
8. I even sat down with him and went through this whole list and how this behavior makes me feel ""disrespected,"" which stopped it for like 2 weeks. And then it slowly resumed, but his reactions still make me feel like the asshole

278,Asshole,"First time posting on this sub, but this has been a point of contention between my sister and I and need some advice. I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.

Lo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.

Regardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it’s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they’ve been going out for roughly 6 months).

Am I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that’s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. 

TLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won’t go if he’s not included, they’ve only been going out 6 months.",112,89,0.92

I’ve talked to him about why we don’t eat meat, he loves animals and agrees that animals are our friends and we don’t want to kill them when we can eat other stuff. My son is happy and healthy but of course it can be challenging sometimes when he’s around other people who have non vegan food. He sometimes stays with my parents and up until now as far as I’m aware they’ve stuck to vegan food with him, even though they don’t agree with it. 

I went away last week for a few days and left my son with my parents. When I got back they told me that he wanted to try cheese so they let him. I was really angry because firstly he could have reacted badly to it, and secondly they destroyed my trust with them. They told me I was overreacting and that it was unfair of me to deny him from trying things. I told them they can forget about looking after him if they’re gonna go behind my back and do stuff like this without talking to me first.

283,Not the A-hole,"This is way past history for me.  No longer with this person for other reasons but quite curious what you all might think.

I'll try and keep this as objective as possible and try to just keep it to the facts of what happened.

I'd been partnered up with this person a little over a year.  We had shifted into a house together.  She had a kid, I had three.

I had/have a shared care arrangement with my ex wife.  It's bit unorthodox but basically every other weekend and every Wednesday night the kids stay with me.  Ex wife, kids and I were all happy with this.  We'd been doing it for several years.
As well as this, for every day every other week I'd take the kids after work and give them dinner at my place, then return them home at around 7:30pm.  A bit of a strange schedule but it worked for us.  (She had her child on a regular week-about schedule.)

A point to note is the new house was further away from my ex than my previous house.  So the commute to take the kids home each night was a bit longer.

After a while my new partner voiced her frustration with the schedule, saying it was hard to organise things when the kids had to leave early each night.

It then came to a point where she asked me to change the schedule to a classic week-about arrangement.  She directed it solely at me so I guess I was supposed to say ""okay"" and then convince the kids and the ex that this was a good plan.

I was very much against it saying that the kids, ex and I were all quite happy with how things were and didn't really want to change it.  She wasn't very happy about that.

We were seeing a relationship counselor at the time (things weren't great between us), and I wont' say the counselor took her side but it felt like it.  He agreed that we should change the schedule.  I felt hurt that the counselor would jump to that decision so easily without weighing up that there were more people involved here than just my partner and I.

Anyway, was I the asshole for not wanting to change the schedule?",15,36,0.96
284,No A-holes here,"My ex wife is a perennial fuck up. She’s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I’ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I’ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can’t even support herself. I don’t wish to hurt her. In fact, I’ve forgiven her for who she is and what she’s done. 
Fast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We’ve paid for the dress. We’ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, “Who is your hero and why?” 
My daughter says, “Do you think I should say, ‘my mom?’”
I said, “ You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom’s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it’s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It’s harder to be a parent all the time.” 

I’ve never derogated their mother. I don’t want to cripple their image of her, but it’s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don’t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them.

When I asked her why her mom was her hero, Her answer was, “Because she does things for me and takes care of me,” which isn’t remotely true. That’s why I told her the things we did for her.

285,Not the A-hole,"My ex and I have been divorced for over ten years and he has had custody of the kids for the last six years.  I pay child support, and an never late and routinely pick up the tab for additional clothes and sports fees and other outings.

Two years ago my ex took me to court to get more child support, but he didn't figure on the judge ordering me to pay for the kids' insurance, which is exactly what she did.  The monthly amount I pay doubled, but my ex didn't get any increase.  As a matter of fact he now has to split copays and any thing not covered by insurance with me, including braces.  

When this first occurred and it didn't work out in court like he thought it would, he told the kids that I had taken him back to court to try to pay less and that I convinced the judge to let me pay for insurance.  He told my daughter that her braces weren't covered with the new insurance and they were going to come ""take the braces out of her mouth"" bc of what I had done.  

He initially refused to tell me how much the cost of the braces were, and I advised him that the court order says I am to see a bill before I pay.  He then had the orthodontist's office call me to tell me the total cost.  We agreed that I would pay him half the monthly payment each month.  I paid him that amount (in money orders for proof) until November.

In November, I was short on time so I gave him cash instead of a money order, but also at that time I had another envelope of money to pay a different bill.  I slipped up and gave him the wrong envelope, with almost twice as much money in it.  He texted me and asked why I had paid him so much extra money.  I told him I had made a mistake and needed to swap the envelopes back and he refused.  He said I owed him for other doctors visits.  

(My insurance offers several services for free, but he takes the children to a different provider and has to pay. I told him I wasn't paying for half that bc there is a perfectly fine free option and he chooses not to use it.)

So after this, I just started paying the orthodontist directly instead of him.  My children have berated me for not paying their dad the money ""like I'm supposed to"".  AITA for not paying him, and paying the provider instead?

Update: I paid the orthodontist today and sent him a receipt.  First he told me that I still owed him money for other doctors' visits.  I explained to him that the insurance that I pay almost $500 a month for offers free appointments for what he paid for.  He didn't call the insurance and find out about these options, he just took the kids and paid.  I told him that since he chose to do that, and not use the free option, I would not be reimbursing him.  He then said that I needed to call and make them appointments.  I told him that I am not gloomy to do that bc he has the same info that I have and he knows what appointment times will be best and I do not.  He told me he would see me in court bc I wasn't paying.

When the first met my son and the girl got a long great they'd hang out with another boy after class and all was good. Near the end of the year my son was to be her one friend she got to invite during her sisters birthday party. I was invited to stay as well and I got along ok with the mom. The mom seemed to have to decided that since our kids were best friends we were besties too. I am a single mom, I already have a strong group of friends, plus I work, go to school and volunteer. The mom seemed very put out that I didn't have time to do weekly dinners and such. I tried to when I could, but other than the fact that we both have kids we have nothing in common and I just never felt like we clicked as friends.

My son and her daughter had been butting heads since the beginning of the school year (grade 5). They had been put in other classes and my son had started to make other friends, but still spent most of his time with her. She had begun lying about a whole bunch of little things to get her way pretty much constantly (I had witnessed this behaviour on multiple occasions) and after months of calling her out on it and giving her many chances to stop doing it my son stopped being friends with her.

After a few days of my son refusing to give in and bring her friend again the mom called me up and demanded to know why our kids were fighting because her daughter told her she had no idea what was going on - there is no way she didn't know my son called her out on it almost everyday. At first I played dumb because I didn't want to get involved with a kids fight, but my son told me to tell her what was going on so I did. She claimed that her daughter didn't lie and must have been playing around and my son took it the way. I told her that they'd figure themselves out and I am not getting involved. The mom seems to think that I am not doing enough as a parent by letting him throw this friendship away.

While I was out this morning my mum decided to spray the rose with some water, despite having been told that it's preserved and doesn't need water.

I come home with my girlfriend to find my rose sitting there looking like it's wilting. I am hugely upset by this and I want her to pay for the rose as its quite pricey.

This is where some context comes in.

About two months ago both her and my grandmother went halves on a new car for me and I am paying her back $200 with every paycheck I get (which is about a quarter of my paycheck, with the rest going into bills and savings).
Today happened to be one of her pay days (from me as she is unemployed and not actively looking for work) and I took out the cost of the rose from what I owe her for the fortnight. She immediately got angry and demanded the rest of the money. Its emotionally affected both me and my partner and is continuing to do so.

My older brother was always very aloof about how well he was doing. He went to a good college and got a high paying job and for years he made more than me while I was struggling. He is in real estate. When I was looking to buy my first home I asked him for advice and he gave it to me, but then sent me an invoice.

300,Not the A-hole,"Background information: I'm 21 and he's 28. We’ve been dating for a little over three months and things have been going well. Since we’ve started dating, we’ve split everything 50/50; food, entertainment, travel expenses and so on.

&#x200B;

So I started a college internship in January where my manager is based in another country, so I have to fly over once a week. I’ve been over about eight times so far. One of my family members usually picks me up from the airport, but my boyfriend picked me up once when I was stuck. He also offers to pick me up nearly every time, which I always turn down because it’s far out of his way and I usually land quite late, although I do appreciate him offering.

&#x200B;

That brings us to today, I’m currently working in the other office and am supposed to be flying back tomorrow. My boyfriend texting me saying he wanted to come get me from the airport. I have to admit, I melted a little. He’s going away this weekend and we weren’t going to see each other, so I thought this was his way of seeing me before he left, which was sweet. However, this message was followed up quickly with a ‘you have to give me money through’, meaning for tolls or gas. I honestly thought he was joking at first, so I responded with a laughing emoji. He then came back saying that I’d be asking him for money if I doing the same (I don’t drive but always meet him halfway places using public transport so he’s not always picking me up by any means). I turned down his offer because my dad had already offered to collect me, and now we’re not really talking.

&#x200B;

Am I wrong for being annoyed by this? I just feel like it’s unfair because he was the one who offered in the first place. It's not about the money, it would have only been a couple of euro.

&#x200B;

Edit: We talked, I explained that I was uncomfortable with what he did, which annoyed him. He said he won't offer in the future and that it was a stupid thing to be mad over. I think we'll be having a long chat when he gets back from his trip. Thank you everyone for the insights!

&#x200B;

Edit 2: Little update, things have gone from bad to worse. I tried to talk to him again today, more about him dismissing how I felt then the money thing. He ignored what I was saying and responded with 'I’m leaving this to you to work out. If you need anything from me, let me know. I am not bothered by it and I think the whole situation is silly.'' and ''I do value you but i draw a line when it comes to spending energy.'' That chat is happening tomorrow now. ",236,455,0.97
301,Not the A-hole,"Quick background: Husband, toddler and I recently moved to a very WASPY suburb. We live in a neighborhood that is essentially an enlarged cul-de-sac. So when the weather is decent, we will come into contact with our neighbors a lot.

Now, to the not-so-quick WIBTA issue at hand.

A neighbor (who I have yet to meet in person) sends out an email in early January on behalf of her Girl Scout daughter, letting neighborhood email distribution (yeah, I know) know that daughter is selling cookies and if we want to order them, reply to email and ChasePay her money. I reply with some pleasantries (""new to hood, hope to meet you soon!"") plus my order of many boxes of Thin Mints and others. Sidenote: I LOVE GIRL SCOUT COOKIES. I look forward to them every year. I need them to get me through the misery of February in the Midwest.

Neighbor never acknowledges payment or order. I email her days later to confirm. She responds days later, apologizing. A month + goes by. I start seeing those delightful colorful boxes around my office. This past Thursday, she sends a neighborhood-wide email that daughter will be at X grocery with cookies for sale, in case anyone missed the original order opp. I respond asking when the pre-ordered cookies will be available. No response. Two days later, Saturday, she responds that they already picked them up. Period. End of email. Nothing about delivery or pick-up, or how the fuck I can obtain my cookies.

I respond right away asking if they'll be delivering them or what. She responds days later (Monday AM) that she's super busy at work and can maybe drop them off this coming Sunday (over a week after they've received the cookie shipment), or she'll put on her front stoop and I can pick them up any time. Great, I respond, I will pick them up right away. No response. I go to her house that evening and there are no cookies on the stoop. WTF. I don't want to be totally psycho and ring her doorbell, so I leave and send a follow up email. This was Monday PM. SHE STILL HASN'T RESPONDED. I sent another one this AM...nothing.

Now I'm sure many of you are thinking I'm overreacting about these cookies. Maybe neighbor lady has something serious going on. Etc. Fair points. But the communication around what is supposed to be a fun and light-hearted thing (Girl Scout cookies) -- which, by the way, her daughter (the Girl Scout) has had nothing to do with, even though I'm pretty sure the cookie selling is supposed to empower the child's entrepreneurial skills or some shit -- has been infuriating to me. AND I NEED THOSE THIN MINTS. And I paid for them already. WIBTA if I showed up at her house demanding my cookies??

TL;DR: I'm obsessed with Girl Scout cookies. Ordered and paid for many boxes through new neighbor child's mother. Bizarro lady is stonewalling me and ignoring my polite and friendly requests to pick up what is rightfully mine. WIBTA if I show up at her door unannounced?",168,605,0.97
302,Not the A-hole,"Let me start this by saying that I love dogs, and I’ve always wanted my own for a long time. My roommate and I started living together in August,  and things started out great. We have known each other since we were kids, and always got along very well. But these past few months she has stopped cleaning up after herself, and at one point her cats litter box hadn’t been cleaned in about 2 months. After asking her for a week straight to do it, I finally got sick and tired of gagging every time I walked into the bathroom so I had to do it myself, literally scraping cat poop out of the pan. I also always have to feed her cat, because my roommate sleeps 11-12 hours a day and only gets up at 15 minutes before she has to leave for work. She already has a ball python which I reluctantly agreed to, and once when I was gone for 10 days she trashed the place, leaving me to clean it all up. One of her friends dogs is having puppies soon, and when she asked if we could get one I finally put my foot down and said no. The apartment is only so big, and there is no back yard for the dog to run around in, since it’ll be a Husky-Lab mix it’ll need a lot of room to run. My roommate got really angry and has been very defensive, even saying “I’m just like her mom when I argue” and that she “deserves this dog” and when I say she can get her own dog when she lives in her own place she said that “she wouldn’t spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars by herself on a dog.” So what do you guys think? Am I being an asshole?",50,29,0.87
303,Not the A-hole,"This just happened. I've been on the computer all day getting work done and light surfing. My GF of 10 months came in the door and asked me ""Have you been wasting time on the computer all day?"" I said ""No"" to which she replied ""Let me see your history."" and grabbed the mouse. I took the mouse back and said ""browsing histories are private"". She got upset and started crying ""You know I have trust issues!"" We've never had a problem in our relationship in regards to faithfulness or anything close to it.",216,376,0.97
304,Not the A-hole,"I'm generally one of the belief that women should have autonomy regarding their bodies, which is why this is a hard one for me.

Originally when my wife got pregnant I thought nothing of her continuing to smoke, because it was my understanding that as it became more socially acceptable of a habit more research had been done that showed it was safe to use during pregnancy. However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.

When she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and ""letting"" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she ""knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative"".

I feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?

Thanks for your consideration.

Edit: For clarification as I'm seeing in some comments I may have left some info out, and hopefully to paint my wife in a better picture (she's absolutely wonderful in every other sense): we did of course seek help through the OBGYN and exhausted all options before she asked as a last resort (phenergan, unisom, vitamin B6). She's been to the ER multiple times just to get IV fluids because she's dehydrated as she can't keep down food or water. She's sick and desperately wanting anything to help her out of her situation and she knows that cannabis has helped her nausea in the past. Not trying to absolve her completely but I think context matters. As for me, I was pretty sure this was the response I would get (and I thank many of you for your contributions outside of the judgments), but sometimes when you're in the situation an outside unbiased source can give you insight you didn't have yourself, and I wanted to make sure I wasn't being an asshole to my wife.

We've since had a discussion and we're both on the same page. I'm fairly certain she knew it wasn't best but was just desperate, which is understandable. Thanks again everyone.",358,862,0.94
305,Asshole,"Alright, so there's this teacher st my high school, T. He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, ""inappropriate"" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.
Now, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. 
One day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of ""Have you ever considered killing yourself?"" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? 


EDIT - I think I need to give a bit more context about my teacher and clarify a few things. First off, pretty much everyone knows him as the jokster teacher and know how he's like. Next, I take back what I say about inappropriate remarks, as what I mean by that were like racial stereotypes and other politically incorrect stuff. Ex. I am asian. He makes jokes about stereotypical asians, knowing I am in the class. The R-rated movies were inly shown in my AP Human Geography class, where 10 of the 12 students were seniors. He showed Full Metal Jacket, Lost in Translation, and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. They all somewhat related to what he was teaching at the time. 
Now as for my friend, after this incident, when I say I got mad at her, what happened was that I asked her about what happened, she explained, I was sort of shocked/suprised that she thought he was serious, knowing that she has already had him for a quarter and knows what he is like, and then just tried to explain to her he wasn't, she got mad and left, we haven't talked since. I am mad at her now because she got him suspended, and doesn't understand that T wasn't serious. 

2nd EDIT - to all those who say T is a shit teacher for having to resport to these methods to appear cool in front of his students, you've got it wrong. It's not like all he does is crack jokes and show movies. I would say that the movies apply mostly to my class with all the Seniors. T is still engaging without going off topic. When he teaches history, he tells stories, asks insightful questions about the topics, basically, stuff a teacher does. His style of teaching is more engaging for the class and he does call people out too. This other stuff about the racist jokes and comments etc. are just things he does while teaching to get a laugh out of the students. He doesn't do it maliciously. 
Also I am on mobile, so there are probably a few typos. ",159,179,0.86

308,Not the A-hole,"So for a little context I have a bearded dragon called Smaug (she's a girl btw) and I've only had her for a year, she's around about 4 years old now and I'm deathly protective of her. 

I live with my mum and my brother who is around the same age as me, I have another brother who is younger though (he's 8) and he doesn't live with us but stays on the weekends. When he first saw Smaug he was kind of captivated, I told him he could look through the glass but her couldn't get her out unless I was there (I didn't want him accidentally drop her or something) I also made this fact very clear to my mum as she also likes to look at her, they both agreed and understood. Recently though I've been spending a lot of the weekends at my boyfriend's as that's the only time we get to see each other, and after coming back from my boyfriend's I find Smaug terrarium a mess. There is dried up vegetables everywhere and a whole box of crickets in the terrarium, obviously I was very mad so I confronted my mum about this, she said that she thought Smaug might be hungry so she threw a box of crickets. literally. now I get it touching the crickets isn't my favourite thing in the world either but you don't just throw a whole box of them in the terrarium with her. I told my mother this and I showed have the proper way to put the crickets in and that I'll tell her before I leave if she can or can't feed Smaug. If you don't know older bearded dragons don't need to eat bugs as much as younger ones do, you can give your beardie a lot of health problems if you do over feed them. A couple weeks go by and I come home to the same thing, messy terrarium filled with crickets. So now I'm even more pissed, my mum has a very bad habit of not listening to me at all. So I did the logical thing and I bought a lock for the terrarium. When I got home after the first week of using the lock my mum wasn't happy, she asked me why I had to go and buy a lock and that my brother was really upset that he couldn't feed Smaug anymore. I told her that if she wasn't going to listen to me I couldn't let her keep going into my room and trashing smaugs terrarium. She didn't seem happy with this but didn't say much else just that she thought I was being selfish. so am I the asshole for not letting my mum and younger brother trash my lizards terrarium?",35,117,0.95

312,Asshole,"I (22F) am currently in the midst of a *disagreement* with my boyfriend John (26M). The disagreement is mostly about my close friendship with a guy named Cody (23M). 

Cody has expressed attraction to me before, and I am also fairly attracted to him (he’s an attractive guy). I’ve never had any sort of sexual encounter with him, mainly because even when I was single I wasn’t a huge fan of the way that he tends to sleep around casually a lot, and because I think that sex can complicate friendships and I don’t want that. Cody and I are very close friends and are open with each other, and since I initially told him I wasn’t interested in sleeping with him he has never tried to initiate anything. He completely respects the fact that I said no and the fact that I’m in a relationship. We have a really strong friendship and I can’t imagine cutting him out of my life, but neither of us have any sort of romantic interest in each other and we treat sex extremely differently and understand that about each other.

Last week, John asked me if I was attracted to Cody. I said yes, because it’s the truth and it would be a trivial thing to lie about, but that it’s not a big deal. John asked if Cody was attracted to me and again I said yes, and that Cody and I are pretty open with each other about that kind of thing but that it’s not a big deal and nothing would never happen. John told me that he was uncomfortable with the fact that I still hung out with him, and that Cody was probably trying to fuck me. I tried to explain that we’d been friends for years and that he was really trivializing a good thing because of one insignificant detail, but he basically said that Cody has a history of sleeping with a lot of girls (true) and that he probably only wanted sex from me. I got mad, because Cody’s a great dude, and yeah he gets around but only with single women who also only want casual sex. It’s not like he goes around lying to women or sleeping with people who are in committed relationships, and he completely respects that I don’t view sex the same way as him and supports my relationship. John basically acted like I don’t understand men and said that he wasn’t comfortable with me hanging out with Cody anymore because I was clearly too naive to see what’s going on. I said that he has no right to tell me who I can and can’t be friends with, and he told me I was being insensitive about his feelings. AITA?

Tl;dr: My boyfriend doesn’t want me to hangout with my best friend anymore because he thinks he only wants to fuck me, but that isn’t true and I’m not going to stop hanging out with him

Edit: For context to people who are saying I should already know this stuff, this is my first serious relationship. I chose not to date during college because I had a job and a very demanding major. I’d appreciate if you took my questions seriously instead of assuming I’m just trying to weasel my way out of a judgement. I’m fine with being called an asshole but unless you help me understand where I’m going wrong I won’t know how to try to change my line of thinking in the future.",166,71,0.82
313,Not the A-hole,"Brief backstory is my MIL (mother in law) has been a widow for about 4 years now. She is 50 and in great health. Once she became a widow she has turned into the biggest mooch. I swear this woman should teach a class how to mooch. She has been given free trips all around the world (NYC, Vegas, Newfoundland, Chicago..to name a few). She also has completely stopped buying groceries. She either eats out or weasles her way into free meals at people's houses. 

For the last 4 years she arranges visits to see the grandchildren around meal times in order to get a free meal. She has NEVER visited her grandchildren unless it's a meal involved in the last 4 years. Sometimes she comes about an hour before a meal, eats, then leaves to go to another function, which leads me to believe she only came for the food not to see the kids.

She's a very picky eater. I've gotten to the point that I'm resenting feeding her. Ive started making food I know she dislikes on purpose to deter her but then my husband gets upset with me. If we order out when she happens to show up for a meal she will have the audacity to place her own special order. Example we order pizza but she wants a order of ribs on the side and you guessed it, never pays a cent. 

Then to top this all off, the woman expects me to wait on her. She won't even carry a dish to the sink let alone help me clean up after a meal. 

AITA for telling my husband I'm done and visits need to be place outside of meal times? He tells me most people wouldn't care as much as I so and that I'm being unreasonable.

EDIT: This has gotten much more attention that I expected. To answer some common questions:

1) she is financially stable. She has recently purchased a $30k SUV as an example. She works less than full-time by choice due to other monthly income flows. She is comfortable in the same lifestyle she had before FIL death. 

2) she does not babysit our children as she feels she has already 'raised her children'. She will watch them an hour or two once and awhile though. So there is no real give or take in this situation which has been asked.

3) ""all over the world"" when I mentioned mostly US cities seems to have hit a sore spot for people. Isolated Canadian here. Should of said ""all over North America focusing mostly on the USA"". Sorry.

4) she is mentally sound. She is not depressed. She obviously misses her spouse but she's not living in a crippling depression. She uses her adult children for meals as well as her friends and other family members.

5) before FIL death they hosted all meals. She would cook. She knows how to cook. She cooks and hosts 0 meals now. 

6) we are paying for our groceries and take-out food when she is here. I'm not sure why I've been asked if I'm paying for it. Yes? My husband and I both work full time and have a joint account. We are paying.

7) I'm not in a poor relationship with my husband because I've tried to keep the peace with my widowed mother in law but after 4 years and visits dwindled to
 only around a free meal is what brought me here.

8) we have been at her house occasionally when a meal time approaches. She tells us she has nothing to cook, and she means it. She may have fruit snacks for the kids but we usually just leave to eat.

314,Not the A-hole,"FIRST OF ALL, when I say send her screenshots I don’t mean like “Look what you’re son said”, I’m talking about more of a “Oops, wrong person kind of message”. I would be real slick about it 

(M 18) I was in a group chat with a bunch of friends and we were talking about the upcoming lacrosse season. All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, “Why do you sound like such a bitch?”. I thought he was just messing around and I said “Why don’t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?” Because he’s short and skinny. He responded with, “That’s why I’m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend”. 

My jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren’t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)

I told him that he went way too far and he just said, “Don’t talk shit then”. He’s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don’t know what to do or say. 

I know it might be a shitty thing to do but I’m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven’t taken any side yet. 

We all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he’s making my blood boil and it’s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. 

TLDR: My friend made some extremely rude comments about my girlfriend who is going through chemo and he’s not remorseful. I’m trying to decide whether to send a screenshot of what he said to his mom to get back at him

Edit: Showing his mom what he said would be the least destructive thing I could do, I could ever post him smoking Newports at a party or packing a lip of chew in class , but that would be irrelevant.

Edit 2: I’m thinking about just putting it on my Snapchat story so people in my school see it, I don’t want my girlfriend to see it tho so idk 

⚠️Edit 3/Update ⚠️: I gave him some time to chill out and he still insisted that I shouldn’t talk shit if I can’t handle it. The only thing he said showed a little bit of remorse was (this is the exact words and spelling he used) “My B, I might’ve been a lil foul but you shouldn’t start talking shit if you can’t handle what people have to say”. I took the screenshots of what he originally said and I took screenshots of our current conversation and told him “If I hear (My gf’s) name come out of your mouth one more time I’ll expose you to as many people as I can find”. He tried to say something about going too far and I told him again that I wasn’t going to do it yet, and that all he had to do was not cross that line again and nothing was gonna happen. He shut up real quick and hasn’t said anything again. 

My only question after this whole experience is if you say something and you don’t want others to know that you said it, why say it in the first place?",415,640,0.94
315,Not the A-hole,"Little bit if background: we dated for 3.5yrs. The relationship ended in July of 2018. 

So my boyfriend and I just started going out again in January. Things were awesome at first, he really seemed like he had changed. In the past he was very manipulative, disrespectful and downright cruel. But when we started seeing each other again he apologized for everything and said he wanted to be a better man. So, maybe foolishly, I believed him.

Around the end of January he got notice that his work territory would be changing and he could need to move west. He’d still be in the same state but about an hour or so west of where we both live now. He says he wants me to move with him. I told him I’d think about it but that my career was in a really good place and I wasn’t sure if I wanted to uproot myself especially so soon into the renewed relationship. He said he understood and we could do the “long distance” thing instead. 

About a week later he blew up at me saying I wasn’t committed to him and to us because I wouldn’t move. I told him it just didn’t make sense for me to change my life completely to be in a relationship that already blew up once. He called me a stupid selfish whore and stormed out of my apartment. 

We made amends and he apologized but now I feel like the relationship is as rocky as ever. Last night I went out with some girl friends and when I got home at 9:30 he was getting into bed. He barely said hello to me, didn’t ask me how my night went (I tried to ask the same to him and he kind or brushed me off) and didn’t thank me for making dinner for him before I left. He just went to bed. This is so par for the course and I’m over it. 

TLDR: ex and I have been back together in a tumultuous relationship for around 2 months and he wants me to quit my job and move to a new city with him.

316,Asshole,"I've recently started dating someone (though we've been friends for a long time) and we decided to take a weekend mini-break, but were having trouble picking where to go. I was having drinks with a friend of mine, and she mentioned that she and her boyfriend were spending their 10 year anniversary in a small town/village, around an hour outside of London. It sounded like the perfect destination, as neither my partner nor I had been before and it was very convenient to get to. 

By coincidence, the weekend we'd chosen to go away was the same as my friend's anniversary trip. My partner asked if I thought they might have a problem with us going to the same town on the same weekend as them. I said it wouldn't have bothered me in the reverse situation, and I doubted they'd care either. Yes, it's a small town, but we weren't booking the same hotel or anything. I doubted we'd bump into each other. 

   We booked the trip and I mentioned it the next time I saw my friend. She froze, went very quiet, and became awkward for the rest of the evening. That night, I received a long, angry, text from her (usually, very placid) boyfriend. He said he couldn't understand why I'd chosen to book the same holiday as them, and that I had in effect ruined their anniversary. He also claimed that they when I'd mentioned I was looking for a place to go, they specifically asked me to chose somewhere else, though I honestly have no recollection of this. I think they were mainly upset that I'd decided to take someone I've been dating for two months on the same trip they'd planned for a significant anniversary. 

 I called to apologise, and he did accept, though he also insisted on providing me with an itinerary of the restaurants they'd booked over the weekend so we could make sure we'd avoid being in the same place at the same time as them.

We spent the entire weekend on edge, worried we'd bump into them, and frankly it ended up spoiling our trip since we were so anxious about it.

317,Asshole,"I don’t know how to flag NSFW, I’m sorry if I mess up

So I am a university student 18 (F), I frequently hang out in a lounge for students that an acquaintance of mine 19 (F). I like her but sometimes she has troubling behavior and doesn’t listen when you tell her to stop doing something. The lounge is a pretty public place and is mostly great to hang out.

But my acquaintance has recently liked to show me NSFW material without my consent, mostly those that she has drawn or animated on MAYA. The conversation usually goes like this;

A: hey can I show you something I drew
me: sure
A: -shows me the pornagraphic material she drew-

Most of the time this porn is shown in a humorous way, but it just makes me uncomfortable. One of the porn she showed me depicted a teenager (low teens). I have told her multiple times that I’m uncomfortable with it and she just doesn’t listen. Once I said that I didn’t want to see something that she drew because I was working and she just showed it to me anyways.

I just want her to stop doing it, I like her as an acquaintance but what she does makes me uncomfortable. Would I be an asshole if I talked to a professor or Guidance counselor about this?

Edit: Thank you for all of your responses, you are right I do need to stand up for myself more and be more firm. However, the reason why I said a guidance counselor or a professor was because this is my first year and I am still getting used to college life. I am sorry for the confusion",86,128,0.91
318,Not the A-hole,"My husband plays PC games in our office on the weekends. Fine by me, couldn’t care less. I love my alone time. What does bother me to insanity is the noise of his mechanical keyboard. I am sensitive to ambient noises: chewing, clicking, certain music etc... 

I brought up my issue with the noise with my husband and he blew up at me saying that I was making him feel guilty for doing something that is fun and important to him. 

My side is that I feel uncomfortable in my home and feel like I can’t relax in our office (a shared space and arguably the best room in the house). 

I would never expect my husband to give up gaming, but I’m doubting my ability to cope with an integral part of that activity.  WIBTA for asking my husband to give up the keyboard? Are there some PC gamers out there that could recommend a compromise? 

EDIT 1: 
Thanks to everyone for the keyboard recommendations! I will bring these up with him. 

In response to some requests for INFO: I do spend time in other rooms to avoid the noise, but he plays almost all day. I feel like I’m shut out of the best part of the house (our office) all day every weekend, and he feels I am being overly sensitive to noise and need to figure out a way to get over it.

320,Not the A-hole,"So last night, we all went out with friends. I was fully ready to pay for my meal, which was wings. I ordered a side fries because I thought everything came with fries, but it ended up being an extra $2.99. He offered to pay for my meal and I told him what I ordered and he seemed okay. I ordered another beer and told him I’ll pay for that one (has a fun and tonic and a beer in total). Then a while later he says “why don’t you pay for your own meal. Didn’t think you’d order all this stuff” (literally fries and a beer). I got upset at the table, like I was just quiet and wasn’t smiling much, just drank my beer. He got mad at me when I told him why I was upset. Fast forward, we talked it out and everything seemed fine. I looked at the bill and asked him what I owe him, and he said “don’t worry about it”. WHAT THE FUCK. Then he gets MAD at me and won’t say he loved me when I told him goodnight. I gave him every opportunity to let me pay!!! And now he’s still upset with me, the next day, that I “expect” him to pay. Which I never did, but I think it’s rude to offer to pay and then just retract your offer and get mad at the person when they get upset. I offered to pay for the extra things but he still got mad!! It’s $12 more which I was fine with paying. Not only that, he left a hefty tip and the bill came to $80, and he expects me to pay $40. I was never even discussed the tip amount. I literally am broke after buying him things for Christmas, his birthday and Valentine’s Day and he knows that. Am I the asshole for being upset?? 



Edit: he called me and turned out he just needed space today to be by himself and that he stopped being mad a while ago. He said he probably should’ve just told me earlier because it caused me stress. He was apparently just upset last night and he regretted being so harsh, and that the prices weren’t a big deal in hindsight, but last night things just piled up in his mind. He says he felt pressured to pay and shouldn’t have offered since I was fully ready to pay for myself. Thank you everyone for the advice and insight! ",92,275,0.94
321,Not the A-hole,"So recently, my long time SO and I broke up. When we started dating she was my boyfriend, but she came out to me as trans. I really wanted to give it a try because I loved her- but we found we weren’t sexually compatible anymore, so instead of dragging the relationship out and resenting each other we decided to mutually split so we could maintain our friendship. It has been so much better now- and it almost feels like I gained a sister rather then lost a partner.

Here is the problem. We had been living with my parents and paying rent. I had been on disability and could barely afford to live, and then my family needed help financially so we paid a good amount of rent and everyone was fine with the arrangement. They called my SO their family and loved her.

When we broke up, we obviously planned on her finding a new place to stay. Sharing a room was a little tight for us anyway and we though more personal space now that we weren’t dating was good.

We didn’t even get a chance to tell my parents that.

Less than 24 hours after we broke up my parents said she had 2 weeks to get out. I was shocked because they had never been hostile to her before- and they couldn’t even wait a few days to tell us she needed to move out. My ex is really hurt by this- her family was not supportive of her coming out and my family had become her adoptive family. She feels like she lost yet another family.

I tried to talk to them about this and they just said ‘this is hard for us too’ and wouldn’t talk to me at all. Luckily we have a friend who happened to have a spare room for a good price offer my ex a room so we are moving her out in time, but my feelings are really hurt.

I didn’t expect her to keep living with us- and it’s their house so I respect their rules- but we paid rent and having them spring this on us less than 24 hours after we broke up really has caused a rift between us. 

So, AITA for being really upset with them? I’m honestly having a hard time imaging how I’ll forgive them. 

EDIT: also- we had been together for 10 years so they had known her for 10 years. 

EDIT 2: my parents have also said they do not want me to leave because they need the money I pay for rent. ",35,74,0.93
322,Not the A-hole,"Yesterday I struggled through the work day and afterschool activities with a migraine. I havent had on in quite awhile so it really took me off guard and I did not handle it well. As I tossed and turned trying to sleep last night I realized the migraine is most definitely stress related. I then tossed and turned in my mind about whether I should take the day off tomorrow (now today). At 5 am I got up to send my boss an over thought out text and planned on going right back to sleep. Of course then the alarm clock in my bedroom goes off to wake me up for work (to which I just called in to) which then woke up my toddler crying. 

But its all okay, I'll just get the kids up and off to school/daycare early and then I can enjoy an almost full day of well overdue alone time. 

Then my phone rings. It's the automated  phone line from my kids school. They've left a voicemail.  Another snow day. That means no school OR daycare for my kids. And that means... No school for my friends kid. 

Just as I have processed that my day off alone has become the exact opposite of what I had planned, a message from my friends spouse pops up in our group chat damning the school for closing yet again and asking what our plans were for our kids. Which is an inadvertent way of asking if we are staying home with our kids and if we will keep their kid too. 

The school has had at least a dozen 2-hour delays and snow days combined this year so far. Each one of them that we were asked to keep their kid we did. No questions asked. They work 8-5 jobs and didn't have any time to take off work. My spouse and I have had a little bit more flexible work days lately so we didn't mind helping when we could. We also understand that making childcare arrangements on the spot like that is hard, add in the fact that they don't have any family around here to help.

Except today. I just wanted to be left alone and recover from my migraine in peace and quiet. I can still recover some it by being a bad parent and letting my kids stare at a screen all day. But if I said yes then the third kid in the mix will change the whole game. Kids will be kids, and kids will be rowdy and needy. 

I decided not to respond to the message until my spouse was awake to talk about it. In the two hours that passed my friends spouse called and texted my spouses several times. We agreed I was justified in saying no to watching their kid today, especially since I already am tomorrow after school while they work. My spouse responded to the text explaining that they had to go to work and I had a migraine and couldn't. Between then and when my spouse checked their phone as they walked out the door for work my friends spouse called another 2 times. 


Am I being an asshole? Or was it okay for me to be selfish and try to salvage the remains of my day off? I was fully capable of watching their kid, I just didn't want to today.",33,105,0.95

324,Asshole,"So right now both of my kids (16 year old son and 9 year old daughter) and my ex are extremely mad at me because I won't give up my appointed time with them. My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. 

&#x200B;

A little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't ""switch"" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. 

&#x200B;

Well, last week my ex contacted me and told me the ""good"" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to ""think of them"". I told him ""tough luck"" and hung up on him.

&#x200B;

Well, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying ""ask them"" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was ""not letting daddy take them to Disneyland"". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.

&#x200B;

I'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being ""can't tell them the truth cause they already know it"". 

&#x200B;

I'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? ",5310,23212,0.79

326,Not the A-hole,"Last week our neighbor begged me to watch her daughter two hours before she had to leave. I was at home anyway and had the kids for the whole day. I promissed my kids the day before, that we would watch Guardians of the Galaxy (they allways wanted to see Groot and Rocket in action). Since the movie is okish for kids, and I was sitting there to pause or explain stuff if something needed explaining I didn't see a problem. So I informed the mother that I would take care of her kid and that we would watch a movie that is pg12 but that I think can be watched by a 9 year old without problem. And that I even would let my boys (5) watch it with us ...
The mother seemed stressed, said something like ""yea whatever, thanks, I'll send her by two o'clock and went away....""
So the girl came at two. I went to the park with the kids, played hide and seek, and some soccer. We went home, I made smoothies, fruit and Pop Corn. Then I talked to the girl (who doesn't watch TV at home at all), to make sure she was ok with the movie, that I could play something else with her, and if we would watch it and she would feel fear or overwhelmed she just should say something and I would pause it and we would just do something else ...
She watched the movie, she loved it, she was really happy. My kids, specially the boys loved it to. Everyone was happy. Then came the mother, took her happy child home... the day after she informed my wife that she won't bring her kid to us anymore when I am arround because I only put the kids in front of the TV and show them inapropriate content... Well apart that her statement is not true, it made me think if I should have showed the movie to my kids ... I came to the conclusion that it is totally ok for my kids who are used to TV and cinema (I'm a Film Art MA, so a big movie nerd...). but might be troublesome for other kids the same age with less experience (visual/narrative knowledge). But I just didn't want to change the plans ... I think I behaved right, but just to hear other voices, AITA?

EDIT: WOW this blew up over the night. Firstly thank you, for your inputs. I really was insecure but this really helped me on a personal level. 
Secondly, the girl next door is a nice girl, she asks questions a lot (wich starts to get annoying after question number 100...) and she has seen stuff in the cinema, it's not like she hasn't been exposed to movies. The mother is indeed a controlish person, but overal niceish, and she has watched my kids too in the past. The fact that it was short notice, was strange (still don't know wtf she had to do that day) but not completly out of place. But she managed to make me insecure about myself and to feel like an AH. I'm aware that my kids have seen more movies than their peers and I know that some parents roll their eyes when my daughter wants to play ""singing in the rain"" or ""Harry Potter"" with their kids, who haven't seen it but it's not like we watch movies every day. it is my go to option on a rainy day or once a month I make a surprise movie night. Often we read a book and watch the movie together afterwards. My sons love make in off movies of special effects and make up artists ... so they are aware that they are watching fiction and can snap out of scary situations by starting to think about makeup and editing and stuff... still never would watch something I haven't seen beforehand and which I'm not 99% sure they can understand and process properly.  
And no, I would not change a plan (promise) I made to my kids, because of my neighbor. 
Finally Guardians of the Galaxy is apropriate, there where two scenes where I had to make a short pause. 1. When Ronan smashes his hammer on the head of a dude and then, just before the impact, it cuts to the blood filling a pool ...you can't see nothing but it's pretty explicit. There I took a short break and explained, that this Ronin is really a bad guy and that he smashed the others foot (not head). The blood was not percieved as such and I didn't mention it. 
The second scene is when the red chick grabs the stone at the collectors and blows up ... there also we had a short break where I explained that the stone is so dangerous, that if you touch it you turn into dust .... 

Anyway thanks for your thaughts.

327,Asshole,"I met this guy through an online app, went on a date Saturday, things went pretty well, then we went out again on Sunday and we ended up having sex, Monday we texted a bit. On Tuesday I decided to have a little fun so I sent him a sexy picture in the morning, a couple of hours later he responded so I sent back a flirty text, then he sent me a picture of his own to which I responded with a flirty text of my own. This was at 2pm. He did not get back to me till 9pm that night, and I was feeling sad and rejected so I called him out on it and told him you can tell a lot by a guys responsiveness on how interested they are. He said his job is busier and much more demanding than most jobs out there so I responded with how it doesnt matter and how he doesnt owe me anything since we barely know each other but a simple text telling my he is busy and we can talk later would have been enough. He hasnt gotten back to me since. So am I the asshole here?

Edit: wow didnt realise how harsh you guys can be until I tried it myself. But you are right, thanks for setting things straight for me. I am starting to think this runs much deeper than what happened yesterday but has to do with how hurt I was when my last relationship ended. I guess I'm not ready to get back out there yet.

Edit2: Thank you all for letting me know I was an asshole for doing this. At least I am mature enough to understand I was wrong and apologize to him. I guess I wasn't that much of a psycho or clingy/needy after all cause he said he didn't think it was a big deal. 

Now on the other hand I'd also like to say a lot of you that responded are also assholes. I dont know maybe I didn't explain my story right or I did but you all jumped into so many conclusions about me and brought out all your ugly. First of all you all assume I want to be in a relationship with him, and that i already think he is my boyfriend. For your information I do not see a future with him, but while we are dating or whatever we are doing it is nice to respect each other and that is all I wanted from what I sent him, it looks like I did not approach that right, I'm human and like all humans we make mistakes.

 I don't need and I don't want constant attention from him either. And before any of you start slut shaming me for sleeping with him on the second date and sending him a provocative picture (it was not a nude) and wanting to keep seeing him even though I dont want to be in a relationship with him, he has been doing the exact same thing, it takes two to tango.

Also, you all assume that I don't know what it means to work and have career and defended him being so busy like he is the only hard working person in this story. For your information, I do know what work means, I know what it means to work long hours every day and being too busy to be responsive to texts. I always put my phone away while working and check it every couple of hours to make sure there aren't any emergencies and to show people that I care enough to talk to them even on busy days even if they are someone I just met a few days ago. That's what people do when they care for others or simply have an interest to talk to them, they make time, it only takes a minute to type out a responce, and that is more than enough. 

I took my turn to self reflect on this and why I said why I said, now its maybe time for you to do the same and figure out why you are an asshole.

328,Asshole,"I have this friend I have known for a long time and we used to have really interesting political discussions. He always had really strong opinions and I always enjoyed a good political or philosophical discussion.

Years went by and I noticed that he became more and more radical in his viewpoints. The change didn’t occurred overnight. Anyway the more I was discussing with him the more I felt uncomfortable with his viewpoints. The thing is that he’s really intelligent and can spin any argument to feel rational and straightforward even when you realize that the conclusion is “we should forbid Muslim people from naming their babies the with an Arabic name” or “we should forbid them walking down the street wearing a djellaba”.

Maybe for context I should indicate that we’re French and over here there is a strong political undercurrent against Muslims. He never acknowledge it clearly but I strongly suspect him to subscribe to the far right political party in France (the Front National). That’s a big no-no in polite society, here.

All of my other friends cut bridges with him. They told me I should do the same. The thing is that I still like him. I just don’t want to talk politics with him anymore. He’s having health difficulties and I suspect his pain is bringing to the forefront all his dark ideas. I personally believe that we all have prejudices inside of us but we know better and try to overcome them but it’s harder to do when you’re in pain because you just want to hate the world and you then have an easy target.

Just quick my parents are pretty old fashioned and when I was with my ex for 7yrs we were not allowed to stay together because we weren't married, so with my current SO I called to say if we werent staying in the same room we would get a hotel room because I'm 36 & hes 39. My mother assured me we can, she then went on to say she actually liked my current SO, so no problem. I made this call 2 weeks before Xmas.

Cut to the Sunday before xmas and my sister texts me a picture and I notice its in my parents garage and I freak out with joy! She lives far away and rarely gets to visit so I'm supe'd shes in town for the holiday! Then I think, huh, I bet I know where they're staying and call my mom. She informs me that they are staying at the house of course, to which I reply ""cool, which room?"" Knowing full well my mom will say the guestroom. She does and I then ask, what room WE are staying in. Without missing a beat she say, ""well you can stay in your old room and SO can stay in your sisters old room."" Uh no. Super uncomfortable rock hard twin beds in separate rooms is not how I envisioned my Christmas. Now,  this is usally what happens when my younger sister shows up, I get relagated ""to the back"", my parents always assume Im fine with whatever, most times I'm good, but this time it wasnt ok. I try to calmly explain to my mother that she could have told my sister that SHE & her husband could sleep in the other rooms and she seemed taken aback by that and honestly surprised I even said that. I explain about my SOs bad back and how they can afford a hotel because they make way more than us. I really tried not to get upset, but its been years of taking the backseat to my sister. Hung up the phone and full on cried out of frustration and general wtf-ness. I then emailed my mother explaining why I was upset the most adult way I could with conviction. No reply. 

My SO and I head down to my parents the next day, and stop by a few friends on the way so by the time I get there they are all down the street at a party we are also heading to.

Go to the party, have a great time, get drunk, eventually pass out and wake up Xmas morning. We have a great day and when night falls my SO and I pack up to head home.

337,Not the A-hole,"Last night I was with three other people, me and my best friend went to someone’s house to hang with her and another friend. 

For explanation purposes I will label my friends. Friend A is my best friend. Friend B is the girl who owns the house we were at. And Friend C is the guy who was there. 

Long story short, we were all smoking, friend A and friend C went to put air in his tire, while they were gone friend A nearly threw up in his car. When they got back we all told friend A she shouldn’t smoke anymore because she just threw up. 

This caused friend A to curse and swear at both friend B and C. Then continue to argue with me. She started saying that we were all ganging up on her and got really angry. I was trying to explain to her that she just needed to calm down and listen to others for a minute, but that was just causing more of an argument. 

Here’s what really made my blood boil: 

While friend A and I were arguing she said, “why do they gotta pick on me”? 

I said “who”? 

She clarified that she meant friends B and C. 

Before I had a chance to say anything else, this girl I’ve been friends with for close to 10 years, looked me right in the eyes and said 

“why can’t they pick on you I just want them to pick on you”? 

I literally looked at her stunned and was like “why the hell would you want them picking on me”? 

Her response, “so they’re not picking on me”. 

I felt really hurt by her saying that and I almost wanted to cry. Friends B and C’s jaws just kind of dropped. 

Later we let her smoke more, she apologized to the others but not me. Now I’m just confuse whether I did anything wrong or not, but I still can’t believe that someone who is supposed to be my friend would say that to me. 

She was bullied a lot when we were younger by her peers, because she doesn’t have great hygiene and stuff, and I have noticed in the recent past I am expected to stick up for her but she kind of enjoys or laughs along if anybody is picking on me. 

Was it mean to all gang up and tell her not to smoke anymore? It’s just like, if you’re puking is it not a waste to being smoking more??? Like really. ",25,31,0.9

347,Not the A-hole,"This happened 1 hour ago, I (20M) was walking on the sidewalk because I had a reservation at the local barbershop.

&#x200B;

At a certain point on my right there was a ramp to the parking area.

I was listening to music with my earphones and after I reached the ramp( that I couldn't see because there was a wall) a car going (in my opinion) way too fast almost hit me, it was literally less that 1 feet from hitting my right knee.

&#x200B;

 Fortunately, he stopped in time, after crossing the ramp ( where the connection between the road and the ramp was of the same material as the sidewalk, so no asphalt to signal that there was the ramp) I told the guy into the car to pay attention.

He told me to fuck off and to take off my earphones, so we started arguing and calling each other assholes and dickheads.

&#x200B;

Then the same guy, who was probably 35/40yo, overtakes me on the left while I was still on the sidewalk walking (I didn't want no trouble so I kept walking) and stop in the middle of the road to get out of the car and keeps insulting me while I tell him to fuck off and to learn to drive.

A guy who was on a white truck behind him tells him to stop arguing and get into the car.

&#x200B;

Luckily he got into the car and accelerated down the street going at least 70km/h on a 30km/h zone.

&#x200B;

AITA for walking with my earphones or was it his fault?

348,Not the A-hole,"So I (14M) have been on holiday with my family several times, and I have fairly recently (2 years ago or so iirc) started requesting that I have a separate bed to my sister (12F), which has not always been a given.

Despite this, I have sometimes had to sleep in the same bed as my sister, which my family, especially my mum and sister don't seem to understand my objection to. 

I obviously feel I should be allowed to sleep on my own, but my parents (again, especially my mum) think it is too much hassle to find hotels/Airbnbs that have a double bed and 2 separate beds.

Just FYI, I am more than happy to sleep on a sofa or other similar furniture.

349,Not the A-hole,"My mum's boyfriend's behaviour towards me is strange and make me feel uncomfortable. For example:

\- At a restaurant he would pull out my chair for me even if i had already sat down at a different seat at the same table and insist that I sit at the seat he chose for me

\- Reach across the table and brush my hair out of my face while I was eating

\- Refuse to drive me home if I sat in the the back seat. I had to sit in the passenger seat next to him

\-  While my mum and my siblings were away he invited me to go watch the moon outside. When I denied his request he stood outside my bedroom door and refused to leave and kept insisting that I go outside with him. Then he hugged me and stroked my hair while I tried to pull away kept asking me to go outside with him. Eventually I gave up and went outside with him where he asked me to go to the beach(???) with him even though it was the middle of the night and then he tried to stroke my face. 

After the moon incident I've been trying to avoid him the best I can. When he speaks to me I ignore him and walk away. This makes him really angry and he has been complaining to my mum about how I treat him. My mum says I need learn to forgive people and that I'm being extremely disrespectful. She always asks me why I'm trying to ruin their relationship and has threatened to kick me out if my bad behaviour continues. 

I have told my family about why I feel uncomfortable around him and the general opinion is that I'm over reacting. I feel like maybe they're right and I'm making a big deal out of nothing and maybe he had pure intentions but didn't realise how his actions came across. He seems like he genuinely didn't know why I was so scared. I'm willing to forgive him but every time I see him I feel nauseous. I should also add that mum's boyfriend and I have never been close and we have barely spoken since the first time we met.

350,Not the A-hole,"To keep things vague because there's a high change some of you here may recognize me if you live in my county, but I've worked part-time as a high school track & field coach (esp with the women's teams). I've worked there for about 7 years now and have a great record of bringing the girls teams to regionals and even state every year. I'm essentially the only competent coach left in the school system due to budget cuts in the past 5 years. My wife and I retired roughly 10 years ago and we've got a good nest egg so salary has never been a big deal for me with this job. I'm just happy to coach and see new kids win awards, scholarships, college acceptances based on what I've helped them accomplish.

&#x200B;

Anyways, a few months ago a big scandal broke out. One of the girls I coached (15 at the time) accused me of hitting on her. Basically what had happened was that she had her high school boyfriend saved in her phone under my name (first and last) because her parents were strict about dating. She somehow thought it would be better if they saw MY name texting her instead of some boy. Well, the parents obviously saw explicit messages at one point and put two and two together. I was suddenly under investigation and that's when the rumors started spreading like wildfire.

&#x200B;

The whole thing only took about a week to clear up in the end (the phone numbers didn't match after all) and the girl came clean pretty quickly too once the police started interviewing her. However by this time all of the parents had coalesced to have me ""investigated"" because in their words they couldn't take any risks and I had to understand being a father of 3 myself. I was heartbroken and humiliated. My wife was outraged and she's still angry now just thinking about it. We considered selling our house and moving cities. Even though my name was cleared several times over, the humiliation, the rumors, everything, still affects me I can't lie.

&#x200B;

So now the parents are back and they're begging me to stay. They said I'm the only coach with enough experience to bring their girls to championships and they've apologized nonstop. However, my wife and I are leaning towards moving for peace of mind. My wife is more resolute and she thinks good riddance, but honestly I feel torn up inside. I know I am doing a huge disservice to the school and the teams by leaving and I know the program has a high chance of being cut within the next 3 years if I leave and they're forced to pay more for another coach. 

&#x200B;

The other girls (not the one that accused me) have been on my side this entire time. They've helped the police and gave useful tips and even told their parents to hold their tongue when facts were still coming out. I am eaten up by guilt with the thought of leaving them, but I don't know how I could stay and work like I used to after this whole ordeal. AITA?",43,85,0.91

354,No A-holes here,"I've known B since high school and back then she was a healthy, active cheerleader. Fast forward 15 years and she's fought a lot of shitty, hard emotional battles and in the process gained 160+ lbs and is edging on 300 for her short stature. I love B to death and won't begrudge people their inner turmoil, but she has gotten very, very unhealthy to the point where she can't really walk for long distances and gets winded and tired extremely easily.

She's expressed a major desire to start a family with her husband and I am supportive; she'd make a great, loving mom, but I'm honestly pretty concerned for her. She's had complications with her menstrual cycle and often complains that doctors tell her to lose weight to help conceive. Her rationalization is that since her much smaller (by ~100+ lbs) sister gets pregnant at the drop of a hat, she should be able to as well. They're half sisters. She's been trying to conceive for almost a year and it's not been fruitful.

I'm getting more and more anxious for her as time goes by and made the mistake of saying that maybe she should take her doctors, multiple, advice but she just doubled down on her position. I don't know how to be supportive in a way that isn't superficial without bringing to light that part of her complications may be from being morbidly obese. It's even worse because I have a disorder that makes it so I can't really ever get fat and I struggle to maintain my weight while eating a ton. I'm like the worst possible person to say anything to her but she's my best friend and we confide in one another a lot.

I feel like such a rotten ass for being this level of worried for her. I worry that her dream won't come true. I worry that she won't conceive the baby she wants because she won't work towards having her body be healthy enough to carry it. I worry that even if she does have a child that she won't be able to keep up with him or her; she can barely keep up just walking around shopping together. It's stupid to worry this much about a life that's not my own and maybe I'm the asshole for it because it's really not my business. I want her to have everything and it really tears at my heart that she might not get it and it could be of her own doing.",45,39,0.91

356,Asshole,"Me and my girlfriend are freshmen in college and although we've only been together four months we're moving quite fast and things have been very serious for at least three of those months. I'm not in a frat and my girlfriend isn't in a sorority but she has friends in sororities and occasionally gets invited to frat parties with them,

I have always held that she's free to go to such parties with her friends, but I'm clearly very uncomfortable with it so she has respected my wishes (despite me telling her to go) and not gone to any since we've been together.

Recently though this is putting some strain on out relationship because she very much wants to go to these parties but I can't look her in the eye and say I'm okay with her going. This in turn has made me feel very much like an asshole because I'm in effect keeping her from having fun with her friends.

The thing I can't get over though is what she's gonna enjoy at these parties because although she'll go with her friends, I very much know that once you get there it's literally just dancing - grinding on random dudes - and occasionally hooking up with frat guys. Now I'm secure enough in our relationship that I don't think there's the slightest chance she'd hook up with a frat guy (at least not by choice), but it's basically inevitable that she'll be dancing on some guys as that's literally all there is to do there and it very much makes me uncomfortable. 

Also, she doesn't drink either so it's not just the fun of going out getting drunk with friends, maybe I'm missing something but I really don't see what she could possibly enjoy out of it other than dancing on other guys which doesn't make sense to me since she seems to be very much in love with me and we're very much exclusive.

TLDR: My girlfriend wants to go to frat parties with her friends. This makes me uncomfortable as I don't see what the parties have to offer other than grinding on dudes. I tell her she can go but that it would make me a little uncomfortable. She doesn't go and makes me feel like an asshole for ""not letting her go"". Am I truly the asshole?",24,25,0.93

359,Asshole,"A group of four women at my office are unnecessarily rude to me. I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she’s jealous since I’m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that’s the real reason though.


Anyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I’ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, “Oh just a little piece won’t hurt.” I’m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I’ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it’s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.


On the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.


Edited to add: I’m not directly going to these women and persuading them to eat the snacks. I usually just talk to them about the snacks if I run into them in the kitchen or if they follow me into the kitchen when they see me bring my snack tray.


Also adding: I’m not the only one who brings food. We have salespeople come bring food every Friday and other coworkers bring food every now and then. It’s not like I’m the only one in my company who brings food to the office. 


Also adding: I’m becoming a better cook out of all this and discovered the most amazing banana pudding cake recipe. This has nothing to do with my verdict but thought it would be interesting to share. ",352,598,0.92

368,Not the A-hole,"We've lived away from his family our entire relationship, to varying degrees. The closest we've ever lived was a 2 hour flight. Generally, we were about a non-direct 4-7 hour flight away. However, about a year ago, due to a career move on my husband's part and a desire to be near my family, we moved across the country. So now we're about a 7-9 hour flight away, non-direct. His family didn't totally freak out at this, but they weren't happy. Lots of passive-aggressive comments from everyone about how we were abandoning them...even though that didn't make sense, since we weren't exactly close to begin with. Still, I was compassionate because they've never been great with change and I knew that the added travel time was a consideration. Six months in, we bought a house and our daughter started preschool in quick succession. We've really settled into the community well.

&#x200B;

Then, his dad died about a month ago. It wasn't a totally blindsiding shock because he had heart issues in the past, but the surgery was supposed to be fairly routine, so it was still a shock nonetheless. I don't need to tell you that it's terrible.

&#x200B;

Where I'm not sure if I'm an asshole is...my husband thinks we should pack up and move to live near his mom. His sister quit her job and is currently trying to move to the same neighborhood, and he thinks we should follow suit. He said that the house/the job/the location don't matter like family does, and his family needs him now and that he never should have moved so far from them to begin with.

&#x200B;

I really, really, really don't want to.

From my perspective, there are ways he can be there for his family without completely uprooting our lives in the process. He won't necessarily be able to find a job right away. Our daughter is thriving in her preschool. We have a home that barely has any equity on it, that we're still in the middle of sprucing up after buying it. It feels like a horrible idea to turn around and re-sell less than 6 months after purchase, while job searching, while trying to scramble to get our daughter into a preschool in a new state, AND while my husband is emotionally withdrawn from us during his own grieving process. Not to mention that his mom and sister have never been welcoming to me since I've known them, so I'd be an outsider at best, treated as a hostile intruder at worst every single day during a really tumultuous time

&#x200B;

I want to be respectful and loving during his grieving process, but I'm not willing to completely change everything about our life again right after we finally started feeling settled. He thinks that this is me abandoning his needs (and his family's needs) at their darkest hour, and that I'm severely overestimating the difficulty of the move since he's the only one who has to find a new job and our daughter is so young, and we live in a seller's market.

371,Not the A-hole,"My friend invited my husband and me to a 40th birthday party for her husband. The party was going to be at a fairly upscale restaurant with dancing afterwards. We’ve been working on some remodeling projects, so we’ve been on a strict budget. My husband and I wanted to attend the party without breaking the bank, so we decided to share an appetizer and entree and only have one drink apiece.

When we got to the party, we were ushered into a private party room. When we were seated, we were given preplanned menus with several options for appetizers, entrees, and desserts. I asked a passing waiter if I could order a la carte instead of getting the preplanned menu. The waiter indicated that the meal was being paid for by the hosts and because were were part of the party, we needed to order form the preplanned menu.

My friend is a bit wealthier than we are and has always been really generous about their parties, but I was blown away that they would host 15+ people at this restaurant.

As the meal was ending, the main server approached my friend’s husband with the check. My friend’s husband seemed to be a little upset, and said, “I know this isn’t how you normally do things but we are only paying for the wine. We told you that.” I suddenly started panicking inside. I was trying to catch someone else’s eye to see if they were panicking as much as I was. One other couple looked horrified, but everyone else seemed calm. I opened the check, and the total was $211. I thought I was going to throw up. I have never spent that much on a meal.

I held my shit together because I didn’t want to make a scene. The couple that looked horrified sidled over to us and we asked if they knew how much it was going to cost and that our friend wasn’t paying. They said they had asked waiter too, and he had indicated the hosts were paying.

I ended up messaging her and said, “Thanks so much for inviting us to \*\*\*’s party. We had a great time. Just a heads up for next time, we really need to know if going to a party is going to cost more than $100. We are on a really tight budget, so a heads up would be appreciated. Thanks again.”

Couple things going against my friend:

He just turned 27 and he is a virgin. Now there's nothing wrong with that but he's never even kissed a girl in all 27 years, never had a GF or anything close to it. 

My friend is very short (5'3"") and he is not in shape. He wants to get in shape and goes to the gym but his diet is terrible. He eats the same thing everyday: cheese quesadilla for breakfast, tequito's or pizza rolls for dinner, whatever fast food he can find for lunch. He's afraid of trying new things and is just very awkward around women. 

He keeps developing crushes on these girls that he has no shot with and then gets frustrated when they ""friendzone"" him. He likes going after extraverted, party girls who like clubbing and going to bars and I told him, he's not the type of guy these girls are looking for. 

So I told him, if you aren't blessed to be born tall (or even average height) and handsome you need to be at least 2 of the following three: 

1. Good looking 
2. Great personality
3. Successful in your career 

Now good looking is something you can't help sometimes but at least be in shape. Great personality means you can make girls laugh or you're a great conversationalist or easy to get along with. Successful doesn't mean rich but at least have a stable job and the ability to provide and pay your own bills. 

I told him if you aren't any of the above 3 then why would any of these girls want to date you? He needs to lower his standards but he got all pissy when I said that, saying ""I'm not gonna lower my standards like these girls are better than me"". Blah blah

At one point, I went up to get a drink and noticed a petite Asian girl wearing a black tank top and sporting a bowl-type haircut with a blue streak through it. I told her I liked her hair and asked if she was Knives Chau from Scott Pilgrim. She immediately got defensive and angry with me saying things along the lines of “so I’m Asian, I have to be an Asian character?” I tried to backpedal a bit (definitely taken off guard by her tone) but I did say that I considered her race when I was trying to guess her costume, but really, it was the hair color/type that sealed the deal. 


I finally managed to get her to tell me the right costume - Mako Mori from Pacific Rim. An Asian character with very similar hair to Knives. So my first instinct was to kind of laugh at the coincidence and point out the similarities and tell her she seemed to have overreacted. However, I cut my losses, said nice costume and skulked off.

377,Everyone Sucks,"I have a feeling people at work think I’m an asshole for calling an older guy (50s) a rat faced goblin.

The back story is I’ve been working on a weld line for lawnmowers since July. I’ve always worked around this person but not directly. He’s about 5’5” and has unflattering features with a giant beer guy and a speech impediment. For this reason I tend to be overly nice to him intially. 

Everyone at work messes with him but in a big brother way. Probably because they see him the same way as me but they still mess with him while I never do.

However, I think the way people interact with him has caused him to feel like he can treat me with disdain and indifference. I assumed it was just that the fact I was new and young. The thing is though all the other workers help each other out and at the end of the day I usually sweep up the pile that everyone sweeps from their areas. Some guys will help out and do it if I’m busy. Basically it’s not beneath them. This person though will refuse, go out of his way to let me know the pile is ready even if I’m still cleaning up my area.

This has been going for quite some time but I ignore it because who cares. He gets to push around ONE person and maybe he needs it somehow.

The past week I’ve been going from a button pusher welder that runs a robot to welding. I ended up welding with this guy because it’s a two person job.

Immediately I noticed him sandbagging and acting like a douche, making other people check my welds and basically having a hostile attitude. I didn’t get it but whatever.

Well today I go back in and he’s even worse than ever. Refusing to weld his side unti i welder nine and had somebody check it. I wasn’t even making that many mistakes, I had improved. 

He started acting pissy and at one point started slamming his shit around and I just looked at him and said, “what’s your fucking problem.” He mumbled something I couldn’t understand so I called him a, “fucking rat faced goblin.”

That’s basically it. I think he deserved it.",43,45,0.86
378,Not the A-hole,"I've been friends with Tim for 20 years. We grew up together and have always been best friends. We went to different colleges and during that time he was diagnosed with depression and bipolar. I stuck with him, helped as much as possible. During this time he would have meltdowns and run away from campus, destroy his room, cut himself. It was a dark time and heartbreaking for me and his family. He eventually found medication and therapy that works for him which is great and he's been stable for about three years. 


These days, he rarely speaks to me, and when he does he has a rude comment to say or some condescending opinion about my life.however he always talks about me calling me his BEST friend. We had plans last week, at a set date and time and when I called to confirm he just said ""I'm spending tomorrow with my girlfriend sorry"". He belittles my own relationship and makes fun of my job even though his is very similar. 


This is all stuff that has annoyed me in the past, but the last straw was yesterday. He has a small YouTube channel and and he posted a video going into great detail about his suicide attempts over the years. In the video he talks about it in a very upbeat tone with happy music in the background. It was honestly very disturbing. I had no idea he had ever attempted this. I've recently lost someone very close to me to a suicide and he knows this. He knows I watch his videos as I always talk to him about them and comment on them. 


I understand using a video as a way to vent out your ideas and experiences and he isn't obligated to share anything with me. But he didn't warn me of the content in the video in any way, knowing I had just lost a family member to suicide and the wound is still very fresh for me. Continuing to be his friend is now effecting my own mental health, as I went into a panic half way through the video and couldn't continue watching.


Whenever I tell someone of the rude things he says or does they say he probably doesn't realize what he's saying is hurtful but I don't believe that. Especially because he is capable of treating his girlfriend perfectly fine. I genuinely believe he may have become more socially awkward as his issues developed, but I also believe he uses his disorders as a crutch to say and do what he wants with out consequence. 


I don't want to be friends with someone that doesn't take me and my feelings into consideration. I realize this may make me an asshole but I just can't do it anymore.


Tl;Dr 

My friend who is bipolar and has depression is rude to me and does things without taking my feelings and experiences into consideration. It's taking a toll on me and I want to cut him out of my life. ",15,28,0.94

381,Not the A-hole,"My husband works from home and I stay and take care of our 4mo. I have done 99% of the care. When I ask for help he seems like he is doing me a favor even after he is done working. He told me the other night that he feels like he doesn’t get a break and basically said it’s my job to care for the baby at all times Bc he works. 

He has gotten better about helping mostly Bc I just ask him to do more stuff now and he knows I’m mad and he doesn’t like conflict. But people, he games 4 hours a night with no complaint from me Bc yes he does work and that is a good break. 

He doesn’t understand that I am touched out. Our daughter needed constant contact Bc of reflux. I literally slept on the couch sitting straight up with her for at least 6 weeks Bc of it.  She is slowly getting better but I’m literally with her 24/7.  She still sleeps with me. He rarely takes her for more than 10-20 mins. The longest is an hour ish Bc I took a bath a handful of times. He has started laying with her while she sleeps in the evening. He actually said “ok I’m done” after about 10 mins once. 

Sometimes he forgets I need to shower when I’ve waited for him to stop gaming then gets a little irritable Bc he wants to go to bed. I also take the baby with me to drop my oldest off at school Bc he gets cranky about not getting enough sleep. He snapped at me like I was a dog Bc I wasn’t going fast enough to get socks to leave. When I said he could take my daughter to school then, he said he wouldn’t and he guesses she gets to stay home that day. I ended up taking her. 

Now he is telling his brother, whom he games with and works with, that he got in trouble for gaming so he has to take a break. So he has totally missed what I was upset about. I still don’t care if he games. I just want a break more often and an actual parenting partner. 

During these short breaks I’m usually cleaning. He does cook and will wash the pans when he needs them. My oldest fills the dishwasher. He will sometimes wipe cabinets off. He washes clothes when he is out and does most of the dog care. 

Today he is saying he wants to get up earlier and  basically be more of a partner. But I need to know if I’m just being an asshole and he’s right.

So I started seeing my current GF 2 months ago. She’s an amazing woman, gorgeous and incredibly funny and talented. We get along really well and I honestly think I could marry this girl one day. 

Problem is. She is a cam girl. She claims that this isn’t at all sexual, that it’s mainly companionship and that these men are lonely and in need of someone to talk to. She says she never gets completely naked and only ever takes off her top. I have asked her to give this up, as I am not comfortable with the thought of other men jerking off to my girl, but she says she doesn’t want to stop. That it is part of who she is, and that this activity has been paying her rent for years.

I don’t want to infringe on her rights, but I just am not comfortable at all with this. So, am I the asshole for asking her to give it up to be with me? I’m fully prepared to take care of her financially and make up for this loss of income.

Edit:
I did not know she was a cam girl until a week ago. When we met she told me she worked in “entertainment” part time, but I didn’t think more off it as she also works in an office. Maybe I should have known, I just didn’t even consider this a possibility..

I never cheated on her, i never treated her wrong, i've met all of her family and vice-versa. She always says that i'm speaking to other women , but in reality its just my FB notifications.

385,Asshole,"I'm cutting to the point, i don't like getting rejected. the moment a girl rejects me any relationship or connection we have is dead to me. I know its harsh, but it's the truth. Ever since I started being interested in girls, all they do is reject me or ""see me as a brother"", Im not interested in sticking around for that tbh. It happened to me last week, with a girl i thought I had a chance of getting with. It crushed me, and i blocked her everywhere. One of her friends went up to me a few days later and got in my face about how i'm immature and how I threw her away and don't value her.

I just walked away from her. I'm so fucking sick of this shit happening to me, rejection is fucking horrific at this point, and all I get for not accepting it is shit. I don't even lash out, i just do what's best for everyone and cut contact with them, and still I get shit on for ""not valuing them"" and shit. I just don't want to waste my time and energy on lost causes. Anyway, are they right? Am I an asshole who doesnt value girls?

386,Not the A-hole,"So my GF (30F) and me (31M) have been together for over 12 years now, and for most of her time with me she has suffered from depression on and off and has been manifesting itself in different ways every time.

Early in our relationship she wanted to become a teacher, I expressed my concern that It's mentally challenging but if shes really wants to i support her!

She goes though education 5 years, get a job and loves it and after 3 years crashes into a combination of depression and burnout.. First they tried half-time but it didn't help, panic attacks and anxiety started to manifest every other day so shes on sick-leave for 3 months and has no energy to do anything most days...In short.

Me I'm going to a different path, after a electrician education goes thru military training, get a temp-job as a security guard and stay there to clime up the ladder so i get a full-time job at the best position in the company it took 6 years to get where i am today.. And i love it! Basically I sit at a reception during nighttime and play video-games with friends thru internet and scroll reddit and netflix :D It's the most lazy job on the planet and because its all nighttime i make above average pay and more then any of my friends have.

The only downside I work every other weekend and is 12 hour shifts.

This means 2 weekend a month she is home alone with our kid and I'm only with my family a few hours, it tough but it's my job and I have come to accept it.

She however doesn't, she thinks i should take almost any job that includes daytime and no weekends.. regardless of pay or working environment. Just because she needs my support during weekends. I understand it's hard but should i sacrifice all that I've worked for?

She gets mad every time we talk about it and starts to tear up.

Am not all that against changing my job but i at least want a job that i might like or I'm worried I might get depressed.

I'm trying to support her the best i can when I'm not at work, making dinner, cleaning, laundry. etc. But some days i feel like I'm the only parent taking care of my kid and my GF and the household all alone..

390,Not the A-hole,"So my son and his girlfriend are high school aged and have been dating for over a year. At first when she came over I tried to have polite conversation about her, school, her family, etc. She interrupts a lot, tells pretty grandiose lies about how much money her family has and the things she buys them and even when you try to share a funny/interesting story she will ""one up"" your story about how something similar happened to her but it was funnier or more interesting. Ok, fine. She's young and immature and I get that. I tend to let them hang out in the family or game rooms and kind of avoid having long conversations with her at all as I usually just end up frustrated.

Now a year or so later she texts or messages me questions all the time about whether or not my son can come over her place or go out with her family. I've told him several times that I won't respond to those texts as he is my son and if he wants to arrange these things he needs to come to me. She persists. She sent out a message asking for ideas on baby names using our last name. Baby names. (She's not pregnant by a long shot). She insists on telling me all about how attractive she finds my son and how much she loves him which is very uncomfortable on my end. Now I get teenage girls are notorious about doing things like this with their friends but with your boyfriends mom? She had their whole future planned out which included moving into our home after school was completed. Again, it's just weird and unsettling that she finds nothing out of the ordinary about saying these things to me and my husband. She also ""forgot"" her key once and took the bus to my house where there was no adult supervision because I was at work. Thankfully I was able to get another family member to get over there and ""babysit"" the teenagers. She never forgot her key to her house again.

The straw that broke the camels back happened not to long ago. She came over to visit and my sisters children were over. While I was sitting right in the room she asks the youngest (4 YO) who she loves more, her or her 10 YO sister. I am in shock and at first just try to figure out if I really heard what I thought I heard. The youngest chooses her and her sister gets teary immediately. I cut in at that point saying it was not an ""appropriate joke"" and separate her from them. Later, I inform my son gf is not allowed over around his cousins and why. She's young but plenty old enough to know that was just a hurtful thing to do.

My husband and my other kids absolutely cannot stand her and cringe every time she comes over to visit. She's rude and obnoxious and I have not banned her from visiting but it is rather close.I'd love to say I have tried to forgive some of the things listed above but she never sees anything wrong with her behavior and refuses to apologize.

393,Not the A-hole,"Title should actually be ""Are We The Assholes"" because my wife and myself are involved in it the same way.

Cutting half the backstory, since I hit the character limit hard lol.

Wife's (F)riend makes poor life choices, asks to stay with us for few days, we agree, wife's a cosplayer, has closet full of costumes and props. F stays alone once and decided to try on the costumes. Wife has wide hips, but is not overweight, F is. Costumes dont fit oops. Eveyrthing is uncovered few days before gaming convention we wanted to attend and main costume is ruined.

Now I have to add few details about one costume. I got her one for anniversary gift and it was really hard to get and really expensive. The waiting list is almost a year (if not 2 years recently) and it's a miracle I was able to get a spot for her. The costume is made out of special kind of latex, it looks like regular one, but is apparently extremely easy to put on. However, damage it and it's virtually unrepairable as you can't glue it again.

F has apparently figured it out that rubber is stretchy and she could try the outfit. Well, it's apparently not as stretchy as she thought or she handed it poorly and there is huge rip above the buttocks. How do we know it was her who did that? Well she lost a sock in the closet. And nobody else could really do that.

Wife is devastated, I am devastated because I knew she was really excited to use this costume so obviously we confront F.

TL:DR of convo:

F admits she ripped stocking of other costume, then after pushing confesses to trying on the catsuit, offers 20 bucks for repairs, we disagree, tell her the costs and waiting time, calls wife a child and fetishist.

I end the conversation since I won't allow some loser to insult my wife and her hobbies. But hey, day later wife is fuming and she shows me a facebook post F made. Basically playing a victim ""They say I destroyed something, want to scam me, W is a child, IJustWantToFeelAgain is fat shaming and they both are disgusting fetishists"". Comments are mixed from ""Lmao, just block those weirdos"", through ""Dont confess to anything"" and ""Why are you body shaming her"" to ""You have to pay them back"". Of course she lied she was allowed to try it on.

We both explained the situation, that contrary to popular belief latex is not fucking cheap, this designer is definitely not cheap, F behaviour is definitely scumy and her fat ass should probably avoid putting on anything that's not hers.

Now I just don't know if we're crazy that we expect to get the money back (cost of the outfit + the fact that it's really hard to buy it) and that in emotions after what we heard we are more than allowed to use the term ""fat ass"". Or maybe I should also play a victim, because yes, I am guilty of absolutely having a fetish for my wife lol.

My family has been planning a big family Hawaiian vacation (my parents, my brother's family with 3 kids, some very close family friends) for about 10 years now to celebrate my niece's graduation from High School. It is scheduled for early/Mid August this year, and everyone is chipping in for an awesome house to rent for the week.

My wife has known about this trip since we started dating a few years ago. We have been lucky and are now pregnant, due in late June. 

My wife is telling me that she does not think we should go. The baby will only be a month or two old, and she is worried about how she will feel after giving birth. The flight would be from the Northeast US, probably a changeover in California, and then out to Hawaii.

My feeling is that people travel with 1-2 month old kids all the time. Also we will have a TON of family around us if we go on the trip who WANT to help watch the kid (so maybe we can relax more than if we stayed home), and I don't feel like she is going to still be hurting a month or two after giving birth. Mostly a guess, but my internet researching backs up the theory, so it's not completely out of the realm of possibility.

 Eventually when she started grabbing onto other kids I had had enough and told her to sit on the wall at the side for a few seconds until she was ready to listen.

396,Not the A-hole," 

My  ex asked me to cosign a  vehicle because he had no credit. I wasn't  comfortable with that, but I  was ok with putting a used vehicle 100% in  my name so that I had control  and if it went bad I would just wind up  with a spare vehicle.

The  agreement was  that once paid off I would just sell it to him for $1. The only other  financial tie we still have is that  he owes me roughly 3k for paying  for a summer of camp for his daughter when he couldn't afford it.  Originally he was supposed to pay that back  with his 2017 tax return,  but since we had split up by then he told me  basically to go screw  because the breakup was still pretty fresh. He  later apologized and  promised he would really pay it back this year with  his 2018 tax  return. But over the last six months his current  relationship is  falling apart (he cheated on me with her and moved in  together after  dating 30 days so this wasn't shocking) and he needs  those taxes to pay  first, last, and security on a new place to live. We  made a third  agreement that he would pay back what he could when he  could and that  after the car was paid off he would continue making the  same payments  to me monthly and I wouldn't sign over the car until the  summer camp  debt was paid. Over those six months he hasn't ever paid  over the  regular payment and specifically told me that even though he  got  roughly a 4k tax return he insists he can't afford to even throw an   extra $50 or $100 at his debt.

I told  him that if I didn't see some effort  to pay something towards what he  owes I would have to really consider  selling the car in June (when it's  paid off) and getting what he owes me  that way, instead of staying financially connected. He lost his temper saying he's a single dad and he has no money and he can't handle the way I speak to him.   Things got heated in the conversation because I feel like I've been more than accommodating and he constantly uses what will happen to his daughter as leverage. I said he could make an effort or I could come and   grab the car today. His temper and pride got the better of him and he told me to come get it and I did.

Here's why I feel conflicted. I know he doesn't have the credit or the money to buy a car now without spending 100% of his taxes on that and leaving him living with a woman he hates for another year. He could  lose his job if he can't get there leaving them in a very  precarious  financial position. I am financially very  comfortable. I  asked him to try more for the fact that someone cheating  on me and  being generally a terrible human being when we split up means I  don't  feel like going too far out of my way to make this easy for him and I take it personally when he continues to take advantage of my resources  when I know that was a large factor in why he wanted to be  with me at  all.",25,29,0.92

398,Asshole,"I saw a similar post which reminded me of my brother.

I took him in when he was 14. I was like 23 I think. I was barely getting by but I figured hes younger than me so I cant be complaining.

The entire time my family was telling me to disown him and focus on my life(he had already lived with them and irreparably burned his bridges). I was like ""I cant abandon my fucking brother"".

So from the moment he moved in i told him a list of his responsibilities. I made him cook and we had tv time ""where he picked a movie and we watched it. He had to go to school and work part time in a clothes factory(sweeping and stuff) and I never took his money. And he had to get good grades and apply for a program where he attends college courses while I high school.

He is naturally good looking (the best out of all of us just a fatass) and we let him know it but he still complained. So I told him ""do something about it first then complain"". I took him running every morning  (it was exhausting for me to take him running as well as get home from working overtime and still have to check his homework). I beat his ass when it was needed and I did talk out his problems and stuff. But eventually it went more like this:

him: ""i cant talk to girls cause they just see me as a fat dude AMD dont even want to look at me""

me: ""change into your sweatpants and meet me outside in 5 mins ""

After a few months, my family wanted us visit so we went and they didnt even recognize him. He lost at least 30 lbs and I made him shower regularly and basic shit like that.

When he was 16 years old, I found out that he had been wasting his and stealing my money to buy donuts and he was intentionally not handing in his homework as ""protest"" to me, I put all his shit in garbage bags and threw him on the street.

I honestly had no idea where he was gonna go but he ended up going to his fathers house(a fuck up himself and he eventually kicked him out). Then he went to california where my middle brother was stationed (I took him in a couple of years before that and threw him out when he was 18. He went to the army ).

Anyways, I miss my baby bro and wish he could chill and get his shit together and come hang out with us but he still my brother and I cause we kicked him out. I think he wants us to apologize but I dont think I did anything wrong. Should I?

Hes barely getting by btw. For all the opportunities he had, hes living in the house that I bought for my mom and he doesnt know but the reason I'm selling it is so he can get the the fuck out. So like, I'm basically doing the same thing i did to him a few years ago but I'm being low key about it. He doesnt pay rent or help with mortgage or bills. Just lives there in a mess.

Should I apologize for him trying my patience or maybe just apologize to keep him close? I feel that it wont matter cause if literally going into debt and stopping the trajectory of my life didnt do anything to change him, what's a bullshit apology gonna do?",106,64,0.83
399,Not the A-hole,"[M 18] I’m a compulsive eater when it comes to junk food, chips, chocolate, literally anything that’s bad for you I eat way to much of. My girlfriend [F 18] and I have been together for a year and no matter how many times I ask her to not give me junk she won’t stop. She’s obsessed with Pinterest and once she sees a gift idea that she thinks is cute she has to do it. It’s really sweet that she always wants to think of me and do something cute but I’m trying to make myself better and she’s not helping. Everytime I ask her not to do it she says, “You’re not even fat” and does it anyway. The only reason I’m not grossly overweight is that I play 3 sports and I’m always in the gym, even then I have a dad bod. She got me a basket for my birthday, two for Halloween, one for Christmas, one for New Years, and two for Valentine’s Day. 

When she came over yesterday she saw that I hadn’t touched the candy in my basket. She was upset that I didn’t appreciate her basket so I was sarcastic and told her, “It’s not like I told you 5 or 6 times that I didn’t want junk food”. She got mad at me and it was the first time she’s ever been mad at me for more than a day or two after a year of dating. It’s not threatening to our relationship but I think I hurt her feelings.

403,Not the A-hole,"My best friend Jason has been in a relationship with his gf Tessa for about 2 years.  She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.

Well after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's ""just the jealous type"" and ""that's just how she is.""  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.

Fast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was ""that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.""  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.

The TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.

Jason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing ""ding dong the witch is dead!"" 

This is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?",153,1124,0.97
404,Not the A-hole,"So just to give everyone a bit of context here, my father recently passed away and had life insurance, but because he passed away in his workplace me and my brother received more money than that of his life insurance policy.
This was 3 months ago and its only recently we've received payments. 
So after a huge argument with my younger brother about how it's getting divided(as he also wanted to keep my dad's house as well as 50%) we eventually settled on receiving upwards of £300,000 each and the house on both our names. 

Growing up and through my adult life I have always been independent but not always financially well off (earn around £24k per year) so having this amount of money is new to me but ever since receiving the money my fiance has been very suggestive as to how it should be spent (holidays, house, cars etc) 

I agreed that some of the money should be spent on a house as that means I would not have rent or mortgage to pay in the long run, giving us our monthly earnings as extra income. 

So whilst discussing this with my fiance of 2 years I said that I would only like the house to be in my name until we're at least married or have kids, but she totally freaked out at me calling me selfish and saying that I think she's a gold digger and that I don't trust her. I tried explaining to her that although it would be in my name she wouldn't have to pay anything towards rent and our cars so financially she'd have a lot more income from her work to support her, but she never wanted to listen. I tried again to reiterate to her and she hit out with ""I don't feel like I would like to have kids with someone who doesn't trust me enough to put my name on our house"" 

This really got to me. 

Before my father's passing we always had a mutual agreement that we would keep our finances separate as long as we both paid equally towards our rent costs and bills, So I don't understand how her views have changed now, even though she wouldn't have a penny to pay outgoings except for minor household costs she seems really persistent on being a joint owner of our house. 

It's now 3 days later and I'm lucky if my fiancé has said 5 words to me since and is no longer answering my phone or texts. 

tl;dr before inheriting life insurance from my dad's policy we had separate finances, now that I have it my fiancé wants to be part owner of the car and house we buy, AITA for refusing to do this before we get married?

I work as a corporate level administrator in the trucking industry.  It's been a pretty sweet gig so far and have no complaints as of yet (2 months in). I would also like to preface the following with saying that I work with a very diverse staff of coworkers who are all as professional as they can be, rarely is it that someone cant pull their own weight. 

About a week ago I was walking through the parking lot to my car after the end of the day, and I was looking at the sunset through the chain link fence.  As my eyes darted around i happened to notice a pink metal plate bolted onto the fence, I thought to myself ""woah, what's that and how did i not notice it before?"" So i started reading it and I was immediately greeted with slight disappointment.  Basically, it read as follows ""FEMALE EMPLOYEE PARKING SPACE ONLY!"" with a large symbol in the middle of the sign which is also seen on women's public bathrooms.  

Now, let me clarify I am not ""Irate"" or ""fuming"" about it, but I dont really buy into the whole chivalry, white knighting culture that the men of previous generations upheld *fedora intensifies*.  I even asked my fiance when I got home, just to get a female insight on it.  She said she thought it was stupid.  I guess I'm just coming from the territory of you can show that your a diverse company dedicated to equality, without making tedious or unimportant decisions like special parking.

408,Not the A-hole,"This happened a few months ago and fucked me up for a few days if nothing else, but it still sticks around in my mind because although it felt like I did nothing wrong, in hindsight it might have been the wrongest of wrong things. I dunno.

So background: I volunteer two days of every school week at a local primary (Australian word for elementary) school in a mixed grade 3/4 class. The area is highly made up of aboriginal Australian and north African immigrant families, and the school is owned by the nearest university - one that focuses on equity for students of different abilities, cultures and finances. 

One such student is an 11-year-old Islamic girl from Sudan, who might be the biggest teacher's pet I've met in my time. Often she'll raise her hand just to ask ""Do you like superheroes?"" Or something to that liking. 

One day I start noticing a few interesting questions from her, such as ""Do you wear dresses?"" and ""Do you have a girlfriend?"", and while I wish I could say yes to both, it would be a bit jarring to explain that I am wearing a bra under my shirt and am considered a woman by my self, friends, and family. I'm also bi as fuck, which makes the latter question even more awkward.

Obviously she was picking up a few effeminate vibes from me. The questions continue and I avoid those that are too strange for me to explain, but after some time she says - more kindly than most adults do - ""Are you gay?""

I think about whether or not I should respond, and for my own sake the answer is obviously not to, but because I don't want to make any sort of impression that the topic is such a taboo, and that she obviously knew of the subject, I decide to answer truthfully: ""No, but I'm actually bi.""

""What does that mean?""

""It means liking both men and women.""

That was the end of the conversation for then, and I was glad to see that she was so understanding at her age.

The next day I get a call to meet with the principal. You know where this is going. She explained to me that she had gotten a call from a parent, complaining that ""I had taught their daughter a new word."" I was told that obviously they would not ask me to leave, for legal reasons if nothing else, but that I needed to learn the ""boundaries"" of a teacher-student relationship, specifically that I have no right to act as a friend in any way to a student and cannot be anything more to them than a teacher. 

I agreed for the sake of my career but it would go against everything I believe in to say that I have to hide a basic, g-rated piece of info like it were a criminal record, let alone to forbid myself from acting as a friend in addition to an educator.

My plans to explain my gender to pupils after I transitioned over the summer were promptly cancelled until they could ""find an appropriate strategy"", and although I did later have to postpone my return for study reasons, they insisted I wait for weeks after school starting so that ""students have time to adjust"".",123,159,0.9

410,Not the A-hole,"So, this morning, me, my mom and my dad took a ride in the car together to a doctor's appointment when I told them I'd like to sleep over at my friend's place on friday night and asked if they'd be okay with that.

My mom immediately bursts out with something along the lines of ""Well, absolutely no, you can't!"", which I respect, but I calmly ask why, as I at least want to know the reason for her decision.

My father immediately follows with scolding me ""Your mother said you couldn't go and you will respect that!""

I absolutely hate when either of them does this. It infuriates me to no end. Makes me feel like a literal idiot. Like I, for some reason, cannot comprehend the reasoning behind most of their complex decisions. I get it, it sounds bratty and teenage-angsty, but I think I am old enough for my parents to finally indulge me in what they actually mean by ""no"" and not just expect me to follow orders. I live far away from my parents throughout the week (boarding house) and they trust me with other things that require adulting, so I really don't understand why this particular thing is such a problem.

But anyway, my father also says something about me crossing a line or something, which, again, I don't get. Now I'm getting visibly and audibly irritated, but I still mostly manage to keep my cool and ask why they wouldn't tell me, as I think I'd be able to understand, if they'd just tell me, to which he replies that he doesn't care what I think and I lose my cool. Now we're arguing in the car, but it's mostly just being pissed at eachother, so we don't really move forward from that point on (obviously).

Me and my mom get on with our doctor's appointment and later grab lunch together, where we bring the topic up again, this time both of us calm. She explains to me why I can't go (I won't go deeper into that, since it's an old friend from elementary and both us and our parents have had various personal issues) and I agree that that is indeed reasonable and I will respect that, but also tell her that they could have just told me in the car in like three sentences and we'd avoid the whole stupid arguement.

My mom explains to me how my dad has just returned from a night shift and was kind enough to drive us to town so that we don't have to take the bus, and it's understandable for him to lose his cool like that, but at the same time I think that I didn't do anything to prompt him to lose his cool like that.

Mainly because I did not get to see her and speak to her for a big part of her childhood. I left to go back to my home country when she was 3 due to DV issues with her mom at the time. This is completely my fault. I was an asshole. I have since gotten therapy and am happily married.


We reconnected when she was 16 and we were pretty much two peas in a pot. We are very alike and she moved in with me and my wife. All was well, except that we'd have pretty heated fights once in a while. I never got violent with her but I'd scream and she'd scream and my wife (who is very calm) would be stuck in the middle.


My wife cannot have children, but our dream was always to adopt or foster. Finally we were at a point in our lives where we could afford to foster a teenager. But when I told my daughter, she got mad. She said that it was unfair that I would foster someone rather than pay her mom the 'child support' that I 'owed', which was never ordered by a judge as we never went to court.


It is true that I didn't pay any child support but she lived with us for two years and we got her a car, clothes, food etc and spoiled her to make up for it. She says that it's still unfair and that she is hurt that I will raise a child when I was never there for her.


My daughter moved out and went to live near her mom again. I called my ex-wife hoping for support. She called me an asshole and hung up on me? Again **she never asked me for a penny before**.


Am I really the asshole here?

Tldr at the end, turned out longer than expected

Background - So with the new and final season of Game of Thrones looming my girlfriend of a few months and I have decided to rewatch everything to refresh our memories and hype us up.

Now the problem with this is that I don't intend to watch the newest season with her. A few friends and I have this little tradition with watching GoT where we go to one of their houses each week and watch the new episodes as they come out. This has been going on for a few years and we've been pretty pumped to watch the finale together for just as long now. It's great fun and a good way to see them as I don't get the chance all that often.

I mentioned this little tradition of ours to my girlfriend before we even started watching GoT so that she wouldn't be surprised by it, however when she brought it up last night she seemed pretty upset that I hadn't changed my mind about not watching the newest season with her and with my friends as intended.

So WIBTA if I choose to stick to tradition and not watch the newest season with my girlfriend?

Tldr: Girlfriend is upset that I'm choosing to watching newest season of GoT with my friends as we have a tradition for it, even after we plan on binging it up until release.

Update: 
So after reading the replies here I'm obviously TA for not even trying to include her, I tunnel visioned and just didn't even think to include her like the ass that I am. 

So this morning I offered to invite her along if she wanted but she expressed that she didn't really have interest in coming along to our ""bro nights"".

I understand that, for a lot of people, lack of sex and intimacy can be a deal-breaker.

My SO and I have been dating for about 4 1/2 years now yet we barely have any physical intimacy. She doesn't like to be held for too long, maybe 30 seconds at best, and we haven't had sex in two years. Every time I try and initiate she tells me she just doesn't want to.

Most of the time I figured I'd get an excuse out of it, but it's always just flat out ""No."" Oddly enough, my ego doesn't feel bruised since she does so much for me. I don't feel a painful rejection. I've considered that maybe I'm bottling it up. I've sat down and had some serious discussions with her about it. We get a lot out of those conversations but I still feel like we haven't made any real progress.

Aside from that detail she's quite possibly the closest thing to a superhuman I've ever seen. She runs her own business, helps me maintain the home, destroys me in smash, makes me laugh until my sides hurt, frequently buys me gifts and listens to me vent about work. At the end of a hard day she still has enough energy to go to the gym with me. I reciprocate this as much as possible that it sometimes it feels like a competition and she does it all with a smile.

I feel if I do end it, I'd get the ""After everything I've done for you"" treatment. Although, she'll never say it out loud. I feel guilty just even thinking about it.

She's incredible, but I do feel the lack of intimacy is eating at me slowly

414,Not the A-hole,"A bit of context, my dad is in his mid 60's so grew up in a very 'traditional' home. He had plenty of kids and i'm the youngest at 21, me and my partner, lets call her P decided to start our family at an early age and our perfect daughter was born in late October, we'll call her B.

My dad currently has around 15 Grandchildren so he is definitely not new to this, 14 of which are from marriages before he married my mother, my daughter is my mum's first grandchild.

Now my mum hasn't been very well recently (nothing contagious) so we went to visit them at the weekend. My dad spent most of the day criticizing how me and P choose to raise B, its nothing crazy, we just don't agree with the 'cry it out' method when she goes to sleep. Instead we only rock her for 5-10 minutes, when B starts to drift off, we put her down and most of the time she soothes herself to sleep. If B wakes back up and starts crying, we rock her again and repeat until she sleeps.

Now this seems to really anger my dad, he constantly tells us that B will never be independent if we keep doing that, and how we just need to let her cry. I've explained to him plenty of times that times have changed, we're happy doing it this way and B sleeps as well as you can expect a baby too. Let's be honest, no first time parent has it all figured out and you learn as you go along.

B also hates going in the car, (I'm well aware most babies love it, but B just cries from when we put her in the car, until the moment we get out) so either myself or P will be in the backseat with B, in an attempt to calm her down and let her know she is safe.

Again, my dad says we should just leave her and let her cry it out, how we're doing it wrong and how me and my siblings were left to cry and we turned out fine. 

This has been going on since B was born and most of the time I ignore it, or come back with a sarcastic response like ""opinions are like an A-hole, every one has one, but I really don't want to hear about yours"" I finally lost my temper at the weekend, telling my dad to fuck off and to leave us to raise B however we want. He gives the usual response telling me to calm down, how he's 'trying to help' how he's only 'giving his opinion' and how 'this generation gets offended if someone disagrees with them'. We left promptly and I have spoken to him since.

Any parent will agree that unsolicited 'advice' is frustrating, and I've calmly asked him to stop countless times but he doesn't listen. My mum says that he's just stubborn and set in his ways and I should just ignore him, but its hard to ignore someone criticizing your parenting, especially when you're stressed and sleep deprived, should I have just let it slide or am I right here?",39,47,0.93

I got married three weeks ago and one of my bridesmaids is about 7 months pregnant (let's call her Kate). Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. 

Between the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.

I was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos.

This obviously isn’t word for word but, to my best recollection, this is the conversation we had:

I looked at these two and I. Saw. RED.

See,  in the Uk the National front are a collection of incredibly violent  Neo-Nazis who generally travel around in gangs breaking things and  attacking anyone who isn't their (very limited) version of pure.

427,Not the A-hole,"So to make the relationship backstory short my ex-wife had a >1 year affair and divorced me because she wasn't happy and wanted to be with him. After a lot of on again off again stuff its final that she has chosen to be in a relationship with the affair partner. Per our custody arrangement we have 50/50 split custody (one week on, one week off) of our two girls aged 5 and 7. We are currently living together and co-parenting until my ex-wife can afford to move out.

My ex-wife has a friend, let's call her Mary, who has cancer and lives close to my ex-wife's work and with whom she stays most nights when it's my week to watch the girls. Not too long ago I found out that she had lied to me about staying with Mary when she was really spending the night with the affair partner. It is currently her week to watch the kids and tonight she asked me if I was okay with taking care of the girls overnight so she could stay with Mary. I told her that if she was actually staying with Mary I was fine with it. She asked me what I meant and I told her that I was not okay with doing a favor for her that directly benefited the guy she had cheated on me with and who I obviously hate. She stated that it shouldn't matter who she was staying with if I'm okay with watching them for her to stay with Mary then I should be fine with watching them for whatever reason and that I was being controlling. I think there's a big difference and told her that putting conditions on a favor is not controlling since the other option is just a straight no.  

I've been pretty messed up by everything that's gone down and don't have a ton of people who I can ask for advice, so reddit, AITA?

*edit.    I feel like I should clarify that this is after they've gone to bed, I am not choosing to miss spending time with my kids to be petty towards my ex, I just feel like there's a difference between me being okay with taking responsibility for them while you spend time with your friend who has cancer vs. sleeping with some guy.",89,27,0.92

429,Not the A-hole,"Some background: My husband and I generally have a loving happy relationship. We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.

My daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.

The issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn’t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. 

My mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can’t take care of it. 

My mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me “I’m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I’m a piece of shit.” I’m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.

And the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. 

I then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. 

I have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven’t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.

&#x200B;

So this is a really long story that starts in August I'm going to try to keep it short but here I go. I'm a first year in university and moving was a huge change and it took a huge emotional toll on me, for the first week I cried myself to sleep and I would text/call my mom nonstop, having anxiety and depression it was already hard enough for me to be able to open up and make new friends so I was already dealing with that situation. Anyways  I moved in with a girl (let's call her Sandy) I thought was super cool we had the same interests and she was nice and funny, a bit annoying but I still enjoyed her company nonetheless, we were getting along as well as roommates do until one day I came back from class and all hell broke loose. 

&#x200B;

I walked into the dorm from class and we greeted each other I sat down at my desk and she turned off her TV and climbed into her bed, and started to masturbate right there in her bed for all of God's green earth to see. I started freaking out and I sat in shock as it happened afterward she went ""oh I have my bio lab"" and left I texted my sister and called my mom and ranted to her about it. After that I reported Sandy to my RA and we exchanged schedules and she said she wouldn't do it again but she ""didn't see the big deal.""

&#x200B;

I'll admit I got paranoid after the first encounter. I started spending less time in my room and started getting colder towards her. I was pissed off, I was gone for over an hour in class and she had the opportunity to deal with that then but instead she waited until I got back to the dorm, she greeted me and then she decided to touch herself. I started going to therapy over this because my mental health already was in a bad place and this triggered a spiral. Anyways there were two other instances when I thought she was masturbating while I was in the room and I reported her again she claims she didn't do it but who knows. She eventually moved out because she was mad that I had supposedly falsely accused her of touching herself in my presence again which I couldn't care less about.

&#x200B;

A while later I reported her to a mandated reporter and that person reported her to the Title IX office where an investigation was done, and they put her on probation. Basically, she's not in good standing with the university and if she does anything else to violate the policy the punishment would be more severe. But I can't help but think I've made a mountain out of a molehill, I just wanted her to face some sort of consequence for what she did but I'm worried I overreacted and ruined her future because of it. AITA?

&#x200B;

**TLDR: Roommate masturbated while I was in the room I reported her and now she's on probation and I don't know if I overreacted.** 

EDIT: Thanks everyone who responded! I appreciate everyone regardless of if they said I was an asshole or not I wanted a new perspective because everyone around me said that I was in the right and I wanted to hear the perspectives of others before finally putting this situation to rest mentally.

My immediate reaction was:""What an asshole."" And even today when i think about it i have mixed feelings about it. Killing yourself isn't a decision you take lightly i know.
And i don't know what that guy must have dealt with.

&#x200B;

Earlier in the day my (ex) girlfriend and I had gotten frisky. So we decided to take a few photos together, it was a first for us. We'd both really enjoyed it. Now around midnight we both get into bed and I'm browsing Reddit as usual and I make a joke we should post our photos on Gonewild or something of the sorts. She is straight away defensive and accuses me of being a bad boyfriend for wanting people to get off to a photo of us.

&#x200B;

I agree (kinda) It was just a joke.

&#x200B;

So here's where the porn watching comes into it. She's seen Gonewild before from my previous history and she's stated she wasn't comfortable with me watching it. So i stopped. 

She got curious, and asked to me to show her what these type of subs looked like, So I complied and showed her. 

&#x200B;

We were both looking through it together. Naturally as a red-blooded male my pp got hard and she was very upset. She asked me if i'd found a certain post attractive (It was a male and female) and I didn't want to lie of course. So i said yes. 

&#x200B;

She's now kicked me out of the house, and broken up with me. She claims I am a monster who doesn't take her feelings into consideration. I disagree, and I am quite frustrated this has happened.

436,Not the A-hole,"So my SO and I have been together for a little over 2 years and known each other for about 8.  He is not into gift giving or receiving in general and really only does my birthday and Christmas because it's something I want.  I take a lot of joy in finding people the perfect gift.  He doesn't want to celebrate his birthday and so I respect that.  When it comes to gifts for him, he prefers experiences over material things.  When it comes to our anniversary we do something together and while I honestly would like to do something for valentine's day I think that would be pushing it so we pretty much ignore it.  I think that's a pretty good summary of our gift giving situation.

Early on in our relationship he asked me what I wanted for Christmas and I said a pair of earrings.  I had a lost one of my diamond studs (an inexpensive pair, something like $100 and honestly the only piece of jewelry I had that didn't come on a piece of cardboard).  He asked me multiple times what I wanted and each time that's what I said.  Eventually he just said ""I'm not going to ever buy you jewelry so... yeah.""  I asked why not and he said he thinks it's stupid and he doesn't like shopping for it.  (I will add that this was in the price range we had discussed and he ended up spending more than this on my Christmas gift.  Football tickets, which I loved.)

So here's the thing.  I think one of the things that can make a gift thoughtful or nice or whatever is to buy something for someone that they wouldn't buy for themselves normally.  It doesn't have to be something you agree with or enjoy shopping for or anything like that.  It's about making them happy.  For example, I think it's ridiculous that he has a $300 pen.  I mean it's a nice pen!  But whoa that's steep for a pen.  However if he mentioned he wanted that pen and it was in the price range for a gift, I would love to buy it for him, because it's something he really wants.

And so that is why I am rather annoyed on this total, unequivocal ban on jewelry.  It seems arbitrary and against the idea of gifting something to someone for the purpose of their happiness rather than having anything to do with yours.  I will also add that I'm not a picky gift receiver and he has gotten me lovely gifts including things like a trip to a bookstore I've always wanted to go to, a ton of WWII books because he knows I'm a history nerd, the football tickets, etc.  I would never receive a gift and not appreciate it.  But it just... digs at me a little when he refuses to buy something because he thinks its ""stupid,"" which kind of feels like he's saying there's something wrong with me for wanting it.

I have no attraction towards her anymore and she texts me the day after the dinner to ask if I wanted to do something again and I said no and politely rejected her.

441,Asshole,"So, some basic background: I need my IUD replaced and I made the appointment 2 weeks ago, set for tomorrow. When I was on the phone, I told the receptionist I needed it removed and replaced and she said she'd double check with the doctor and call me back.

She didn't call back, but that same day I got a confirmation email that clearly said ""IUD removal and replacement"" so I figured we were fine. 

Today (the day before the appointment) I get a very dodgy looking email from them that's encrypted. It doesn't have any of the normal stuff, no letterhead, nothing in the actual body, and the subject just says ENCRYPTED-IUD. I work as a network engineer and I've seen spam like this before, so I call the office and leave a voicemail asking for a call back. 

I get a call back from a very distracted receptionist who tells me that they sent me an encrypted email that contains a form I have to fill out for the insurance company and they haven't ordered my IUD. I ask why, and she says because I have to fill the form out. 

I'm pretty pissed off, and after looking through my email, I can't find the form. I finally find it buried in my trash folder, and call them back. When another receptionist answers, I lost my temper.

Why the hell didn't they tell me about this form on the phone when I MADE the appointment? Why isn't the office fillng this form out? I've never heard of this before, and my sister is a nurse, I've never seen this done before. I'm seriously upset, my IUD is causing me to bleed, I have to work tonight, and the receptionist is saying stupid stuff like ""We don't keep them in stock, we sent you a form--"" ""I MADE THIS APPOINTMENT TWO WEEKS AGO WHY AM I ONLY NOW BEING TOLD ABOUT THE FORM?""

&#x200B;

I was definitely yelling. She transferred me to the nurse manager, who explained they'd really dropped the ball. I vent to him a little and he's pretty understanding (or he's used to upset patients). I also ask him about a CPAP that's supposedly been ordered but that there's no update on. 

&#x200B;

Basically, I hung up feeling better, but was an I asshole to yell at the receptionist? I know its not her fault but this is the second time they've dropped the ball for me, and I'm getting tired of having to submit my own insurance forms, which is not standard practice.

So, tomorrow, when I go to drop off the form, I'm probably going to apologize, but let me have it Reddit: am I an asshole?

EDIT TO ADD: I dropped the form off and apologized to the receptionist. She was very understanding and said she'd gone through similar frustration herself with her own doctor.  We're good.

Well now he wants the things back that he purchased for me, including a set of grooming equipment that cost about $500. He purchased it for me after I had lost my job at a company so that I could go back to dog grooming and try to get myself by. I offered him compensation for the grooming equipment after he confronted me asking for it back because I will still use it and still frequently need it to groom my own dogs at home. 

Now this is equipment is very well used, two of the blades are broken and a pair of the shears aren’t cutting properly anymore, and if anyone is familiar with commercial dog grooming you know that we tend to groom 8-9 different dogs a day and that puts a lot of wear and tear on the equipment. 

He however would not accept the offered compensation of the full price of the initial brand new equipment. Stating it was a reminder of him and why would I need to keep it? 
He wants to just sell it and get his money back but why would he do that when I’ve offered him more than it’s actually worth?

My girlfriend and I have been living together for 4 months now. We’ve been together for 3 years, and I’ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.

When we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. 

We would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.

Now flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. 

It all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I’m gonna play some games if she doesn’t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) 

I had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn’t expect this to be her reaction.

She said, it’s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I’m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn’t a “plan.” I’m not going anywhere, I’ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn’t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.

Then, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her ‘she didn’t need to go out every time, I’m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.’ 

She’s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play.

He asked me why I stopped playing with him and I told him he hurt my feelings, which made him cry.

451,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I got married in August at the JOP. My MIL, GMIL and parents were there. 10 minutes after the ceremony my stepdad asked when we were going to have a baby. Since then, he has brought it up every time we are around him, more so when other people are around. I think he’s looking for their validation or trying to get a conversation going about it. The first few times he asked, I would reply with something like, “Not any time soon,” or “It’s going to be a while.” I figured this was clear enough to satisfy him or would at least make him aware that this wasn’t something we were ready to discuss. My mom is usually quiet and doesn’t say anything when he does this.



Over the last few months he has gone so far as to share things on FB about a new grandchild. Every time he does, I ask him to remove the post because 1. It’s not his business to put out there and 2. Why does anyone else on FB care? I have fielded pregnancy questions from several family members after he does this. He removed one of the posts. 



My parents, my sister and her husband were at our house for dinner last week. My stepdad was talking to my husband, and I overheard just the end of the conversation. My husband pretended not to hear him to avoid even talking about it. My stepdad repeated himself, but loud enough that everyone heard him. He told my husband he was losing faith in us that we would ever give them a baby.



The way he said it made me feel like he thinks we are obligated to provide him a grandchild. It made me angry so I told him that if and when we have a child is none of his business. He told me to shut up, that he was joking. I said that he was not joking because of the frequency of him bringing it up every time we see him. I mentioned the FB posts he has made that he wouldn’t take down after I asked him to. I told him it made me uncomfortable being asked about it and that maybe we would not be able to have children and every time he brings it up, it hurts my feelings. I said he doesn’t take into consideration a number of factors that go into having a child, and I would appreciate it if he would stop talking about it until we decide we want to talk about it.



Eventually he told me I wasn’t allowed to speak to him that way, and he and my mom left. I apologized to my mom the next day for how I reacted because I know I didn’t need to yell, but not for why I was upset. I told her I wasn’t trying to put her in an awkward position. She responded by telling me how disappointed she is in me and that I crossed a line by speaking to him that way. I told her I am not a child any longer and if I don’t want to talk to them about something personal my husband and I are going through, I don’t think I should have to.

I’ve also attempted suicide when I was younger and I’m terrified those thoughts could spring back. I’m terrified I won’t love my baby or my life because of my hormonal mood swings and depression, and I might do something stupid.

So I don’t want to be pregnant. I would be much happier using a surrogate mother or adopting. My husband would prefer biological children, but he’s willing to support me with whatever decision I make.

The issue is that my parents (my mom specifically) are desperate for grandchildren. My sisters haven’t had kids yet — one of my sisters is gay with marital issues, and my other sister is having trouble finding someone compatible with her lifestyle. So I, being in a relationship with a man, am my parents best hope.

I’ve brought up my fears of pregnancy before and my mother told me that I “better get pregnant”, she wants a biological grandchild (really weird to me, I can understand wanting biological kids, but why grandkids?). I know she would judge me harshly and we already have a really rocky relationship.

I want to lie to her and tell her that I’m infertile and can’t get pregnant. This would be so much easier than telling her, and I feel like she would accept my future children more knowing that I had no other option.

Would I be the asshole? It would be a lie about my decisions, but it wouldn’t be lying about who the child’s genetics actually belong to or where they came from. 

Edit: just clarifying, asking if I’d be the asshole for the lie, not for my decisions on child rearing :)",129,191,0.94

456,Not the A-hole,"- sorry for weird format! im currently on mobile. 

My friend (19M) has been staying over at my house for the past year or so due to him being homeless
during last year and this year, he probably took at MOST 4 showers. I offered him to shower here in a shared bathroom between my sister and niece but he refuses because “it’s dirty” - I have cleaned and bought a bath mat to fix this but he makes excuses often that “Oh well it was dirty earlier” “I dont smell THAT bad” (he does) 

Anyway I just bought a new bed, sheets, pillows TWO DAYS AGO because he absolutely WRECKED mine with his sweat and stench. (literal sweat stains and smell of his b.o. carved into the fibers of the bed) I know its not me sweating. While i do burn up like a furnace in bed, My sweat is not so extreme to the point it leaves the sheets damp and wrinkled every night. Plus, my side of the bed is perfectly fine. 

Today,  I go to lay on my bed when i notice that the sheets are wafting this overwhelming body odor, the sheets were wrinkled from the sweat. I kept involuntarily gagging to the point i almost threw up while to take off the sheets on my bed. 

I have smelled dead animals before, and if you have too you know how disgusting that smells? this was almost the perfect replica of that smell but just musky. 

He heard me gagging and throwing the sheets off the bed. I brought up that he needs to shower because his body odor was very overwhelming and i dont want to ruin my new shests and he got upset saying stuff like “ill just sleep on the couch so you arent bothered by my smell” or just being rude to me in general because i brought up that his body odor is pretty bad.

Tl;dr: just bought a new bed & bed sheets; friend who refuses to shower slept on it two times and now the sheets smell incredibly musky and are moist - complained about it to him and he believes i was an asshole for gagging at the smell and is, in general, being upset over it",69,33,0.92

458,Not the A-hole,"Me (F32) and my BF(M32) have been together 4 years. Every year, his parents book a week long holiday in June, for my BF, his son, and the parents. I've never been invited and I'm okay with it of course because I always want to encourage him to go and spend time with his family. I should also note that his parents have never accepted me, whenever I see them his parents ignore me, they've never asked me anything about myself or tried to include me in anything. 

Last week, his mum told us that she's booked the holiday and gave us the dates theyd booked and they're over my birthday. My birthday is in June but it's never clashed with their holiday before. Originally my boyfriend assumed that because she told us while I was there, it meant I was invited but we've since discovered I'm not invited. 

He said he won't go if he doesn't want me to, because it's my birthday, but I can tell he really wants to go. He also really wants them to invite me, but honestly even if I was I wouldn't want to go because I don't like the idea of spending my birthday with people who don't like me much. But I don't want to tell him not to go, because it's a week away with his parents and his son, and they always have a really lovely time. I've told my boyfriend a bit of how I feel but I feel really guilty like I'd be stopping him having a good time. I don't want to be a bitch, but I'm also frustrated because this could have been resolved if they just asked my boyfriend what dates would work instead of just booking them, and a bit hurt that after 4 years they still don't know when my birthday is (I don't expect them to know the exact date, but they could have at least learnt which month it was in)",49,60,0.93

461,Not the A-hole," My girlfriend and I live together. Have been dating for a few years, but just moved in together six months ago.

Something I had noticed a bit before, but is now really apparent since we spend even more time together is her BO. I knew she didn't like to shower when we are dating, but I didn't know she only showers once every 7-10 days. We've had conversations about how I think it should be more frequent than that (at least 3 days) and that its embarrassing that I should even mention that she smells and that if I can tell, other people can as well. She says that someone would have told her if she did. I had to let her know that one of her friends told me in confidence because it was embarrassing and my mother, friends have said things before.

She doesn't want to shower more frequently because she says the water isn't good for her hair, but doesn't have a good response when I told her I'd get her a shower cap / she doesn't have to wash her hair every time. My concern is that we've had this conversation over a dozen times, but it doesn't seem to have changed at all. She has started showering regularly at exactly 7 days, but I don't think that is enough. I feel like an AH for noticing how often she showers, but it makes it uncomfortable to sleep in the same bed (her hair smells greasy even if it doesn't feel it) and I want a little femininity out of my SO (shaven legs, etc.). Speaking of femininity, when she is on her period she doesn't want to shower since ""she doesn't feel clean,"" which I can understand to an extent. So that adds another 3-5 days between bathing depending on where it lines up. Most recently, and what led to this post, was that day 7 she started, so she took a shower on day 11.

For me, its on the edge of accepting that we all have personal freedom to do what we'd like, yet I feel like there is a certain expectation for hygiene and that I'm not asking too much. My biggest concern is what happens when we have children and what will be acceptable/ ok then. AITA?

I get compliments on how ""cool and unique' it sounds at times but I still hate it.

She lived around half an hour away, and I am an inexperienced driver, so that sucked too, but she said shed had been planning on moving in with a relative in town, which would have been 10 minutes away.

I told her I don't care about sex, but the fact that she isn't comfortable around me, and the fact that she rushed into a relationship so fast after the assault probably wasn't healthy, and I told her we should take a break so she actually has time to heal and process everything. 


She said she was disappointed in me, and started being a dick to me.

469,Not the A-hole,"Some context: about a year ago a very good friend of mine lost his father to heart related issues. He and his family had been struggling with money for a while well before this; he had told me a few weeks prior that they weren't paying for their house anymore and were refusing to leave until the bank came to take it from them (something along those lines, I'm young and have no idea about this stuff). His father had to leave his job as a chemical engineer because his mother was diagnosed with MS and was unable to work/ take care of herself. On top of this, they were paying his older brother through college.

Fast forward to today. We're seniors in high school, it's 2nd semester, and senior events are coming up rapidly. He expressed an interest in coming to our senior party, but said he was unable to afford it. I offered to help him, and talked to my dad about his situation. My dad is a teacher at our high school, so he was able to find out that one of our assistant principals typically helps people in this situation with Prom and other events. He would be willing to meet us halfway to pay for a ticket.

In the past few weeks, however, something has changed. This same friend who told myself and several other mutual friends that he couldn't afford a $55 ticket has bought a Nintendo Switch, a new phone, and a guitar within the past month. He also bought a plane ticket to go to California and meet his e-girl. Obviously these were red flags to me, since I had agreed to pay for him under the pretext that he couldn't afford it and had gotten my dad to agree to help me pay for him to go to prom. I confronted him about this last night, and he told me he's got 18-years worth of savings for himself. He also blocked me after this conversation.

Our mutual friends are remaining pretty silent about this and removed, though one of them has told me privately that he believes this friend of ours is using me for my dad. I feel bad because of all he's had to go through, but if he has enough money to buy all these things for himself, why should I pay for him?",10,27,0.93

472,Not the A-hole,"My coworker's son is in Chiropractic college. With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that.

However, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say ""Medical School"". They also mislead further by saying he will be a ""Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country"". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.

475,Not the A-hole,"My mom was having a party Saturday night at her house and I was having a nice time talking to some family members when my mom and grandma came over to join the conversation. Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.

My mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. 

Out of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, 

Me: Umm... isn't she kind of old? 

Mom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! 

Me: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.

Grandma: I'm going to walk away now.

477,Not the A-hole,"Hi reddit,

For context:

We are a small company, there was only two people really experienced here. One of them left last December and I got a proposal from the same company to go with him. After much thought, I talked with my last remaning experienced colleague about the matter and she told me that it would be a bit unfair from my side to the company to leave at such a critical moment. I've decided to stay based on this thought, too, because I'm not as experienced but my bosses really like me and I think I've been doing a very good job so far. So  think it would be really hard for them to lose us both at the same time.

But January came, and they decided to fire our last experienced member (the same one I just mentioned) simply because one of my bosses (they are a couple) doesn't like her. She was top notch professionaly, everybody liked her, expect the boss. So they fired her, leaving the team even more crippled. 

My feeling of ""being unfair to leave"" dissolved completely on that moment. 

A month later (a week ago) I received a fantastic offer for my career on another company. I really want to go, even though I know it will hurt my company and current bosses a lot. They recently gave me a raise and I know they are totally counting on me, but I still feel like leaving.

I think she's an amazing person, she's wickedly smart, she's very funny and I have so much fun with her. Ramona is actually very pretty in the face and she takes very good care of herself considering. The issue she is morbidly obese. I would think she weighs well over 300lbs and she's about 5'5-5'6"" so it's even more prounounced because she's average height. She is 23 (I'm 20) and in the time that I've known her I would guess she's gained 50lbs and it really shows in her face. The crazy thing is she hardly eats anything so obviously she has a genetic condition which makes her put on weight which makes it even more sad because she can't help it. She was on her homecoming court in high school, and while she was ""thick"" she wore it very well. She claims she started gaining weight after a bad break up her freshman year from stress and the weight just came on.

The issue is I think we've always had a flirty relationship and I just thought it was part of our ""friend language."" I really enjoy her company and if she were thinner, I can see dating her and even marrying her--we get along that well. 

Things went crazy last night to the point where I don't even know if we can be friends anymore. I had a tinder date with another girl that was a disaster.  It was the first time I'd been on a date since college. I didn't even tell Ramona about it but word got back to her and she flipped out.

The general gyst of everything was that I led her on for the last 1.5 years and now I've fat shamed her and essentially cheated on her and that I'm an asshole.

Part of me sees the point and maybe I am fat shaming her for a condition she can't help but part of me feels like of I'm just not attracted to her, than I'm just not. Am an asshole for any of the above?

The younger guy decided that he’s moving out early and is gonna break the lease, but the other roommate and I have to both sign off on him removing himself from the lease, and he has to find someone else to take over his section.

Yesterday he scheduled someone to come over and see the house.  I made sure I would be home so I could meet him.  I have two pets and wanted to make sure they would get along with the guy.  

When the guy showed up though, I got a weird feeling in my gut.  There was nothing really in particular, but if you’re a woman, you like know that gut feeling.  The “this man makes me uncomfortable but I don’t know why” feeling.  That’s what I got off of him.  I keep going in and out of the kitchen because that’s where they are and I’m trying to monitor and the guy mentioned that his 26 year old son lives nearby.  When I heard that I knew I didn’t wanna live with him.  Had I known I would end up living with a 40+ year old man, I never would have signed the lease here.  I feel like it might be hard to any guys reading to understand, but I’m hoping that any women reading this can get why I, a 22 year old gay woman, wouldn’t want to live with a man twice my age.  I had friends over at the time, but after the guy left, I went to my bedroom and just laid down and cried for a bit.  I just got a bad gut feeling and, as I told my friends later, am not sure that I would feel comfortable home alone with him.  I also think I’m entitled to want to live with people somewhere in my age range.

I told my roommate that I’m not signing off on him living with us, but my roommate thinks I’m being unfair because he “works to pay the bills like any of us.”  From his perspective, my roommate just wants to get out of the lease and it’s kind of an asshole move to hold him to the lease.  However, my roommate isn’t the one that will be living with whoever he finds so I think it’s inconsiderate to not even try to consider what the house dynamics will be like after he leaves.  I think my roommate also already told the other guy he could have the room if he passes the background check.  If this person moves in then I’m going to probably try to move so I can live with people closer in age. 

So anyway AITA for not wanting to live with him and not signing off on adding him to the lease?  I feel like maybe I’m holding my roommate hostage, but I also feel like I’m entitled to comfort in my own home.

I narrowed my selection down to four people. Theyre all pretty much equal in experience, knowledge, and confidence. Ones a bit more charismatic than the rest but really thats just superficial.

Me: “No thanks.” I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom’s texts and phone calls. (Keep in mind that I was already frustrated from the fact that my mom was being super needy about it, and her telling me to get more stuff for more people didn’t help it at all.)

I spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. 

Walked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) 

We were arguing then I just said “Maybe if you weren’t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn’t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!” (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) 

She then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. 

Typing that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I’m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. 

I’m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all.

489,No A-holes here,"I like to surprise my husband with massages and it being Valentines day soon, I figured hed appreciate one. I was in a BST group on Facebook and someone recommended one that we hadnt used before and it was a running a Valentine's day special - so I thought, what the hey? 

Dropped him off at the parlor, me and our kids got dinner and then went to Chuck E Cheese to wait out the hour massage.

He arrives a little later and the first thing he says is ""Im gonna need a blow job tonight."" I smiled and said ""Was she sexy?"" (Im bi. I dont mind if he looks.) And he said no and then told me that he thought I knew I signed him up for a tantric massage. Which is basically massaging around (and on) his genitals to give him a semi and then massage elsewhere to let him go flaccid. Even though the ad (https://imgur.com/a/cyYX5aH) listed no such ""treatment"".

I was stunned and didn't quite know what to say. Then he told me about what she said when he got in there. ""Oh your wife signed you up for this? She must be pretty awesome."" ""Some guys have to relieve themselves in the middle of the procedure. Just let me know and Ill get you a towel.""

He went along with it because he thought its what I signed him up for. We have a good strong relationship, and theres a very slim potential that I could have signed him up for it. We'd been in seperate polyamorous relationships in the past, we watch porn together.

We get home, he shows me the massages she performed and I pretend to be ok. He gets his blow job and goes to bed. I stay up thinking about the massage non-stop. Eventually I tell him that Im not ok with what happened. That I want to be mad at him but I cant be. He says he should have left. He says it was stupid to stay.


He should have left. He should have called. He should have texted. He should have asked. We have 2 kids under 3 yrs old so sex is... Scarce. I feel like he didnt call me because secretly he wanted the massage... Whether I was ok with it or not. :(


Here it is almost a week later and I still cant stop thinking about it. I dont want to touch him because I cant stop thinking about her touching him. I usually give him massages and back rubs all the time... But I cant..

P.s. I'm not angry... Just upset, depressed and defeated.

AITA for not wanting to touch him?


ETA: I'm not doing it maliciously or to punish him. I have anxiety, depression and body issues. I literally start to have a panic attack if I think about giving him a massage or touching him sexually. This isnt on purpose. I dont want to be like this. I did talk to him the day after. I'll try talking again. ",76,70,0.8

492,Not the A-hole,"Boyfriend (27M) and I (27F) had an argument tonight after dinner. I had picked out a new restaurant I wanted to try a few months ago and he had okay'd the menu and agreed to try it out with me. I made the reservation and we showed up tonight. It was a 6pm reservation so they were busy. Less than 5 min into being seated he was annoyed already and was unhappy with me, partly because the waiter had not come over yet, the restaurant was packed and noisy, and partly because he just does not like leaving the house. I told him I had been looking forward to it, I dressed up, had pre-paid for dinner (set menu), and that this is my first time at the restaurant too and I cannot foresee the situation. I told him I just wanted a nice meal out with him since most days we stay at home while he plays video games and I entertain myself. I told him that I wanted him to have some patience with the restaurant and to just focus on me and talk to me for a few hours while we're out. And that by being upset he ruined the night for me too. His response was ""Fine, go ahead, talk"".

&#x200B;

Anyways, dinner went by more or less uneventfully afterwards and when we got home, he knew I was sad and hugged me, and I started to tell him how I don't like how we pretty much just live together and don't talk and how he spends all his waking moments with his electronics. He said ""but we spend all the time together"". Yes, we sit side-by-side on the couch as he plays his video games and I'm on my laptop waiting to show him something funny I saw or share a story when he catches a break from one of the boss fights. His argument was this is because we are comfortable with each other so we don't always have to talk. I told him I didn't like him playing games that much but have to deal with it everyday because it's what he likes and he needs time to relax too. But I'm upset that every time I ask him to do something with me that I'd enjoy (trying new restaurants, going on a walk, etc) he agrees but puts on a ""I hate this"" face all time. And it kinda ruins the moment for me when I just want to spend more time together. His point was that we spend time together at home, and that I'm being unfair by asking him to act like he was enjoying doing these things when he clearly does not just for the sake of making me more comfortable. He now refuses to talk to me.

&#x200B;

This was not the first time he was upset at a restaurant. In his defense, the services at the past few new restaurants that we've tried have been subpar and the wait was long (\~2 hours wait for the main course), but instead of just talking with me, he'd complain and tell me how shitty things are, how I have horrible taste in restaurant selections, and how it's a waste of money and we should've just stayed home. AITA for wanting him to do these things with me once in a while even when he doesn't enjoy it and not act out? Or should I just accept that we'll be couch buddies and let him be and find friends to go out with me instead so we don't run into this problem again? Thanks.

&#x200B;

Edit: 

\- The restaurant yesterday did not have a 2 hour wait, we were in and out after a 5-course meal in about 1h45m. We had tried restaurants before that did have the long wait, and I agree, that was a pretty bad experience and I felt bad for asking him to go with me. 

\- Thank you for the suggestions, I will stick with known restaurants with him and try out new places with my friends, which I think will probably be more comfortable for both of us

\- I'm not sure if he has social anxiety (he's really good around school and work) but he does not like to be around people so maybe I shouldn't push him to go out 

\- He moved across the country for school 3 years ago, we did long distance for about 1.5 years before deciding it wasn't working because we'd get into arguments about how he was lonely and stressed I wasn't there for him. I used to fly out once a month to visit for about 4 days or so. But ended up quitting my job and moving over so things would be a bit easier. Things were good when I used to visit, he said he doesn't get much time with me so he'd go explore around the city with me and we'd cook together, watch movies, puzzles, etc. Basically I got all the attention while I was here but it was REALLY bad when I was away. Now he says he knows exactly what's going on in both our lives and everything can be summed up in a 5 min convo, there's no point just staring at each other. When I told him sometimes I miss the times when we were doing long distance because the moments we spent together felt more special to him, he said it was a shitty thing to say and I should be happy we're spending all the time together now. 

\- I told him I don't mind him playing games when he comes home from school/work, but when he's had the whole day off where he stays at home to do so, and I come back home from work at night, I want him to spend some quality time with me instead of the games. He said no and said a lot of girlfriends are happy just watching their boyfriends play and I should be able to do that too. 

\- He did buy games that he thinks I'd enjoy and that he can play and I can watch, we did that for a while. I'm not into gaming but it worked for a bit and we'd discuss the storylines and characters, etc. I brought the game up yesterday, but he says he's tired of that style of game and doesn't want to do it for a while. 

\- I think I'm more easily irritated at his actions now as opposed to before as well because I feel like I've done a lot for him and expect the same but maybe that's not the right mindset to be in and I should change my expectations as opposed to asking him to change. For example, he likes to make jokes, but some of his jokes are at my expense and I'd get upset, but he says I'm being too sensitive and I shouldn't take everything so seriously. Yesterday on our way back home he made a joke I didn't get and he said it's because I'm a ""peasant girl and not sophisticated enough to understand"". 

\- I've tried to ask him to go to couples therapy with me but he rejected the idea 

\- He says we're not teenagers anymore and we don't have to do all the ""dating stuff"", and being comfortable just living with each other is what normal relationship progresses to 

\- He wasn't always like this, so I'm not sure which part changed, maybe I should be less clingy and let him be happy in his zone. I'm more upset that he's upset at things and I feel like I'd be okay as long as he's happy and I can be there with him. I try to find other things to do with friends when I'm free and he's busy.",107,146,0.96

496,Not the A-hole,"This is a throwaway account. Idk if any relatives use Reddit, so.. yeah.

This is a long story, and has many details that (I believe) all matter, but it is hard to tell it through such a short amount of text, so bear with me. TL;DR at the bottom.

I (F20) cut off all contact with my adopted sister (we will call her Rachel) a couple of years ago, and I'm still wondering if I am the asshole in this situation. 

Some background:

Rachel was adopted into my family when her and I were freshmen in highschool. We had been best friends since 6th grade and after much consideration, based on her home life, my parents took her in.

We had a typical sister relationship. We got along well, but we also fought occasionally, and more so as our highschool years went on. I could have been a better friend/sister at times, for sure. But other than that, we were good. 

Onto the situation:

Freshman year of highschool (I'm 13, she was 15), Rachel and I shared a group of friends. One of our friends was a 21 year old guy from our church youth group. My parents trusted  (let's call him Ron) him because of this, so Rachel and I hung out with him a lot. He would pick us up and take us to the mall or the movies.. the three of us (sometimes others tagged along) had a lot of fun. Rachel became really close with him and started calling him ""brother"", which I thought was weird at first, but since I wanted to be like her in some ways, I occasionally referred to him as our ""brother"", as well.

Well, for my 14th birthday, Ron offered to have a mini party (Me, Rachel, Ron, and 1 other friend of mine) at his apartment, where he would provide alcohol. This was not a red flag to me, since we (me, Rachel, Ron, and others)h ad hung out at his apartment before and had alcohol there. 

I agreed to this and made plans with Rachel. She had a softball game the day of the party, but told me that her and our other friend would just meet me at Ron's that evening.

Long story short, she never showed up. I had one drink and passed out, only to wake multiple times throughout the night to witness Ron taking advantage of me. 

The following morning (my actual birthday), I woke up at about 5am with a bad headache and felt sick. I immediately got dressed and Ron drove me home. I told him that I didnt remember saying yes to what had happened that night and he apologized, and left. I went to my room and laid on my bed. Rachel was in her room listening to music, so I went in and asked her why she didnt show up. She told me that she had told Ron that she couldn't make it, that she had spent the night at our friend's, but that she was sorry she couldn't be there. 

FF a couple of months, I decided to tell Rachel what had happened, because I began to worry for her safety, as she had still been hanging out with Ron, and now without me (because I stopped altogether after that day). She apologized for what I had gone through, but I had a feeling that she didnt believe my story. She continued to hang out with Ron. 

I think this info is critical to her assessment of the situation; I think she doesnt believe me because one time, at one of our previous parties at Ron's, she had walked in on me and Ron kissing. Before she walked in, I had been talking to Ron about truth or dare, and he dared me to kiss him. I was drunk and thought that it would be funny to do that, so I did. And she walked in at the wrong moment and never let me explain what happened. 

Okay, so FF to Senior year. 

Rachel was kicked out by my mother for stealing and doing drugs and some other things (I hadn't seen Ron around for a while at this point. I thought they weren't hanging out anymore). She moved in with her boyfriend and basically stopped talking to me and my family (besides holidays). I would text her occasionally to see how she was doing but that's about it. 

Shortly after this, I decided to tell my parents about what had happened to me. My dad made me go to the police and make a report, and eventually Ron was informed of the situation. 

FF to about a year ago.

Ron was killed in a motor vehicle accident. Not knowing if Rachel was aware or not, I texted her and asked if she knew about what happened. She told me that not only did she know, she was in the hospital every day holding his hand for nearly a month. She then said ""I know you don't like him, but I love him, he's like my brother."" I said, ""Its not that I dont *like* him, it's that he *raped* me. But, you know what? You can love whomever you want."" (Not exact quote). She said, ""I love you."" And I didn't respond. 

Her Facebook timeline photo is of him. Her bio says ""My brother is an angel, R.I.P.""


She has recently tried to get in contact with me, but I felt like I would be happier if she wasn't in my life. So I refused to give her my new phone number and have not reached out. 

So, AITA for doing this?

TL;DR: I was raped at 14 by a 21 y/o mutual friend of my adopted sister. I told her about it and I dont think she believed me. After the guy died (and she spent his dying moments with him), I cut contact with her because she keeps saying that she loves him despite of how I feel about him and she calls him her brother.",131,306,0.93
497,Not the A-hole,"Hi everyone. I'm using a throw away account for obvious reasons and am typing this on mobile so please forgive any spelling errors, spellcheck has it out for me. 

I recently left a long term relationship and am out on the dating scene again. I've been using dating apps and online dating sites since I find I usually have better luck talking to people also interested in dating. Like everyone else, I put what is important to me in my bio. One of my few deal breakers is kids, I dont want any and I dont want to date someone who had them or wants them. There are many reasons for this, but it really boils down to incompatibility. Wanting children vs not puts us on very different paths in life. I hold to this rule no matter what, if a guy has a kid in his bio I pass, if i find out he has them/wants them after talking I walk away. I'm in my mid twenties and am looking for a guy around my age which means some guys will already have kids so I keep this in my bio to preemptively weed them out.

This doesn't stop guys from lying or matching with me just to complain about how I am selfish, rude, too dumb to know what I want, am missing out on the greatest joy in life, etc. I can deal with internet trolls and usually just brush it off. 

Recently, however, a friend of mine set me up with a single friend of hers from college. He seemed nice and I trusted her judgement that he was great and we shared lots of mutual interests. We went on a first date and things were really great. He was funny and sweet and liked the same sports teams. I was really interested in him and had a great time.

On our second date I decided to test the waters and asked ""where do you see yourself in 5 years?"" Which is my go to question for probing their interest in a family. Most people who see families in their future bring it up when talking about the future. His response was fine, he wanted a promotion, to move to a new city and settle down. I was a bit disappointed that he wanted a family but didnt react since I didnt want to ruin the date. We kept talking about our city and why he wanted to leave and he said to be further from his ex. Turns out he has a young son from a previous relationship and was having trouble co parenting so he wanted to move away. Super big deal breaker for me. His attitude at that point was terrible, really just venting about his parenting woes, and he could tell I wasnt interested anymore. The date wrapped up and we went our separate ways. He asked about a third date and I told him I didnt know what my schedule was like. I wanted to let him down easier the next day than right after I found out.

Later that night he started texting me asking what he did wrong. I was honest and told him that kids were a deal breaker for me which is when he went off. I got a whole string of abusive texts about how I was bigoted and didnt know how hard it was being a single parent. That I am a bitch for not dating single dads and that no one would want me if i wouldn't give them children or raise their existing kids. I usually dont let this kind of thing affect me but this particular bad date hurts worse since he actually got to know me and before he had a kid he seemed like a great guy.

I got a text from him today apologizing and talking about how he was just frustrated since he gets turned down a lot. He wants me to give him another chance and claims that his kid won't have any impact on our dating which I dont believe to be true. 

So am I really the asshole for refusing to date an otherwise good guy because he has a kid?

Edit to add: I am not considering dating him anymore because of how nasty he was to me. However this has gotten me thinking in general on him I'm being an asshole to all the other guys who want kids that I pass on.",360,1144,0.94

499,Not the A-hole,"This is somewhat of a long story so I’ll try to keep it as informative and short as possible but please bare with me.

For context, I am an almost 25 year old woman and my younger brother is 22. My mom is 56 and my dad is 53.

My dad had an affair with a random woman in 2011. My parents had seemed to work it out. My mom wanted couples counseling but my dad never followed through with that and then everything was forgotten (I did not forget). Great, whatever, that’s their marriage.

However, last year my mom found out that my dad was having another affair. This time with a family friend. This woman, let’s call just call her Gloria, had known my dad in high school but were never friends until later in life when we would rent her cabin on a lake for family vacations. Gloria was always super sweet, fun, and had hung out with my family a few times on these vacations. Gloria and her husband started befriending my parents more, and her and my mother became closer friends.
A few years pass, and my dad’s mom dies. Suddenly he’s going to visit his hometown (about 10hrs from where we live and where my grandmas house is) to go through old belongings and I suppose to reminisce. We were all very supportive. 
But then, my mom starts hearing from friends who live there that they’ve been seeing Gloria and my dad out and about together, in an inappropriate context. My mom confronts my dad and he admits that yes, he’s been seeing her for 2 years behind her back. Apparently all the times he spent in his hometown, he was really with her. And when he went to Florida to fix up a trailer my family owns (which we rent out), she went with him.

This was much more devastating to my mom, me, and my brother than the first time. We know this woman personally, and she also has a husband and son. It cut deep.

Fast forward 6 months and my parents are still “trying to work things out” and he claims he is not seeing or talking to her anymore. My dad and my mom have always had a retirement plan to sell their current home and move near the town they went to college to and get a home on the lake. My mom is close to retirement. So my dad tells my mom he’s been applying to jobs in that area and he gets it. My dad heads up there and he finds a house, and he buys it. My mom agreed to all of this.
However it was all a lie. My dad tricked my mom into signing documents that tie that new house into their current house’s mortgage. And now Gloria is living with him up there. She even changed her address to that house!

Gloria’s husband divorced her when he found out about the affair, and share custody of their son who is a senior in high school. However, my parents refuse to divorce for financial reasons, and instead are just separating.

Now comes the important part. This really hurt my brother and I. It hurts to see my dad treat my mom this way with absolutely no remorse. As an adult, I can also empathize with my mom and it’s hard.

My dad has never apologized to me and my brother for hurting us.

After an extensive conversation with my brother we decided to confront my dad together and give him an ultimatum which is “We don’t care if you separate from mom and date other people, we just don’t want you with Gloria. If you stay with Gloria we are cutting you out of our lives completely” this includes not coming to my graduation, wedding, being in grandchildren’s lives. Ya know, the stuff that is supposed to matter to a parent. 
We explain to him why we want this. That Gloria will forever be a symbol of the pain he caused, that we don’t want her anywhere near us. And that he never apologized for hurting us and that hurts even more.

My dad’s response? “Well I’m not married to you guys, you live your life and I’ll live mine”. In the 45min conversation where we laid out all our feelings to him, he still refused to take responsibility for the hurt he caused and he still hasn’t apologized. 

He then goes on to call us awful for giving him an ultimatum like that, and he doesn’t understand why he can’t be with Gloria even after we clearly explained how we felt and why we felt that way.

I blocked him on all social media accounts and I intend to stick to my word. I’ve come to the conclusion that he’s selfish and he’s never really been there for us anyways. But it’s still bothering me if I’m really doing the right thing here. Maybe my dad was right, it was unfair to do that? But he showed no remorse, took no responsibility, and never apologized before OR after we gave him the ultimatum. 

So, AITA for giving my dad an ultimatum and then cutting him out of my life?

EDIT: To be fair, I genuinely do not care if he isn’t with my mom. If they’re unhappy I want them to divorce! Find other people and be happy!! My brother and I just can’t find it within ourselves to forgive Gloria and move past it. The only reason why we gave my dad a second chance is because, well he’s our dad.

I don’t want Gloria in my life and if I ever have kids I certainly would not want her to know them or for them to know her.",144,552,0.97

I took issue with this, as I am worried about leading the conversation with someone so young. My Wife became angry and defensive and is currently not speaking to me.

B (Who is 9, almost 10 years old) (I'm 18) is always rummaging through my room looking for money or candy (which I frequently hide in my room to keep him away from it) Sometimes he shoots me with nerf guns but when I do it, he goes crying to our mother who tells me off and says nothing to him. Most of the time he's also slapping or hitting me while I'm playing video games. So recently (after my birthday) I told him that he could either quit it or be woken up by being tossed in the snow every day to wake him up. (He didn't quit cause he didn't think I would do it) so I threw him in the snow for the first time this morning and he is now screaming and crying that I ruined his day. AITA?",58,196,0.95

514,No A-holes here,"First time poster long time lurker. So I'm 29m shes 28f we've been dating 10 months and besides this everything in our relationship is great. However, she brings up her ex who died 2 years ago constantly, like everytime we see a black Corvette (vehicle he died in). We live in Florida so you can imagine how often we see corvettes. She does a lot of things to honor him and such, like she went back to school for nursing because she had always told him she would and some other things, she still has a picture of the guy on her dresser in her closet which happens to be on the same side of the bed that I sleep on when I stay with her. 

I was ok with this at first because I know everyone grieves differently, but where am I supposed to draw the line. I don't feel like I can compete or live up to who this dude was. 

So more into this as I feel more details are needed. She dated this guy on and off for 7 years, they had been broken up for 2 years when he died. She spent more time with his mom on both Thanksgiving and Christmas, I got to see her for maybe 15 minutes before she went to her brothers house both times. I also had family in town from Scotland, which I told her it was important to me that she meet them as they don't come over often.

I do have some of my own issues, I am certainly no where close to perfect. I also understand that she is grieving, and I empathize with her on that tremendously, I've unfortunately lost way to many friends from motorcycle accidents and overdoses than I care to mention. Also, I have never mentioned my issue about this because I am trying to be supportive.

 I am between a rock and a hard place because I can see us going far in life as we get along on so many levels, we jumped out of a plane together, we travel well together, they're are pretty much no other issues at all. ",42,90,0.96

516,Asshole,"Both of us have always wanted children, and it's probably one of our biggest dreams. We love each other dearly, and I wouldn't even doubt her ability to be an amazing parent. Unfortunately, she happens to have a highly heritable autoimmune disease. I'd rather not get into the details as it's quite a sensitive topic, but the severity divers a lot per person. Some people are severely impaired due to it, and can have near to fatal attacks, while for others it could just be a minor inconvenience. I am extremely uncomfortable with the fact that one of our children might inherit it from her, or carry the genes that could potentially continue the disease.

Am I the asshole for choosing not to have children with her because of this reason?

When I made it clear that it'd be better if we wouldn't have children, so there wouldn't be a chance they'd inherit the disease from her, she didn't take it well, and it made her extremely upset. We both still would really want children, but it wouldn't be the right option to possibly make people suffer because of our selfishness. We've briefly discussed adoption, after which I've told her I wouldn't be comfortable with adopting children. If we did have children, I'd still want them to be related.

She's a wonderful person, and I'd never abandon her because of this, but it does make me have serious doubts about having children with her.

 https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/al7ftg/aita_for_refusing_to_see_my_brothers_baby/?utm_source=reddit-android

Hi everyone. So my post really opened my eyes to a lot of things. I tend to be a very stubborn, protective sister and I was realizing I was letting this get in the way of many things in my family relationships. I read a lot of good comments on that post, both expressing NTA and YTA and decided to try and meet in the middle. I met with my brother privately. I expressed to him my concerns and told him I will always love him. I offered to watch his baby if he needed time alone and apologized for being distant. I pointedly asked him if he would be with Amber if he found out the child wasn't his. He tells me no, he would feel betrayed. He told me he was terrified of the DNA test and what if the results turned out horribly? I hugged him and said no matter what happens, I'd be there. Even if he decided to stay. He said ""I want to do it. I'm tired of being afraid"". He agreed to take the test and I even paid for it. Results came in and the baby is his. The test stated ""with >99.999% accuracy"". He was so happy and relieved. He thanked me and gave me a big hug. He said he can sleep better knowing with scientific proof it's his. I apologized to him for being so headstrong about it. Everything is great and we hugged each other tightly, assuring each other we will always be family through anything.  

I again made it clear I would love to visit his baby, who is a boy named Leon by the way. I meet Leon today and I am excited.

Thanks again for the advice.",22,1158,0.98
518,Not the A-hole,"This happened on Valentine day's but I only found out about the reaction this morning. We all go to school in a fairly large college town.

&#x200B;

I went out with some friends to a couple bars late at night, and my roommate/friend invited some of his friends to tag along with us. One of them is this girl that I guess has issues with me since the moment she met me. There was 8 of us in total, myself included, 4 guys and 4 girls. We had been barhopping since 10 and it was already around 12. The guys had pregamed pretty hard before we headed downtown and most of the girls are not 21 yet so they couldn't drink. I hadn't drank at all up until that point so I made sure to keep track of everyone in our little group.

&#x200B;

We were moving in between bars, and I'm not going to lie, the area is pretty sketchy late at night. To give the area context, its where all the bars and clubs are, so everyone from my university and the town itself go to party. There's alot of crime in this place, alot of homeless people and other sketchy individual live in this area, this area is famous for fights, robberies, and assaults. There's a large police presence in the area because of this. We even saw a hit and run happen just as we were about to cross the street. (The car escaped)

&#x200B;

There we are, about to hit up the last bar for the night, and the group was getting separated. The guys and I were in our own little group walking ahead of the girls, while the girls were behind us with last two helping each other walk because one of them could barely stand up to walk. Since I was sober, I made sure that everyone was accounted for and were just about to cross the street and we were about half a block away, I realize we picked up an extra person. This random dude I hadn't seen at all, was talking to the last 2 girls, trying to pull them away. No one else noticed what was going on, I tapped my buddy on the shoulder to come with me to talk to the guy but he didn't realize there was a random guy following us.

&#x200B;

As I approached the guy, I could hear him say they should go with him to this other bar and he was getting real close to them. One of the girls could barely stand up straight to walk, so the other girl couldn't walk away fast enough to move away from him so I got in between them by sticking my arm out and wrapping around the girl in kinda a half hug and turning toward the guy and telling him they were good and that they were with our group of friends. It worked for a moment because he backed up immediately but then one of the girls (the one that doesn't like me) says that they didn't need me and that I didn't have to touch her.

&#x200B;

That shit left me stumped and I suddenly felt really awkward so I immediately let go and I walked away back to my friends. By that point, the rest of the guys figured out what was happening and were like ""who dafuq is this guy?"" while pointing at this guy. And since I walked away from the girls, the guy used the opportunity to come back up to the girls and talk to them. He followed us the whole way to the bar. The atmosphere was awkward after that, we all got quiet after that with the guy being the only one talking.

&#x200B;

The whole time time we were walking, he was trying to talk to the girls saying ""We should go to this bar"", ""Where is that bar located"" and ""Why don't we wanna go to that bar."" When we finally reached the bar and it became clear we were not going everywhere else, the guy dipped and disappeared.

&#x200B;

We went inside, the guys and I went into our little group and did our own thing, while the girls went into their own, before dipping out early.

&#x200B;

This was a couple of days ago, and my roommate told me this morning that his friend (the annoying one) that she is upset with me, that the girls could have handled it and they didn't need my help, I didn't have to touch her, and that they didn't need man to defend themselves, and I need to tone it down with my machismo. (I think she said the last part because she knows I'm Latino). I talked my roommate and my friends about it if I did a bad thing and we laughed about it. But I honestly feel a little hurt now and like I did something wrong.

&#x200B;

I'm wasn't trying to be a knight in shining armor, I wasn't rescuing a damsel in distress. I didn't expect anything  owed to me. I just saw someone that was in need of help and I reacted because I felt like I was doing the right thing but I guess not. In hindsight, I realize what I did was very stupid and dangerous. The guy could have reacted very negatively to what I did, he could have had a knife or a gun. I could have gotten into a fight or worse. Like violent crime is a common occurrence. (The Bojangles in front of my apartment was robbed this week with an AK47 style weapon and they got away from the police.) I get kicked out of my program with only a year and half left before I graduated for a career I worked so hard to achieve, or my parents lose their only child.

Not worth it.

&#x200B;

Lesson learned, No good deed goes unpunished.

&#x200B;

Update: My roommate spoke with her today and she accused me of being a white male. I don't know what that means considering I'm Latino that was born in south America. Should I be offended or concerned? She doesn't appreciate me touching her friend and that I should have gotten in between them and the guy. All in all, I've just been walking around the apartment yelling at my roommates ""Your a white male!"" at them.

519,Not the A-hole,"I get a bit claustrophobic on flights and always book a window seat when I travel. I usually only need to take short domestic flights for work and the window shade has never been an issue. A few months ago, I was on a long haul from Europe to the US. I had a window seat in business class. Seats were in a 1-2-1 arrangement so I had the window on one side of my chair and an aisle on the other.

The flight left around 2pm local time. They served the meal fairly quickly after take off.  I still had my tray in front of me and was gazing over it out the window when the flight attendant reached over me with a tray to shut the window shade. I asked what she was doing and she said the guy across the aisle wanted to sleep. I told her I booked the window seat for a reason and wanted it open. 

The guy all the way across the aisle has a sleep mask and it was the middle of the afternoon. I also had a cross-stitch with me to work on during the 12 hour flight and needed better light than just the overhead lamp. The FA made some snippy remark about us needing to compromise and ""allowed"" me to put it partially back up.

AITA for keeping the shade up? The guy never talked to me before getting the flight attendant. She never talked to me before slamming it shut. The other passenger could block light with his sleep mask, pillow, and blanket since we had lie flat seats in little compartments and I paid $5K for the window seat. Why should I be forced to ""compromise"" and sit in the dark during the middle of the day? I wouldn't have thought twice about it because I've always believed the person in the window seat controls the shade but when I got up a while later to get a bottle of water, I noticed my shade was the ONLY one open on the entire plane. I started to feel like ITA but I don't sleep on planes and need to be able to look outside so I don't feel so trapped in a metal can.

When they come back from school, I take their phones and put them in my bedroom so they have no access to them.

My son complains saying that all his friends dont have their phones or other stuff confiscated as soon as they get home. He also complains that he cant have his phone in his room overnight.

They argue that since their grades and behaviour are good (which is true, most of the time), they shouldnt be ""punished"". Im worried that if they are allowed to use their stuff they will start slipping at school.

522,Not the A-hole,"Sorry in advance for typos, I'm properly fuming.

So she went out last night for her brothers birthday with him and all his mates. She's really close with a lot of them as she grew up with them, they treat her like a little sister. It's really awesome. One of these guys friends came out too last night, someone she's only met a few times. We'll call him Dave.

So Dave has a girlfriend of 4 years, a pretty nice guy so I hear (not that I've ever met him) ((and not that I think that now)) At about 1AM last night, he was reeeeeeally drunk and they were all in the club. For the next 2 hours he preceeded to grab her ass 15+ times despite her telling him not to, he was begging her to come back to his for the night relentlessly and right near the end of the night, she was at the bar and he came up behind her and pinned her against the bar and pushed his erect penis against her bum. She managed to push him away but she's still quite shook up by it all. (she was raped 4yrs ago, still dealing with the after affects)

So I go to pick her up, she gets in the car and she's clearly off. About 2 minutes up the road she told me about the bum squeezing and propositions and I turned the car round. I was going to drag this guy to the car and make him apologise for being such a total peice of sh*t. I was told not to so I didn't. When we got home she then told be about him pinning her against the bar. I've somehow stopped myself going back to the club, I don't know how. I haven't been that angry in a looooong time.

So here's the kicker, she doesn't want anyone to know. I've found out his and his girlfriends names and I want to send a couple of messages off. Truthfully, I want to go and put this guy in the hospital but I'm not going against her wishes to that extent.

Advice would be great here, if anyone knows a way to process these emotions I'd be very glad to hear it.

So when me and my friends sat down to eat lunch and Dave sat with us, and we didn’t think anything of it at first until halfway through lunchtime he said (No joke) “Hi everyone, my name’s Dave and I’m gay”. We didn’t care and didn’t give any attention to him...   until he started hitting on us. At first he said stuff like “I want to swallow your kids”  and  “I want to see you in bed”, however these comments were mainly directed at me.

So recently he started getting more up close and personal like screaming in my ear and getting face to face, in me and my friends opinion to close. So on Valentine’s Day he said “I want you to be mine” and touched my upper thigh. I was shocked. I shouted “Get the fuck away from me!” He moved seats and started crying. Later that day a couple of his friends confronted me saying I’m a homophobic asshole.

&#x200B;

My SO (20F) and I (22M) have been going strong for 3 years now, even though we have quite different views/opinions about basically everything; attitude, politics, religion, philosophy.

&#x200B;

One of the hot topics we have discussed a lot is religion. I do not have a strong leaning to either side (guess that would constitute an agnostic) and my family has always had a pretty laid back attitude to these questions. But on the other hand, her upbringing is from a protestant family, and she has had a pretty strict christian upbringing.

&#x200B;

During one of our many discussions we came to the topic of masturbation and porn. She didn't like the fact that I looked at porn, while we were in a relationship, so I promised to stop, and I have kept and respected that promise ever since.

&#x200B;

The current problem is, that even though I don't masturbate to porn any longer, I still get berated (daily) about the fact that I believe, that in a relationship between two grown adults, porn is a topic that should simply be discussed and if neither party is comfortable with the other masturbating to porn, then perhaps they should come to a solution that fits them (me not watching porn, in our case).

&#x200B;

She firmly believes that masturbating to porn is equivalent to cheating, no matter what, and that my opinion is vile and disgusting. She says she won't be able to maintain our relationship as long as I have this opinion, and I honestly don't know what to do.

&#x200B;

I've stopped masturbating to porn, like she asked me, but now she wants to break up because I don't share her opinion. Is my opinion wrong that wrong?

Anyway, Valentine’s Day was a few days ago now and we couldn’t be together because she is on a ski trip with her family. We agreed to celebrate when she got back. I still messaged her Happy Valentines Day and told her that I loved her, but I’m trying to save all the ‘big’ stuff so-to-say until she is back in town.

That being said, I woke up to a text this morning from her that said, “Why didn’t you say anything about me anywhere on Valentine’s Day. Not even a Snapchat. Like you didn’t have a girlfriend on Valentine’s Day.”  Since then she has been acting different, even though I apologized repeatedly. 

I feel awful.. I didn’t intentionally *not* post a picture or flex her, I just.. don’t use social media like that I guess (besides Reddit).. She *did* post a picture of me on her Snapchat, and I appreciated it, but I didn’t really think it was such a big deal that I needed to do it too? If it was that big of a deal to her, I feel like a hint (and by hint, I mean a *big* hint because half the time I’m a clueless boy) would have been a big help! 

I’ve always enjoyed living in the moment and I think that stems from seeing my dad live behind his camera lens as I grew up, so I was more or less just focused on putting my effort toward making the time when she is *here* special.

Firstly, I want to thank all of you who gave your opinions and advice. After reading some of the comments, I realised that I have left this situation for way too long. So I had a sit down with my girlfriend and my wife and we had a long, long talk.

Firstly, to all those asking if my wife is pretending to be transgender in hopes that she’ll become “my type”: the answer is a big no. In fact, she doesn’t have romantic feelings for me at all, which I’m so glad of. It turns out that the reason she hasn’t pursued anyone in the ten years that we’ve been married is because she doesn’t really feel romantic or sexual attraction at all, towards anyone. As a member of the LGBT community myself, I have heard of this. Again, I was surprised that she had never said anything to me, but she told me that she’s always felt quite ashamed of this, because it’s not normal. That’s why she agreed to marry me in the first place: she didn’t want to marry anyone for real, and marrying me was her ticket to a single life without being judged.

Secondly, I’m going to come clean to my parents. It took a lot of convincing and a lot of tears from both my girlfriend and my wife, but I told them that they’ve done so much for me and it was time for me to start thinking about them, and not myself. I don’t feel comfortable doing it in person, so I will be telling them over the phone. To protect my wife, I will tell them all why she didn’t know I was gay, and now that she’s found out we will be divorcing. I will not tell them that she is transitioning. Before I tell them, my wife and girlfriend will be moving in with my sister’s family for a while, until it’s all blown over. As much as I hope my parents will just cut me off, knowing them there will probably some harassment and it may not be safe for them to be living with me.

Depending on how my parents react, I may have to move house, so that they can’t track me down. I don’t believe that they would physically harm me, but I’m not certain of that, and besides, there are other ways they can hurt me. 

Once everything has blown over, my girlfriend and I will move back together. My wife will stay with us too, through her transition. And she’s welcome to stay with us as long as she wants to after that. We’ll get a divorce, so she’ll finally be back to just my best friend.

535,Not the A-hole,"Namely birthdays, but some other stuff as well.

Long story short, I was born on NYE and New Year is a fairly big thing in my family. As far as I can remember the only things I'd get for my birthday were a cake and a present with the line ""this is for St. Nicholas' Day, Christmas and your birthday."" Sometime during middle school I stopped giving a damn about the NYE and NY, and I'd spend most of the time either helping out in the kitchen or playing Diablo 2 (that became some sort of tradition for me).

Note: I'm in mid-20s, living in a family house. Not unusual in my area.

Fast forward to some years back. There used to be a bistro nearby which was going to close with Jan 1st. I found out around mid-November. They had this one weekly special which I always wanted to try - there's a large bit of prep time and the taste is never ""right"" if you make it at home. I pitched the idea to celebrate my birthday there to my mom, who thought it was a great idea and we pitched the idea to grandparents. Problem was the last good opportunity to do so was the next day. Anyway, Grandpa was silent, and the Grandma's response was ""We went somewhere yesterday so we don't feel like going anywhere tomorrow. I cooked food for two days. And it's not a good time to waste money. And next week [duties] start, so we won't have the time."" Later, mom told me grandma was right, that just the two of us will celebrate it at a similar bistro at some future point in time and it was left at that.

That year, between Christmas and New Year, I simply disappeared right before lunch. No notice or anything. It's something I just don't do. I went to a Chinese restaurant. The context is I've been trying to go with _anyone_ for years, but never did. My friends are either on the other side of the country or spread around the globe, so that leaves my mom who always stalled (for various reasons, some of them financial) until I gave up.

Next year I had a minor thing to celebrate, family tradition. From the start it was stressed as _my_ celebration. I got home one day from work, done surprisingly early, only to be greeted with ""I'm glad you're here! We're celebrating your thing on Sunday with Y, but no one feels like dressing and going there, so we want you to go there, pick up the food to-go and bring it here."" This was a month after we talked and I explained what and where I wanted to do/have. From everything I heard, I had no reason to think that conversation wasn't forgotten, so I went with my original plan.

That year's birthday party is what I count as the only birthday celebration I had with my family in the past ~8 years, rather than being present at a party celebrating my birthday (which was always pushed aside for sparkling wine and fireworks). I had to effectively emotionally blackmail everyone involved to get to celebrate how I wanted. No one complained about the food, ambience or anything, only had constructive criticism about some stuff.

And then comes the last year, where my mom asked me what I wanted to have for my birthday. I told her X, Y or Z. Her response was ""Those are okay ideas, but I don't like them for this occasion, so I'll make H and D."" I nodded, helped her search for the recipe she wanted and went to celebrate on my own two weeks later.

Each time except the first, there was a massive argument with my mom. I explained where I went and why I went there. Primary emotion driving me was always anger. In her case, she was always viscerally hurt by me excluding her from my birthday. Pointing out I always felt excluded from _my_ birthday... didn't help.

After the last time, she basically swore off ever doing anything for my birthday again - until I deem her worthy of celebrating with me. 

So... am I the asshole? And writing this did feel a bit therapeutic.",23,43,0.89

540,Not the A-hole,"To preface this, I'm a brain tumor survivor and went trough surgery few years ago (the tumor was benign so no further treatment was needed) so obiously I went trough a lot of MRI scans before/after the surgery and I have a cousin who studies medicine in a medical uni.

One day I was talking with my grandma about something completely random when she out of the blue mentions something about my mom going to go to the MRI centre to get my scans so the she can send them to my cousin to help her study for an neurology exam. My first reaction was ""wtf, why has noone told me before?"".

From what I understood, my grandma was chatting with my cousin trough skype and my cousin told her that one of the professors was working in a field of neurosurgery and she mentioned my case to him and he was interested in it from the medical perspective. So my grandma thought it would be a good idea to give my cousin the CDs of my scans so that she could talk about it with the prof, so she was going to send my mom to ged a copy of the CDs in the centre.

Now I don't have a problem with helping my cousin in her studies but I kinda lashed out about all of this happening without my knowledge. My granma's argument was that she wasn't planning to share it with some random people, just with my family and a medical professional and that it was only meant as a learning material for my cousin. I told her that I don't have a problem with my cousin seeing it but I have a problem with her sharing my medical info without asking me first and I felt like my privacy was being breached. She then started acting hurt and went into the ""Ok, you got what you wanted, I won't send it to her"" mode. 

So am I the asshole for not keeping my temper down and lashing out on her?

542,Not the A-hole,"My sister has 14 kids. It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year.

A few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning.

545,Asshole,"To clarify, it's my house and she hasn't signed any form of lease agreement. 
A couple weeks ago I confronted her, saying I had been getting the vibe that she doesn't like me anymore. She admitted she had been feeling that way. I was hurt but didn't press her further, telling myself she must have just felt like that for a while and gotten over it, or she would have moved out. 

Last night she told me over Facebook messenger, while we were both home in our separate bedrooms, that she was moving out. I told her to take as long as she needed. Then I took the opportunity to ask her to clarify what she meant when she said she didn't like me. Her response was that she had felt like that since she moved in which was the beginning of January. 

I thought about that all night and then I told her this morning that I wanted her to leave immediately. I said she could take as long as she needed to get her stuff out but I don't want to share my house with someone who doesn't like me for one second longer. I feel betrayed by this whole experience and it's been really affecting me. 

I just got out of an abusive relationship and I'm grieving cos my brother died in December. I'm upset that she stayed in my space this whole time, making me feel awful and uncomfortable, not being upfront about issues and letting them fester. 

She's now trying to say she only meant she didn't like living with me. But that's not how she put it the three other times we spoke about it. I think she's just trying to back out of it. She is calling me unreasonable for not letting her stay tonight, even as I'm telling her this is testing my mental health. I have been hospitalised 7 times in the last 6 years and am now stable and this is jeopardizing that. To which she responded, this is stressing me too and it's not all about you. She has no mental health issues. 
So am I the asshole for demanding that she leave my space immediately? 

edit: If editing is against the rules please let me know. Guys I'm not making her homeless. She has her parents house and multiple friends. I would definitely not throw someone out who has nowhere to go. In regards to the mental health thing, well those are her words. She's been acting so different her health was the first thing I cared about and discussed it with her. She told me she has no problems and that I was worried over nothing. 

I am not blaming her for my own mental health, I'm just trying to point out that I'm in a very vulnerable space and she knew that moving in. 

She's known me for 10 years, been my best friend for 6 years and we have lived together before with no problems. That time she didn't move into my house and make me change a million things and lay down a bunch of rules about when I could talk to her and what subjects I'm allowed to bring up, how I'm allowed to wash my cat's bowls (previous post I made in this sub), and she didn't just announce changes to my regular routine without actually discussing it. Like she has been doing since moving in this time. I think if you're going to be such a sensitive housemate and require so many things to change for you to feel comfortable, it should be known before moving in. I wouldn't have agreed to it if she had been honest and open about her needs. She really is a completely different person since meeting her current boyfriend a few months ago, who was also living with me. 
 
This edit is just for context (and to add spacing), especially since a lot of comments said that it would be valid if she had been disrespectful, and she has been since moving in. I'm not going to be challenging anyone's judgements. I wrote this in a hurry yesterday and don't think I explained it well. ",140,102,0.83

548,Asshole,"So ""Jesse""(m42) and I(m37) have been friends for going on 20 years. I'm the entrepreneurial type, he's the just keep your head down and work hard and the American dream will automatically come type. Jesse has 3 jobs. He works at a car wash during the day, then parks trucks for UPS, then finishes off most his nights doing valet for a restaurant.

 The car wash is the 8-year gig. Jesse works hard asf. He's never late, never calls in sick, always down to come in on his days off if he's called in. Super trooper for real. The problem is, his starting wage was $7.25/hr....fast forward 8 years he now makes $8.15/hr. To add insult to injury the employees must split tips. And since washing cars is such a menial profession he's the 42-year-old working hard to survive while surrounded by co-workers who are mostly fuck ups or high school kids on break who just don't care. 

He's the workhorse and his employers take advantage of it full tilt. If he wants a day off to go check out the Bengals(his fave team) he damn near has to beg. When he's tried to bring up raises in the past management manipulates him into thinking his requests are non-sensical. Almost every day he tells me the BS he has to deal with from managers and co-workers and almost every day I tell him how he deserves better and should look for better but he kind of shuts down when I make these suggestions.

 So a couple days ago he comes to my place all smiles and suuuper excited. Like ""bro, guess what happened at work."" I'm thinking ohhhh shit, this mf finally got a raise. He tells me that their busy as all hell when the owner pulls up and gets out of his car looking pissed as fire. As soon as he gets out he points at Jesse and orders him over to the car, hands on his waist pacing back and forth clearly irritated. According to Jesse he literally runs over to the owners car. When Jesse gets over there, the owner switches up and begins to explain how much he appreciates Jesse for his hard work and YEARS of dedication to the business.

 The owner then tosses Jesse the keys to the car and pauses for a moment. Long enough of a moment to give Jesse the thought that the owner just gave him the car. The owner then chuckles and says nahhh I cant give you the beamer but I got you something else, open the trunk and check it out. Jesse takes the keys, opens up the trunk,(Again I'm thinking to myself like...it better be a kilo of bam bam or at least 3 mac book pros in that bitch) and feasts his eyes on...a mf'n air fryer.

 Jesse is telling me this shit like he's the luckiest dude in the world, and I, somewhat regrettably so begin to dismantle every bit of his excitement by describing how much of an insult and slap in the face this ""gift"" from his employer is. I'm telling him shit like ""you should've thrown that air fryer across the damn street and told him to go fuck himself"" etc etc. My rant probably lasted 3 minutes and at the end of it I look at his face and he looks embarrassed and somewhat ashamed. He's not looking at me while he say's ""well I thought it was pretty cool I really wanted one of those things"". I again go into explaining why he should feel disrespected and not appreciated until I snap out of it. Then he tells me maybe I'm right, followed by ""well I gotta get to my other job"" but I really feel like he just left because I shit all over his good day. What's your take? AITA

TL:DR Friend of mine has been working at a place that's given him less than a dollar raise in 8 years. Owner gives him an air fryer to show appreciation. My friend feels good about it until I make him feel bad about it. ",51,90,0.89

As I approached my car, a second man got out of their car and started walking towards me, yelling ""Hey! I need to talk to you!""

552,Not the A-hole,"A little background:  I own a business earning $150k+ a year that I built from the ground up. I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. 


The other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. 

So AITA?

Edit:  To those saying I should leave her and that she is a gold digger, that couldn't be farther from the truth. She is amazing. She always pays her way for everything. Bills, rent, dinners, she always wants it 50/50. I dont think I painted her in the best light. I wouldnt even consider leaving her after this, though I cant say the same for her. Marriage is an issue for me, and always has been. I dont have faith in myself more than anything. If I were ever to get married, it would probably be to her. My reservations are from my issues and past experiences. She's never given me a reason to not trust her, but I've seen how people can change. I have a lot to think about. Thank you all for everything. ",341,672,0.96

Anyway, we weren’t doing anything big for Valentine’s Day. I bought him a box of chocolates and handmade him a paper lantern with scenes from one of his favorite movies.  He bought me a personal size cake made to look like a rose. 

When he opened his chocolates, he offered me some and I ate one piece. When I walked past him an hour later, all of the chocolates were gone. Like 30 chocolates. He has a serious sweet tooth and will literally eat an entire package of sweets in an hour or so if he doesn’t stop himself. Anyway, I ate a little bit of the cake and put the rest away to be eaten later. I like to savor things. 

The next day, I went to make some breakfast and the rest of my cake was gone completely. He even licked the frickin frosting off the container. I wouldn’t have minded if he’d just had a piece but he ate ALL of it. And, this kind of thing happens a lot and he gives me a hard time for “hiding” junk food from him. I don’t hide it, I just try to keep him from eating all of it or I will get none. He thinks I should eat all of my portion right away to make sure I get it. I’m sorry, but a huge package of cookies should last a few days - not be gone in an hour and only eaten by one person. 

It’s unhealthy, rude, and disgusting imo. He shows no remorse for doing it and laughs about it like a little kid. He doesn’t think he’s wrong or that there’s nothing wrong with what he’s doing. 

And, no, he’s not a stoner. He just eats constantly and he’s gained quite a bit in the 3 years we’ve been together. I know this is stupid and trivial but he’s seriously ruining his health. ",101,121,0.94

557,,"Usual situation applies - I don't think I'm being an asshole here, but someone else does so I'm turning to the internet for a verdict. 

I have been friends with Simon for a decade. We went to university together and are part of a group who meet once or twice a year for a weekend somewhere and we often congregate for weddings/life events and whatnot. 

Simon got married last year. His wife is lovely and we get on well. However, since they were engaged, Simon gets his wife involved in everything. She comes to every group event, every weekend away. No one else brings their significant others. 

Recently I was going through a tough time with my family, at work, and had a friend diagnosed with terminal cancer. I called Simon for advice and support (he is a doctor) and halfway through the call his wife chimed in with her own advice. Simon had put me on speakerphone and I had no idea. I barely know her and she stated asking me questions about my friend's diagnosis and treatment. I felt uncomfortable knowing she had been listening to me at one of my lowest ever points. Everytime I've called him since, Simon has put me on speakerphone. 

Recently we've been trying to organise another event. No one has invited their partners, but Simon has already said his wife is coming. I'd really like for us to have one event this year without partners, but I know this would upset Simon. I also want to ask him not to put me on speakerphone when discussing personal stuff. 

My friend thinks I am a dick for suggesting this, that she's his wife and he has every right to include her the way he wants to do in his life. She also thinks that because I am a woman that it is unrealistic of me to expect my friendship  with Simon to stay the same now he is married and that I should be welcoming his wife into phonecalls and all events with open arms. 

So WIBTA for suggesting one meetup per year without partners and to not put me on speakerphone, knowing it would probably upset him?

me: ok i want you to abort one of the twins as i am concerned about our fiscal wellbeing of having twins, how long you are going to be pregnant, the safety of the twins once born, our time spent into taking care of both twins, lots of potential fighting between twins, unwanted attention from strangers, double time spent if both twins get sick, never alone time with one child. it would seem logical to abort 1 of the twins. it is either that or we need to prepare for the outcome of twins.

her: agrees with financial point says we can talk about that, but rest of my reasons are stupid. says i am an idiot. (???)

&#x200B;

me: i explain points again. if 1 twin sick, the other will 100% as they spend all their time together. first time parents, having 2 right away increases chances 1 gets hurt, twin proofing the house, and i go on with more back up arguments. it is all genuine concerns. we have a bit more back and forth, she is trying to shove my concerns, but all i want is a civil discussion, not to be verbally shoved and called stupid.

we had a very long discussion before pregnancy, but now that she is pregnant with unexpected twins i am not allowed to put anything in the tip jar? i reckon shell be back when she is hopefully is willin to talk. i am fretting over options going. we have lived our hole lifes in Alabama so we dont have any residence outside of here so if we need to leave the state for an abortion past 21 weeks, may not be allowed... i am fine with no abortion (honestly i prefer it, dont want her going through struggle of abortion) but this discussion must happen. i am all about open dialogue and sharing smart ideas. even if she has her mind set on having twins. am i the ahole in the context that i should not speak about abortion to a women who is pregnant? i want to chat while we still have our options on the stump...not fair for her to call me stupid for fretting over surprise twins.

561,Not the A-hole,"So I work shift work- 12 hr days and nights from 6-6.  As is the nature of most shift work there are different daily/weekly/monthly tasks for each shift. These tasks are not employee specific, whoever is working that shift that day is responsible for completing the task and signing off on it. There is a general understanding however if a casual employee is working a shift where a particularly “difficult” or specialized task is due then they usually leave it for the regular staff, which is fine. I’m talking about regular staff who have been here for years in this post.

I’m pretty type A about my job and I have fairly high seniority. I do both days and nights but mostly nights which means a lot of the paperwork type tasks and scheduling falls on me, because day shift doesn’t have time for a lot of that sort of thing. That’s fine. But the other employees who work nights flat out refuse to do any of the “difficult” tasks (I’m not exaggerating on this, a lot of them think they can just come in and nap on nights) and it has somehow become “my” job to handle all of them. Tbh I liked this at first because I like things done my way and I feel the way the other employees do certain things is pretty abysmal, despite me showing them the correct way over and over. However the tasks have increased over the years and I can’t keep up anymore. I have brought this to my managers attention and all she ever says is “I’ll talk to them” and nothing ever changes. I tried telling the other night staff that I can’t keep up and they need to start pulling their weight- I even offered to show them how to do some of the specialized tasks AGAIN but nothing changed. There had been some turnover and I’ve trained the new night workers who seem agreeable but the work is still somehow all left to me. There’s a running joke that certain tasks are just “____’s job so don’t worry about it.”

I take a month of vacation every year. The past few years I’ve tried to get as much work done ahead of time before I go because I know if I don’t there’s going to be a shit show when I get back. As I said the work has increased and I’ve been incredibly burnt out. Even if I wanted to I could not get more than a weeks worth of work done ahead of time before I left for holidays this year (work that is supposed to be everyone’s job, not just mine).  I knew this was going to be a problem but I figured it would be a good time for the other employees to figure out how to do some of this stuff (stuff I have shown them how to do before but might prove a bit challenging if you are out of practice for NEVER DOING IT).

Well it’s been just over a week and they’ve already bombarded me with calls and texts because they can’t seem to figure anything out. I told them not to bug me on my holidays and blocked the number, not before my coworker called me an asshole for not taking the time to walk her through something that she should have been doing all along (not to mention we have a manual on this particular task and a support person you can call 24/7 if you have questions). So am AITA here?

Also: I feel it’s worth mentioning that I don’t have a pay raise for change of title for doing any of this extra stuff, I just have pride in my work and don’t like seeing our workplace in disarray.

""How cool will that be? Help around the house, rent spit in 3rds, and a cool friend to hang out with,"" We thought at first. But after a while, things didn't really go that way. 
He got a job at a big name chain retailer when he first moved in. He worked almost every single day for maybe, three months? Until one day he said he got fired for reporting racism in the work place. Now, Daniel likes to lie, so we don't know whether to believe that or not. 
So shortly after, he said he was joining the army. Months later, he never did. 
Then he said he was joining Americorps. He submitted an application and got an interview! Daniel put down my bf's dad as a reference. My bf's dad called me and my bf one day and said, ""Hey did you know Daniel doesn't have a driver's license?"" Because Americorps called him and was asking about Daniel. We had no idea. 
We asked him about it, to which he responded, ""don't know. Just never got one."" Keep in mind that he doesn't have a car. He drives me and my bf's cars, and at the time we didn't know he didn't have a driver's license. 
He never got the job at Americorps. 
Months pass and he doesn't apply for any jobs. Every morning I wake up and go into the shared space of the living room, and he's playing my ps3 that was my Christmas gift many years ago. And then I work full time, over fourty hours a week, to come home to see him playing my ps3 more. Every single day that's all he does. He has his own xbox one in his room, but he never plays it. 
Me and my boyfriend are getting sick and tired of him doing nothing but playing video games, when my bf and I are working our asses off full time. I feel like it's unfair, and that he's using our house as a frat vacation home. 
My boyfriend is getting really annoyed, but he's afraid to tell him. He doesn't know how to tell someone his own age to, ""man up and get a job,"" and we know that if we even try to start a conversation he'll go lock himself in his room and have a douchey attitude, because that's what Daniel has always done. On top of that, my bf is just like me: he hates confrontations and is scared to bring stuff up. But he's told be before how much he hates waking up to see Daniel play video games, and then to work, come home, and watch Daniel play more video games. 
Daniel is home literally all the time, but never cleaned up his messes at all. We had to initiate a chore chart to get him to clean. All he does is play my console. 
The other day I got the idea to take my ps3 and move it into my room, but it took me a few days to actually do it because I knew how petty it was. But after a few more days of thinking it over and getting more and more frustrated with Daniel, I decided enough was enough. I unplugged my system and took it into my room.
Daniel has bought games for the ps3, as well as two controllers. I left those out for him, as they're his property. But the system is not. 
I told my boyfriend that I'll let his friend play my system--IF he gets a job. But we haven't told Daniel. Me and my boyfriend need to learn to talk about things, I know. 
I did it because I was hoping that having some time with nothing to do would make him realize he needs to get a job. I will admit I also did it to be petty, because it's my system, and he doesn't deserve it if he doesn't even have a job or a driver's license as a 21 year old. 
So: AITA in this situation? 
And as a side note, I'm new on reddit and also on mobile, so I apologize for any weird formatting or misused terms. 
EDIT (update): thank you all for your comments and judgment. Daniel has been applying for jobs, and is getting his lisence soon. I moved the console back into the living room, because he is now making an effort. ",19,29,0.94
565,Everyone Sucks,"So last night I had met a woman on tinder at my university and we chatted up for a little while. To be clear, I had no intention nor any expectation of having said intercourse. I (18M) had went to her (22F) apartment simply to hang out and drink, as it was only a ten minute walk away. Things started heating up and moving along and she had asked me if I had a condom, which I had not because I didn’t expect anything along the lines of actual sex. 

Push came to shove and I ended up walking back to my room, then back to her room which took about a half an hour. When I had gotten there her friends had left an entire box of condoms on her nightstand. This didn’t bother me entirely too much because well it’s always good to have extra, but it would’ve been a nice sentiment to tell me the option was there. Thus, I was already slightly irritated to begin with.

So we restarted things again, but this time I wasn’t as, for a lack of a better term, excitable. She saw I was completely mortified, which I was because I’m much younger and presumably less experienced. She reassured it was okay and we could try other things to jumpstart the process, which we did.

Even that didn’t work and I was stuck feeling rather embarrassed. Also what she did and how she acted started to make me feel slightly uncomfortable. We tried starting and seeing if it’d just work itself out (the “problem”) but that just causing more problems.

Eventually she had told me that I had just taken her virginity, which shocked me even more and set things back even further. About five minutes later and with lots of struggle I had told her I just wanted leave, to which I was treated like an ass and berated as I was leaving. Essentially I’m just curious as to if that’s a bad thing to do, considering I had just taken this girls virginity.  ",65,79,0.9
566,Everyone Sucks,"My girlfirend and I have been together for three years now. We have been talking abut getting married and having kids for a bit now. She wants to start having kids, I want to wait until we get married. I have been planning on proposing to her, and was going to do it within the next few weeks.

Yesterday she came to me with a positive pregnancy test and told me that she was pregnant. I was happy, I wanted to wait, but it wasn't the end of the world that it came a bit earlier than I had planned.

When she left for the night, I went out and bought my own pregnancy test. This is not because I don't trust my girlfriend. I do trust her, and I have no reason to believe that she would be faking a pregnancy. However, with big life changing events I always want to be sure that all the information is correct. 

When she came over today I asked her to take this second pregnancy test just to be sure. She adamantly refused saying that it shows that I dont trust her. She was extremely upset and started saying stuff like, ''If you can't even trust me when I say I'm pregnant how could we raise a child together?''

This is nto about trust at all to me, this is about being sure. I would also get a DNA test or wHatever it is to make sure I'm the father. This isn't because of trust, it's because I've heard of horror stories and I don't want to end up like that.

She never did take the pregnancy test, and if she doesn't that could seriously be a dealbreaker to to me. AITA?",390,535,0.94

568,Everyone Sucks,"So when this first happened I was 100% sure I was in the right but in hindsight I may be at least partially responsible. 

So I was riding my bus home on Valentines. A few stops down this guy gets on the bus. The bus driver had shut the back bus doors by the time he had arrived, but left the front doors open. This guy pounded on the back for several seconds before going up front. I, as well as a few others, chuckled at how pissed off this guy was. I wasnt laughing in his face but I can see how I riled him. 

He took this very seriously, getting aggressive with me and implying I laughed because of my race.

I did apologize, and said I thought it was funny but didnt mean anything against him. At this point a girl in the back spoke up as well in my defense. 

I wanted to drop the subject, but as I turned around he muttered that I was a ""coward who wouldnt do anything"". 

Now, I have a tendency to over-defend myself so I started talking back. 

I should have dropped it. But I didnt. I started telling him that I didnt mean anything by it but sure as hell wasnt a coward.

Now, I am not a fighter. I talk a lot of crap so maybe I SHOULD be, but I'm not. I can take a few hits, but I'm not one to go throwing punches. But I try to avoid fights if possible. 

Now this conversation happened for several minutes. He didnt talk much but every time I tried to back down he would make a snide remark towards myself or the girl. He began to target her more, and I came to her defense because I didnt like where this was going. 

Eventually we get to my bus stop. He threatens that I'm ""too much of a pussy"" to stay and not get off. 

Now heres where I may be wrong. 

I would like to say I stayed because I was worried things might escalate. But that's a lie. I stayed because I wanted to prove him wrong.

I pulled out my phone and started recording. This did not help to calm him down but I thought it was for the best to have recorded evidence. He got even quieter on video. I will admit the video probably doesnt put me in the best light. There was a point I probably should have dropped it but didnt. It wasnt out of malice; I really wanted to settle things.

His stop comes up. Finally, he begins to react again. He gets out of his seat and into my face, threatening me and calling me a bitch. I tell him I'm not gonna fight him. He smacks me. My phone, which was in my hand, was sent to the floor. 

The girl jumps up to my defense, kicking him off me. Another passenger firmly pushes him out the door. 

It's at this point I notice my phone is no longer on the bus. I chase after him believing he stole it. 

Eventually I lose him in an alley. The girl from the bus comes shortly after. She found my phone at the bus stop. I dont know if he tried to steal it or simply threw it out of anger. The case is cracked and theres some minor damage but it still works fine. 

One thing I can say is that I never threatened this guy or tried to incite violence.

572,Not the A-hole," 

We're both 26 and been dating for 5 months, she wanted me to officially meet her parents as I only met them once before when we ran into them at a mall. So last night we we went over to dinner at her parents place and before we went over my GF reminded me that her dad can be mildly racist and not to take it too heart or seriously. I'm brown and have a Islamic first name even though I don't practice and my GF and her family are Italian. 

Next he starts going on about how amazing Italy is and how italians have shaped western culture and have amazing cultural exports like cars, food, fashion etc. I again nod my head and continuing watching TV, my GF was helping her mom in the kitchen at this point and didn't hear this. He asks me what my country has produced for the world or if people like going there, I shrug my shoulders and say nothing and he laughs and is like hahah damn right.

When the food is ready we sit down at the table and my gf's mom asks if I want some wine or a beer I opt for a beer and her dad stops me and is like woah slow down there I thought you're not allowed to drink? I just say I'm a neo-muslim and we are allowed to drink and smile and reach for a bottle of Stella. Then again when when he's telling me what his wife cooked he's like theirs pork in all of these dishes so you can just have the sides with a smile, I tell him I love pork and my GF gets me a piece of lasagna and a piece of porchetta which was amazing btw. By this point the tension in the room could be cut by a knife and I was trying to stay calm and not beat my GF's dad's ass back to Italy. He finally cut the shit for awhile and my gf and I spoke about how we met, then about sports, vacations we're gonna take and normal stuff. Then somehow we start talking about the education system here in Ontario and how he thinks there shouldn't be Islamic schools here, I rebutted saying if there shouldn't be Islamic schools there shouldn't be Catholic schools either nor any faith based schools funded by tax payer dollars. He got super mad at this and said called me ""Muslim Boy"" LMAO, I laughed and said ok and tried diffusing the situation but I was really mad at this point. And was ready to leave, my GF begs me to stay and I did because she drove here and I needed a ride back.

When we were having dessert he stars blabbing about immigrants not assimilating properly here and not knowing english and how all Italians assimilated so well into Canadian culture. I was so annoyed at this point and told him to go back to Italy if he likes it there that much. He started laughing and told me to get out of his house I put my boots on and tell him he's lucky his my GF's dad and wait outside for my uber. My GF is calling me an ass and crying and said I should have just put up with it for 2 hours and not argued with him as now he hates me etc.

 

TL;DR: GF has racist dad, makes racist comments throughout a dinner am I an ass for not taking his shit and arguing back at him?

AITA?

573,Asshole,"FYI - posting for a friend that doesn’t have reddit, so this point on will be in their POV.

Hello Reddit! I (F34) was on a dating website and connected with an awesome guy (M33). We ended up going on a date and it was going pretty well. He was a great conversationalist, and we were able to connect on many topics quite well. Towards the end of the date, I mentioned “Hey do you usually wear straight cut jeans? I think skinny jeans would look better on you.” He replied, “You think so?”. I responded, “yeah!” I didn’t think much of it and it ended pretty well, with a goodnight kiss :)

After the date he texted me goodnight and complimented me. After that he went ghost and I never reached out. After a few months he texted me and I asked him after going ghost why did he reach out? He answered, “You started looking for flaws in me right after the very first date. Thought that happens after a few months.” Since then we’ve been talking regularly, but a few of my friends have been saying I’m sort of an asshole for this situation. I didn’t think much of it and now I’m not too sure. Reddit, what do you think?

UPDATE: (owner of the account) I have passed on the feedback to the friend! She understands the overall consensus that it wasn’t the best thing to say on a first date and it wasn’t the best way to go about it. Thank you everyone for all the different views!",68,164,0.92

576,Asshole,"I had to take my mom to the hospital because she was having trouble breathing and turns out she had the flu. I was visiting her and a nurse came in with a mask on and asked me if anyone had talked to me about putting one on. I told him that I’m fine I have already had the flu this year. He said it’s more for seniors and kids who are more vulnerable to it. I told him that I wasn’t putting a mask on and he can’t legally make me wear one, and he got an angry look on his face and left.

I’ve already had the flu this year so I don’t even see how I could spread it to someone else if I don’t make physical contact with someone who has it. I shouldn’t have to worry about other people catching it, it’s not my concern or my responsibility. If you get the flu, drink plenty of fluids, get rest, and if it gets worse go to the doctor. It is not my problem if you cannot take care of yourself.

I’ll concede I was probably an asshole for how I talked to the nurse, but I don’t like it when people imply or tell me I need to do something that I’m not legally obligated to do.


EDIT: Well, everyone has spoken. I will try to be more open to listening to others when it comes to the flu. I accept my judgement.",111,104,0.64
577,Not the A-hole,"My son (4 years old) has a classmate that we see at the ymca play area after school twice a week.  This classmate is a good kid but a little wild and much larger than my son.  

My son likes to build buildings in this play area with the other kids.  He is not a perfect child (has trouble sharing and has a potty mouth) but is very playful and social with other kids.

This classmate of his knocks the buildings down and tackles, hits and kicks my son without provocation.  He is twice the size of my son.  His dad intervenes and makes him apologize, but after the third time my son said he did not want to play with this kid and that he did not want to be friends with this kid anymore.  This made his classmate cry.

The dad told me that my son should accept his apology and shouldn't be mean to his son by saying they aren't friends.  I also got the feeling he wanted an apology from us.  I told my son he doesn't have to play with anyone he doesn't want to.  It is important to me that my son be kind to everyone even of they aren't to him, but I don't want my son to feel obligated to stay in a situation where someone is touching him in a way he doesn't like.

AITA for not doing these things?  

I am pretty sure that my kid was not wrong to not want to play with this kid after the third incident, but saying he didn't want to be friends any more may be too mean.

Edit:  I appreciate feedback but I would like to state my opinion that the classmate is not a ""bully"".   Kids that age haven't developed to the point where they can have those type of motivations.  They either are too exuberant (case here) or it is used as a problem resolution method.  Nothing this kid has done is outside of normal four year old behavior.

579,Asshole,"So I made a throwaway account because I really don’t want my wife finding this. I am a lesbian (38F) who was raised by extremely homophobic parents. They were Catholics and would often lecture me on the dangers of homosexuality, banned me from seeing my gay friends, etc. When I was a teenager they caught me kissing my girlfriend at the time because I got careless and left my door open, and they immediately kicked her out of the house and would not let me see her any more.

Since then I’ve had to convince them that it was just a phase, otherwise I would be written out of the will and most likely disowned. I have no other family except my sister, but she’s 11 years younger than me and at the time would not have been able to help as she was still basically a child. So, I did something a bit regrettable. I married my best friend from high school. He was straight, which was a bit of a red flag, but at the time I didn’t really question it because we were very close and I would have done pretty much anything for him. The agreement was that our marriage would be completely platonic and for convenience’s sake, and that we could pursue relationships outside of it. 

So 10 years pass, and in that time I get a girlfriend, who I’m still with to this day. She moved in with us, and wasn’t too happy about the situation, but got along well with my husband so she accepted him as a weird kind of roommate. 

Then my husband comes out as transgender. 

It was a huge shock, as she (I’ll be using she from now on) had never really discussed this with me before, or given me any indication that she didn’t identify as a guy. She’d always been quite masculine (not to stereotype) and was into typical male things like football. Again, I don’t mean to be transphobic here at all, I’m just emphasising my point at how much I didn’t see this coming. Anyway, she tells me that she wants to start transitioning, which is a bit of a problem because my parents would not accept that. I suggested that it might be a good idea for us to get divorced now, but for some reason she refused. This was the point when I started to realise that she might have actual romantic feelings for me. She’d never really shown interest in finding anyone else, and often wanted to do things like cuddle with me, even kiss me on the cheek and things like that, but I’d always thought that was because we were such close friends. Anyway, I tried to insist, but she told me that my safety means more to her than transitioning. I think this is ridiculous and I don’t want to let her do that, because dysphoria is no joke. I think she’s hoping that I’ll magically become attracted to her and want to be together for real, but that just isn’t going to happen. I only see her as a friend. I want what’s best for her, which I believe is for us to divorce so she can get on with her life, but I feel bad forcing her into that when she’s done so much for me. 

AITA???

Edit: I probably worded that bit about being disowned badly. It wasn’t just about being written out of the will; I was sixteen at the time and my parents still had a lot of control over me. I was scared they would kick me out, and I had no other family to go to. Also living with them knowing that I was gay was awful, because I do love them and again,  they were my only family. I would have been banned from seeing my little sister, who I loved more than anything. Basically a world without my family seemed very bleak, but I know I still shouldn’t have done what I did.

I also love my wife more than anything, despite not being attracted to her in that way. She’s a better friend than I could ever have asked for. If I hadn’t been stupid enough to miss that she had feelings for me earlier, I would never have agreed to marry her.",148,1659,0.94

I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn’t find them.it wasn’t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser.

588,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR Last night I adopted a dog from a family and this morning they’re asking for it back

I have invested a lot of time and energy into the situation. I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. 

Speaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I’ve begun to correct in our short time together. 

The background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.

The mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can’t process the situation. Of course she can’t she’s too young. Why didn’t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren’t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what’s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. 

I already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don’t want to give the dog back. 

**UPDATE**
Thanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. 

[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)

I told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!

The last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn’t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn’t expect the drama to follow and she said she’ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn’t agree on over text. I guess in the family’s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I’m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!

Will continue updating if more happens but I think so far she’s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.

**UPDATE post meeting the family again**

Met the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. 

Here’s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn’t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. 

I truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don’t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. 

So I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it’s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!

590,Everyone Sucks,"Don't get why I put quotations, I did. 

tldr, I changed my mind about being tied up during intercourse and my girlfriend got upset because I didn't fake interest. 

We agreed beforehand that we were gonna switch things up and we were gonna try new things. One of those things she wanted to try was reversing our positions. Not like wearing a strap on or something. Just switching who has control. I agreed to be tied up. We were getting in the mood and all of that, it was fine. Till she got to actually tying me up. I did not like that at all. I felt claustrophobic, out of control, stiff, my shoulders fucking hurt. I just wasn't feeling being tied up. I hated that more than words can explain. 

We fought so much after she untied me. We never fight, at all. Her main issue was that I didn't ""attempt"" to like it even though ""she does all the time"". I'm putting quotations because that isn't true. I waited for what felt like five minutes. Sex kinda revolves around my dick. There's not much to do without it. If my boy isn't feeling it, he's not feeling it.  She got more upset the more we argued but I really don't get it.

She needs extra money sometimes for books so I pay for them. I also help out on her car note when I can. I do this because I care for her, but lately, the past month, ive been feeling like she treats me badly.

Another aspect to this is I have a form of gigantism. I was 6'3 at 14 and am 7'2 right now in my late 20s. I am close to 340lbs. I had a tumor when i was young thats now gone, and i have signs of acromegaly.

This has had a negative impact on my life. Im not able to have really normal relationships and its hard to connect with people. I cant do many physical activities due to joint pain. I am actually sort of introverted so I was actually verbally bullied somewhat in school. Physically twice when i was attacked by two separate groups of men because of my size. 

Still i am an adult now, and i have moved on to a career i enjoy in welding. But i am somewhat still self conscious about my body/face and my girlfriend knows this.

Well we were drinking a week ago and she told me that ""i was lucky to have her"". I agreed. But she kept going, stating that i was very lucky and she could get any guy she wanted.

I was upset by this and we had an argument where i pressed her about what she meant as she never said this before, and was very supportive. 

She eventually said that she could do much better than me. When i asked her if she meant my looks she said ""what else?"".

When we sobered up i told her to not expect me to pay for her books this month. She said fine, but shes also telling her friends that im being controlling. They told me this. She thinks im using money against her in a fight we had when drunk.

Idk, i just feel weird about everything now. Kinda depressed as well. AITA?",237,689,0.97
592,Not the A-hole,"I recently had a baby (about two months ago for context) she has received her first round of vaccines two weeks ago (not relevant but just a disclaimer)

I explained to everyone I don’t want smokers to hold my child in anyway even if they have washed their hands (because they smoke about a pack a day) the reason is I don’t want my child to smell that nor do I want the smell to transfer to my daughters clothing or I don’t want her to smell second hand smoke, since they smoke near my front door which is near her bouncer, but everyone keeps telling me that I am a bitch because they have washed their hands and they also have a shower every single day (you wouldn’t know unless they have told you, they lack hygiene). So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.

 I also don’t allow anyone who hasn’t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don’t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn’t need to be updated so they don’t go and get it.

595,Asshole,"I know the title sounds awful but please read the full story. Every time I walk to my gym I see this cute little dog looking miserable. The dog (it’s a she) is sometimes with her owner, a homeless guy in his 40s, but most of the time she gets tied to a pole and left there for hours. I wanted to report this to authorities but I was told that because most shelters in our area are kill shelters that could be even worse for the dog. Recently it’s been showing a lot in my city and seeing the poor dog tied to the pole was just too much. A few nights ago my fiancé and I were walking back from a restaurant in the area and saw the dog alone again, we decided to take her home. When I told my mother she was outraged, she says homeless people need their animals to keep them company and that I had no right to take her. I told her a dog isn’t a toy and people shouldn’t get one if they can’t look after it. My mom says I’m cruel and don’t care about human beings. I disagree and maintain that you should not have an animal you can’t take care of. We took the dog to the vet, he said she’s a little over a year, malnourished but not critically. We scheduled her shots and made sure she was okay. The plan is either to keep her or let my aunt’s family adopt her. We have two cats (they’re used to dogs) and we’re leaving our apartment to live in a house with a backyard in a few months. On the other and my 8 year old cousin fell in love with the dog from the moment she saw her. Regardless, we all live in the same city and will be there for the doggy to shower her with love. I just hope my mom gets over it.

*For anyone wondering about the legality of what I did, my vet helped me out to make sure the dog was reported as abandoned and everything was legal. We’ll be able to make the adoption official after a 30 day wait period.*

UPDATE: as suggested by some of you in the comments, yesterday my fiancé and my brother went to talk to the homeless guy to let him know where the dog is and how to claim ownership. However, authorities ruled this as animal abuse, so if the guy does claim ownership he can face charges (the guy knows this as well). Typically the waiting period for us to adopt the dog if the owner doesn't claim her would be 30 days, but because this is a case of abuse we might be able to finalize the adoption earlier. Seems like my aunt will adopt the dog since they're a family of 5 and someone's always home to take care of the dog. I understand the people telling me I should have talked to the guy earlier and I was a coward for not doing it. For people asking about temperatures, my city is in the mountains in northern Europe, snow and sub-freezing temperatures are a regular occurrence here. For people telling me to return the dog because the homeless guy is lonely, animals don't exist for our entertainment and loneliness isn't a valid excuse for animal abuse. Plenty of homeless people care for their animals and don't leave them alone in the cold.",565,5887,0.67

When I was 19, I got involved with a local boy named Zack. We are the same age and went to the same HS. Zack and his sister got involved in drugs and he became a bit of a deadbeat. But I was ""in love"" and pulled a Little Mermaid ""but I love him Daddy!"" when my parents told me he was bad news.   
They were right. One night he accused me of cheating and beat me up pretty bad. I had a black eye, fractured wrist, and bruises for weeks. He went to prison but agreed to rehab in exchange for probation. Since then he has successfully gotten his life back together.   
He recently moved back into town and is married, with a kid of his own. I don't hold a grudge, but I refuse to have anything to do with him. He scared the living crap out of me.   
The problem is that we live in a rural area. His wife comes into the store all the time, but when Zack comes by, I refuse to serve him. Everyone knows what happened because it's a small town and I wasn't quiet about what he did. I told everybody what happened. So did my sisters and brother.   
We are in our thirties now and I still don't want anything to do with him. I don't believe I need to be the bigger person. I don't care that he is sober. I could care less about his life. I am 100% okay with serving his wife, I just won't serve him.  
Because of this, my manager has asked if I want Zack banned. I said I would like that because I still get this feeling in my gut that's a mix between fear and anger. I have been to therapy, but the moment still haunts me. I think I might have PTSD, but have not been diagnoses. But it feels like I am back in that moment when I see his face.   
His wife came to talk to me the other day. She says Zack has expressed multiple times that he is sorry for what happened. I told her I didn't care, he could have killed me, she is free to shop here but he is not. And my manager agrees. He is not welcome.

598,Not the A-hole,"Six years ago, my mother bought me a laptop for college. It wasn't a beast or anything but it could play simple games like csgo and dota. Those were basically the two main games I played with my friends. Well a year after getting it, my roommate at the time was drunk and tripped, knocked it off my desk and landed on it. Breaking the screen clean off the laptop and it would not turn on or connect to external displays.

Now, I still go to college full time and work part time at night and living pay check to pay check for my own needs. I have been using this terrible computer for 5 years now because I have no savings or emergency funds at all. Working in restaurants, I would steal food from work to eat. I make about 800 a month and rent alone is 450. With cell phone, car insurance, utilities, gas for my 30 min drive to work, etc, it gets pretty tight. So, I gave up on my laptop and asked a buddy of mine at walmart to grab me a marked down display model from the back. He came out with a 80 dollar gateway laptop that was made god knows when and I opened a walmart credit card to get it. This laptop cannot handle the software I use for my classes (it cant run basically any software other than word or google chrome. I bought shovel knight with a steam gift card I got for Christmas and the fps is so bad that I cant tell if my inputs actually do anything) and I frequently have to use other people's computers or drive to the library and pay for parking to take tests and complete assignments.

Every year my mom takes my tax refund to pay her back for the 20 dollars here, 20 there that she sends me to help pay a bill or get gas towards the end of the month.

Fast forward to now. My sweet mother decided to actually give me my refund this year which is 800 dollars. I thought this would be my only chance to get a new laptop since I never have any sort of savings whatsoever and I desperately need a new computer.

Enter my girlfriend. She makes 40k a year and blows her money left and right. Drops 60-80 dollars every other day eating out, 200 bucks on the weekend at bars, new phone every couple months, a lot of unnecessary purchases so she also, some how, lives pay check to pay check as well. Growing up with not much money, I try to help her budget her money to build some savings but she claims its her money and she can do what she wants with it. Fair enough.

We are looking at this apartment and they want a lot of money up front and she wants me to give her the 800 dollars to help offset the cost. She admitted that she can easily cover it with her next pay check but said that ""its not fair"" because she wants to get some tattoos with her next pay. I told her I can help split the monthly bills once we move in but I desperately need a new computer and I dont know when I will have the chance to get another one.

Since then, she decided to end our relationship and I received said bag one month after the end of her relationship. I told her it had arrived, and that she could come pick it up whenever she wants. She said that because we live an hour in car from each other, we should meet halfway because she doesn't want to travel 2 hours for a bag.

I refused, and said that it would be waiting at my place. She started throwing a massive tamper tantrum and insulting me, so I said that it would instead be waiting in the recycling bin outside in front of my porch, because I didn't want to talk to her in person anymore. Since then, I think a homeless person (my area has a lot of homeless folks) came by and took it, because it's not in my recycling bin anymore. 

I told her. Apparently her mom wants my head on a stick now (that's literally the words she used: ""I want his head on a stick.""). She also blocked me on social media and on her phone.

600,Not the A-hole,"Long story short. I come home and my live-in gf is gone. But her phone is on the bed, so I assume she went on a run. Nothing out of the ordinary. I have *never* done this before but something struck me to unlock her phone with her passcode (we use each other's phones all the time). I admit I crossed a line with mutual trust in each other by checking her text messages and I found more than 1 text thread with other men. These messages were sexual in nature, including dick pics being sent to her, and her actively engaging and suggesting that they will eventually make a ""snuggle date"".

When she gets back I ask her to explain. This turns quickly into ""but how dare you go through my phone"" kind of argument rather than a ""you're sexting other men behind my back"" argument.

AITA for checking her phone in the first place?

From the moment I started here Katie glommed onto me. I’ve tried to be nice but Katie is racist/homophobic. I have heard her use the n-word and call people fxg and dxke among others. Each time I hear it I correct her nicely but she always does it again. One of the guys at our lunch table is gay, too.

She lies all the time and talks about really inappropriate stuff; we’ll be talking about music or something and she’ll say her uncle went to jail for molesting her cousin (yes that happened and it was as awkward as it sounds).

A few days ago at lunch one of our other friends was showing everyone the photo book her boyfriend made her, and while no one was looking, Katie drew mustaches/glasses/crazy hair on their faces in a couple photos and thought it was hilarious. If that isn’t bad enough she refused to apologize and our other friend was so upset.

After the picture incident I told her we needed to take a break while she figured out how to be a good friend. She laughed and said I sounded like an episode of Daniel Tiger (idk what that even means) and walked away, and then yesterday she tried to sit at our table at lunch. Everyone stopped talking and looked at me, so I said ‘can we help you, Katie?’ and she said ‘no, why?’ to which I replied ‘I told you that we need to take a break, so you need to find someplace else to sit at lunch’.

She went and TOLD THE VICE PRINCIPAL that we were excluding her because she’s in hospitality. VP then told me I needed to be nice to Katie because she doesn’t have many friends. I told VP everything I just wrote and she said ‘I know she’s socially awkward but you still have to be nice to her’.

Today she was sitting at a different table where no one was talking to her, and one of the guys at my table asked if we were maybe being a little harsh since none of us really talk to her outside school either. But then everyone mostly agreed it was nice to have a normal lunch for a change.

604,Not the A-hole,"I have ALWAYS been of the school that people do NOT ask to borrow someone else's car. It isn't a cup of sugar or two eggs, it is our most important asset. Our neighbor got into a situation where his girlfriend had a nice car and he 'took' over payments, a tow company came to repossess it on the same day he sold his junky, dented up car to a coworker. We felt bad, of course, then he broke up with his girlfriend and now has been hitting us up for our car. We have a 2015 Jeep and a paid for T&C minivan with no issues. He had begged us to borrow our nice Jeep to go on a date right up the street. After getting all of the information I said yes, because it was right up the road. He didn't come back until the next day and, turns out, had driven f\*&\^ing 80 miles each way to go on a Ferris Bueller road trip to go take his date to a casino. He totally lied. My husband was oddly nonchalant about this. I was SO MAD and felt betrayed. This is our baby! I spent so much money to get it, love it, and pay the monthly payments. It is in BOTH of our names. I talked to my husband and told him that this was a deal breaker, we are not doing this anymore. I also told the neighbor earlier that that was a one time thing to try to head off being hit up for borrowing our car like a dependent. Tonight he called, my husband answered, said ""yes"", I saw who it was on the caller ID and was shaking my head no. HE said the neighbor was just going a couple of miles to Walmart. he gave him the keys, which consist of both keys. I decided to have this battle another day but then thought...wait...no way he would take our 'new' car I pay so much for and already said no, right? I go look and he totally did! He took the keys to the van and decided to take our expensive Jeep. MY husband seemed so upset that I flew off the handle, couldn't understand this was a huge betrayal of trust and really NONE of this is okay with me AT ALL!!!! He is seeing someone. This is not our child. I don't trust him because he was dishonest with the first time we allowed him to take the car up the street and back.

I am so mad at my husband I cannot see straight. Let me add that they are co-workers. I DON' T CARE. You don't borrow cars. That is not okay.

If someone is injured or killed in a wreck? We struggle as a family and live paycheck to paycheck. This isn't anything to be okay with, IMO. Am I the Asshole? We are currently not speaking.

&#x200B;

 I think the problem lies with my husband, who got the job based on him (a referral, although my husband is skilled and quickly proved himself, feels like he owes him and this is technically a foreman who is above him so to go nuclear will make his job a living hell. He also doesn't want a next door neighbor to have a hostile situation with us.

Thank you all so much. No-one should lend their vehicles to others, period! I thought most people would consider this a complete no go, and my husband felt indebted in some way to be nice when pressed with a ridiculous request like this.

And, to those who made comments about being irresponsible for the monthly payment on a car when living paycheck to paycheck, at the time we bought the Jeep Patriot we had two jobs and double the income. We were trying to get a newer, reliable car for a daily 70 mile commute for work. Life happens.

606,Asshole,"...or is my cat the asshole?


His name is PJ (Patrick Jr., after my husband) but mainly we call him Pidgey. He’s always been a real 10 of a guy; a real cat to brag about. He greets me at the door when I get home from work every day, he is always down for a cuddle and he doesn’t seem to know that his claws and teeth could be used for violence against humans. Seriously, you could pick him up and toss him around and he’d just meow at you. Not that I would ever do that. He’s my precious Pidgey.


But, in other news, fuck Pidgey. Because as much as I really do love him, he sucks. I understand that cats can develop territories, and lately Pidgey has adopted the upstairs bathroom and hallway. However, this seems to apply only between the hours of 5- 7AM.


Every weekday morning it’s the same: my alarm goes off and I sneak out of my lovely warm bed. Already, Pidgey is on the other side of the door meowing like it’s his job to wake me up or I’ll sleep forever. And no, before you even suggest it, he’s not hungry. The first thing I do is go downstairs and feed him; he ignores the food completely and runs right back upstairs to bother me in the bathroom.


You know those tear-jerking videos of dogs greeting their owners after long absences? It’s like that, every morning, only it’s 5:30 AM and I’m fucking tired and trying to get ready. I cannot deal with him every single morning. He puts out his paw in this cute little pantomime of “pet me pet me!” and I just do not have it in me. Don’t get me wrong, I pet the shit out of the little bastard, but it’s never enough. I get in the shower, he sticks his head through the curtain and meows at me. I get out, soaking wet, and he covers my wet legs in cat hair before I can dry off. I brush my teeth and he jumps up on the sink and bumps my hand. Cat hair everywhere, and no amount of petting settles him down.


The rest of the day, he’s a normal chill cat. He’s upstairs right now, being chill. If I go up there, he’ll come over and say hi, but where’s all the intensity? Right now I’m sitting downstairs on the couch with a perfectly good open lap and two hands that could be used for petting (if I weren’t currently shit-talking him online), but no. It has to be the only time of day when I’m on a time constraint and otherwise unable to give him the attention he demands.


I could shut the bathroom door, of course. But such a good boy deserves my love, doesn’t he? He’s a good boy. Every time I growl “enough!” and rudely toss him off the bathroom sink, I feel like an asshole. He seems to have gotten it into his head that this is the only time of day he can receive love, and he goes after it with the intensity of a drowning man. It seems so sad to deny him. Should I just accept the fact that this is his love language and set my alarm earlier to make time for Pidgey? Or is he a fucking asshole who needs to fucking chill?

Edit: said kitchen, meant bathroom

Edit 2: as this post has gotten more replies I realize some vital information is missing. So, for clarity’s sake and to maintain the integrity of voting:

A) Pidgey is a Tonkinese boy, which is very similar to a Siamese, which explains the temperament.

B) Pidgey has a sister, Molly. She’s no star in the personality department like he is, but she keeps him company when we’re not around.

C) We recently had a baby who takes up a lot of our attention. This is most likely the root cause of his actions. He is still very much loved. This is not a case of “if you don’t have time for a pet, you shouldn’t have a pet!” He’s just used to being King Boi around these parts.",96,319,0.89

Every morning, around 7, I wake up to her standing in my doorway either just standing there with the light turned on staring at me, or yelling about how lazy I am for not living on my own yet, or telling me to do something like unload the dishwasher or whatever (which could definitely just be done in an hour or so after I'm feeling a bit more rested), or to just complain that I'm lazy and should have a different job because my scattered work hours annoy her because she doesn't like hearing the door open when I get home around midnight if I'm doing a closing shift. 

When I try to tell her that i don't appreciate that or how she never just knocks on my door and speaks to me calmly, she turns into a T-Rex and makes a bunch of loud noises that I guess are supposed to mean ""this is y house, I can do what I want, if you don't like it, get out.""

612,Not the A-hole,"This is actually my first post, I really wanted to share this story because it has been on my mind for a week. I'm on mobile so I am sorry for the format.
To get to my school I have to take the subway, and transfer one or two time to get to my school. 
So the first train trip I was running late, and instead of going to the last station, I went to the station before it to get to school close to onetime,  even though it meant not getting a seat for my ride.
When I had to transfer trains, my legs were hurting from standing. (Also to the fact that I am on a sports team and my legs were killing me from doing a few laps). 
This is the time I should explain the layout of the train. It had 3 chairs a gap and 2 chairs perpendicular to it I sat on a chair at the end of the 3 chairs, and a guy sat on the other end so there was a seat in between me and him. (This is important to note).
Stops go and pass until it was 2 to 3 stops until I  reach my stop. The train is pretty crowded now, but the middle seat is still open. Then comes this lady.
I'm not trying to sound rude, but the only way to describe her was very obese. She proceeds to walk near to the middle seat. Note that the middle seat is for an average - lil thick person. But she puts down her bag. I though she was going to put her bag down to hold onto the pole. I was wrong.  She begins to try to sit down in the little seat. She actually though she could fit in.
She sits on half of my leg. I kid you not half of my leg was enveloped by her leg. I was literally sliding out of my chair in the process. So I quickly stand up.
Lady: you dont have to stand up sweety theres enough room to sit. 
Me: I'm sorry but you are taking up a part off my seat and I was getting pushed, it's fine if I stand for a bit
She didnt say anything to me after that, but muttered very loudly about me being rude and that I have plenty of room to sit.
Only one of two people stared a little at me, but it didnt matter as I got off in two stops. This made me think if I'm the asshole.

Edit: If you want to know the layout of the trains, look up nyc orange and red subway cars.

615,not the a-hole,"So last week I [M21] was hanging out with a friend [F23] (which I knew for 2 months) and her sister [F24] (first time hanging out - our dedicated driver) who I still live a bit far from (12Km) but since they had to pick up a friend of ours near my area I was offered a ride home.

We stopped half way to call him and know where he was at but because he wasn't answering we waited around for about 5 minutes until I said that I could walk home the rest of the way (which wasn't a big deal even though it was getting dark - I walk that route home often to save money and get some exercise on). They asked me how far off we were from my house and I showed them on the GPS it was a 3,5Km/7 minute drive from where we were but because I was used to that route and it being uphill I knew it would take me +/- 1 hour. Again, **not** a big deal but they weren't taking it... apparently they both took my comfort in that walk in a bad way and my friend complained that I shouldn't be such a ""*cunt*"" and accept the ride (I guess she wasn't happy our friend wasn't picking up either).

Ten more minutes passed and our friend calls back and says that he isn't going to need that ride after all so they both turn to me and tell me to show them the way and so I do - it was clear they were upset. Her sister's car was old and was struggling to go uphill despite driving on newly paved roads, but that didn't stop my friend from commenting 3 times on how long it was taking us to get there (even though she had been to my house multiple times through that very same route).

After the final incline I said they could leave me right there so they wouldn't have to deal with my dead end road and I hop off the car. I thank for the ride and show them how to get back through the exact way we came through and said they could call me if they needed help getting back - no help was needed.

Two days had passed and we meet up again to hang out and while they were driving to mid town I get a call from my friend saying that I owned her sister half a tank of gas because of the drive from last time and I took it as a joke. After they arrive and we're hanging out 30 minutes in they stop for a smoke and pull out the receipt from the gas station and hand it to me showing a 12,5L/20€ bill - they look serious and I was obviously taking it as a joke and ask them what was up. They wanted an apology and for me to make up for the fuel they spent saying that they filled it up exactly up to where it was before they started the car when we were waiting on our friend's call (which sounds like absolute bullshit).

I told them ""I'm sorry **but** I offered multiple times to walk home and you knew it was uphill"" so they criticized me for using a *but* and using excuses instead of just apologizing and making up for it (for example paying for dinner).

This continued for around 10 minutes until a friend of mine showed up and they seized the discussion. One hour later her sister left before we had dinner.

**TL;DR:** Friend's sister drove uphill on her 90's car to get me home when I offered to walk and days later showed up with a ridiculous fuel receipt that she wanted me to pay for. I refused to pay her telling her that she didn't have to drive me there.",56,43,0.87
616,asshole,"At my job as a waiter, I always like to do things that are in the companys best interests, but my boss likes to do things that are in the customers best interests. Let me give you some examples:


Today, there was a table that approached us looking for 5 adults and 2 baby chairs, and what I would usually have them do is wait outside until a suitable table is available. However, my boss ask the customers if they would like to take a seat first at one of the empty tables until the suitable table was available. the rest of the restaurant was 90 percent full at this point. So I approached him and said it would hurt our sales because we had one less table to serve, but he said it's ok just let them sit they have kids etc


This example happens everyday, when customers forget to specify modifications to the food and want a change after being served. My boss always asks the chef to prepare another dish with the correct specifications. As for me, I would stand my ground and insist that they accept it and that they should have told me before if they wanted any modifications.


I would like to point out that what I am doing does not break any company policies. When I make a decision like that, my boss will usually try to stop me by asking nicely, but if I insist on going through with it, he will let me do so as he respects my seniority. I do not think my boss is the asshole, but am I?

617,not the a-hole,"I was invited over to my cousin's house to play Cards Against Humanity.  We have played a couple times before, sounds fun.  I bring some weed, bring some dabs, brought my Magic The Gathering deck just in case things got wild.  You know how it be.

My cousin lives with her baby daddy, and they just got a new roommate who's BD's close friend.  The new roommate invited some chick over for the night that I'd never met.  So, there were 5 of us playing, it should be fun.

It was fun.  We all took dabs, passed around a couple joints.  The roommate was drinking some liquor, and I guess the chick was on a fentanyl patch.  Everyone was having a good time.  The roommate and the chick were having a really good time.

They started getting more and more handsy with eachother as the game progressed (I was winning).  It got to the point where I was waiting several minutes between hands for them to finish, I don't know what to call it.  Aggressively flirting?  They were practically shoving eachother out of their chairs.  You would've thought we were in high school.  We're having fun, right?

Anyway, I become Card Czar and I'm waiting for tweedle-dee and tweedle-dumb to finish their fuck-fuck games so I can read the damn card.  In the midst of this grab-assery the chick grabs roommates head.

Roommate has a couple piercings and those ear gauge things.  The ones that you can see through a big ass hole in their earlobe.  His was that size of a quarter.  Anyway, the chick grabs dude's gauge out of his ear.

He starts trying to get it back and they're both basically wrestling for control of the One Ring.  She gets away for a second and does the most logical thing in situation.  She put the gauge up her ass.  People have asked me if she put it up there or like up up there.  I don't know, I don't fucking want to know, and frankly I don't think it should matter for how gross this was.

So, dude does the only rational thing and goes in.  He managed to get up in there and retrieve what's his.  He took it right out of her bootyhole and put it right back in his ear hole.  Then they both grabbed their cards, sifting through each individual card.  Touching every.last.card.  Then they both played a card looking at me like I was actually gonna touch them.

I must've stared at them blinking for a minute looking dumb as hell.  I finally said, ""I'm good, y'all need to wash your hands and grab some new cards.""

He was like, ""Are you serious?""

I'm just so taken aback by this kind of behavior, all I can say is, ""Y-yes I-don't. How?""  I just can't- I don't understand.  Am I the fucked up one here?  Everyone's looking at me like I'm the dickhead here.

Dude just throws his cards down and gets up and walks out of the room.  He just keeps repeating that he's done, he's so done.  He's done playing the game.  I'm just trying to finish my cigarette at this point since everything seems to have went to shit.

The chick just keeps talking shit.  Talking about how it's not a big deal, she thinks I'm overreacting.  My cousin and her BD are just looking at me like I got a dick growing out of my forehead, and this chick is just turning the condescension up to an 11.  She's going on and on about how it doesn't matter cause she's a girl and she's all clean (even though she was just talking about having opioid shits and dope farts 20 minutes ago).

""I just got my asshole bleached this morning.""

Can somebody help me please?  Has the whole world abandoned reason?  This is madness.  I take a mood stabilizer, but please tell me im not going insane.

I tried to explain that I understand where she's coming from, but that I didn't think this kind of behavior was appropriate for adults around other people.  I just wasn't getting through to her at all.  I kinda just gave up on talking as she kept going on her tirade.  I was just trying to smoke as fast as I could and maintain my composure.  I was shaking a little bit.

She just kept going on and on sarcastically saying she was gonna clean all the cards off.  She was gonna start looking for disinfectant and wipe down all the cards.  I'll clean the whole deck if it's such a big deal!

I finally finished my cigarette, gathered my things and excused myself, confused.  I think I've been confused ever since.  I feel like I just live in a perpetual state of awe and bewilderment now.  Nothing makes sense any more.  This happened months ago and I still wake up in the middle of the night flabbergasted.  I ain't never seen some shit like that in my life.

It's a shame, I was hoping to get down on some Magic cards with the roommate before all this went down.  I don't want Butthole Surfer anywhere near my cards now.  I left so fast I forgot my dabs.  Fuck it, they can keep it.  I thought this whole night was egregious.  I guess it's alright though, because she bleached her asshole.  I guess I'm the asshole.",24,43,0.82
618,justified asshole,"I have a friend that is a nurse. While we were out to dinner with a group of friends, my nurse friend brought up the topic of dieting, and how now she really needs to watch what she eats. Then she mentioned that if she were to eat a box of cereal she would be 5 pounds heavier the next day. I made some sort of throw away comment after that, it wasn't even funny; 

I said something along the lines of, ""well, you'd need to eat at least a 5lb box of cereal... And that's a lot of cereal."" 

This is where stuff got weird. 

She said, ""no, if I ate a regular box, I would gain probably like 5 lbs."" 

""Haha, well you'd gain the weight of the cereal plus whatever else you ate that day, minus whatever your body burns off."" I replied.

""No"" she said, ""I seriously wouldn't even have to eat anything else for that whole day, and the next day, I'd be about 5 lbs heavier.""

""Gail, you can't gain more weight than what you've consumed, that doesn't make sense..."" I said.

She asked me if I even knew about the glycemic index. I knew she was getting a little mad at me, some other people at the table were shifting uncomfortably. 

Someone we were with said, ""hey dude, are you in the medical field? Because she is. She probably knows what she's talking about."" 

I think before that guy (I don't really know him) made that comment, I was ready to drop it, but for some reason his remark pushed me into asshole mode.

""Hey dude"" I replied shittily, ""I don't need to be a doctor to know that that's not how food works. And no Gail, I don't know anything about the Glycemic Index. Look, what you're describing is magical. You're talking about gaining weight, when? While you're sleeping?

Gail: ""If you don't know about the Glycemic Index then why are you arguing with me? I have a nursing degree, you don't."" 

Me: ""This has to be a misunderstanding. Gail, I want to make sure we're on the same page. You're saying that if on Monday you decided that the only thing you were going to consume was a box of cereal, that on Tuesday, you'd wake up weighing more than you did immediately after finishing that box of cereal?""

Gail: ""Yes! That happens-

I interrupt, ""No Gail! That doesn't happen. It doesn't make any sense! Where are you getting the extra mass from? The air? Are you absorbing the air? Is your body somehow creating matter? Gail, you're talking about breaking the laws of physics!

Gail: ""Do you have a degree in science?""

Me: ""Jesus Christ... No, I don't have a degree in science, but didn't we all learn this in Middle School? Am I going crazy? Why isn't anyone else saying anything?

I look around the table, one of Gail's other friends chimes in, ""maybe you guys should just agree to disagree.""

Me: No. Guys, seriously, this makes no-

Guy from earlier: ""Dude, I don't know why you're even talking? She's a nurse, you're not going to win this argument. You keep bringing up science, but you don't even have a science degree.""

Me: i don't need a degree in science to know that what she's saying, and what you all seem to be agreeing with is really fucking stupid! 

Gail: Okay, well I'm done with this, if you can't agree to disagree that's too bad because I can.

Me: Jesus... Okay whatever.

We got our checks shortly after that. I think everyone at the table was pretty pissed at me, and I felt like everyone there was really stupid. 

I fake apologized in an attempt to make things less awkward the next time I saw them. Gail said that it was fine.

So, I think most of the people there thought I was being an asshole, I guess I kind of was, but I feel like Gail and that guy (who I'm pretty sure just wants to fuck Gail) were bigger assholes.

 What's the verdict?

Edit: 
Hey, thanks so much for all of the comments, even though most of you called me an asshole, I still appreciate each and every one of you. 

ONE THING I WANT TO CLEAR UP!
A lot of people are commenting about water retention, and how Gail could have eaten 1 box of cereal, then pounded water to be 5 pounds over the next day.-- Gail made it clear that she could wake up heavier in the morning, than she was when she went to sleep the night before without adding any kind of food or drink (including water) to her body.

For some background, she already has a four year old boy and a baby boy born last month. Is it unreasonable for me to be a bit annoyed at this and still consider using the name, especially since she is calling ownership of a name for a baby that will be born in the next 3-5 years, which may or may not be a boy?

623,asshole,"Currently I live in a three person apartment, each on our own lease. In the lease is a clause that says that any evidence of smoking inside the house will result in a $100 fine to all residents. One of my roommates is epileptic and has a prescription for medical marijuana, while the other doesn't. However, the epileptic one does smoke more than just his prescription, and they sell it to others as well. When we first moved in I told them I didn't have any problem with them smoking, but that they needed to do it inside, to which they agreed.

One day,  I received notice that the maintenance worker had found evidence of smoke in the air filter, and we were hit with a fine. I made it clear to them that I wanted them to pay for my fine, as this is entirely caused by them. While they agreed, they were very hesitant to do so. I am fairly sure it will happen again, as they smoke multiple times a day and often have people over to smoke with them.

629,not the a-hole,"So this just happened in a group text between several friends and myself.

My friend was saying that he plans to invite a girl over on a night where all of us had planned to hang out together. We’ll call this girl Daisy.

Daisy has a rare condition called ectrodactyly, which causes her to only have three fingers on each hand. So when we were informed that Daisy would be joining us, my friend Peach asks if Daisy is “the fingerless girl”

This kind of upset me because the last time Daisy came over, Peach was kind of bitchy and it apparently made Daisy uncomfortable, and so we cut our evening short that night.

Then Peach started making jokes about how “her hands are the only way I can identify her!” after I explained to her that Daisy probably wouldn’t like being identified by her condition.

I reminded Peach that when *she* heard that our other pal, Waluigi, was saying how he found Peach annoying to be around during their weekend hiking trip, Peach’s feelings were hurt. 

Peach told me that I was being hypocritical because I also made jokes about Daisy’s hands in the past. I admit this is true, and Daisy very well could have been offended by my jokes if she saw them. One of my jokes was asking how Daisy could pass the blunt, just to give an example.

My point was not “hey, don’t talk shit about her, that’s bad”, but rather “hey, I know you get upset when people say things about you, so you shouldn’t do that to other people.”

Edit: What I more accurately said was “Hey Peach, since you got upset that one time someone talked shit about you, why do you say mean things about other people?” In the form of a non-aggressive question, and she took it personally. End edit.

I honestly don’t condemn people for shit talking or offensive jokes made in private. I think that’s just part of human nature, and everyone does it at some point. I don’t take it to heart when people shit talk me, I just chock it up to them either being assholes or I consider that maybe I should change something.

Am I wrong about any of this? I was not rude
at all when talking to Peach, but she took great offense to it and left the group text. I know she is very insecure and temperamental, so I’m not surprised that she’d be so easily upset.

It just got to me that Peach would go and make a mean joke when I know how sensitive she is about stuff like that. Also, she already made Daisy uncomfortable once. 

In her opinion, this is a joke but Waluigi was talking shit, so it’s different, but really Waluigi was just giving his honest opinions to us in private. His exact words were “nah, she’s too annoying to be more than a friend.” It wasn’t even that bad.",11,30,0.8

If I ever need to talk to someone, I will just, if i don't wanna have a conversation, I won't talk. However, it seems like this one kid, whom we will call Chris, sees me as some sort of friend.

Don't get me wrong, I see nothing wrong with him, we even have a few things in common, but he usually approaches me whilst I'm on my phone and he just so happens to be nearby, or when I'm in class and he really wants to share something with someone, bam, I'm that guy.

Truth be told, I really don't care, and I'm not looking for friends, and he's not someone who I can talk to, nor am I interested in talking to, but I can't help but to feel guilty, because at some point, I was this kid, and I understand he just needs a friend, but I really don't wanna be that friend.",52,368,0.95
632,not the a-hole,"So my gf and I have a very good relationship and generally support eachother. However, there's things that really bother me when she doesn't care about them. For example, I sing and play guitar and sometimes I upload my stuff to youtube. I'm very much and intermediate singer with a decent to good voice, so I don't expect her to be amazed at me but to at least support me. I've had comments before, like ""what's the point of it"". I simply enjoy it... I also write poetry, which she has never bat an eye to. 

Tonight I've been given the opportunity (for the first time) to play in the background for 20 minutes at an event of a society we're both part of, and she was going to be there. However, now she's told me that she's going for drinks with work collegues after work, and then for drinks with other friends after that, so she won't be there (didn't say it to apologise, she just stated her plans for today, even though she originally had intended to help out at the event aswel). I'm honestly very frustrated about it, but can't help to think that I MIGHT be over-reacting?

Other instances where she's had the same attitude have been when I had to resit a university exam during the summer and was very stressed during my study period, she simply told me to ""get on with it"" and would stay silent when I told her I was stressed and fed up. This past week I've had a bad cold that made me feel miserable and she also told me to ""get over it"". Meanwhile, one of my girl - friends got very worried about it and started giving me advice on how to get better as soon as I told her, and I can't help wish my gf was the same. The simple fact that someone worries makes you feel a bit better already. 

Those are the most recent events I can remember but it's definitely happened before.There's such thing as being reasonable, but then there's not caring... and I feel this is more of the latter. AITA for thinking that? I also can't help but think that if we ever had children and she did the same to them, she wouldn't be an entirely good mother.

Edit: I don't want to tell her how much the chance to play tonight made me happy, because then she'll only turn up because of that and not because she wants to see me perform/be there. If she had a valid reason to not be there, I'd be fine with it. It's just her attitude in general that frustrates me.

Edit 2: thanks for all the comments and support. I went to the event and played, and she turned up (later after I had already played). We had a passive aggressive discussion about it and she explained that she wanted to come but made it seem as if she wouldn't because she was annoyed at me for an event I went to with friends and didn't invite her, although I went spontaneously without pre-planning it (that's another story). I'm not completely convinced by her excuse and she should have turned up on time anyway instead of staying having drinks for so long if she really had wanted to listen to me, but the fact that she turned up at least proves that she saw importance in the event, since she didn't know at what point would I perform.
Although she's very inconsiderate with little things that really matter, she is also quite good in other situations e.g. she took me out for dinner and payed when I got my exam results. Hence why I didn't ask if she's the asshole. If she is an asshole, she certainly makes up for it with other things. But I wanted to know if I was the asshole for being frustrated at her in those times when she does make it seem that they're insignificant events, which happens every so often but not every single time. I needed to know of I would be right and have ground to argue with her about these things or if I was being overly-sensitive (like she makes me out to be).

We were discussing a timeline (we are engaged) and I talked a little bit about it with my best friend. She told me she doesn’t want me to get married on Halloween because she got together with her boyfriend on Halloween and they want to get married on Halloween to keep the same date, so she doesn’t want us to share an anniversary. She also told me she “wouldn’t be able” to make the wedding if I do get married on Halloween. We plan to have a courthouse wedding but maybe have a big wedding party on a 5 or 10 year anniversary, and she would have been my pick for maid of honor, and she knows that.

635,not the a-hole,"Update: I decided to talk with his professor. She offered to report it to the police but I refused (I don’t think he realised what he was doing and think it’s more trouble than it’s worth). I suggested an extended deadline, which she refused as my housemate was already on extended time. Turns out we couldn’t really come to a compromise, and after reading comments here, I decided to drop it and I’m letting him submit the song for marking only (after that it’s being deleted off the system and his own files). 

My housemate is studying music production and for the past six months has been working on a song that’s due in 3 days. He decided to show me the project this morning, thinking I’d appreciate it, but instead it felt invasive as he’d used voice recordings of my private conversations without my permission. 


The voice recordings were of a private phone call I had when I was feeling quite vulnerable. I talk about some pretty heavy emotions I was feeling and some intimate details about my life. It’s embedded into the song itself and he explained he wouldn’t be able to remove it without recreating the entire song (something that took him months to perfect).


Now, I’ve known this guy for about a year and we’re not exactly friends, we just see each other throughout the shared accommodation and never really speak besides hellos. I find it pretty creepy that he recorded me (his excuse was that I was in the kitchen and not trying to keep the conversation private, and the ‘raw emotion’ added to the value of the music). I don’t think he’s infatuated with me at all, and I genuinely don’t think he was trying to be creepy, just a way over the top artist type that hasn’t realised he’s crossed a boundary.

636,asshole (Kinda),"Over the past few quizzes in my Bio class people have been cheating by erasing their answers and writing in the correct ones. We mark our own quizzes with an answer key and the quizzes themselves are worth little. Since it was almost the whole class cheating I spoke to my teacher who basically told me that she wasn’t going to watch for cheating and if people do cheat they will have to answer to God (she’s a nun) she also said she would speak to the class about it. There were a few people from my class in the room when we talked about this and they’re pretty obviously upset with me and might tell the rest of the class. The only reason I was upset about this is because this is a 30-1 diploma course and people really shouldn’t have to cheat on these tests. 

EDIT: just to clarify because I didn’t mention it, I didn’t mention names and I only said that some people were cheating. Nobodies grades were affected.

Tbh if I was smart I would have cheated too

one last edit: my teacher encouraged me heavily to tell who was doing and to tell her WHILE they were doing it in order for her to do anything, which I obviously won’t do. Otherwise, she said she wouldn’t do anything about it.

There are 12 people in our department. We’re all pretty good at what we do. 

One of my coworkers, though, who has been here for 6 months, seems to lack the ability to pick up on basic things, and continues to ask questions they should know the answer to by now.

Our supervisors aren’t always around so a lot of times she’ll have to ask one of us in the department and we’ll help her. 

It got pretty embarrassing when we had a new person start 2 weeks ago who answered one of her questions for her. She (the one who’s been here for 6 months) asked a question and a few of us were around, it was something pretty basic, and the new person spoke up and answered her question correctly. 

Because our supervisors aren’t always around us 24/7, they don’t always get to see first hand just how bad our one coworker is at her job, and how slow she can be.

At first, I would just answer her questions, but lately, I’ve been saying things like “hmm, not sure, I think you should email our supervisors and see what they say” because I want them to be aware of how bad she is at her job because at a certain point it could really start to affect our company.

A lot of guys have said positive things, thinks it’s cool. We have normal conversations everything is good. 

I recently matched with someone who seemed more curious about it. His comment was “how did you get into network engineering? Not the most common path for a girl”  

This question kind of rubbed me the wrong way.

I just had an interest and pursed it. I don’t see how it’s any different then having an interest in teaching, or nursing, or marketing. I just like tech. 

My response was “yeah well it happened the same way it does for a guy shockingly. Found something I was interested in and pursued it” 

His response “sad that we live in a world where someone can take offence to that. I work in tech too and the lack of women in the industry always gets brought up so I was curious how you got into it” 

My final response was “I didn’t take offence to it, but I just don’t have some grand story on how I got into it. I really just had an interest in technology and pursued it.

He starts exclaiming (to an office space of three women) that he just can't understand why she's accusing him now. That she's only accusing him now because he's famous and that we don't have to assume that her accusations are true. We start to explain to him that power might be one of the reasons she's coming forward--if confirmed, he would have the power to overturn Roe v. Wade and it's a scary prospect that someone with that lack of judgment should have that control over the law. He says that she should have accused him much earlier. 

He's also had a similar argument and come into my office wanting to discuss Serena. He said that she was just a sore loser and if she really wanted to take on sexism and racism, she should have done it years earlier. Telling him that Serena was previously and continually fighting these issues didn't deter him. 

I'm not sure why but I raised my voice (though my voice was calm) and said, ""please get out of the office. I don't want to talk about this topic."" He started blabbering saying, ""what did I say? Did I say something wrong?"" When he eventually did leave, he came back minutes later, apologizing, saying, ""I just wanted to understand why someone would do that.""

I said, nicely, ""can you put your phone away, they told us to"" and she said it's just the previews, so I said ""OK"". Then after the movie started she had her phone out and was definitely scrolling through facebook. I snapped at her, ""turn off your phone, that's very rude!"" And she said, defensively, ""I was just looking at the time!"" Then she took out her phone again to look at texts and I angrily gathered up all my stuff and moved to another seat in the movie theatre. But I could still see her regularly using her phone throughout the whole movie.

So after the movie was over, I stormed into the lobby and said, ""Attention everyone, I have an announcement to make: this bitch had her phone out the entire fucking movie!"" 

Later on, I was in the bathroom and she came up to my stall and said ""I don't think we should be friends anymore"" and I said ""okay"".

Later on, she called me to let me know that she has a lot of respect for me but that I had crossed a boundary and was being emotionally abusive.

In the interests of context, we'd just had a fight earlier that day. I'd kind of unloaded on her things I had been keeping to myself,  namely, that she has owed me $200 for almost 2 years now. At the time, I told her not to stress about it and pay me back when she could, because she was having money issues at that time. And over the next year or so she was always stressing about money and complaining to me about her money issues so I never wanted to bring it up. But now she's going to go on a trip to Europe with her bf and recently bought herself a TV and told me how relieved she was to finally be financially stable. And so I was bitter about it and she said that she didn't realize I was still holding that against her after two years.  She said I needed to communicate my feelings to her instead of holding it in. So the reason I was so pissed off during the movie is because I felt I had made my feelings on phone use during a movie very plain and she kept doing it, meaning she had been lying about how she would have respected my feelings about the money thing if I'd only made them apparent.

650,not the a-hole,"I'm 25F getting married next year to my amazing Fiance. My sister is 28F and we've always had a caustic relationship. When we were very young, we could hardly be in the same room with each other without getting into a screaming match. We would often get into fights throwing things at each other, slapping, pulling each others' hair, and it was about 50-50 between who would escalate things to getting physical. Once I turned 9-10 I stopped getting physical, but we would still fight often and she would still do things like hit me across the head with the TV remote or scratch my arms during our arguments.

Teenage years were also bad. I wasn't always a saint and we continued to get into arguments constantly, but I wasn't instigating them. My sister would do things to push my buttons like stealing things from me and tearing out all the signature pages in my yearbook saying that I didn't need them anyway because I had no friends. In general she acted like a third parent/authority figure over me and tried to dictate things like when I was allowed to get on birth control and whether I was allowed to go to parties. (I am not so hung up on the specifics from when we were kids, just trying to show that our relationship has always been toxic and it's not just a recent thing.)

As adults things haven't improved. I resigned myself to just trying to coexist as peacefully as possible, but every time she came around it would escalate into her screaming at me (and if not me, a screaming match with our very-similar-to-her mom or our dad). And I know it's not just me because pretty much everyone who's ever hung out with us both at the same time has made comments to me about how emotionally volatile my sister is, and people have specifically made comments about how she will find a way to blow up no matter how much I try to avoid or de-escalate an argument.

That brings us to the matter at hand. Yesterday she sent me a text asking what color and style of bridesmaid dress she needed to get for my wedding. I *specifically* did not ask her to be a bridesmaid because I am having a very small bridal party and I only wanted people standing next to me who have loved and supported me throughout my life. My sister has *always* done these sappy ""sister"" things on Facebook etc. where she will post things about how a sisterly bond is something sacred that no one else can understand, or she'll get me a painted sign about how important sisterhood is to decorate my room with, but then she turns around and constantly instigates fights, takes my car, rips up my mail, and tells me I should kill myself?? To be perfectly blunt, I don't love my sister. I don't even like her. And even though there have been pockets of goodness throughout, on the whole our relationship has been a shit sandwich and I am a happier person with my life having as little involvement from her as possible.

I texted my sister back ""You aren't a bridesmaid."" and of course she threw a shitfit. I asked our parents to talk to her and that was also a very unproductive conversation, with the main takeaway being ""She's compromising by not being your maid of honor, you need to compromise by making her a bridesmaid."" Which...she was 100% never in the running to be my maid of honor and I'm shocked that she thinks she was a candidate. But our mom already has her white lace dress picked out for my wedding, so she's not exactly a wellspring of rationality either.

I don't want to make my sister too upset (mostly because I don't want to deal with her dramatic behavior) and I know just giving her what she wants is *probably* going to alleviate a solid year of getting shit on for not making her a bridesmaid, but ugh. I just wouldn't be happy with her standing beside me.",33,58,0.84

Last week a I got a new neighbour, a single mom with a probably 3-year-old girl. I and my new neighbour liv on the second floor with no one above us. Other than saying “Hi” to them we had not talked at all. 

On Wednesday last week, she had put up a wreath on her door, a flower in a glass jar and something I can only describe as dead twigs in a flowerpot. I thought to myself, “Okay, this was a bit strange that she did not say anything before putting up the flowers. But I’m not going to say anything”. But it did not bother me, but it looked a bit strange. 

On Thursday when I got home form work, she had put up a couple of signs. A big one that had “Home sweet home” written on it, one that had “A smile cost nothing but gives a lot”, and “chocolate fixes problem”. Along with a woodcarving thing. She had still not asked me or said anything else to me about this about wanting to decorate the stairway, so I thought now is my turn. 

On Friday as soon as I got home I got a nail and hammer and put up a picture on my own. The picture was of George Costanza from Seinfeld when he is half naked on a couch, wit the test “the subtle art of seduction” written on the bottom. A let it hang for a couple of hours, before changing it of a fake painting of Kramer, also from Seinfeld. She opened the door when I was doing it catching me a bit of guard, but I told here that if she wanted to decorate the stairwell she can, but I wold appreciate to be involved since I also lives here. 

On Saturday morning she had taken everything down except the wreath, and I removed the Kramer picture. Later in the day I knocked on her door and said sorry for being a bit silly, but repeated that I wanted to be involved in decorating the stairwell. She told me that she did not think men cares about decorating and that she was not interested now at least. I am pretty sure that she hates me now.

Not like in China or anything but you will be touching 2/3 people with your shoulders and back. 

Recently there’s a woman with a pram who gets on before me (there usually isn’t too many people on the carriage before my stop/the one afterwards). She takes up a load of space and makes it so much more compact. 

Then when we reach her stop a good 15-20 people have to get off of the train(sometimes into the rain) to let her off. 

I know that it’s tough to bring children around with you but it’s against the rules to have prams or bikes that aren’t folded during peak times. Not to mention super inconvenient for all passengers

I said this to my mates after she got off and it has annoyed me all day. They think I’m being a bit of an asshole and unempathetic. 

To be fair to the woman she is quite nice when asking everyone to get out of her way and the baby has been asleep every time. But inevitable there will be a ride where it screams its little lungs out. 

If we piled up our bags in a corner and got one of our friends to lie on it instead of putting them at our feet like usual we would be chastised. 

I just don’t see how it’s fair to take up so much room. Especially when there’s those baby holder things you can put you kid in and they are like a backpack. 

I’m just saying she should collapse the pram and put it back up after her 15 minute commute.

I get along fine with pretty much all of my suite mates, but there has been some conflict arising over one of the suite mates trying to tell us to go to bed when we’re up playing video games or watching a movie in the common area.

He’s about 10 years older than all of us so sometimes it comes across as if he’s scolding us even though all of us are adults. I respect that he wishes to go to bed at a reasonable hour, but it’s not like we’re being disruptive or loud in the common room. We keep the TV volume low and talk at a normal volume. 

He’s came out of his room to tell us to quiet down (in a very passive aggressive manner) about three times now and we always listen to him by muting the TV, but the past two times he’s told us to go to bed because we were keeping him up. Again, I don’t understand how we would be keeping him up considering his room is on the opposite side of the common room. I even asked my roommate if he could hear us from our room (which is closer to the common room) and he told me he heard nothing.

My suite mates and I plan on having an adult conversation with him this week to see if we can solve the issue.

Last night I got a booty call around midnight while I was at a party at my friend's place from a girl I have been seeing on and off for over a year. I made it to her house about 20 minutes after she invited me and found her laying on her bed, hardly opening her eyes to talk to me. I tried talk to her for a while but she was basically just laying there. I thought maybe she was just really serious about having sex and didn't want any pleasantries. Again, no. She just wanted to go to sleep.

&#x200B;

She did sleepily ask me to cuddle with her, but I was not interested in going to sleep - I was wide awake. Realizing the situation, disappointment set in as I tried to figure out what I was going to do: 1) drive back to my friends which felt weird to consider place 2) go home and be bored 3) end the fun night I was having prematurely and hope I can fall asleep (I often can't in situations like this).

&#x200B;

As I considered this, I sighed and said, ""I wish you wouldn't have invited me over if you were just going to waste my time."" At this, she gets really defensive and angry and insists that I'm being unreasonable for presuming that she could ""know how tired she was going to be in 30 minutes,"" which I say is a reasonable thing to be able to predict in yourself. Worse than this she launches into this whole thing about how I'm a sleazy guy for just wanting sex. For one, that's what she call me for (implicitly, from our conversation earlier in the day, and from all the dirty texts in the days before). Secondly, I genuinely didn't care about having sex. I wasn't even horny this night but I am always happy to please people I'm in a relationship with if they want it. But most of all, I just expected at the very least that someone inviting me over would stay up with me and hang out. So yeah, I thought she was wasting my time by inviting me over and then expecting me to sleep just because that's what she suddenly wanted to do.

&#x200B;

For some context, this was a dumb argument that snowballed into something really big because of how frustrated her back-handed comments made me: ""I just thought it would be nice to spend some time together."" *Implying I don't like spending time with her.* ""I feel weird that you're angry because I don't want have sex with you."" *Implying that it's just about the sex (and not the sleeping) and I'm some sort of pervy sleaze.* ""You're right, I'm just the worst!"" *Even though I said no such thing, I just disagreed.*

&#x200B;

We've been together on and off for over a year and though we've had issues we've never had an actual argument where we were pissed at each other. So, that's why I'm worried about something so seemingly trivial -- because the bullshit the ensued after feels like it might end the relationship.

&#x200B;

So, am I the asshole for being angry/disappointed for her wasting my time?

&#x200B;

**EDIT2: Resolution:**

>Yeah, it would be annoying for someone to go to sleep that quickly, but you do sometimes hit a wall, and I'm sure it wasn't her intention.

Thanks for this. Genuinely. This is the only comment here that has me actually re-thinking my actions (and it has zero karma, what's up with that?!). Because I seriously did think it was unreasonable to not be able to predict how tired you would be and was also truly disappointed with the situation I was left with. Combine those two things and I feel like I have been willingly wronged.

But you're right. She wouldn't have intended the outcome that happened and it was unreasonable of me to fault her for getting tired. Her intentions were good. I really would have appreciated a simple apology for her getting tired, or just something that shows she can see how it'd feel to be in my shoes, but I get it. She's a little drunk, a lot tired. That's not crossing her mind in that state.

I've now sent her this text message because of this post:

Hey *affectionate nickname*, I just wanted to apologize for the other night. I should have known your intentions were all good and kept that at the forefront of my mind, but I didn’t. It was unreasonable of me to expect you to control your need for sleep. I was disappointed with the situation and was hoping you’d appreciate that disappointment but I understand why you wouldn’t at that time, especially after things got heated. Love you, *piecemealed*.",64,67,0.9

667,not the a-hole,"Ok, so a little bit of context for this: Last year, in college, my year went to shit. I ended with 25 credits and a 3.05, (28 if you count an incomplete) and was generally pissed. I had to drop a class because someone cheated off of me, therefore zeroing both of our tests and ending with me almost getting a D, which I elected to replace with a ""W"" for ""Withdrew."" I lied to myself and my dad about how my year was going, and it was generally a shitty year. My mom died, my entire family was in legal battles, and I was being forced to cut off ties with a lot of people I didn't want to.

&#x200B;

Cut to this year. Over the summer, I got a criminal speeding ticket for going 106 in a 65. I was having an anxiety attack over getting home at 11, and ended up getting pulled over for it for the first time in my life. I didn't tell my dad, and eventually he found out. A couple of days ago, I plead guilty. My dad over-exaggerated everything. He made it seem like I was getting an SR22 and my license revoked, their insurance was gonna go through the roof! I would never work again, unless I lied on my resume about my criminal history. The prosecutor put it best: ""You guys are making this seem like the end of the world. It's not a big deal."" A lawyer told me exactly the same thing.

&#x200B;

The reason I brought up the ticket, is because during our court dates, he used every opportunity he had to make me feel like absolute shit, and a total failure. He told me I was fucking up my entire life, and that I had no excuse to do it. He even blamed me for getting cheated off of last year. He's been asking me for my college sign-on password so he can check my grades whenever he pleases. I'm uncomfortable with that for a number of reasons:

1. He traced my previous emails. When I was a tween, he helped me set up my first few emails. I thought he did it to help me, turns out he had whatever was sent to my emails, forwarded to him in a way I can't prevent it from happening. (He runs an internet company and can do that kind of stuff.) Everything from signing in at certain times, to purchasing things, if I didn't clear it up with him first, or do it with his express blessing, was subject to scrutiny, being told I was terrible, and being told I wasn't allowed to do things. My college sign-on is hooked to my college email, which he can't trace, and I use it for a number of things.
2. He rides my ass relentlessly. I have had conversations with him where he repeats the same question over and over and over again, even if I respond the first time. He gives absolutely no slack, and will remind you about things you don't need to be reminded of. He'll ask me why I didn't perfectly score a 100 on my last assignment or test, or why I'm not at an A+ in my course. He blames me for things I can't control, and has never once said he is proud of me.
3. I'm trying to move out. The last thing I need is for him to have more power over my life. IMO, he isn't really a good parent, and I've been trying for the past couple of months to get a job and a place. I am very much trying to leave the life I'm living, despite his assurances that because we're well off, we're lucky, and who would want to leave a life like this?
4. He sent me this. I told him I didn't feel comfortable giving him my password. [https://imgur.com/NXMbJlk](https://imgur.com/NXMbJlk)

His justification, and the justification that I am hearing from others, is that since he is helping me to pay for college, he is entitled to my password and to do whatever he wants. I could have gone to other colleges with a full ride, and no one would have said anything, except for my family, who would have given me a headache for it. The only reason I went to the particular one I go to is because it was near family, in state.

Well, we all just thought it was some cute puppy crush and that it'd just disappear as the girl got older and met other people. But it didn't. Each time Ken would try to hangout with his friend, Kayla was right up his ass and it lasted for a good few years, as far as I know. Now, Ken wasn't going to be an asshole to this girl just for having feelings. He talked to her, hung out with her, all that jazz. Nothing ever came out of that.

I don't know what changed or how things even got to this point. But apparently this girl started sending sexual suggestions/content to my best friend for a good month or three, probably more. Each time it'd happen, Ken would tell us, ask us for advice, and we'd always tell him to block her and get out of her life. All three of us would warn him not to do anything, since we were just-turned adults and he'd be locked away for associating with a minor in this way. But he never did anything to stop it. Each time this happened,  *we'd always tell him to stop.* We wouldn't make fun of this or anything, all of us agreed it made us sick thinking about the subject. But Ken took it as a game or something and kept talking to her despite the situation, even making jokes concerning Kayla and how things would go down every now and then.

The tipping point for me was when Ken scheduled a trip with his friend's family to the beach. This trip would have the both of them in a hotel room together, with a bed, alone, while the rest of Kayla's family is out on vacation. It was very clearly suggested that the both of them would have sex multiple times when they had the chance, and along with all the jokes Ken made and advances Kayla sent, I didn't know if he was serious about doing anything. I took it upon myself to fix the situation my idiot of a friend was putting himself in.

679,not the a-hole,"Some backstory, Tl;Dr at the end.

So a coworker of mine we'll call Jack I had been working together doing masonry for 4 years and had become close friends. He was a struggling heroin addict and had been trying to get clean/relapsing since I knew him. A little more than a year ago his sister committed suicide leaving behind her 2 year old daughter to the care of the rest of family. Jack was of course devastated and it was the finale straw for him to get clean for good to make sure he's there for his niece, which he did.

The rest of the family however is an absolute mess. His brother is still on the shit, the mom pops xanax like candy and nobody ever knows where the other sister is until she's asking for money. There is a third sister who fell on the right foot and partly seperated herself from the mess.

Back in May, Jack and I moved into an apartment together. It's a really old house that was turned into a duplex and in great shape for its age with tons of space and incredibly cheap rent for the size and a private acre backyard, we both loved it and had a great couple months there living together.

On the night of the first anniversary of his sisters death Jack overdosed in his room where me and his brother found him. It was a traumatic and horrific sight to see one of my good friends like that and the sight of his hysterical mother and his father walking around like a zombie after losing two children in a year was an overwhelmingly terrible situation to be in.

After the wake I told the family I'd leave the back door open for them so they could come get their sons belongings on their own time. We went through quickly what was mine and what was his. A few small odds and ends and things that were mine ended up missing but nothing of any realy value so I wrote it off to them not being in a good state of mind.

The other day I noticed my winter gear bin missing, 2 pairs of ski pants, ski jacket, boots, A carhart work jacket, helmets, goggles, everything totalling almost $1000 worth of various outdoor equipment. Jack and I's things were in the storage room not really separate or anything because we knew whose stuff was whose and I expect that they took it by accident so I asked them about it and they said ""none of us ski so we probly didn't take it but I'll look."" That was two days ago. I plan on following up with them after work today but with the families track record my hopes aren't high.

I can't just let this stuff get up and walk away on it's own. I've looked my entire house up down multiple times for this big, hard to miss bin full of equipment that nobody in their right mind would think would fit Jack (he was WAY bigger than me). I'm so conflicted about what to do and I fear the only way to turn is to report it stolen but I really don't want that bad blood with my good friends family and I have no real proof other than where the hell else did it go. Not to mention what the family is going through right now.

Please help

Edit: Reporting it will be my last resort but I fear it may come to that.

686,advice zone,"So, some back story first. I (m/18) have been dating my gf (f/17) for going on three years now, on and off. We have a great relationship but her parents have always disapproved of me. I couldn't tell you exactly why, because I have never gotten concrete reasons as to why. I personally think it could be a social class thing, because I live in a wealthy area and her parents are very well-to-do, and my family and I... not so much. Anyway, I have always treated my girlfriend right, we never argue or fight, we have a very loving relationship. 

About a month into us dating they found out that we snuck away from a school dance and they banned her from seeing me for a year. A couple years ago they finally allowed her to date me again. Again, I always treat her right, I always get her home on time, I never get her in trouble or let her hang around bad influences that I know her parents won't approve of.

So for the last couple years everything has been relatively fine, her parents have seemed like they warmed up to me, though it's still slightly awkward being around them because they seem to like asking me a lot of ""gotcha"" questions and still don't seem like they trust me completely.

About two months ago my girlfriend went on vacation to the state she used to live in and ended up smoking some weed with her friends there. Well, one of her ""friends"" ratted her out to her parents and they got incredibly mad, grounded her for about a month. They also partially blamed me because they ""had a feeling"" I convinced her to start smoking weed. (I do smoke but have never once tried to pressure her into doing it with me, though she has on her own terms wanted to smoke with me a few times. Her parents don't know about that.) This made me incredibly upset because it showed me that they never trusted me all along and they've always thought of me as a bad influence on their daughter. Not only that but they banned her from coming to my house because they also think my family is a bad influence. That pisses me off the most because my family is incredibly loving, incredibly supportive of both me and my girlfriend, and are all around great people. They don't pretentiously judge us like her family does. (seriously, her mom makes her cry regularly because she says incredibly hurtful things about her weight, her friends, and me.)

Ever since this incident I have pretty much completely backed off from seeing her family, except for one occasion last week where I met up with them at my girlfriend's swim meet and they pretty much gave me the silent treatment. I don't want to see them, their actions and their judgement of me and my family really hurt. 

So her birthday is on Friday. They're going out to dinner and my girlfriend invited me.

I am currently 33 weeks pregnant and chronically uncomfortable. It takes me aaages to get back to sleep (if I am able to) and every single noise or movement wakes me up. We also share the bed with our 2 year old most nights and he wakes up a few times during the night which also wakes me up as well. 

I asked my husband to only have one alarm in the morning so that I have more chance to get back to sleep after he goes to work (I don’t get up until 7 or 7:30 with my son). He has partially done so... now he has one loud alarm, goes back to sleep and 15 minutes later has a vibrating alarm on his smart watch (the noise of the vibration wakes me up as well so it’s almost as if he just has two alarms), then he gets up. I have asked him to just have the one alarm so that I’m not in a constant state of trying to get to sleep and waking up for 15 - 20 minutes but he says he can’t. 

I got really over it this morning (I’m already cranky af all day every day anyways) and told him that if he can’t have one alarm and get straight up then he can sleep on the couch until the baby comes.

I'm in university and there's a big scene here for LGBT rights etc. A lot of my friends are very active in the community - I don't involve myself much it but I know they are doing good in the world and I'm glad we have people fighting for equality. I myself am a lesbian, but I have dated men in the past before I knew I was lesbian. 


Anyway, I broke up with my girlfriend last week, and one of my close friends said that she knew someone who was single and wanted to hook us up. I said yes, and gave me her friend's number. We arranged to meet in a pizza place.


When I got there, I found out this person was a transgender woman - that is, he was very clearly a man in a dress. His voice was deep and he had a very masculine face. I am using the masculine pronoun because this man it seemed was making very little effort to look like a woman, besides shaving his beard and wearing a dress.


I was a bit shocked, but I stuck through it until the end. He asked if I wanted to go out with him again, and I let him down gently.


When I saw my friend again, I told her it was not cool to just set me up with a man like that when she knows I'm attracted to women. And she said I was being transphobic! For being a lesbian! Apparently it doesn't matter that I'm not attracted to men, I should be attracted to him because on the inside he believes he is a woman. 


And to top that off, all of the other friends in our friend group are on her side, and they seem to think im the crazy one.


We actually had quite a big argument, but have apologised since and we are still friends. But I can't stop thinking that it was not OK for her to set me up with a man.

I (26/M) started dating Jasmine (18/F) in early June. Things were going great, we saw each other a few times a week and were constantly happy when we were together. In late July, Jasmine suggested she take the two of us out on a romantic date and said she would text me the details the following day. I did not hear from Jasmine until three days later.

Jasmine called me at about 10am from a number I didn't recognize and sounded both intoxicated and distressed. She asked me to come pick her up from a target in a large city about 3 hours from my house and I asked her what she was doing out there and she kept avoiding the question with vague answers like ""my (nameless) friend took me out here"" and just kept repeating she needed me to come get her. 

I told her it's a far drive, there's more than 15 target stores in this city, I am unfamiliar with the city and i need an address in order to go get her.

She never gave me an address or anything specific besides target in (city). I was worried sick and texted and called her (unrecognized phone number) many times throughout the day and never got a response. I tried calling both her old number and the new mystery one a few times over the next few days but to no avail.

A few weeks go by and I still haven't heard from Jasmine. I told Bob (25/M), one of my best friends everything. He had me convinced that Jasmine had gone out to that city to cheat on me and get fucked up, then had the audacity to call me for a ride back home. I thought I had been ghosted and accepted that things were over between us.

Another week goes by and I go on a week long vacation with my mother (60/F). While on vacation I meet Morgan (26/F) who I instantly clicked with and we spent two days in a lustful, tantric bliss. Seriously, I could write a novel on how awesome of a time we had but I will have to spare y'all the juicy details. 

I am no longer in contact with Morgan, we both knew that our romance would be short lived, but oh so sweet. We live 3000+ miles from each other and agreed to part ways instead of torture ourselves with a LDR.

On the last day of my vacation, my phone starts being blown up by another unrecognized number. It is Jasmine, and she tells me she got arrested and has been in jail for over a month. I tell her I'm in Mexico and I'll be back in a few days because we have a lot to discuss.

The day I got back, I gathered Jasmine's things and brought them to her house. I told Jasmine the truth and I broke her heart. I am of the school of thought that it is better to tell people the truth even if it is the last thing they want to hear. 

I told Jasmine I thought she broke up with me by ghosting me and she claimed that she isn't that shitty of a person, and she would have had the decency to have that conversation with me.  I told her it wouldn't be the first time I've been ghosted out of the blue by someone when things were going seemingly great.

As a reminder, I hadn't heard a peep from her in just about a month by the time I left for my vacation. By the time I had spoken to Jasmine in person, it had been about 40 days of no contact.

I thought we had broken up over a month ago, and Jasmine thinks I cheated on her with Morgan. I told Jasmine I do not regret what I did with Morgan, I do not consider it cheating, but I am sorry that things turned out the way they did. 

I told her had she not been acting so shady before going MIA, or if she had just sent me an address to go pick her up that the sequence of events leading up to what Morgan and I did never would have occurred, and I never would have ""cheated"" on her, because we either would have broken up then or worked through it.

I told her I don't expect nor will I ask for her forgiveness, but I am still the same guy I was before her disappearance, and on the off chance she comes around and would like to be friends, I'd be okay with that.

About a year ago, I brought my cat Illya to a local vet/groomer's office to get a summer cut, since the heat seemed to be bothering her. I sat in the waiting room and watched them shave her hair, and everything seemed fine. She meowed and fought back, but Illya's a little bit of a bitch, so I didn't think much of it. 

Now, after they were done shaving and bathing her, they brought her back into the waiting room and handed her to me, then went to their desk to grab some forms/bills. It was then that I noticed the bottom of my white shirt was tinged red. I held Illya up, who'd been meowing pretty loudly since she was handed to me, and I saw a large gash across her stomach, bleeding. 

I don't remember exactly what I said, but I'm pretty sure I yelled at them. I paid for the haircut/bath, but I demanded they take the fall for stitches, anesthesia, antibiotics, the works to make sure she was okay. I also had them take care of her when the wound became infected. The vet seemed fairly anti-confrontational, so they just took care of it. I watched the whole thing, but they gave me the ""go to hell"" eyes the entire time. The medicine was the expensive kind, both the initial visit and the followup infection.

I also wrote a pretty harsh review on the city's large Facebook cat-love group, so there's that. 

TL;DR : Vet/Groomer gives my cat an accidental C section, I force them to treat her with the works to make sure she makes it through.

715,not the a-hole,"For the record, I'm really feeling like a huge asshole. 

I'm 6 months pregnant and this morning i was having some pain so I went to the women's clinic just to make sure all is well. When I'm getting examined, the doctor asks if one particular spot hurts and says there is something there that looks like it could possibly be herpes. My blood runs cold. I have never been diagnosed. There's nothing bothering me that feels like it could be herpes. I am tested for STDs regularly and have never had a problem... the Dr said she didn't have the things she needed to test for herpes there but to do it at my next obgyn appt next week. If I do have herpes it's not the end of the world but if I somehow contracted it while pregnant, it could mean complications for my birth.

Some additional background is that my husband and I are happily in a sort of open relationship. He's bi and sometimes plays around with buddies of his. Like maybe 4 times a year, max. The last time he did was in early July.

After I left the dr I was freaking out about whether to tell my partner. Today is his birthday and while he doesn't really care about it and doesn't want to do anything special for it, it felt shitty to burden him with this, especially since I didn't know for sure. As the day went on, I started panicking more and really feeling like I needed to talk to him. It seemed like something I shouldn't have to hold in. So I ended up telling him. He was obviously concerned but said that he doesn't see any way he would have contracted it.

I immediately apologized for dumping this on him on his birthday and I expected him to be like ""no big deal, glad you told me"" but instead he was like ""yeah it's sort of messed up. You could have just waited til you knew for sure."" I made it worse by crying a little after he said this.

First of all, it shouldn't matter at all, but I feel that for some reason this affects people's perception of the story: I'm a guy, but all the other people mentioned in the story are girls.

In high school, someone started vandalizing my car. It happened three Saturday nights in a row that my car was parked in front of my friend H's house.

It escalated each week, from crude window markings, to peanut butter under the handles, to a shocking amount of ketchup squirted evenly over one entire half of the car.

Once we identified the pattern of when and where, H and I spent the next Saturday night in my car with the seats reclined. H said she'd have non-emergency police on speed-dial for the second the person showed up.

Sure enough, eventually a figure showed up at the driver's seat window and began to write something using Vaseline. I didn't know how to react in the moment, and just kind of hit the window to startle them. 

It was A, one of my best friends, accompanied by another good friend, J. They began to run, so I got out of my car and chased them. Once this stupid chase began though, I realized I didn't know what I would do if I caught up with them, so I let them go.

H caught up to me and asked if I still wanted her to call the police, knowing it was my friends doing it. All I remember is hesitating, but at this point I literally can't remember if I verbally told H to call the police, or simply didn't stop her once she decided for me. Either way, I could have stopped her if I'd really wanted to.

The police found A&J really quickly and made them come back. They also had me call my parents. The cops said I could press charges if I wanted, but I didn't. There were no consequences for anyone involved. Regardless, the whole thing was really uncomfortable.

I didn't have a huge desire to be friends with A & J after that, but they made sure they were the ones doing the ""breaking up."" They mostly ignored me for the rest of that senior year, but were generally really mean whenever we did interact. 

There were a few times that I tried to confront them about that night though, and what really pissed me off is they always claimed that was the very first time they ever tried to do something like that. I really expected them to eventually come clean and apologize since this incident destroyed our friendship, but it's been eight years and they never wavered in their story.

I honestly don't believe them. But, I've wondered if I was the asshole in this scenario. If it really was their first time being the vandals, despite doing it in the exact same circumstances as the first three times it happened, then maybe I'm the asshole for having the cops called for one possibly good-natured thing. Even if they did it every time for sure, does my reaction to all of this mean I can't take a joke?

I'll be honest and say I don't understand pranks in almost any form, especially car pranks. I don't see the appeal in simply making a mess that's unpleasant for someone else to clean up. 

Either way, was I the asshole for letting the cops get involved without a more personal confrontation first?",23,89,0.92

He talks to her for a minute before turning on the hard sell to me trying to get me to sign up for a once a month direct debit.

I tell him ""sorry, we really can't afford that right now"" (which we really REALLY can't. We're struggling month to month right now).
At which point he says ""oh, but you are going to the zoo today, and that must cost a pretty penny right?!?""

I said nothing. Just moved my daughter outside to get away from him. And a week later called the station to make a complaint about it. Cos I felt pressured and bullied in a place I just wanted to quietly wait in.

I was just on assist with the guests and tried to call the little boy back. My coworker was behind the console and was doing the same. I yelled to her to turn the ride off but she didnt hear (english is her second language).

Everyone was fine, but it was scary and i asked her to tell a manager.  She debated it but didn't. I kept asking and today at the end of my shift I went and told them.

I just felt like something to tell them. We've been drilled to report all incidences including near misses. 

When I told them, I didnt mention my coworker, just what happened. Then they asked if any emergency precautions were done and if she was near the console. I answered honestly.

So this was about 8 years ago but recently was told it was a shitty thing. So my daughter was born 2/10/10 and I have like 3 close lifelong friends with birthdays 2/11. One of which was my best friend (use to catch the bus to kindergarten together, we'll be 30 this year) turned 21 a milestone birthday. So these 3 friends organized a group party at a bar. So I went to the bar probably less then 24hours after the birth of my first child. Recently a different life long friend got a new girlfriend and she said I was an asshole.
Couple points id like to provide:
1. bar was conviently located 1 mile from hospital
2.was there for an hour or two had maybe one or, two drinks, did not get drunk
3. Asked child's mother if I could go she said I could
4. I like beer
So what do you think, asshole?

EDIT:  alot to reply to so just a couple things, 
A. Baby was not in nicu, we stayed in the maternity ward, I got to hold her whenever I pleased, gave her most of her bottles, changed most of her diapers
B. I didn't think it would matter and maybe it doesn't but we were not married or together. We actually broke up before the pregnancy but had a night together and she conveniently forgot to tell me she stopped taking her pill.
C.  My friends girlfriend did not have any of this information, so I'm asking if just from the context from the op AITA, but this has been a fun interesting thread, thanks to all that replied.

731,not the a-hole,"Background: My parents have been divorced for over twenty years. My dad remarried a woman (we can call her Nancy) from a different country about a year or two after my parents divorced. I love everyone involved and respect all of my parents. I’ve never had any issues between them....until yesterday.

My mom bought us tickets to the A&M game today. A couple of people saw I was going and invited me to tailgates - one of these was my cousin who I haven’t seen in forever! 

I was really excited because my Uncle’s tailgates are really nice, and I always went when I was at school there. I know my mom will be welcomed there because they all went to the same high school and keep in touch and she has been invited to many of my uncles tailgates before. 

I text my dad to see if he will be at the game too. He responded that he will be there with my half-sister! I am super excited to see them since I haven’t seen them for about a month. I mention my mom will be with me. He then asked me to call him! 

I called him and he told me my step-mom Nancy doesn’t want my mom to come to the tent. She feels uncomfortable with my mom and dad being around each other when she isn’t there. I told him I probably wouldn’t leave my mom alone to go see them then hung up.

I have a feeling this comes from Nancy’s very traditional upbringing, as she was raised in a very strict family from a different country/religion that has negatives views of past relationships. 

After I thought about it, I texted him this morning saying-

“I am very disappointed and feel you and Nancy have put me in an extremely unfair position.  I just want y’all to consider the place y’all have put me into and it directly makes me choose between my parents. Yes my mom has to do with your past but this decision is punishing no one but me. The Botwins are my family too, even without you. I am halfway considering ignoring your request because I wasn’t invited by you and it’s not your tailgate and I want to see my family. 

This warrants a very serious conversation next time I see you, and I honestly don’t know how it will turn out. It won’t be today, and if I do come to the tent today I would prefer not talking to you because it’ll make me upset, so please respect that.”

I have decided I’m going to disregard his and Nancy’s wishes. My mom and I will be going to the tent, but I will not be speaking with him to avoid the commingling of my parents as requested. I am not asking for advice. I have already made my decision to go. 

TL;DR- I’m going to the tailgate my dad and stepmom have asked me not to attend my mom is with me. 

Am I the asshole here for going to the tailgate anyways? 

EDIT:
It went really well. At first my mom was really nervous when I told her the situation. We had a tailgate that we went to nearby first. She asked me to go there by myself, which I did at first. I mentioned to the other people at the tent that she was there and almost all my aunts and uncles agreed they wanted to see her. I grabbed her and convinced her to come. We had a great time. I was able to see my family, my mom was able to catch up with my family and her old friends, but my dad pretty much moved himself to the other side of the tent when he saw her coming. He did come over and hug me once but that was the extent of our interaction. 

I’m glad I went, I’m glad my mom went, but I still need to talk with my dad about it. I’m just sad my mom had to feel uncomfortable with people that clearly welcomed her and said she could come back whenever she wanted.

Dad still hasn’t responded to my text, so I have no clue how he feels about any of it. I had a great time today, and it was a great game. We even went back to the tailgate afterwards.

**tl;dr: 2 best friends refuse to be witnesses of a violent crime that resulted in severe injuries, even after originally saying they saw the incident and would give a statement. AITA for being pissed off and potentially unfriending them?**

Background info - I was the victim of assault causing GBH (a lad I know who has been threatening me for weeks saw me in a pub, confronted me and pushed me full force, I hit my forearm against a step and broke both bones. Surgery was required and I have suffered nerve damage that could potentially be long-term or permanent, affecting my hand and wrist). Both my friends witnessed this. I have been friends with one of them for 15 years, the other for 12 years. We do everything together. One of them told me on 3 seperate occassions on Facebook that he saw what happened and agreed to give a statement to the police. A few days later, he turned around and said he didn't actually see (even though he described the event in detail beforehand), and would refuse to give a statement. The friend of 12 years just flat out denied he saw anything. Neither of my friends have any idea who the offender is and the offender doesn't know who they are, so I can't buy that they're scared of repriesals. I have always gad both their backs in the past (even intervening in the assault of the 15 year friend in which I received a broken nose, broken ribs and a fractured cheekbone), so I feel really let down by them both and like this is a massive slap in the face.

I'm sitting in the smack middle seat of the plane, 10 seats across. 3, 4, then 3 again. Our flight is delayed and we're sitting on the tarmac, 2 how's and counting. A man and his wife demanded that the person on the plane next to me (sharing the middle) be moved so they can sit together. Totally reasonable. They didn't have to be rude, but whatever, right? So it's a guy, me, the husband and the wife.

Everything fine for about 30 minutes, but then guy starts pulling my purse out from under the seat in front of me, saying he wants to put this feet there. My purse was at my feet under the seat in front of me. It wasn't on ""his"" side. I asked him to leave my purse alone and his wife starts grabbing it and yanking it out. I reached down to grab my purse and this lady starts pinching and slapping my hand. The man starts getting upset, saying I'm being rude, that he's ""politely"" telling me to move my stuff so he can put his feet there. A flight attendant came over and asked us both to calm down. I told her I just want to watch a movie and zone out to my overnight flight. The guy next to me stops.

Then he starts putting his feet on my purse and kicking it. Then he's kicking it harder and trying to dig it out from under the seat with his feet. I ask him to stop and he tells me that I'm very rude and he won't let me do what I want because then I'd win. But he stopped kicking my back, so I ignored him, put my headphones back on, and went back to my movie.

A few minutes later, the wife goes and asks another flight attendant to come make me move my purse. So fine, the person next to me let's me put my purse under his seat and he put his laptop bag in the overhead storage. Problem solved. I put my feet or straight in front of me and am putting my headphones on when he pushed my feet out of the way and starts getting upset again that my feet are STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. He wants HIS feet there with his legs spread. 

The flight attendant comes back and asks ME to keep my feet to the side of the guy with the laptop bag. Sitting at an angle. For a 10 hour flight. He defended this guy's using my space and asks me to stop being a problem. I asked the nice guy with the laptop bag if we could switch seats and the flight attendant said no, we can't do that once we've taxied away from the gate. 

So I have my legs straight out in front of me, he's angry, and the flight attendant thinks I'm being an asshole. AITA for fighting back or should I have just crossed my legs off to one side and sucked it up for 10+ hours? Now this guy keeps muttering at me in another language. He and his wife are shooting eye daggers at me and I'm just sitting in the tarmac in the middle seat.

My grandchild lives with me and has for over a year now. She's 3. I have a decent relationship with the other grandparents, the parents of my son in law.  They have her 1 night a week on average.

Here's the situation: They brought my granddaughter home last night.  My granddaughter was carrying a kitten.  I told them that I already had 2 pets and I didn't want another one. They said ok and left.

This morning I went to check my mail. The kitten was on my back deck. Instead of them taking the kitten back to wherever they originally got it, they had abandoned it outside my house last night.

After I found the kitten,  I called them. Yes, I was angry.  They said I had no right to get mad over something so small and that I had anger issues.  I also refused to let them pick the kitten back up because I'm afraid they'll just drop it off somewhere else. I'm rehoming it. They said I'm overreacting.  

So am I an asshole that overreacted by getting mad? I consider this kitten as an abandoned animal.  They said they think a pet would teach our grandchild responsibility.  I said she already has pets here and if they wanted her to have another one, they should have kept it. They would have to pay a pet fee to their apartment complex though.

However, today, I was flipping through jackets without looking up, and an old lady I’ve never seen before from the next aisle over looks at me and says: 

“I bet you’re really pretty under all that makeup! You should try a more natural look.” 

I was wearing a  fairly intense amount of makeup, but well within current fashion trends of a heavy eye and full-coverage face. I was caught off-guard, and not really prepared to grin and bear a random insult. Without even *thinking,* I said: 

“If I tried a more natural look, then I’d look like you!”

The old lady stammered and turned really red, before ambling out of the store. I felt awful, as soon as the adrenaline of the situation wore away - she insulted my appearance, and I stooped to her level by insulting hers right back at her. She could have had dementia, or simply meant it in good faith - that she liked natural looks, and didn’t like my bright orange and gold cut crease.

Two weeks ago, we got into a fight because he got so depressed he called me a stupid bitch. He often lashes out to push me away, kind of to “test” whether I will stick around. He will apologize in a few hours after he calms down. This time, he didn’t. He loaded a gun and pointed it to his head. I was so terrified I called the police and they put him in a psych ward for two weeks. Yesterday he was released with new medication and therapy plans. 

But I don’t think I can do this anymore if he continues the cycle of testing me. I also don’t think I want to be emotionally invested in someone who will eventually take their own life and leave me by myself. 

So I gave him the ultimatum that he needed to forfeit his gun, be consistent on his medication, and attend his therapy, or I’m gone. He’s too scared of suffering and pain to choose another method besides shooting himself (he’s told me several times) so I told him no more guns.

Truck driver (need to establish this). I arrived at my deliver location 10 hours early for my appointment. The best place I could find to park was a dirt lot next to a Burger King 1 mile away. That night, I go in for my appointment 30 minutes early and got turned away for being late. So I have to wait an additional 24 hours.

I tried to find a hotel, or even a motel nearby but there wasn’t anything. And the place I’m at doesn’t have Uber. So I couldn’t get to a shower. It happens. Showers are more of a privilege than a commodity. Plus I’m overdue for a haircut and it’s getting disheveled as it does when I let it grow out too much like I have done (I plan on getting it cut in a week when I go home). 

I pull up tonight once again 30 minutes early since I parked a mile away. Almost got turned away for being late again. Dispatch said either they take the load this time or they won’t get it at all, so they agree to take it. I spray some deodorant and check in, then dock, and go take a nap while they unload. An hour later I get the call saying paperwork is ready. I go in, and the guy in there said “you do realize this was still technically late?” 
Uhhh no, I was 30 minutes early. 

“30 minutes early to me is still considered late.” 

Well, if I had known that, I would’ve been an hour early.

“It’s not my job to tell you something you should already know.”

Dude, it’s 3 am, I want to get some rest tonight. Just let me sign the paperwork and get on with our lives.

I grab the pen on the table when he said “drivers aren’t allowed to use my pen. Go get your own.” 

Are you serious? I walk out, but not before he shouts “and if you don’t mind go take a damn shower for once.” 

Now I’m fuming. I get my pen and sign the paperwork while listening to him say “late. Unhygienic. Ill prepared. I don’t even know when you’re employed. I would never hire you.” 

Dude, you don’t fucking know me. Just because my first impression isn’t my current best doesn’t give you the right to talk down to me like I’m shit.

“What a piece of shit driver you are,” he said. I grab my paper and walk out. 

So yeah, maybe I was “late” according to his standards. Maybe I was “unhygienic” because I couldn’t get a shower since the day before yesterday and deodorant was the best I could do. And yes, maybe I was “ill-prepared” because my first thought waking from a nap isn’t “better grab my pen because I’m prepared!”

744,not the a-hole,"So for context, I’m spending some time abroad and my days usually consist of walking to the train station to ride to various cities, spending the day exploring, then taking the train back to the house of the family friends I’m staying with. I’m female and I turned 18 fairly recently and I’m traveling alone. Usually on the train to and from wherever I’m going, I just sit quietly by myself and listen to music. Sometimes I’ll fix my hair in the reflection of the window but that’s it. I don’t do anything to attract attention, so I get annoyed when random men start conversations with me. Don’t get me wrong, if someone is just trying to ask the time or what stop the train is at, I’ll gladly answer, but I don’t like having full blown conversations. In addition, I purposely try to make myself less approachable by wearing headphones and not looking anyone in the eye. If someone does start a conversation with me, I don’t have the guts to tell them to leave me alone but I act very vague and dismissive with my responses as well as cut the conversation off as soon as I can. I know that this is typical asshole behavior but I feel justified in doing it because I don’t feel obligated to have conversations with strangers on the train. I’m not antisocial or anything, I love the idea of meeting new people, but it makes me mad when random men on public transit try to start lengthy conversations with me when my actions/body language make it clear I want to be left alone. Also just to clarify, I’m not trying to sound sexist, I would be just as annoyed if a woman did this, but so far I’ve only had this experience with men. 

Edit: I probably should’ve originally given more context in my original post. I was prompted to write this post after I was approached by a man asking me where the train was pulling into, I answered and started to put my headphones back in but he kept making conversation so I was polite and gave short answers while trying to subtly indicate that I didn’t really want to talk. At that point I was a little annoyed, but I became extremely uncomfortable when the train stopped and he followed me out and started asking me personal questions like my name, age, where I was staying, if I ha a boyfriend, etc. Even after I said I had a boyfriend, he ended up following me all the way to my taxi while telling me how much he liked me when he saw me on the train. In my home country, it’s a well known “unspoken rule” that it’s considered creepy to start talking to a woman on public transit with headphones on, especially if you start blatantly hitting on her. Despite cultural differences, I know I had every right to be creeped out when he started following me/asking more personal questions. I made this post because I generally shut down advances from men on public transit. I don’t do it purposely to be mean. I do it to avoid uncomfortable and/or potentially dangerous situations, but there’s no way to convey that to complete strangers, which is why I think it has the potential to be asshole-ish but it also has the potential to be not asshole-ish.

She was the mom that would go through every paper on my desk and go through my phone without telling me to find out about problems I was having with my friends instead of just asking me.

After we came back in off the lake me and a friend of mine who's parents have a place down there too, were riding around on their golf cart and having fun talking.

At this point, I'm driving and we go up a hill, turn around and my friend is driving again. As we turn around and start going back down the hill, the one driving the other cart floors it down the hill behind us and nearly runs us off the road.

753,not the a-hole,"Growing up, I was discouraged from getting my driver's license because neither of my parents wanted me to have independence. I wasn't allowed to go to the DMV until I was 19. Even if I wanted to go on my own, I didn't have anyone to give me a ride other than . my parents. The nearest DMV to my house is very far away, so it would take multiple buses to get there. I never questioned not having my license because I grew up in a sheltered household and always obeyed my parents.

However, as you could imagine, my parents eventually got tired of driving me everywhere. And by everywhere, I mean only school because I don't go out. As soon as I was able to get my permit, they encouraged me to *immediately* take my behind-the-wheel test. I knew this was a bad idea because I did not get nearly as much practice as I needed to pass. My parents were teaching me, but they worked full time so it was difficult to practice daily.

As I said though, I'm very obedient so I made an appointment on the nearest date. Unsurprisingly, I failed. My parents were relentless about it though and pushed me to schedule another one. This cycle continued until I failed 3 times within the span of a few months.

This angered my parents greatly. They yelled at me and called me stupid for not being able to get my license as a 20-year-old. My entire family jumped on the bandwagon so now at every family gathering, I get berated for it. However, the reason why I refuse to believe that I am the asshole in the situation is because I was literally incapable of getting it until I was 19. 

Now, I've gotten a new permit and have been practicing. However, this time around, I *refuse* to take the test until I am 100% sure that I will pass. Not only because it's the safe thing to do, but also because I do not want to give people in my life another chance to say mean and degrading things to me.

I've expressed my struggle with this to my boyfriend, but he agrees with my family and constantly berates me. I told him how much it upsets me and how much obnoxiously reminding me to get my license doesn't speed up the process. I understand that he doesn't want to be the one to drive us everywhere, but I've told him multiple times ""If you do not want to drive me, don't."" I also take a bus to his house and walk the remaining distance in order to see him when he cannot drive.

I say the same thing to everyone else in my life. I don't mind walking or taking the bus, and I have done so on many occasions. I do not feel entitled to being given rides. That being said, I don't know why people can't just shut the fuck up. I know this sounds overdramatic, but I'm a little traumatized after failing 3 times in a row and being called stupid/worthless by my parents for not being able to pass. I have been practicing every chance that I get -- I just do not want to risk failing anymore.

Nowadays whenever someone mentions my license I tell them very angrily to stop pestering me about it. I tell them that it's not encouraging, so they should stop passive-aggressively reminding me as if it does anything to help me because it doesn't. Am I being an asshole?",18,26,0.82

Essentially, my office (very small, around 20 employees) has an admin assistant. Many people order lunch during the week, and she goes to pick it up. She’s paid hourly and also reimbursed for her mileage. I generally only jump on the lunch train with other people and order from the same place so that she doesn’t have to drive somewhere specifically for my food. The only exception to this is Starbucks. When there’s the BOGO after 3 deal, I will order something and then offer her the free drink for making the drive. I’ve done this 3 or so times now and have always given her the free drink. Last week, I was talking with another coworker who apparently had no idea this offer sometimes exists. She asked if I wanted to go halfsies for the next two deals so only one of us had to buy each time and both of us got a coffee. I agreed, but then immediately started to feel bad when said coworker excitedly went to go tell the admin about this great deal and ask her to go pick it up for us. Admin looked kinda disappointed.

766,not the a-hole,"I work a cubicle job that lets me work from home a few times a week. Our apartment is pretty small, my desk is set up in the living room against a wall, so my back faces the room. The couch is about 2 ft from my back. 

I had a meeting this morning. Remote, no video, just audio and someone sharing their screen. I had headphones in. 

I got distracted by my husband fapping behind me. I could hear him- well, I didn’t know what the sound was, but I checked over my shoulder and it was him fapping under a blanket. The sound was distracting the rest of my meeting (even though he was quiet) and I was hurt because I’ve asked him to seek privacy for masturbating a few times. 

After the meeting, I had a half hour break before my next meeting. I was short with him, he asked what was wrong, I expressed that I’d asked him several times not to fap in the same room as me. 

He said it wasn’t fapping because never came (I think this point is pedantry). He said he wants to have the freedom to touch his dick sometimes (I don’t mind that, but for normal stuff like warming your hand and scratching your balls, etc). He wants to know what’s the line for masturbation (I said, the line is when you are sexually stimulating yourself). He said he intended us to have sex after my meeting (I had another meeting afterwards, which he didn’t know, but he could have just asked me and it’s presumptuous to just assume I’ll be available for sex whenever he wants). He said he wasn’t really fapping, just intermittently touching his dick when porn came up in his feed (I saw him jerking it and heard it off-and-on for at least 30 mins). 

I feel that it’s disrespectful for him to masturbate in the same room as me, when I have asked him not to. He feels I’m putting unfair restrictions on him in his own home. 

I’m not asking him not to fap, just to do it in the bedroom. 

I’m not asking him not to look at porn, just to not do it where I can see his screen. 

Normally, if he’s doing something I don’t want to be around, I just remove myself to another room. I don’t want to be the ruler of the living room. But I was in a meeting. 

It upsets me when he looks at porn. I know that it’s okay for him to look at porn, and masturbate. I think masturbating is healthy and I do it too. In private. I know being upset is an unreasonable reaction, and I wish I didn’t care. It’s hypocritical of me. But it hurts my feelings. I just don’t want to see what he’s looking at. Rather than try to curb his porn consumption, I try to limit my awareness of it. Thus, the request that he fap in private and not orient his screen so I can see his porn when he’s casually viewing it most evenings. 

I get that he wants freedom to masturbate and be a sexual person around me. For me, sexuality is something that is more compartmentalized for private time. I think asking him to fap a different room from me is a reasonable request. 

Am I the asshole? 

Tl;dr my husband masturbates in the same room as me. I ask that he masturbate in private, and it upsets me when he doesn’t. He thinks I’m being unduly restrictive, I think I’m not asking too much. ",85,109,0.94

When forced to confess to Jim because she had been caught, girlfriend instead lied to try and lighten the severity of her actions, to the point where we just said fuck it, and sent Jim the proof/whole story ourselves.

Despite a long, difficult relationship of contempt that led up to this, Jim and Girlfriend both don't know how to be alone, and use eachother to avoid that. As a result, Jim has more or less taken her back for this (not official yet, but they are keeping in touch heavily and spending time together every day).

However, my friends and I feel as though he forgave her much too easily, and we do not forgive her ourselves for what she did to our friend. As a result, despite Jim staying with her, the rest of us don't want to spend time with her anymore.

AITA? Should we forgive girlfriend just as easily as Jim, because it's his decision? Or is Jim being too naive? Jim has sent girlfriend the message that she can do this and get away with it, and with how much she lied even after being caught, I have no doubt this isn't the last of it.


Edit: a lot of good feedback that I am grateful for. I realize now that maintaining my friendship is more important than sending her some sort of message.

My tattoos are not objects for public comment."" Now, I understand where these people are coming from, as I'm sure they're used to getting a lot of crap for having *any* tattoos.

776,not the a-hole,"Sorry, bit of a wall of text.

My GF and I are meant to take turns cooking and cleaning. If one cooks, the other does the dishes. The sharing of this work is important to me as we both work and have little free time at the end of the day.

Sometimes on the days I cook my GF says she feels sick or anxious and goes to bed after eating, leaving me with the dishes. I (think) I've cottoned on to the fact that the illness or anxiety seems to happen right after dinner, when she's supposed to clean up.

Tonight the same thing happened and I felt resentful. She went to bed with that I honestly feel was self induced panic attack-like symptoms, and I cleaned up. During washing up I opened up some tupperwear that had apparently been in her bag for ages and was hit by a putrid smell (rotting cheese). I had to run to the kitchen window and vomitted out into the garden. 

Hearing me gagging she poked her head out of the bedroom and asked what was wrong. I said ""What the hell was in that! It smells fucking awful"". She didn't say anything and went back into the bedroom. I sprayed airfreshner over the dishes and continued cleaning. After I had finished she came out of the bedroom and could tell I was a little miffed. She asked what was wrong and I said it didn't matter and went back to what I was doing.

She pressed the issue so I said ""Well, I knew you were going to get sick when I started cooking tonight. It upset me a little, but I'm ok now, can we just drop it?"". She got really upset: ""What? You're a clairvoyant now? If I treated you the same way you treated me around this sort of health stuff you wouldn't be happy!""

I kept insisting ""Look, lets just drop it. I don't know why you asked me if you get upset when I answer honestly"". She replied ""No. We can't drop this. You can't say these sorts of things."" She then proceeded to move towards the front door and I asked where she was going. She replied ""I'm going out. I don't feel safe here"".

I was pretty taken aback, so I said ""What? Around me? That's really a really hurtful thing to say"" (At this point I hasten to add that I never have been aggressive or violent against anyone, ever), She said: ""Yeah, it's always about you isn't it!"".

I this point I was getting pretty upset so I said ""OK, if you feel that way you stay here and I'll go. I'll go out for a drive for a while"". Her reply was ""No. You just don't get it do you?"" Me: ""I don't know what to do - you don't want to be around me, so I'm leaving. I thought this was what you wanted."" Her reply again ""Yeah, that's it - you just don't get it.""

I went to leave, but as I was getting my things she sort of signed and said ""Look. Let's just drop it. I'm sorry.""

We hugged and I too, said that I was sorry. But I don't feel I should be. I feel I was in my right to feel resentful, to voice my feeling clearly and calmly when asked, to say I wanted to drop the topic several times and to offer to leave when things got too much.

Now, I just want to add a note about this anxiety thing. She has anxiety issues. And I know how they feel because I have them too (in fact, I also have PTSD). However, my anxiety has never stopped me from working, coming home, eating dinner, watching Netflix, only to then kick in just as it's my turn to do some cleaning with such consistency.

I understand that - like being gay - this is something people cannot control, it is what they feel they truly are inside. My daughter says that gender is on a spectrum. 


While I am glad my daughter isn't planning on having any operations, throughout her upbringing, I have never seen any sign that she was different from a typical female child. She would play with ponies and dolls, while my son would play with dinosaurs. They both played with lego. She has never shown any masculine traits until very recently, where she has cut her hair short and sometimes wears men's clothes. 


I do not doubt that gender exists on a spectrum. Different people have different hormone levels, and some women are more feminine than others. Perhaps my daughter is somewhere closer to the middle on this spectrum. What I don't understand is - what's the point? I remember when boyish girls were simply called tomboys, and they wouldn't mind being referred to as 'she'. What's wrong with just cutting your hair and wearing jeans? What's the point in asking everyone to change the way they talk to you?


And can I still call her my daughter? Or is she now simply my child? Can I call her pretty, or is she now handsome? Or maybe she's pretty when she's in a dress and handsome when wearing jeans. 


I understand how frustrating it is for teenagers to feel like their parents don't understand them, and that to be told they are going through a phase, but is that not exactly what this is? I seroously doubt they will still be asking people to refer to them as 'they' when they are my age. When I was a kid I bought a scooter and my mum hated it. Is this just the new way of rebelling against your parents? And is it not my job as a parent to be against this rebellion, whatever it is? 


I just feel like my daughter is getting distracted by all these silly ideas when there are more important things to care about. She is young and has so much time to enjoy life and the freedoms that come with youth. I don't think it's healthy to reinforce these ideas by calling them 'they'. 


Maybe I should buy her a scooter.


EDIT:


OK guys thanks for all your advice, you really helped me see the bigger picture, and I can see how my attitude before was not helping anybody. Me and my wife had another talk with our child and I made my apologies to them. They said they knew I would probably find it hard to understand and they were right! And they don't mind if I slip up every now and then and use the wrong pronoun. 


It's almost like nothing ever happened. It seems such a ridiculous thing to have got worked up over now, but we are all happy, and my wife and I still have a beautiful child that we will always support. I'm still not sure I understand what it means to be non binary, but I understand it means a lot to my child, and that is enough for us both. I'm sure I will understand it more as time goes on, as my child will understand themselves more with their parents' support. Thankfully they have never had suicidal thoughts. 


It's easy to think that the point of parenting is to educate, but sometimes the point is to listen and to learn. As Dumbledore once put it, 'Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth.'


But I'm ready to listen and ready to learn, and I'm sure one day I'll understand hip hop.",892,2297,0.94
781,not the a-hole,"I work as a delivery driver for a place that only recently started delivering. Over the summer they had built up a handful of drivers and were able to rotate through fairly consistently, but now most of those kids are going back to school. There is now only two drivers, me and a guy.

It's a minimum wage job. In the cafe I get 8.60 an hour, and when I'm driving its 5, while hoping for tips. And now since they're understaffed I'm working most days 11-8 by myself. 

It's becoming too much for me. There's too much pressure in my opinion for the amount I get paid. There are 2 jobs I've been encouraged to apply for that pay more and are less grueling, as well as better fit in my skillset.

I told her she shouldn’t be doing  that kind of stuff and then she started yelling at me because of it and she got to the point where she said she was going to the same thing with me and I told her “we’ll see” that’s the moment she exploded and yelled at me even more, I stopped listening to her because it has always been that way, I can’t have a civilized conversation like I have with my biological father (I am currently living with my stepdad, I can’t talk to him either because he would always support my mother) because she always thinks I say things in a bad mood or I just want to bother her.
Another thing that worries me is that when she hits my sister, 30 or 40 minutes later she starts regretting it and in a very calm voice says something like “I’ll never hit her again”, should I be worried about this kind of attitude coming from an adult?",19,52,0.94

We had this day planned for a few weeks but unfortunately two days before the visit I get a surprise call from my aunt who was visiting town from South America on the same day as my friends arrival. Being family and being an extremely rare visitation I was obligated to spend some time with my aunt. I asked my friend if it was possible if I could spend the morning/early afternoon  with her and her family and then they would have to excuse me while I took my aunt out to dinner or invited her to my place for dinner. They originally planned to be there at 9 am till 6 pm I asked to be excused at 4 pm.  My friend requested that she and her family be allowed to join me and my aunt (who doesn’t speak a word of English) for dinner. I politely refused as I felt that would be uncomfortable for my aunt. My friend was worried that her daughter will fall asleep in the car on the way home if she left early afternoon and it would be difficult to put her to bed later on in the night. I asked my friend if it was all possible that they continue their trip without me (from 4 pm onward) enjoying the sights of my city without me and they could go home at their leisure. My friend then requested that they be allowed to hang out at my place to entertain their child while I was out with my aunt. I again refused as I wanted my space free in case my aunt was too tired to go out and wanted to stay in. My friend cancelled the entire trip as she wanted to ensure her child had naps at the appropriate time.

He says he has it but he is tired of me ‘throwing it up in his face’ that I haven’t received it yet.  Mind you the days leading up to my birthday he kept talking about it as if he was going to do something spectacular then my birthday comes and he does nothing.  Not even a phone call.  I ended up calling him to find out what the deal was he said he forgot due to having been at work all day.  Said he would make it up to me but never did.  

Edit/ Update: Thanks for all the responses. I just want to say this has been a pattern- not a one -off incident- of how things have been during the 8 months we have been seeing each other.  But this one hurt the most.  I have never been with anyone who has treated me this way before and I think the reason I took it for so long is mainly due to disbelief of this happening to me when I don't feel I did anything for him to act like this.  

He gets very upset any time I bring up anything he does, always flips the script trying to somehow make things my fault and then if that doesn't work he will apologize.  But then he will turn around and do the exact same thing days or weeks later as if we never had a conversation about it and the same cycle repeats itself. 
 He's ten years older than me (I'm 30ish) and from the outside looking in he appeared to be a very stable and responsible guy.  But I am tired of the mind games I have endured with him this year.  So yes I will be strong and move on for good this time.",126,581,0.97

787,not the a-hole,"My bf and I have been together for nearly 4 years. The relationship is as perfect as one could get, except a little hang-up about his grandmother. 

His grandmother has lupus, and she lives 3 hours away from us. His grandmother and I have tried to get along, but I’m not really crazy about her because she’s very opinionated and very loud/belligerent. Her opinions on things have angered me to the point of wanting to throw her through a window, but for the sake of my boyfriend, I kept being friendly to her because she’s one of his only family members left. I even added her on Facebook so she could stay updated on stuff with my BF (since he doesn’t have a Facebook). 

A few months ago she decided to move to the other side of the city. She hired movers to get a lot of the furniture but a lot of stuff was still left behind. So my bf and I agreed to drive down to help her out. We got to her house and there was still heavy furnature left, so my bf and I helped move the rest of her stuff. We even helped clean up a bit — which all lasted several hours. We got back to her house, unloaded all of the heavy furnature and helped sort some stuff out.

I went to the living room and sat on the couch to go on Reddit so I could cool down (it was 105 that day). After taking a break, his Grandmom wanted us to keep helping her sort things out. I ended up falling asleep instead. When I woke up, the boyfriend was still helping her sort things out while his Grandmom was complaining that I wasn’t helping. She proceeded to call me lazy and continued to run me down to the bf, including calling me ungrateful. So I got up and went to bed, because in the moment, I was angry and was about to let her have it. 

The next day we woke up and got ready to leave. We both took off work two days to help her move, and we couldn’t afford to miss more work. On our way out, she gave my bf $50.00 and said that he deserved it for all of his hard work, while ignoring me. When we left, she didn’t even say bye when I did. So on our way home, I deleted her off Facebook.

When we got home, the bf got a call from Grandmom and complained that I was disrespectful to her by deleting her off Facebook. My boyfriend then got on to me for not wanting to get along with his Grandmom, and said that I needed to try harder. And when I refused to go back to his Grandmom’s house to help her finish organizing her belongings, he said that I’m creating a divide in his family.

On that same trip, my wife's mom invited themselves to our place for Thanksgiving this year. ""I think it's your turn to host us."" I said that sounded like fun. (It did and does.) ""But,"" she said, ""You'll be cooking us a turkey."" I sort of laughed and said, well, no. It became an **issue**. We argued. I said that we would make such a wonderful dinner and they would have such a nice time that they wouldn't even miss the turkey. She said that we were being selfish.

Now that Thanksgiving is approaching, I feel pressure to just make the damn turkey so it doesn't come up. But I feel as though if we're hosting them and preparing the food (and only have one oven!), we shouldn't be obligated to spend half a day cooking something to which we have a moral objection and will not eat ourselves.

But maybe I should just let it go, be a good host, and give them what they expect on the holiday.

Am I the asshole?

EDIT: For what it's worth, I kind of prefer to host. They live several states away and the hassle and cost of traveling is much higher than hosting (for me). So while it was a little odd to have her invite herself over, I don't at all object to hosting them.

Then I asked ""are you not going to answer?"" No reply.

I decided to stay quite and looked out the window. After a few minutes of silence he talks. He asks me ""how's work?"" I replied ""same as usual nothing new"" and asked him about his day at work. He replied and told me the things he did today. I replied with ""that's interesting."" 

There was silence for about 5 minutes. 

The he asks ""are you going to talk?"" I reply ""what to you want me to say? I am mad at you because you didn't give me a kiss."" He replied ""you're going to pick up a fight over this?""

I replied ""all I wanted was a kiss from my boyfriend, you're such an asshole."" I got of the car and went inside.

After a few minutes he texts me and says come outside, so I did. I walk up to his car and we get into this huge fight. Nothing got fixed. He later asks me ""are you going to apologize?"" and I reply ""for what? for wanting to kiss my boyfriend? No. I'm not apologizing"" then he says ""okay, apologize for picking up a fight for no reason."" And I told him ""No. I'm not apologizing because I don't feel like I have done something wrong.

I’ve been doing interviews all week and I have a woman coming in tomorrow who I just realized was my high school ‘bully’ for lack of a better term. She has a different last name now so when I called her for an interview I didn’t realize who she was, and I only used my first name when I called her to set it up. I have been looking potential candidates up on LinkedIn and Facebook and when I found her profile I instantly recognized her. 

I was a year older than all the people in my grade because I started kindergarten late, not because I got held back or anything, but this girl told everyone it was because I was stupid and couldn’t pass my classes. She would also make fun of my hair and clothes and say I was going to die a virgin and stuff like that, and that my only friends were the anime characters I would draw (ok I did have a little bit of an anime phase but I didn’t like go over the top and do the Naruto run or anything and I got over it pretty quick, I just appreciated the artwork and still do). She also interrupted me while I was asking a girl to the prom and told her she could do better. Just dumb shit like that. 

It didn’t scar me for life or anything but she definitely made me feel like shit about myself a lot of the time and luckily I pretty much forgot about her once we all graduated and went off to college. I know she might have changed but I just don’t see myself working with and managing someone who was so rude to me all the time. 

And as tempting as it would be to have her come in and lord it over her during the interview that I’m not gonna hire her, I won’t do that because that’s petty and unprofessional.

After negotiating with her, I have changed the passcode on my phone so she can't access it. Part of this problem was that I was too scared to speak up about this all along, but now I know it's reasonable to do so.

Also, since a few comments asked, I am 15 years old. My post was slightly satirical of my compliance to my mom, so that's why it seems like it's written by a parent.**

**TL;DR-Mom is very invested in my social life to the point of going through my phone constantly and telling me what to say to my friends. As a result, I lie to her a lot and I fear it's getting out of hand.**

My mother goes through my phone, my text messages, emails, everything. I know she does it because she loves me and wants to protect me, but I can't help but feel a bit annoyed.

I've talked to her about how I'm uncomfortable with this, but she always replies with 'Your friends' parents do this too', which is probably true. She says the only reason I'd want privacy is because I have things to hide, which is also true.

I wouldn't mind too much if she just read my texts. What annoys me is the constant over-analyzing of what my friends say. If one of my friends sends an emoticon, for example, my mum will read really deep into it-'That face looks mocking. They're making fun of you.' She constantly misinterprets jokes and sarcasm. I've tried to communicate this to her numerous times, but she just says I'm too naive(she's not wrong though, I always tend to think the best of people). 

She often tells me what to send back to my friends. I have to send what she wants me to, or I'll get yelled at for being socially incompetent. She always feels guilty and says sorry for it afterwards though, so I forgive her.

I, on the other hand, treat her awfully when she goes through my phone. I get mad and sometimes yell at her. I try my best to never be angry at people (since I dislike it when people lose their temper), so this is really childish and hypocritical of me.

She just wants me to become a better person socially and I admit I do send a lot of dumb stuff if she doesn't tell me what to write. But overall, I feel like this social dependency is only going to become harmful for both me and her. 

It's humiliating when she takes my phone to search through it-like I have no personal agency. But I also seem to have no limits when it comes to lying to her now-I'll lie about my daily life for *my* benefit, to get out of trouble or to avoid her freaking out about small things.

Well last week our internet line got hit by a tall bus since it just hangs over the street. It's been 10 days and no ones come to fix it and its knocked out everything for most people who live on the street. They have a telephone hotline but to save money it's now completely automated and you can only file one repair claim per account. Follow ups aren't permitted. So we visited the office last week - no luck. So we go again today but this time I was fed up. As we were waiting for them to call us I notice a sticky note with ALL of the wifi info on it. Just out in the open. I'm not a mastermind when it comes to this stuff but I know my shit. I notice they have 3 wifi routers in the building so I decide to log into my VPN on my phone and connect to their fiber line (the fastest).

Originally I just wanted internet so it would be less boring while I wait but after our number got called and they basically told us to fuck off I was done. I was so fucking tired of their shit. So I log into their routers console and change the password to a randomly generated one and change the wifi name to ""FixMyWifiAndIFixYours""

Now I only bricked their fastest wifi (the same kind we have) they have 2 slower connections still to help others but now they cant use their fiber. It's a small thing but I watched them all scratch their heads and switch to the slower connection as I walked out.

Anyway. We just got a call and we have a repair man on the way. Once he fixes our line I'll go restore their settings.

Her confidence, her positivity, her motivation. It wasn’t just the weight, it was everything that came from it.

Her best friend was personal trainer who gave her free PT sessions, free meals plans, everything so she had all the tools at her disposal and was better placed than anyone I knew to lose weight and keep it off. 

It came down to this; She wouldn’t look after herself. She wasn't willing to do anything about it and that was the biggest burden. I felt like I was walking on eggshells. I tried talking to her, but it was always construed that I was being unreasonable or deliberately trying to hurt or upset her and make her feel bad. 

Every time I broached the subject I was met with denial and anger. I would always apologise because I felt awful for making her feel bad.

Tried motivating her, I got a gym membership, went with her and followed her many diet plans. It very quickly became that I was going by myself and coming home to her on the sofa eating something unhealthy. 

I was going to gym so much because I didn’t want to be at home sitting next to this miserable person who I was expected never to criticise and be ok with it. I was physical repulsed to touch her. We had sex maybe twice in that final year. 

Her parents tried too, cooking very healthy meals when we would visit them, cutting all sugary treats out of the house, even when she wasn't there. But everyday she'd want a take-away or something unhealthy and guilt trip me into getting it. 

When I said, “You get what you want, I’m having a salad”, I was the bad guy because I wasn't being ""fat"" with her.

Tomorrow never came, ever. She would always be saying “As of Monday I’m really going to try, but for the weekend let me enjoy myself.” That became every weekend and when Monday came it was “I’ve had an awful day at work, I want to curl up with pizza and TV.” Got to the stage where she would say “I know I say this all the time, but THIS time, it’ll be different. THIS time I’m going to try”, but she wouldn’t. Skipping the gym because she felt “sick” or “wasn’t in the mood” or “I’ll double up tomorrow.” 

I stopped believing her, but still if I saw her making ANY effort, I praised and supported her. It was always short-lived. 

Here’s the caveat, in an attempt to make her take the issue seriously after months and months of trying to talk to her and getting rebuked and maybe get her to appreciate how I felt I told her it had crossed my mind to break up with her, that I really wasn’t happy, but that I was willing to work on our relationship and do what I could to make it better. 

In hindsight, not my best move but honest to god I didn’t know how to get through to her.

It all unravelled after we came home from visiting my parents a couple of weeks later, she was moaning about wanting something to eat for the plane and asked me to get her something from the vending machine, I refused. 
She’s got her own money and the machine was about 10 steps away, considering we’d had a large breakfast about an hour ago. (we’re about to starting boarding and its a 20 min plane trip) 

She goes off, really overreacted and when her parents picked us up at the other end started chewing me out in front of them. It was at this point I realised I just didn’t care anymore. I didn’t care what her parents thought of me or how upset I’d made her.

After everything I did to help I wasn’t even allowed to say no to her when she wanted me to get her food. They say the opposite of love isn’t hate its indifference and that was what I felt at that moment. 

We get home and long story short, words were exchange and she smacked me upside the head. Didn’t hurt but hard enough to knock my glasses off. That was the final straw. 

We broke up that night and I moved out that week, got my own place and a new job so I’m doing great. 

Looking back all I can say is she wasn’t fulfilling a need for me and I obviously wasn’t fulfilling a need for her either. Any Qs fire away. 

Edit: Formatting like an adult

Update: Thanks for the feedback everyone, appreciate your honesty. Going to reach out to her, see how she’s doing. Some of you have said she was suffering from depression and subsequent weight gain was the symptom of it. While I agree I also think it was the thing holding her back and had she lost the weight she would have felt better, one affected the other kinda thing. Obviously I’m inherently biased toward myself, think I lost my critical eye as I wrote it. I wasn’t an easy guy to live with and certainly had my own issues/stuff going on. 
Main reason I posted is because none of our mutual friends reached out to me afterwards so that was a big red flag that I was in the wrong but you guys have helped me get some closure so thank you x",141,1340,0.96
809,not the a-hole,"I (26F) currently live with my boyfriend (31M) of 6 years.  My entire life revolves around him, my job, and my family.  I live ~6 hours from my family, and I try to make trips back home to visit when I get a chance, because I never know how long it will be before I get to come back again.  Also, my grandparents are not in good health, and one of them probably has less than three months left.  I also have a significantly younger sibling who I love to spend time with.

Every time I go home to visit, my boyfriend turns in to this pouty, whiney, passive aggressive, insufferably moody teenager.  It's to the point that it feels like he is actively attempting to sabotage my visit and make sure I can't enjoy it.  He calls me and will be pouting so hard that he talks like he's just woken up and sounds groggy, and he mumbles so bad I can't understand him.  It's like he wants me to feel guilty for visiting my family instead of spending time with him, even though I live with him and spend far more time with him than my parents and grandparents.

To clarify, I literally do NOTHING when I am home besides spend time with my family.  I don't go out, I don't meet up with friends, I don't even go to the grocery store.  I stay at my parents, and I go to my grandparents a couple times.  It's not like I'm having some wild, week long party.

I get it, you miss me, I miss you.  But, you are a 30 year old man, and you can survive on your own.  And, if you can't, can you at least have the decency to pretend like you're fine so you don't put a damper on my family time?   I've tried to address this with him, and I just get sarcastic responses.  ""Wowwww."" ""COOL."" ""Lol, alright.""

810,not the a-hole,"So let me start by saying my dad posted something on here asking if he was the asshole for the way he was parenting me.

For those of you that didn't see the post it sort of went like this: My daughter is 18 and her curfew is 7pm. She's a straight A student whos never done bad things, but I forbid her from staying the night with her boyfriend.

I saw the post and obviously knew it was him. I showed him this app ffs and this subreddit. I showed him how many people were calling him an asshole. His response? He deleted the post and yelled at me because ""those people are morons"". He told me I was grounded and could not leave the house for months.

He forgot to add that my boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years. He always comes over and helps my dad with yard work and stuff. He has no reason to dislike my boyfriend. A lot of you commented on the post saying ""they probably already had sex, spending the night won't prevent it"". I would like to add that I am still a virgin, that doesn't matter though. I'm 18, my father has made me feel like sex is shameful and I'm starting to understand that it's completely normal at my age.

Anyways I'm packing my things and I'm moving in with my boyfriend tomorrow. I never wanted to be the girl that moved in with her boyfriend at 18 but my dad is giving me no choice. I guess I feel like an asshole for moving out but he won't listen to me. If anyone read his post and now sees this I would love to hear your input.

811,not the a-hole,"We had a 3 day weekend vacation planned in a couple of weeks. We didn't book any hotel room but I did book it off work.

Since Early July my girlfriend committed to a project at work that would keep her at work extra during the last 2 weeks of August. She changed her mind and all she had to do was tell her boss so that they wouldn't schedule her.

I told her (even before we book this trip) to let her boss know well in advance so that we could plan out our trip and she could have a regular work schedule. This was in July.

Fast forward to this week. She still hasn't done it. I booked off the weekend (24th of August) as she insisted that she'd still be able to get it off. I found out today that she just talked to her boss today. Literally the day before the project. She waited over a month to tell her boss. Now she can't get the days off.

I'm pissed because I warned her and she procrastinated. I'm also losing 3 days of work and I was looking forward to our trip. She says she's very sorry and will beg her boss to get some time off.

817,not the a-hole,"So my mom has had this tattoo planned for ages. Basically it's a tattoo of my name and it has a butterfly because of the butterfly project and the logo of a band I liked when I was 13. Her story is that those were the things that made me stop self harming and she thinks this band like kept me alive or something. The issue is that it's from her perspective and is not at all the truth. She still sees it as butterflies and a band I once liked when in reality it was a lot of therapy, hard work, and learning to use art as a coping mechanism. 

Over Easter she was talking to my grandmother and I about it and she was getting a lot of things wrong and diving in way too deep to a sensitive subject in front of someone I wasn't comfortable discussing it with. I tried asking her to stop and she acted offended and continued. I then tried to tell her that her recounting of events wasn't the right one and she tried convincing me otherwise.

She's going to get questions about this tattoo and she's going to tell everyone a skewed representation of my truth. She already has a habit of oversharing despite promising me time and time again that she doesn't. It has affected the way people see me and I've spent so much time trying to set it straight. 

Would I be the asshole if I tell her I don't want her to get it? It means a lot to her I just can't bear the thought of her continuing to walk around and telling all these incorrect personal details of my life. What if I suggested she make corrections to it? I've been trying to bring this up for months and I just can't seem to do it. 

Edit: So she kinda brought up tattoos when I saw her last and I asked if she knew what she wanted to get and she said she wasn't quite sure. I explained why I wasn't comfortable with that one and she totally understood and we pondered new ideas. 

Edit: Also looking back I think the reason she reacted badly the first time had to do with the fact that we were talking about it with my tattoo-hating grandmother who already has a negative view of my mom and I (that's another story for another day lmao). My grandma reacts badly when my mom and I have any disagreements because she thinks they all have to do with my mom walking out on us.

830,not the a-hole,"Basically, I'm going on a long trip with my boyfriend Ben starting this week, and I'm throwing a party so we can see all our friends before we head out. It's kind of a big deal because it's the only time our friend group of 6+ years has all been in one place for a long time, and this genuinely might be the last time we're all together for a while, since my boyfriend and I are moving shortly after the trip.

The party is at my house, and it's going to be a board game and grilled cheese party, since our friend group is largely comprised of nerdy introverts. One friend, Rita, who I'm a bit less close with than the others and who is a decided extrovert, asked me if she could bring a friend, Jacob, who was staying with her for the weekend to the party. We don't know Jacob at all, and honestly I thought it would be pretty awkward for him because we have a ton of inside jokes and made-up party games, not to mention we're all pretty shy. Personally, since it's my house and I have some anxiety issues, I really did not want a stranger to come since I knew I wouldn't be able to relax the whole time if that were the case, and I really want to enjoy it. An additional factor is that Rita only asked tonight, the night before the party, and Ben and I had already finished preparing for a big surprise game for all our friends that adding someone else to would be a huge inconvenience.

I told Rita that I'd prefer for the party to be close friends only since it might be the last time Ben and I see everyone for a really long time. Her response seemed mad, and now I'm second-guessing whether it was okay for me to say no. I used to have a really hard time saying no to anyone but have recently been working on asserting myself and my own interests more, which is why it's a bit hard for me to know whether or not this was a dick move since I'm not used to it!

TL;DR - I'm having a party for close friends, and my friend asked if she could bring someone. I said no because we're introverted and inside jokey, and I want to be able to relax a bit.",48,44,0.92

832,sensitive,"Hello everyone, welcome to my own personal high school drama at an age that's well beyond high school.  This may get long as I'm going to try to include as much information as possible, as objectively as possible, because I truly want to know if I'm the asshole here so I can put this issue to bed in my mind.

To set the stage: this story involves me, a female, my male roommate who we will call Steve, and our mutual female friend Alyssa.  Alyssa lives a block away from us and when I moved to this house in January, we started doing a weekly hang out centered around a pub event at the end of our street.  Since then, her and I have gotten quite close.  Sometimes Steve would join us at the pub, but every week like clockwork Alyssa and I would go, barring prior commitments or work schedules preventing us from doing so.  We shared a lot of heavy, personal stuff in this time.  Steve and Alyssa have known each other a bit longer than I've known the two of them, and they've always gotten along, but never really hung out much just them.  They've gotten into really heated debates that have left them angry at each other (moreso for Alyssa than Steve) for days afterwards, since they're both quite passionate people.

This issue began a few weeks ago.  All of a sudden, Alyssa and Steve started hanging out just the two of them.  I have no problem at all with this!  However, when we would hang out all together, I started to feel very alienated and excluded; it was suddenly hard for me to get a word in edgewise between them talking so much directly to each other, and they would talk a lot about things in common they shared that I simply can't relate to.  This is where me being an asshole comes in.  Since I was feeling so third-wheeled constantly, my attitude went sour and I can confidently say I was not a lot of fun for them to hang out with.  This included me clearly communicating to them, in tears, that I didn't understand what had changed, but instead of feeling like the three of us were all hanging out together like we had in the past, it felt like I was intruding on their private hang out.  They did try to make me feel better, but it came with a lot of ""we"" and ""us"" statements (them, not including me).

At this time, they also got really into a video game that I'm not very good at/have very little interest in playing.  They did their best to include me when they were doing this but their attitudes had changed into suddenly being very obnoxious and almost... jock-like?  Which had never happened before.  So I didn't particularly want to be around that kind of energy, because despite being an extrovert, I don't really care for loud, off-colour conversations and harsh ribbing.  Another facet of the video game thing is that in my house, I have sort of my ""sanity corner"" that has my TV, laptop, desktop, and my comfy couch.  Steve doesn't have a TV, so they would play this game on mine.  Since I was so uncomfortable being there when they were playing, and they would start playing without really warning me, I'd move to my bedroom, which is not a natural state for me (I've never been a ""chill in my room"" type person).  This led to me feeling even more isolated and pushed out.

After an awkward night when we were all drinking in my sanity corner and they tried to get me out of my bad attitude/negativity funk by inviting me to play and come sit with them, Steve sat me down the following day to talk.  He told me that Alyssa had felt chased out of the house by my bad vibes and that both of them were getting frustrated with how negative I had been lately.  This conversation was, again, riddled with ""we"" and ""us"" statements that made me feel isolated all over again.  I took this opportunity to do some introspection and bounce some ideas off Steve, coming to the conclusion that I was feeling jealous and replaced because Alyssa and I had been closer before and now I felt like I didn't even know her anymore.  I took a step back and realized that I'm responsible for my own feelings and actions, and sincerely apologized to Steve, with plans to do the same with Alyssa the next time I saw her.  Steve asked what they can do to help this situation, suggesting that he could let me know in advance when Alyssa was coming over to hang out specifically with him (because some of this issue was caused by the grey area of them hanging out in our mutual space, but not really wanting me there), or hanging out at Alyssa's place instead of ours when they wanted to hang out just the two of them.  I told him that he should feel free to use shared space at our house, but maybe a warning would be nice.

That evening, Steve informed me Alyssa was coming over to play the video game.  I went to hang out in my room so I wouldn't be bothering/bothered by them.  When Alyssa came over, she knocked on my door and we had a talk where I apologized for being so awful the past couple of weeks, and explained how I had been feeling.  Alyssa told me that I didn't have anything to apologize for, and I didn't need to make up for anything.  She told me that her and Steve just really understand each other and they like to do things like play \*video game\* and that I like to do things outside like go to the beach, and they like to be inside.  She said that we could have the weekly pub event just be our thing for the two of us (which I protested, because the last thing I want to do after all this is exclude Steve), or that we would just have to find other things that we could do together.  I found this strange because we had never HAD TO have something to do to hang out before; sometimes we would sit and talk for a few hours.  It didn't seem to be centered around any activity.  She left to go play \*video game\* with Steve and I sat in my room reading and hearing them joke and laugh until I put on headphones.

The next day, I had a long and thoughtful conversation with myself and decided to ask Steve if it would be okay if when he and Alyssa wanted to hang out exclusively, they did go to her apartment a block away like he had suggested before.  He agreed.

The day after that, Alyssa had deleted me on Facebook and Instagram.  I was confused (mainly because I have people I haven't spoken to in 10 years on Facebook and I feel like it has to be a pretty deliberate process to delete someone) but didn't bring it up to Steve or anyone other than a friend who is completely uninvolved in this situation.  That evening, Alyssa and Steve came to our place for Alyssa to pick up something she had left here, and I greeted them when they came in the door.  Only Steve responded, and for the short duration of her visit, Alyssa did not acknowledge my existence.  My relationship with Steve is normal, but I haven't heard from Alyssa, and have not reached out to her myself.  After all of this, I'm of the mind that I don't really want to at all.  I kind of want to just put it all behind me.

Anyway, the loss (?) of this friendship has been saddening to me, and confusing because I'm not sure what exactly happened with Alyssa.  Mainly I just want to know if I'm the total asshole in this situation.  I tried to tell this (LONG ASS, NOVELESQUE, AND TRITE) story as objectively as possible and with all the details.  If you made it through this novella, thank you for your time.

So, AITA?

ETA: Since there seems to be a little confusion about whether there's romantic vibes between Alyssa and Steve, and the amount of time we've all known each other: Alyssa has a really nice boyfriend and we've all hung out together many times, and I've known both Steve and Alyssa for a few years longer than I've lived in my house.  I've probably known them for three+ years or so (Alyssa and I both had LTRs with a pair of brothers at the same time who are both friends with Steve \[I met Steve and Alyssa through my ex\]) and they've known each other a while longer.  Steve and I have only been living together since January.",55,61,0.88

This sort of thing - leaving your family for a white non muslim/being an atheist is pretty much the worst thing I could do. Someone last year in the community did the same thing and my family went on about how awful, disgusting and trashy it was and how miserable she'd made her family.

836,not the a-hole,"Long story short, I am half black. I know the history behind the flag and it offends me. However I understand it is your right to wave whatever flag you want, but it is my right to be able to call you an asshole and disassociate myself with them. My fiance just received a Confederate flag from his brother. He wants to hang it up, but I told him hell no. It is either me or the flag. He says it is part of his history and I shouldn't be offended. Is it an asshole move to put an ultimatum like that, saying it is me or the flag? Second: is there any way I can show him how damaging that flag is to people?

Update: We talked and he is keeping the flag. It is one of the things his brother gave him and he wants to keep it. He is not flying it and it will stay locked away in a chest. He has been receptive to talking about what it means and we both agree what it stands for is wrong. ",283,664,0.93

My bf (who mounted the other 2 TVs in our apartment) was too lazy to mount this one and it’s been sitting like this for 9 months. We are about to move again, so he doesn’t want to mount it....understandable. I asked if he could at least help be find the base of the TV so we could put it on a table so that it’s be more sturdy. I’m afraid my niece—who began to walk a few months ago—will mess with the tv and it will fall on her. I voiced my concern to him. His response was “well she needs to watch her fucking kid”. I was pissed about his response (last night) and I’m still pissed now. Of course my brother and SIL (apparently my bf thinks it’s only *her* job to watch the baby) are going to watch her, but I know how toddlers are! It takes 2 seconds for them to get into something.

840,not the a-hole,"I’m really torn here. It’s long, but bear with me. I’ll put a TL;DR at the bottom. 

I’ve got a long term friend (nearly 20 years of friendship) who I’ve just ceased to understand. I don’t agree with a major life choice of her, but more than that I don’t agree with how it’s effecting everyone around her. 

About ten years ago she got married and immediately got pregnant, like on the honeymoon pregnant. We were all thrilled for her since she has always wanted a family and she and hubby seriously had their first kiss at the alter. 

Unfortunately, like many women she had a miscarriage. We all gather around her and she grieved hard. She soon got pregnant again! Yay! And then again. She had two healthy babies in a year. Birth was hard on her so the doc told her to hold off on the next kid for a couple of years to let her body heal. They waited just a year and then had another. Fine. Kinda dumb to ignore the doc, but everyone was healthy. That’s when she announced they were a part of the “quiver-full movement.” Basically they believe God will give them as many as He wants and they won’t stop it. 

At this point I think she’s a bit crazy, but she’s my best friend so I helped organize a “baby shower” where we helped convert their garage into a master bedroom so they had more living space for their (obviously) growing family. 

Not long after she tells me privately she is struggling with PPD. I help her get in support groups and such but she stops going and refuses help. I stay in contact but we drift apart. I feel bad about it. 

About 18 months later I find out she gave birth to another baby. She told no one outside of family she was even pregnant. He’s perfect, but she doesn’t let anyone see him. She starts talking about angels protecting him. Alarm bells go off in my head but she doesn’t want help or advise. She starts talking about demons in her home. She starts leaving baby alone because the angels are watching him. Obviously her husband is alarmed and has her evaluated at a mental health place. Idk what she told them but They commit her on an emergency hold. CPS gets involved. Her husband almost loses custody of his own kids. Community is in a panic. We all volunteer for “shifts” to watch the kids, cook meals, etc. we do this for 6 months because CPS won’t let her be alone with the kids. It was horrible for everyone. Finally it all levels out and she seems fine again. 

But now she just announced she is pregnant again. This is six pregnancies in 9 years. And for the life of me I can’t be excited for her. I’m just sad. I get she has her beliefs, but NFP exists and it seems like she can’t handle anymore kids right now. If she snaps again, WIBTA for not involving myself? 

TL;DR Best friend is pregnant again against doctors orders after an episode of Post Partum Psychosis and I don’t have the energy to commit to helping her if it happens again. ",67,213,0.95
841,not the a-hole,"Ok, on mobile so forgive me for formatting and spelling issues. Also this is my side piece account, not my main.



I live at a gated apartment complex. Or well, it is /supposed/ to be gated. Of the six months I've lived here, the gate has worked a total of two weeks, and stands lamely open and useless most of the time. The first time they fixed it, someone tried to tailgate another person into the gate instead of waiting their turn, hit the gate and broke it again. Like legit, it's a sore spot in the community. It's even mentioned in the Google reviews of the complex. It's that bad.



Additionally, there have been five car break-ins in the past two weeks at the complex. The leasing office has sent us numerous emails about locking our cars, not leaving anything in them, etc. So having a gate would be really fucking nice.



So, they just finished installing the new gate. Today is literally the first day it was operational. We got an email stating clearly ""one car at a time, you need to wait and open the gate with your own remote or code, we don't want the gate broken again.""



Great. Awesome.



Well I get home from work, hit the remote and start to go through the gate when I see someone is riding my ass to get through. I stop and yell to them ""it's one at a time! Use your own remote!"" They do nothing. I say ""YO. Back up and use your own remote, I don't want the gate to be broken again!"" She honks at me. I flip her off. After two minutes, I give up (she'd been honking at me this entire time) and drive to my spot. This bitch follows me to my freaking spot and proceeds to berate me that she lives there and has a right blah blah blah. I tried to tell her I just wanted people to follow the rules because I don't want the gate to get broken. She's barely letting me get a word in edgewise. 



Eventually I just tell her I'm sorry, but I don't want my car broken into. And she literally says ""why, because I'm black?""



No bitch, it's because we've gotten five fucking emails about it from the leasing office because the gate was fucking broken and fucking douchebags kept getting in and stealing people's stuff out of their cars. I'm not trying to keep that shit going by allowing you to break the rules and tailgate me into the complex.



I just told her to drive away, but now she knows where I park and what my car looks like. Great.

This was not the first time my mum caught him as she did so a year prior and it was a different woman then. With this second mistress (that I know of), he actually left my mum, me and my brother (four years younger than me). My mum didn't even have a job at the time, and he just left.

We saw each other once or twice a month since then... and he lives on the same block as we do! I don't know if I'd say I hate him, but I cannot and will not forgive him. No way.

I stopped contact when I was around 17. I stopped calling, and you know what? So did he. He's married to that mistress now, though he didn't have the guts to tell me that himself, instead I found out by ear and by the ring I saw him wear. 

I feel like he and her do not deserve to be there. They were not a part of my life and I don't consider her my step-mom. Just no. I reel thinking of her, and him to an extent since it wasn't her fault that he left. He had a choice. He chose.

A little later, they caught a decent-sized bass. It looked like they were going to throw that back too. 

I’m broke as fuck while in law school with an unpaid internship, and I have two semi-deadbeat roommates to feed. I figured, hey, maybe he’ll let me have it and that’s one less meal I have to pay for.

So I approach him and ask if he’s going to throw back the fish. He says yes. I explain that I could use the fish to feed my household and it would really help. He happily agreed to give me the fish.

As I’m walking away, I hear the daughter start sobbing because I was going to “kill the fishy.” She was really, really upset that the fish was going to get eaten. Her dad ended up taking her home pretty quickly. I felt like shit for making a little girl cry like that and possibly cutting their bonding time short. 

I could hear her dad reassuring her, “hey, we did a good thing and fed some people,” so he wasn’t pissed at me, but the little girl was staring daggers at us.

I’ve done everything I physically can for this girl and she’s abused it to the point that I’m expected to single handedly work and not question it. I spend hours and hours a day working on things for her and her parents, but in spite of that her family hates me because I’m an ‘asshole’ for questioning what she wants me to do.

854,not the a-hole,"That kinda sums it up, but here's a bit more info. He's 35 and great all around, thing is tho he's a heavy heavy drinker and it does have an impact on me, and will continue to worsen if he doesn't wake up. 

He's the main bread-winner and I won't pretend he's never stressed, but I think fairly everyone reasonably stressed for their own reasons, right? A drinking problem is a problem because it's viewed as a solution, from what I understand... I do believe he's bordering alcoholism. I'm talking drunk multiple times a week, frequently have to drag him off the couch and argue to get him to co-operate and go to bed. Slurred speech, talking non-sense, can't follow a conversation, doesn't remember things the next day etc... 

We've had many talks about his drinking. This is what I think is reasonable: keep the drunk nights to weekends, for weekdays I think 2-3 beers is reasonable, 4 on tough nights (whatever I can understand, I'm being reasonable won't start picking at things). My point isn't control, it's just that he's not constantly out of it and needing me to watch over him. 

Anyways, I usually get through to him with these conversations, but it seems to cycle in a sense that he'll see my points and agree, and absolutely does make an effort to cut down which I appreciate and praise. We live together, and are talking about a ring. I think this needs to be sorted and in order before actually getting married. But then a few weeks pass and it'll cycle again. So, as a solution to this, I made an Excel chart kind of like a calendar, marking the amount of drinks he's had that day and it's color coded green yellow and red (red is 5+ drinks that night). He doesn't know about this. I don't plan on ambushing him either. My goal is to keep track for both of our sake, and then we actually have real data to base future discussions on. The proof is in the numbers, and I am totally honest when writing the score down (if not sometimes more lenient towards his benefit, for example I don't keep track of drinks if we go out, and if he drinks half a can before passing out I don't count it etc.) Again, it's not about control, it's literally to see things as objectively as possible to then find the best solution as a team. 

I don't want to show him until it is needed, because for one right now he's at a good point and doing great so I don't want to bring him down out of nowhere for nothing, and for two he probably would manipulate it a bit like hiding empty cans so I don't have proper count, not out of maliciousness but out of shame.

They live an hour and a half away so sometimes they spend the night when they come visit, on this occasion they did. 

I told them beforehand, and have reminded them many times since our son was born 14 months ago, that there is absolutely no smoking at our address. Not inside, not outside, not in the street, not in their car in the driveway, not anywhere near our property. I don’t want it around my son and I don’t want him asking questions about it when he gets bigger or getting ideas, and they know that. They said okay.

My mom did so as well but only once. I texted my dad afterward and told him that because they disrespected our wishes for them not to smoke on our property, from now on we’ll only be meeting in public, they won’t be coming to our house.

I'm waiting in a room for the doctor, when a PA walks in, and she says your blood work and urine say you have a bad infection in your kidneys. So she asks me to turn around as she is pressing on my back, and she touches an extremely tender spot that made me jump and say ""fuck!"" Because it hurt so bad. Fuck slipped out of my mouth. She stops, and then tells me that she will not help me anymore if I cuss again. I said, ""I'm sorry, but I'm in pain and it slipped out when you pressed on a sensitive spot."" She said ""I don't care, don't do it again."" So I just shut up. I didnt say another word to her. She never even looked at me or asked me anything. Just said shes sending a nurse with shots and walks out the door. Didnt specify what shots and barely acknowledged me. After everything, I reported her for her rude behavior and explained the situation. But now I feel bad that I may have overreacted by reporting it. I thought what she said to me was rude and made me feel like she was dismissing my pain. But I feel like an asshole too, by maybe being too sensitive and irrational because I was in a lot of pain.

865,not the a-hole,"So, I will attempt to be as honest as possible here. Some background- I have schizoaffective disorder bipolar type, which can be simply explained as (kind of) a cross between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, so I can occasionally be the asshole without realizing it. I have made significant progress since my diagnoses in high school and now am going to college and running a D&D group. This girl, I’ll call her Cutie, because that is basically her entire identity, has some form of depression and possibly worse, but hasn’t been to a doctor and is not officially diagnosed. She is living off government welfare, a frequent source of silent annoyance for me as she does not seek any help for her conditions or attempt to improve her behavior. Now a while ago I was home alone and having some psychosis so I invited a good friend of mine over, and we made soap and watched TV. A few days later Cutie messaged me on Discord. She used to be in our D&D group but quit because she tried to make her character name “Adoriblis Creampie” or something equally as terrible and was asked to change it . She was upset that I hadn’t invited her, so I apologized and said I would next time, but I didn’t want to scare her with my condition. She became offended at this, because she is one of those New Age witch people (which I normally don’t have a problem with as I like learning about mythology and the occult) and she said, I quote, “most likely in my line of work I’ve seen a lot worse than you.” I got mad. I probably should have just chilled but I was seeing red. I told her some of the rather disturbing things I have seen, she apologized, that was that. But it wasn’t. The next day I messaged Cutie apologizing for my outburst. She replied that she was deeply hurt because she “opened up” to me and I burned her. I said I was sorry, but that perhaps telling a person with psychosis that you’ve seen much worse than them was not the best idea. She then went on a whole rant about how she was born from the stars and engaged in a great battle against evil, and I was like, well that sounds like some of my delusions, we’re pretty alike. She then deleted all of her messages (Discord, you can do that) so that it looked like I was harassing her and started shit-talking me on Tumblr behind my back. The D&D group I am in thinks she deserves a second chance and that I shouldn’t “assume my problems are worse than someone else’s” but to be honest, I’m real done with this girl. Am I the Asshole? 
Edit for clarification: Cutie was implying that her spiritual witch stuff was worse than my psychosis, NOT that she had seen worse cases of psychosis than me. ",31,121,0.92
866,not the a-hole,"This past Sunday, my husband and I were on a mini-vacation at the beach. We arrived on the beach early (around 9am) and picked our spot fairly close to the water, and then rented a $20 dollar beach umbrella that the vendor drilled a hole into the sand and put up...therefore, our spot was not changing for the day.

A little after noon, a large family of about 6 or 8 adults and 3 or 4 kids came onto the not-crowded beach and started setting their stuff up literally right in front of us. Instead of me looking at the ocean from my chair, I was now looking at the back of some guy's head. There was a large space to the right of us that was unoccupied, and I asked (politely I thought) if they would be opposed to moving their stuff over a bit so their large family wasn't directly in front of us. The gentlemen of the family (there were about 4 of them) got very angry and started berating my husband and I, then paid for three umbrellas and had them drilled so we really couldn't see anything.

867,not the a-hole,"So on Friday I was having a pretty awful day, I got to work late, I was struggling to carry out basic tasks at work and was just generally in a bad mood.

Now I work as a welder, and in the UK, not sure about the rest of the world, but in any trade there is a lot of manly men whos banter tends to be mainly taking the piss out of each other, which I am fine with, and so a couple of guys were making fun of me and my bad mood, which I wasn't happy about at the time but it didn't particularly upset me.

So come lunch, I go for my break and everyone else down in the area carry on working and just before lunch is over they went home because they came in early and so were allowed home early. So when I went back down to the bay I was working in I find the fuel tank I am working on covered in snarky messages, stuff like ""cheer up pal, only 2 and a half hours to go"" and ""smile! Jesus loves you!"".

Along with those messages was a noose that they had created out of a length of rope they found in the workshop draped over the side of the tank, with an arrow pointing to it and the words ""Do It"" next to it. That really REALLY annoyed me so as soon as one of the management came over I explained the situation to them and he agreed with me that it was completely out of order.

So come Monday I come in and neither of the guys will talk to me or even look at me, so Management clearly had a talk to both of them. However ever since I have been completely ignored by both of them, and they appear to have brought people onto their side as well as there are now a number of people who have been really obnoxious and rude towards me. Because of this I am now doubting myself and wondering if I over reacted to it, so I thought I'd bring it to you guys and see what you thought.

TL:DR I was in a bad mood at work and was told to hang myself by 2 co-workers and went to managent about it. Since then them and multiple other co workers have been extremely rude towards me because of it.

On valentines day, my ex broke up with me after a 6-7 year relationship. It was decided that he would move out. He took his sweet fucking time however. He didn’t want to move twice so he was looking for his dream home.     

He dealt with the living together pretty well but for me it was hell. I’ve never felt so stressed in my life. I considered moving myself for a while but for reasons (other housemates wanted me to stay, didn’t have the financial means etc) I couldn’t. He also didn’t seem to save up for a big move, he even needed to borrow money from me at one time even though I only make €850 and he €2000.     


After 3 months or so, friends and family were telling me to start dating again. And so I did. My ex kept talking about couples that live together for a year after they break up so I didn’t see this ending soon and didn’t want to wait until he moved out. I had a few uneventful dates which I didn’t tell him about. But then one night a dude came from another city and he asked to come by my place first because he didn’t know the city. I agreed and told my ex that I would have someone over for a drink before we headed out. So if he wanted, he could have made sure he wasn’t home. He didn’t though and stayed in his room the whole time, being really loud with his weights. That was it I guess. After a good hour or so we left, had a fun night but nothing happened.

874,asshole,"Throwaway as people know my main and my Father-in-law is a douche.

Background:

I married my wife last year, my wife's parents are split up and my mother in law has since remarried. There was a great deal of turmoil regarding who would get custody of my wife and her sister when her parents split up. Ultimately they went to live with her much to Father-in-law's chagrin. This all happened when my wife was still very young. This means that for most of her life she was raised by her mother and stepfather.

The speculation is that Father-in-law wanted to get his kids and put them into some sort of boarding school in a move that can only be described as ""disney villain-esque"". That's pure speculation based on the fact that the kids went touring some boarding schools with the father and that the father never intended to stop working his job that had him travelling all over Europe. Effectively if this was true my wife and her sister would have been snatched away from a caring home with their mother and placed into a boarding school for their childhood. Father in law is still salty that he didn't get custody.

The upset:

A few months before the wedding we announced an order of service that included Father-in-law doing all the Father of the bride duties including walking my wife down the aisle and giving a speech. He was incensed to discover that my wife's stepfather (the one who actually did most of the raising) was doing a similar speech. He'd offered as a compromise to turn up, give my wife away and leave before the reception. We didn't like that idea because no doubt my wife would be begging him to stay and him leaving the wedding would make everything worse. Because of this, up until the morning of the wedding my Father-in-law wasn't going to attend. Ultimately we made the compromise and he turned up to give my wife away and left before the speeches.

The day was great aside from this fact but it definitely soured some of the mood and was just an all round dick move by him. 

There are other more minor things this buffoon has done but for conciseness I'll keep it to just fucking up the wedding day.

My reaction:

We're due to have the father in law to our house for a few days in a few months time. I'm not comfortable with it, I don't want a relationship with the man until he apologises for his conduct. As such I'm planning on visiting my father at the other end of the country. My wife doesn't want me to, she really wants her relationship with this man to be good but knowing how he is, I don't think it ever will be anything other than exactly what he wants.

My question is: 

Does removing myself from the situation like this, leaving my wife to explain why I'm not there to her father in law make me an asshole? 

Note: I've offered to explain to Father in law myself why I won't be there but my wife would rather make an excuse, I'm not sure how I feel about her (probably) lying to cover up

TL;DR: MY father in law made a damned fool of himself at our wedding, AITA for not wanting a relationship with him and leaving him with my wife when he visits?",28,37,0.87

Ryan likes to call his girlfriend who we will call Erika on FaceTime before they go to bed, just to check up on one another. We’re all 16 years old as some more background info. I was logging out of discord, saying goodbye to Ryan and Ryan and Erika where about to hand up their calls to. Suddenly Ryan goes “Erika, you wanna go night night, you go sleepybyes?” In the cute baby voice everyone does talking to toddlers. I found it kind of odd but ignored it until she responded with “yes daddy waddy” and then hung up. So I sayed “dude no offense but that was kinda weird” and he started ranting to me about how I don’t get to talk about her like that and how I’m such a jerk for even listening to their phone call even though we had been playing well before he called her so it’s not like I was gonna stop playing with him.

878,not the a-hole,"When I first got social media at the age of 16 my mother wanted to be involved in every single aspect. Who my friends were, what I wrote, what groups I joined. Everything. Since I was a minor and still living under their roof, I had to comply. Seven years later and I’ve been using a new Facebook, one that I had blocked her on. Since then I’ve basically quit Instagram and Snapchat, and go on Twitter once a month. I use Facebook because I can still follow groups of interest and news pages to keep tabs with what happens in my hometown when I’m on the road. 

However, my mother is oh-so desperate to get on this Facebook as well. She wants to know everything I write, all the groups I follow, and everyone I’m friends with. She’s been desperately getting my Facebook, despite her being blocked, since I was 18 and got the new Facebook profile. She believes that no matter how old I am, she still has every single right to know what I’m doing online. 

This weekend while I was home we got into a huge fight because she was threatening to not let me come home anymore (I’m a truck driver, so I’m only home 4 days for every 30 days) if I don’t add her on Facebook. Well, I caved after 5 long years and let her on. In less than 24 hours she had commented on over 100 posts ranging from last year (I don’t post much on there anymore; mostly just shared posts from other people. Yes I’m one of those people.) She has also messaged half of my friends asking who they are and why they’re friends with me. Even goes so far as to accusing me and one girl of having a secret relationship without my mother knowing, which isn’t even true because the girl has a boyfriend who isn’t me! 

My mother has gone way too far, and I finally told her that she is annoying, overbearing, and contrary to her belief not entitled to every aspect of my life just because she gave birth to me 23 years ago. This made her cry. Also, it’s been two days since the fight and she refuses to talk to me. Since then I deactivated my Facebook and lost a lot of friends in the process. She may have her heart in the right place, but this woman’s mind is not. She’s always been overbearing. The type of mother who constantly needs to have physical contact with her child. Even though I’m 23 she still needs me to hold her hand everywhere we go. She babies me constantly, always belittling me as if I’m still a 5 year old. 

Granted, I never ever wanted to make her cry. Believe me, I want to rip my heart out for every moment in my life I ever made my mother cry. I just wanted to be honest in that she needs to grow up and stop treating me like a child. Even my father is standing with her in this and saying I’m disrespectful and that I’m still their child, so I have no rights or say when it comes to their involvement in my life. 

I’ve been begging them to go to therapy with me over this shit, hoping they could see everything they do is wrong. Hoping they could see that I’m a 23 year old who has a full-time job, makes his own money, has no social life, stays out of trouble, etc. But they’ve refused at every opportunity I gave them. So now I’ll have to start finding places to go for my 4 days off from now on unless I reopen my Facebook and let my mother back in as a friend with full ability to see everything I do on there, just as she wants.

880,not the a-hole,"So my neighbor and I were childhood friends. He moved away when we were like 12 and has now moved back in with his grandma (my neighbor). He has been gone for awhile, with short weekend visits every now and then. Anyways my friend’s fiancé comes to our door while I’m at work and asks my mother for the WiFi password cause my friend might’ve broken his arm falling down the stairs. She said she needed directions to the hospital, but my mom offered to go on our computer and look up directions for her. Her excuse was that she isn’t good with directions and needed to follow them on her phone..which makes no sense...but my mom isn’t very tech savvy so she had no clue. Anyways my mother called me while I was working, but I don’t know the password (I know the general thing, but I change the numbers around so I’d have to try a few times). So the fiancé goes home empty handed. 

Fast forward a week (not home again) and the fiancé comes by a second time asking for the WiFi password so her and my friend can keep up with job applications and whatnot since apparently there is no internet at his grandmas house and they don’t have the money for gas to keep going to the public library to use their internet. The kicker is that my mother asked how my friend was doing after his fall. The fiancé says his *ankle* was not broken...even though she originally said it was his arm.

886,not enough info,"AITA Long story shortish—my (39f) Dad (70) was caught engaging in intercourse with my very close friend when I was younger and nothing ever really happened as the result. I have always felt creeped out and uncomfortable around my dad. Other siblings and family members feel the same. But my dad is generous and loyal I guess. I think. But maybe he uses money and his generosity as a way to keep a hold. Anyway, I have young children of my own and I am always cautious of when he is around the kids. I never leave them alone together. Ever. But he helped me after my divorce and kept me afloat. I’m stable now and I have kept to my agreement with him about what I owe him. I pay him every month. Every time I see him I am more and more uncomfortable. I decided to give myself permission to stop reaching out. I haven’t called or texted him in weeks. I am happier and better for it. But a smidge of me wonders if I’m the asshole?

Edit: my close friend was the same age as I was at the time- 15. My dad groomed her by doing things like playing with her hair or giving her small things like a pack of cigarettes. Then he started letting her sleep over on school nights; which had previously been a hard no. My brother, one year older than me, lived at the small house with me and my dad for around a year or two. He would move back and forth between my mom and Dad. One night my brother walks in on my dad having sex with my friend. He is mortified and doesn’t come back home for days. My dad acts like it’s no big deal. My friend is upset because she “cheated” on her “boyfriend”. I later found out that her boyfriend/than husband was my high school basketball coach. The topic wasn’t addressed again until I made the mistake of telling a close friend and she told someone else and that person told someone and...until my paternal grandmother found out at the local grocery store—its a small town. My dad was livid that I had opened my big mouth. That evening was rough. My dad can be scary in a psychopathic way. He had guns everywhere. He’s a racist, sexist, misogynistic guy who preys on young women. I could give a million examples of things he has said or done to convince you—he’s not a nice person. Anyway, my husband won’t be around him anymore ever for other reasons. 

As far as what I owe him—starting when I was in my teens my dad had a sort of allowance system. I adopted some of the concept in my own house now. After chores are complete, “money” is deposited into an “account”, that can be withdrawn at anytime. There was also a borrow system—if you didn’t have funds my dad would loan any of us money but would expect us to pay it back. He never minded what the agreement was, you just had to stick to it. So the agreement between us was that I would pay him an amount every month until my debt is paid. I have about three years left to pay him. He bought things for me after I divorced and helped me frequently by coming to visit. Then it just started feeling weird. He would present us like a couple when we would go places. He would touch me in a way that just creeped me out. And then the older kids (older teen, old enough to understand but not old enough either, and a little little) started to notice and call him a “creepy old perv”. 

Update—I began having severe panic attacks and had to be hospitalized. I remember things that I revealed to my husband. He called my brother and told him. And my mom. My husband was angry when he told them what was happening; he knew both my brother and mother knew of my fathers history and would understand I guess. But none of my family understood. I was released and when I told my family none of them reached out. I texted again. My mother told me she would only respond to phone calls. My sister told me the same. My oldest sister has just not responded and my brother would not respond as well. I tried to figure out what was happening individually. The response I got from my brother was that I am a liar. A nasty liar. My sister says she isn’t going to text about it. That we can talk when she visits this state in a few months. I call my mom to figure out what was happening. She initially sounded empathetic and understanding and then when I asked her why she hadn’t been responding to me she said she was upset about how my husband had told her and that I had accused her of knowing. I confronted that and reminded her that she had indeed known of abuse and had told me of some abuse in the past. I asked her to relay that information to my brother but she would not. She kept coming up with excuses and it was very clear that she simply wanted to be let out of some responsibility. I just let them all go. I’m not going to move forward with anything other than happiness, healthiness, and honesty. 

I want to choose love and not the kind that cost so much. My husband and kids are sleeping soundly. The dogs paws are running even though he’s not moving an inch. I want to choose grace and forgiveness. I am. I will forgive them all eventually. You don’t know anyone else’s story. But the people I choose for my family will not turn their backs on me. They never have. I never in a million years expected my mother and three siblings to choose my pedophile of a father. I want to forget how that makes me feel. I’ve not one time lied to them. I cannot remember a time that I have betrayed them. But I have my family now and I will love on hoping that I continue to make good mom choices.

890,not the a-hole,"Hey all, just got off a shift at a café. I’ve been working on my Spanish for about five years now and my cafe location brings in many Spanish-speakers. If I recognize an accent from a Spanish-speaking country, i usually say, “¿hablas español?” And if they respond affirmatively/excitedly, I’ll switch to Spanish. So far the results have been great, people seem to like speaking (probably?) their native tongue, teaching me new words, giving corrections, etc. Oftentimes it’s conducive to really good conversations.

today I had like four Spanish-speaking people out of six in one series of customers, and with the last of the four, I didn’t ask ¿hablas español? before switching over after hearing his accent. He snapped, “you can speak English you know,” and I apologized and said I just am trying to practice and I finished his order in English. Was so embarrassed.

891,kinda,"TL;DR Recently rejoined dating site. Guy chats me up, we hit it off. Guy reveals I had chatted and promised to meet up 2ish years ago but ghosted him. Guy won't let it go. I tell him I'm not going to apologize for something that happened so long ago that I don't even remember, ask him to start fresh. He continues to harp, I reject him.

Long version:

I used to ghost people a lot. I have social anxiety and am a people pleaser so a few years ago I would talk to guys, get in over my head promising them things and sending pics, then panic and block them or never talk to them again because I was scared. It was shitty, I **was** an asshole. I've learned from my ways, dealt with the anxiety and other crap, moved on.

Enter long-term relationship followed by bad break up. Haven't used [Dating Site] in 1.5 years at least? Rejoin, update profile. Guy starts chatting. We have nice chats, hit it off, good convos.

He brings up that we talked before really casually. ""Hey yeah you ghosted me last time we tried to start something."" I'm honest. ""Yeah that sucks I used to ghost people all the time man, social anxiety blah blah blah."" 

He persists, telling me how much it hurt his feelings and how bummed he was. Finally I'm like ""Hey listen I'm not gonna apologize, I honestly can't remember what happened or how I felt and I don't think it matters. Do you want to start fresh with this or not?"" Giving him a chance even though I'm skeeved out by this point.

He says ""I'm still interested, I believe in redemption."" This is a huge red flag for me, like I have to redeem myself to be with him? Nah son, that's not cool.

Since I promised I wouldn't ghost anyone this time around I lay it out ""I don't owe you anything and if you hold this over my head this relationship won't work out, why are you even talking to me if you're so hurt?""

Cue butthurt, defensive answers and I""m just like ""Sorry, I'm out, don't talk to me again.""

I feel like I'm right but feel like an asshole too. It's hard to know when I'm setting boundaries or crossing the line. Was he just seeing if I'm still the ghosting type or was he fishing for me to fall over myself ""making it up to him""?",127,150,0.82
892,not the a-hole,"I want to preface this by defending myself by letting you know this is not the only thing that caused my reaction but one of many. I seem to work in a sexist environment where only the women get in trouble and publicly pulled up for anything. I am one of these women.

A part of my job is answering the phones and if I'm not there we often don't have enough people to cover the call volume.

Since I started at this company I have been arriving 15-40 mins early almost every single day and get straight to working. On the very few occasions I haven't arrived early, I was on time.

Now, the other day I arrived on time, but there were building works around the office and I had to turn back and go another route to get inside, this made me 8 minutes late.

When I arrive, the CEO immediately pulls me up on timekeeping. I have (male) colleagues who are regularly late and nothing has ever been said to them.

He emphasised the importance of 'arriving on time'.

So, now I sit outside the office and enjoy my coffee until start time. Never arriving more than a minute early, but never late.

This, plus other demotivating things that have happened here, has also caused me to put in absolutely minimal effort into everything at work whilst looking for other jobs. I also don't think I'm the only one that has this attitude here now.

Here's where I'm unsure about my choices: I work at a start-up company. Generally in this environment it is expected that everyone does a bit of everything and puts in a bit extra than just their job description to make the company as successful as possible. If the company does not exceed, 10 people will lose their jobs. This does not just affect me.

I think I might be being a selfish asshole.",29,33,0.83

895,not the a-hole,"This happened a few months ago on an 11 hour long haul flight. I fly on staff discount, so I do not get a choice of seats, which usually means I get the shit seats no one else wants.

The plane was a large Airbus A380, I was seated in economy and in seat '45B' (so i'm seated between the window seat and aisle seat on the left side of the aircraft). The staff had mentioned the flight was very full... only very few spare seats left. I board the plane, and see the window and aisle seat either side of me are not occupied yet. I sit down in my allocated seat.

A woman with a little girl around 3 years old, and a 10 month old baby boy, make their way up the aisle to my row. It's clear the mother booked the aisle and window seat hoping that no one would chose the middle seat and she would have the row to herself. Now there is a problem because I am here. She looked unhappy.

I get up to let them in and she tells me her 3 year old will sit in the window seat, she and baby will sit in the middle, and I can have the aisle. SWEET I think to myself. I get the aisle now instead of the middle seat. YAY.

Before we even took off, the mother had asked the flight attendant if there was a spare seat I could move to so she could have the row to herself. She didn't ask me if I wanted to move, just asked the FA to find a seat for me to move to. FA said I couldn't move until after take off, but would see what she could do. 

After takeoff, the mother asked again and after some searching, FA was able to find a spare seat a few rows down in the middle of the aircraft. In the VERY middle.  Like 1 person left of me and 2 people to the right of me. My least favorite seat. 

The Flight Attendant was sympathetic to me, and asked me if I wanted to move, but I said No. I just told the mother that her and her children really weren't bothering me (which is true), and since I'm a bit taller I prefer the extra room. She was pretty unhappy the rest of the flight.

Was this wrong? On one hand I can understand how annoying it would be to sit 11 hours with a big baby on your lap, and entertaining another kid all whilst crammed into two seats. As well, it's not like I paid extra for an aisle... I was actually booked in the middle but preferred to stick with the aisle next to her kids than move to a middle seat again.

But on the other... she should have just booked the whole row. She booked two seats, she got two seats. There was obviously a possibility this could happen and I really really didn't want to give up my aisle seat....

896,not the a-hole,"Important backstory: 
I work for a social services org. that tends to be more progressive and in tune with the needs of staff (for example, we set self-care goals as part of our annual goals). This is designed to support us with our emotionally heavy daily work but also has created this dynamic where coworker relations tend to get more personal. In fact, I sometimes have a hard time distinguishing if what is going on is professionally acceptable/normal or a bit over the line. 

Anyway, I have a teammate, L. She tends to be very emotionally reactionary to things and takes things very personally, mostly because she stews on little things until they become big things without giving anyone a chance to address it. We’ve had a lot of meetings as a team mediating this and we all agreed to take any issue we have immediately to the other party so it can be quickly resolved. We also agreed to always do this in person. Whatever, fine. Work is work to me and I’ve yet to bring something to anyone because I let it roll off my back knowing no work relationship will be perfect. L tends to have something to discuss at least once a month, if not more, and preceding this she will get very cold and snarky or short with me. 

These constant feedback “check ins” seem to primarily be with me as she was my mentor when I started and I think I challenge her because I’m equally as motivated and on even footing now but she still sees herself as my superior. She makes a big show of these, pulling me into a meeting room and dragging it on for however long she needs to feel comfortable. In the past when we’ve “checked in”, as she puts it, the common theme is that she doesn’t like how I show up in meetings and seem to take charge on things, and wishes I were more quiet and didn’t come “across as intelligent”.  To be fair, she’s always late and fairly unreliable (it took her four months to get something to me that was due three and a half months ago, as an example, which I just did myself after asking multiple times). Shit has to get done so I do take charge sometimes. She also likes to tell me I make her feel like she’s inadequate, that she’s jealous of how I’ve networked and made connections in the field, that I cast a shadow on her, etc. 

Relevant situation: 
I got another text from her last week saying “Hey, I just want to check in before things snowball. Can we meet?” This came after a week of short, snippy comments; not acknowledging me; and giving the cold shoulder or other weird awkward silences. I said nothing for two days then texted back saying:
“Sometimes I feel like you actively seek things out to criticize or invalidate not just my work, but me personally. It doesn’t seem appropriate to do this to the degree that it has been in a professional setting. There are plenty of things I could harp on about how you show up - the lateness, the weird silences, the emotional reactions - but I let it go because we’re coworkers, not friends. I wish you would consider how you affect other people and not just think of yourself.” Since then I’ve ignored her in the office (we’re in the field a lot so this is actually easy) and refuse to acknowledge her want to “check in”.  I intend to do this as long as possible, mostly because it’s ridiculous but also I’m stubborn and dreading another stupid conversation without anything being resolved.

She's a little younger than I am and all her friends constantly want to go to bars and clubbing but Im not big into that scene and would rather stay home those nights. I guess at some point one of her friends decide to tell everyone I'm ashamed of her, or maybe even cheating on her and I'd rather bring some side chick over than go out drinking with them until sunrise. Next thing you know, whenever she's with them, she feels the need to ""confirm"" all these ideas they're putting in her head about me and its all stereotypical insecure bs that just ends up stressing both of us out. 

I've gotten to the point where I told her, if she wants to hang out with them, by all means go for it, I'm not the kind of guy thats gonna dictate who she can and can't spend time with. She's an adult and able to make those decisions for herself, but Im not interested in being around any of them in the slightest. She doesn't invite me out with them anymore and I'm more than okay with that, they're not my crowd to begin with. But for whatever reason she decided that I'd be perfectly fine with bringing all them over, so I get home from work last night to her coworkers passed out on my couch/floor, and my kitchen/living room looks like a fucking frat house with all the empty cans and solo cups all over it.

903,asshole,"I live with my girlfriend of 3 years. All week we were excited that we had no plans and could have a lazy weekend. She was dreading having to do some work from home on Sunday. On Saturday morning, I suggested maybe we should paint the bedroom. My girlfriend agreed. 

That turned into a much bigger project. In addition to painting, we changed every outlet and faceplate, rearranged the room, and bought and installed new blinds. All of the electrical her brother and I did on Saturday night. We didn't finish until 10:30, bringing the total time to 12 hours.

On Sunday, her brother and I mounted the TV, installed the last set of blinds, and installed the phone jack, while she worked on painting the baseboard and the bureau. After about 3 hours more shopping/work Sunday, 2:00ish, I needed to make one last home Depot trip to get a wall mount for the mirror. My girlfriend was finishing painting the baseboards; that, mounting the mirror, hanging pictures, and cleaning up (including all the displaced clothes) still remained.

While at home Depot, I called my cousin to get advice on the mirror. He said he was nearby about to go to a movie. I knew we had more work to do, but reasoned that I had to wait for some paint to dry for some of it, and we could finish after the movie. I told him I'd get back to him and called my girlfriend. I told her my cousin wanted to go to the movies and asked if she wanted to go. She said she was super stressed and couldn't - I said I understood she had a lot of work to do and was just inviting her out of courtesy. I realized immediately this sounded like I didn't actually want her to go; I tried to explain I meant I really wanted her there but understood if she couldn't make it because I knew she had to work. She said ""yeah okay"".

She also said ""what about lunch?"" Before I left we we're talking about ordering food but hadn't come to an agreement. We disagree here - she says I told her I'd get lunch, I don't think I said that since she indicated she didn't want fast food and I didn't have any better ideas. I told her I'd probably eat at the theater. I checked the movie length and told her I'd be home around 6.

Anyways, we went to the movies.  We got there 50-60 min early because my cousin was worried about getting seats. My girlfriend started textong me that she was unhappy with me and thought it was a dick move to bail on her. I told her we could finish later and that she should do her work-from-home she was worried about whole I was gone. She said we'd talk later.

That's where we are at now. I feel like, after spending 3/4 the weekend working on the room, a movie with my cousin is no big deal, since we could finish later anyway. She feels like I ditched her and bailed on a commitment that I made to her, increasing her stress load when I knew she was already stressed. She did do all the cleaning and hanging while I was gone, though I hung the mirror when I got back (and I seriously would have done the work when I got home).",29,52,0.92

905,not a-hole or shrink,"So bit of backstory; my sister married a guy who did a complete 180 personality-wise and was super narcissistic, manipulative, all that fun stuff. She's been separated and had no contact with him for about two years now. But since she's been back she's been a changed person. I tried being supportive and understanding because I can understand to an extent what she went through (narc family, but that's not the issue rn), and tried to encourage her to see a therapist, and do things that would help her get the emotions out. 
It's been two years now and she's developed this victim complex, where it's like everyone is out to get her and bad things that happen to her happened intentionally to make her feel bad. She gets defensive and confrontational so fast. Her old friends have been less than understanding and rarely see her anymore, so I'm the only person she talks to and hangs out with. 
I don't want to hang out with her as much as she wants me to. She's needy and says things that are dark or downright nasty and will follow them up with laughter like it's a joke. She gets jealous when I hang out with my cousins or friends and causes arguments in our house about it. 
She's been through a lot and I get that, but I'm trying to work on my own mental health problems and being around her just gives me a headache. Also she's thirty with a child and I'm twenty so I honestly can't relate to her. AITA?",37,86,0.95
906,not the a-hole,"So I (single person) moved in with my best friend and her partner to save money on housing. We are all approx. 30 and live in an open house (no separate living spaces, only space that is truly mine is my bedroom). Prior to moving in, there was no discussion that the couple may intend to have a baby while we're living together - however, my best friend knows that I don't like babies and don't want children of my own.

Fast forward to 6 months after we've moved in together, the couple tell me they want to start trying to have a baby.  I'm quite taken aback and don't tell them at that time how angry I am that they didn't bring this up before we combined houses. They insist that they will do whatever they can to make me comfortable in the house with the baby, and I say I could try it, but that we'd have to do a lot of pre-planning. It would be incredibly difficult for me to move out and find suitable housing financially.

Now about another 6 months later, my best friend is pregnant, and I honestly don't know if I can stand living with a child. I've started trying to broach this with my friends/roommates, and they are quite angry, as they say they have now budgeted for their child based on me living with them.

She, *completely unprovoked* (like literally, I was just making a cup of tea) said "" You should wash your face more! I bet you never do. You always forget."" I told her I did, once a day with facewash everyday + in the shower obviously. And she said it should be three times a day if not more, and that it's my fault I have acne. Now, this is usually how she talks so it didn't bother me, but what followed it was what really set me off.

""Your face is ruined!"" 
 
That was too far in my opinion. I snapped back something about how she shouldn't say things like that, and she got really mad and told me that I 1) shouldn't teach her how to parent and 2) that being civil doesn't work with me.

A few hours later I was walking down the street and a dishevelled-looking woman in a wheelchair came over to me. She started complimenting my hair and outfit.
Then out of nowhere she went on a ten minute sob story about how her boyfriend beat her, she was now homeless and her kids had been taken off her (I just nodded politely and asked if she had called the police, but she kept going and I was too awkward to leave). Then she asked did I have any money, because she ""hadn't eaten in five days"".

I remembered my student cheeseburger, and said ""sorry, I don't have any cash on me, but I can give you this?"" and got it out of my bag and passed it over.
She took it, then immediately went from being full of compliments and crying to looking really agitated, and said, ""this is freezing. I don't want this, this burger is cold, what the fuck. Are you sure you don't have any money on you? I need money, not a burger""

I said no and that I had to go now, and after that practically sprinted away feeling super awkward.
I relayed this story to my friend later on, who said I should have just given her some money for a fresh burger because they're only £1, but I didn't have any cash on me and it would have required going to an ATM and taking out at least £5, and she probably would have just asked for that.

Ok he says fine, he even says he will come home if the rest of the group goes out after

So me and the other couple with the baby go back to the house, put the babies to bed and have a great night! No issues. 1145 comes by and this bar is a 15 minute walk so I’m like wtf. I call him twice, no answer. So I call the other couple, thinking he probably isn’t paying attention to his phone. Whatever, I just want to see when he’s coming back. They don’t answer. I’m kinda freaking out like omg they got arrested, they are lost, SOMETHING is wrong because nobody is answering.

915,not the a-hole,"Background, been dating my gf for almost 7 months now. Basically there’s this guy we know from school who she started chilling with last semester. They started off as merely study buddies but now they’ll hang out and text every now and again.

I don’t normally have a problem hanging out with other guys platonically, but this guy quite obviously wants more than friendship from her. I can tell because he likes and comments every single Facebook/Instagram post she makes, will buy her the odd gift here and there (usually boxes of Ferrero chocolates), and he’ll post stuff like “I wish you were crazy about me as I am about you” on his Facebook wall.

My girlfriend reassured me that they’re just friends and that she’s not interested in him in that way. She tells me to go easy on him too (he’s an awkward/shy guy in person). I don’t believe that she will cheat on me with him either. The reason why I dislike him is because when I do see him in person (she invites him to parties sometimes) he’ll say hi and be nice to my face, but I catch him staring at me and giving me bad looks. He knows were dating, and as a guy I know exactly what he’s thinking. 

I went out one night to a bar to meet up with some friends without my girlfriend and he happened to be there  with a couple of his friends. He spent half the night just watching me, probably to see if I would start cheating with another girl.

I do trust my girlfriend completely, but its him I don’t trust. Deep down I know he sees me as an obstacle. I have what he wants and I have the gut feeling that if he sees an opportunity to try and take me down a peg he’d do so without hesitation. In his eyes I’m the enemy, and I’m not his friend so if that’s true then he must be my enemy.

So AITA here? Am I being too controlling over my girlfriend or do I have a right to be upset?",155,288,0.97
916,not the a-hole,"Ok. A little background. Bear with me:

I had a two and a half year relationship with this girl, she broke up with me, immediately got into a relationship with someone else and told me she wanted to sever ties, when I wanted to try to stay friends. (There's way more to it than that and it was super dramatic and painful, but there's only so much time in a day. So that's the gist of it.)

Despite her making it clear in various ways that she didn't want to talk to me, when her new relationship turned out to be emotionally abusive, she continually turned to me for comfort and support. After a little over a year apart, during which I did my best to deal with her periodically popping back into my life and I attempted (somewhat halfheartedly) to move on, they ended up breaking up. She came right to me (non-romantically) that very night. And we started hanging out often (without being anything official).

Flash forward about 4 months and she decided she wanted to commit to me again. So that's what we did. Things went pretty great for another 4 months or so. It was even better than if we had picked up where we left off. We were starting to talk about getting married, the logistics of having a life together and starting a family, etc.

About 3 months ago we started having what seemed to be minor issues. Nothing I would have considered more significant than things couples go through sometimes because both people are human and have their own ops and downs. It's only in hindsight that I've been able to see that these were signs. (Or that *SHE* saw them as signs which then fed her own doubts about the relationship. Who knows.)

At the end of June/beginning of July, She went on a two week vacation to Ireland with her grandmother and aunt. I flew out to join them a week in. We had a decent time, but there were some things about how she was acting that made me anxious. I have anxiety issues to begin with, which had been flaring up recently (perhaps over the last couple months... hmmm), so I kept telling myself I was worrying over nothing. Our last night there, the anxiety got the better of me and I brought it up to her. We were (usually) quite good about open communication. I was hoping she'd reassure me that I had nothing to be concerned about. NOPE. She tried to be comforting while being non-committal, but when I said, ""You're not thinking about breaking up with me, are you?"" ...silence.

So, over the next few days we talked about it more (she also had an unrelated but pretty huge personal/emotional revelation). At some point she told me how sure she was that no matter what she did, shed always have me. She had told me her plan was to not be with anyone right now (to tell the guy in love with her at work to back off) and wanted to continue having me as a significant part of her life. Even if she DID end up with someone else romantically, she wouldn't let that relationship jeopardize her connection with me. That was how we left it on a Monday morning.

The next week was absolute hell for me. I felt her pulling away while she spent time with the guy from work, both on and off the clock. She had broken up with me, so I had no right to question her about what she was doing. From what she told me freely, I'm fairly certain she spent at least Monday night at his house. But again, not my business anymore. I just kept asking her if her plans had changed and getting vague or non-answers. I was getting the feeling that what she wanted was changing and there was nothing I could do about it. My attitude wasn't the best a lot of the time, as I tend to over-analyze and talk as if I figured out what is going on in her head. I came off as a bit of a dick, and I'm not proud of it. To her credit, she knows me well enough to realize it wouldn't last forever. She seemed confident that whatever happened, we'd find a balance that would work for us. But still, most of that week was completely nerve wracking. My stomach was in knots all say and lurched whenever I got a text from her. She cancelled plans with me twice. Once because of an argument. Again because she ""wasn't ready to see me. We both need more time to process."" Whatever. Fair enough. I don't know if there was some kind of PTSD on my part from the last time she broke up with me (which was much more chaotic and painful and confusing) but it all felt very familiar and awful.

Saturday (while she spent her day with the new guy she hasn't told me she wants to be serious with) I went to my therapist. We had talked a bit about the situation over the phone during the week. We talked about what I want. That what I want is to marry her and have a life together, however unlikely that might be. More to the point, I want to marry someone I love and that will commit to starting a life with me. And what if she's just having another personal crisis that will end with her wanting to be with me again, but how in the meantime I'm at the mercy of her volatility. We also talked about how helpless and not myself I had felt without her during that week. We talked about how I can try to be better on my own, independently from her, and how whether she changes her mind or not, that will only be a good thing for me. And we talked about me standing up for myself and what I want.

He suggested that I straight up propose to her. That I ask her if she wants to quit fucking around with me and seriously commit. And if that's not what she wants, what's best for me would be to not try to maintain a friendship with her right now. I wasn't sold on the idea, but I went home and though about it. And I started thinking about what I might say. And I started writing. And the more I wrote the calmer I felt. I poured my heart out trying to explain. I didn't want to hurt her and I did my best to word things in a way that made sense and wasn't harsh or critical. I wasn't angry. It wasn't an ultimatum. It was a way of telling her that I need to do what's best for me while also showing her how MUCH I don't want to lose her. I tried to make it clear that in the future a friendship may very well be something I could want.

I gave her the letter when she came to pick up some money I still owed her grandmother for our trip and tickets to a concert that I had bought for us because she wanted to go. (She said I could keep them, since I paid, but I had no desire to go. The whole point was to go with her.) I sat with her while she read it. I knew she wasn't going to say yes. She cried. I cried. She said she was proud of me. She said she understood. She said she wishes she had handled things differently so that being friends would have worked for me. I told her I don't know if that would have been possible. We hugged and said goodbye. It KILLED me to put her through that.

That was Sunday.

I still hate thinking about the fact that I don't have her to talk to. I've wondered if I made the right decision. If maybe having her as a friend is more important to me than I thought. I may still find that to be true. (God fucking help me!) I should have just gone cold turkey and blocked all social media. But I didn't. I should have made sure to at least turn off ALL notifications of when she posts stuff. But I didn't.

Today, I got a notification on MyFitnessPal that said ""Tell your friend \*\*\* nice job for burning 90 calories doing 30 minutes of intercourse."" We've both used that app for about 4 years, and she has NEVER logged sex as a workout. Then she tweeted for the first time in years making a joke about how shitty it was of me to try to ""force"" her to stay in a relationship by proposing.

She knew I got notifications about her stuff. She used to tease me about it.

I'm done trying to understand what she want's from me, or what kind of a reaction she expects. But I fucking hate it. It hurts. But I still just wish there was something I could do to help. Which maybe is what she's hoping. That I'll try to argue that she's wrong. I don't know.

And on an fairly insignificant note that just kind of adds insult to injury, tonight is the night she's going with her aunt to the concert that I bought tickets to.

So, am I the asshole?

TL;DR: The girl I've stuck by for the better part of 5 years and that I was ready to marry broke up with me while we were on vacation in Ireland (though she didn't plan it that way). After I told her trying to stay friends with her and watching as she starts a new relationship (a week after breaking up) was too painful for me right now, she's now lashing out toward me in various ways.",105,201,0.93

919,not the a-hole,"So recently I’ve been getting tired with my friend’s phone habits. Every time we hang out, he’s constantly on his phone. When I try to spark a conversation his head is always to his phone and if he does end up listening to me, the words go through one ear and out the other. His clingy ass girlfriend nonstop calls him every time we want to hang out and it gets on my nerve. Every second of the day she wants to talk to him or ask him something stupid. A majority of the time we’re usually walking and he’s on the phone with gf and I’m just there silent. Also, I like to eat and converse with people and once again, he’s got his head down to his phone doing whatever. Facebook. Instagram. Idk. He sometimes brings his handheld phone stabilizer to record wherever we go and even that gets on my nerves. WIBTA if I stopped talking to him for these reasons?

But anytime I try and do any tiny thing such as carry her bag or offer to pay for the dinner, she gets really offended, and says that “In Norway,” (where she’s from)”girls do things for themselves”. My counterargument is that it’s a nice gesture, but she says she doesn’t want to hear it and refuses to allow me to do whatever it is I attempted to do. I get her point, that guys shouldn’t do EVERYTHING for girls, but still, I believe that I should at least be allowed to pay for dinner or something along those lines.

So, the question stands; am I the asshole? Should I just let her have it, and let her split the check in half, or carry the umbrella or whatever? I still paid for every date we went on in full, she was just never happy with it. I believe she is in the wrong, but maybe it’s just how she was raised, and I should go with it. I don’t know.

 He’s been dealing with some depression and anxiety and I totally get it because I myself have been through it. My problem is, he can treat me like complete crap and I take it but I’m not allowed to have type of emotions or show when I’m upset without completely pissing him off......  

It kills me because I’m always made to feel like the bad guy all the time. I’ve been working my ass off to try and keep him happy and to do my best to contain my emotions and let him roll with his. How much am I suppose to endure without losing it.... 

Well anyways, today I woke up after a bad night with him and just kind of ignored him and talked as little as possible to him. (We have kids so no talking at all is rough). Went to lay the kids down and I fell asleep with them without really saying much to him. He then left for work and I hardly even cared. He kissed me and said “I love you” and I just kind of took it and said okay.... 

 Of course after he left I felt like shit because I hate acting like that towards him because I never know how he feels or if it upsets him.

926,not the a-hole,"Ok, for context, this happened a few years ago, but I recently found this sub and was reminded of this little incident. 

I used to drive for Lyft, and when this incident happened, I had only had my car for a couple months at this point [2014 Honda Civic LX](https://i.imgur.com/yeV6CG0.jpg)

So it's about 10:30 in the evening on a Saturday night in downtown San Diego, and I get a request to pick somebody up. Upon arriving, 3 girls hop in and mention they are going home. Ok, they already put their destination address in the app, so I confirmed they were my fare, and off we went. 

Now, this particular drive required me to hop on the freeway for about maybe 10 minutes. I was driving along, and we were maybe about 2 miles from our exit, when I suddenly hear multiple clicking noises coming from the back seat. I look back, and one of them is trying to light a joint in my car!

I immediately ask her what she thinks she's doing, and she replies with ""Oh don't worry, I'll just blow the smoke out the window""

I respond with ""No, you do NOT light a joint or a cigarette in MY car, so please put it away""

She begins to get all huffy and asks me what my problem was. I simply told her either she puts it away, or they can get out of my car. She continues to complain, so I pull off the freeway, stop at a 7-11 and tell them all to get out, I'm ending the fare.

""You can't kick us out, we're paying you to take us home!""

""Uhh, I just ended your fare. You didn't want to put your joint away, so now you can find another ride.""

They continue to complain and refuse to get out until I finally say ""Look, if you won't get out of my car, then maybe we can let the police sort this out.""

At first they didn't believe me, but when I started dialing they got the hint and got out. 

Of course I received a call from Lyft the next morning asking why they had received a call complaining that I had kicked them out of the car before arriving then continued the fare. I explained that one of them tried lighting a joint in my car, and after telling them multiple times to put it away, they would not, so I dropped them off at a local 7-11, and had to threaten to get the cops involved to get them out of my car. 

The rep took a look at where I stopped the fare, saw it was at a 7-11 like I mentioned, apologized for them, and said they would remove the 1 star review from my record. 

Thinking about it years later, was I the asshole for kicking them out?",14,34,0.88
927,not the a-hole,"A new position opened up in my department, and I wanted a guy I used to work with (we'll call him ""Jim"") to apply. He was game, and was eager to make a change in his life. I recommended Jim to my boss and argued that he was perfect for the role--and in truth, he was. Unfortunately, he completely bombed the phone interview. My boss basically said that he wouldn't have continued the conversation if I hadn't spoken so highly of the guy. I replied by saying that I'd put my reputation on the line because I firmly believed he was the right fit for the role, and that I'd coach him on interview techniques. Boss said okay, and scheduled him for the second round of interviews. Jim did really well the second time around, and he was subsequently flown out for the grueling all-day interviews with the rest of the team. Again, he did really well, and my boss made an offer.

Now, Jim had told me ahead of time that due to his family situation (lots of dependents), it would take him some time before he was able to move the family out here. He asked to stay with me for awhile, to which I replied, ""Sure, you've got a place to crash here for as long as we both can stand each other."" I followed this up by informing him that the absolute line in the sand was 6 months, and more realistically I was expecting him out after two or three months. He agreed to the terms.

Before he moved in, I broached the subject of rent. I basically said that I'd appreciate some help with the bills if he was going to be staying with me. He got extremely dodgy with his response and basically said that he'd be willing to pick up whatever house chores, but wasn't sure about money. Whatever. I figured that the more he was saving, the sooner he'd get the family moved out and the sooner I'd get my place back.

Speaking of my place: I'm an extreme introvert. I spend a ton of time alone, entirely because that's how I enjoy living my life. I work, I read, I code, I write, I play games--I'm 34 and pretty set in my ways. Offering him a place to crash was a big sacrifice, and he knew it up front. Moreover, despite having a 2 bedroom apartment, the only place for him to stay/sleep was the living room, as I use the other bedroom as an office. Thus, getting him situated in the new job, and then getting him the fuck out of my apartment was a pretty high priority for me. One might imagine that an extended stay in a living room would make it a high priority for him, too.

I also want to point out that the job was a net 50% raise from his previous salary, and he was getting a lump $10k relocation stipend as well. 

Day one, he moves in and sheepishly approaches me with some cash ($250), saying he didn't realize that he couldn't find a place out here for less than $900/month while he and the family got their shit together. I accepted the cash, and things got off to an okay start.

As the weeks rolled by, I could already feel my stress levels rising. This fucker eats more bread than medieval peasants, and decides to carve up bagels and fuck knows what else on every available bit of untouched counter space. I constantly found myself cleaning up entire handfuls of breadcrumbs almost every other day. Then lets talk about the sinks. Jim smokes a LOT of weed. I really don't care for it and don't use it myself, but I don't care all that much what other people do. However, it's had a nasty effect on his lungs. He has a deep, wracking cough that I have the pleasure of listening to at all hours of the day. What's worse, though, is that the ""public"" bathroom (the one connected to my office) has been desecrated by the fruit of his lungs. On the rare occasions when I use that bathroom, I've found some of the most utterly revolting dried up green shit coating a good half of the sink. I've seen shit that doesn't look like it could come from a human being, dried up and on display in that sink. It is fucking foul in ways that I can barely describe. I've also found little treasures dried up in the kitchen sink, as well. Then there's the fact that he can never seem to remember when the garbage is supposed to go out (despite us having the conversation at least half a dozen times), playing music too loud, leaving the patio door open in the middle of fucking summer, and more.

By the start of the third month, I told him to keep the rent money and to use it to help expedite him leaving. He hummed and hawed about it but eventually relented, keeping the money. We proceeded on for a few more weeks, and approached July. He again offered me rent, and I again told him I prefer he save it. To this, he replied that the family situation wasn't really about money anymore, and that if he didn't pay me the rent, he'd spend it on weed or strippers (yes, he's married). Fine, I said, and accepted the money. That night he rolls out to hang out with some co-workers, then calls me up and says he fucked up and miscalculated, and needs the money back. Fine, I said. He gets back that night and I give him back the cash.

Now at the 3+ month mark, he takes some paid time off and travels back home to see the wife and kids. For me, it was absolute bliss. I'd almost forgotten how wonderful it was when I was alone, and didn't have to confine my life to the two wings of my apartment. I dreaded his return.

While he was gone, a lot of my coworkers would ask how things were going since they know me and know that I'm a very solitary person. I told the truth--it fucking sucked. One of my coworkers, who has become good friends with Jim, mentioned he'd been asking about whether Jim was looking for places. The response was unsettling--""Nah, not really man."" What. The. Fuck.

Jim gets back, and he's in a good mood from seeing his family. Awesome, good for him. I grit my teeth for a few days and let him ride that high before I spoke to him in earnest about the situation. This past Friday, he went out and I stayed at home. I drank a little too much. He got back late, and I confronted him and said point blank that six months was no longer the upper limit. More than that, I told him that I just can't do this thing anymore--I've given as much as I can to help him with the major life change of a new job and moving the family, and that I was especially pissed because I was working under the assumption from day one that his reason for staying with me was to save money in the short term. To his credit, he said he understood. But honestly though, I can't help right now but feel like I've been fucking used here, and I'm starting to really resent the fuck out of Jim.

I've tried to be extremely accommodating throughout this entire journey, which started as early as February during the interview process, and which has proceeded through present with giving up a substantial part of my living space. I just can't do it anymore though--I never have the chance to recharge after a long day, and the stress is building and starting to impact my health.

So, am I the asshole by basically telling him to get the fuck out and get a place of his own?",25,102,0.92
928,not the a-hole,"I'm on mobile, so I'll try to keep this concise and not include any unnecessary details. Apologies for any less-than-ideal formatting.

My ex-girlfriend (age 18) and I (age 17) had been dating for a little over a year. It was the first long,  serious relationship for both of us. However, due to her leaving for college at the end of the summer and an agreement that a long-distance relationship wasn't for us, we both agreed to break up. She's a coworker at one of my jobs, and we still got along fine and were generally friendly. I figured it was great that we were still friendly and all was well.

3 weeks after we broke up, one of my friends had a party. My friend invited one of my ex's friends, and my ex asks if she can come too (she knew I was at the party). After giving it some thought I decide that's not a good idea and my friend politely says that since I'm here he'd prefer not to make it awkward and for her not to come. Neither her or her friend showed up, and the party was fine.

At the party, I became intoxicated and slept with another girl (age 17 who works at the job where my ex and I both work). This was a pretty fucking stupid idea. I think that I don't regret the act, but I very much regret the things that occurred from it.

It was rather naive of me to assume that my ex girlfriend wouldn't find out about this. A day or so after, I received a text from her asking if I had slept with the other girl. I decided to be completely honest and told her that I had. Apparently she had found out at work when the other girl had told another coworker. She went off on me, saying that I was the worst human ever, that she hates me and wishes she had never met me, and that I should never contact her or see her in person again. I also got flak from her brother, who texted me later saying how stupid and insensitive I was.

When I was at the party, I thought that such a thing would be a moral gray area at worst. I figured that I wouldn't really be upset if she did something like that (especially since she had mentioned at work to me that she was already getting hit on by several people), so she wouldn't really be bothered if I did it. Looking back on it, I know she probably still had feelings for me, and that I really offended her and devalued our whole relationship, which wasn't my intent at all. I cherish the relationship that we had and it holds a special place in my heart, and it hurts me to see that in her and her family's mind I pissed away a year of respect and love in an act that occurred 3 weeks after we broke up. This is where my deep regret lies, and it's probably the thing I regret the most so far in my life.

In addition to a broken relationship with her and her brother, she told her parents about it (who used to really like me), and they told mine. Her parents told my parents to tell me to stay away from both of them, which really stung. I'm facing a lot of repercussions for my dumbassery that I feel like I deserve. My parents are having me resign from my job that she works at, as well.

I don't really know what to think about this. Was my initial interpretation of the whole situation assholeish? Am I an asshole, or is this blown out of proportion? I imagine it's some of both, but I would much appreciate an outsider's perspective as I move forward with this and try to become a better person.",43,47,0.89
929,not the a-hole,"So my girlfriend and I moved into a house a few months ago(renting) with a roommate. Our bedroom closet was PACKED floor to ceiling with junk: Trash bags with dirty clothes, an old lamp shade, a beat up muffler, random pictures, etc. Among the junk was an old neglected violin. 

My landlord said it must have belonged to former tenants and said we could have it if we wanted it. I asked my roommate about it and he says he'll look through it and take care of it. We move the junk pile to a common room so we can use our closet and he can grab it when he goes to the dump.

Three months go by and the pile doesn't move. Every time I asked him about it he would promise to take it, but never did. A buddy of mine comes over one weekend and sees the violin. He's a bit of a musician and restores instruments as a hobby. We get to talking and I agree to sell it to him for $25. 

Another month goes by and a woman comes by the house looking for the violin. I explain to her what happened and she asks for the money, since it's hers. I offer her the money and a case of beer(I work at a brewery) if she will help clean up the junk that was with it(roommate still hasn't taken it to the dump). She argues, says she didn't live here and forgot it visiting her boyfriend over 8 months ago, and eventually leaves when I remain firm about wanting help cleaning the mess. She was very rude, unapologetic, and didn't accept any responsibility for her actions.

Had I known she would have randomly showed up I wouldn't have sold it, but I dont think she was in the right to just demand money without even an apology for leaving a mess that I ultimately had to take care of. The thing is if she had been nice about it I probably would have given her the money or called my friend to get it back, but she immediately antagonized me and didn't give me a chance.

I pull over, make enough room in the car to accommodate them, and yell back to see if they want a ride.  They are very surprised, since they didn't even have their signs out yet asking for a ride to Louisville, and had been too busy to see me getting ready for them.  

Turns out, it's two guys from Japan-- a waiter and bartender that came here from LA and are making their way across the country to go to New York City, hitch hiking the entire way.  I get pretty excited to find out they are Japanese and say a few phrases I have learned, we talk about places we have been, and what motivated them to come to the US.  

I'm not a  super outgoing person, I just like helping travelers, much to my girlfriends distress. She was a Peace Corp volunteer in South Africa for two years, which has resulted in her being very anxious about talking and helping strangers, since she was regularly followed home and harassed while she lived there.  Forgetting that she got off work early that day, I offered to let these guys come to my house, get a good shower and a quick meal, before I drove them to a good spot to continue their journey.

About 5 minutes from home, I remember that she only had to work for half the day, and I realized I needed to call her and get her approval before putting her in a situation I know she would feel uncomfortable with.   She was not pleased with my offer and after expressing her discomfort, I basically said, ""Are you putting your foot down on this?""  She ended up saying that she didn't want these strangers in our house.

I ended up driving them across the river to a good spot to continue their journey, after apologizing and explaining the situation.

Am I the asshole for doing something that many people, including my girlfriend, might consider dangerous (could have resulted in bad outcomes for my family if I was wrong about these guys).

933,not the a-hole,"So I brought my brand new vehicle (8 months old; \~7,000 miles) if for it's first oil change and tire rotation at a dealership that sells this vehicle, though it was not the one I purchased it from. I was initially told this work would take an hour. However, after two hours went by, I was approached by ones of the service managers. She informed me that the mechanic broken one of the locking wheel nuts and it would take a few more hours to get it off. Apparently, he tried to get if off with an impact gun, which you should never do. I told her that was fine, accidents happen, but I needed a loaner to get me to work since I had a meeting that day. She told me they couldn't get me a loaner, but someone from the dealership would drive me to work. I told her that was fine. So the guy brings me to work (nice guy, by the way) and all is well. I made it to my meeting.

Then it all starts to go wrong.

About an hour after getting to work, I get a call from the same service manager. Apparently, they would have to keep my vehicle overnight because they would have to drop the rear axle and hammer the wheel off. Now I'm getting concerned and frustrated. I told her that was fine but I really needed a loaner and would like to come see my vehicle before they did that work. She told me that they would have a loaner to me when I got off at 5:00 PM and that I could definitely come by and look at it. So the day goes on, I'm worried about my vehicle, and frustrated that this simple service is turning into a multi-day project. So I get the loaner and drive to the dealership. First of all, my vehicle is not sitting in a mechanic bay, but in front of the dealership. Second of all, there are chunks of metal missing from my wheel. The mechanic told me that they tried to hammer and chisel the broken pieces off the stud. As a car guy, I almost cried. Third of all, the mechanic hands me the piece of the locking nut that did break off and says, ""Did you want to keep this as a souvenir?"" I played it off as a joke, but I almost blew up in her face for thinking this was something to laugh about. But I kept calm and left the dealership.

The next day, I get a call from the service department. It was the guy that drove me to work. Says they got the wheel off, but are ordering me a new wheel (that they are paying for) because they damaged the original one. They said it would it be in and installed on Saturday (today).

First phone call I get this morning is from the service manager, ""Hey. We've had more issues. We broke an axle seal and it'll be here and installed Wednesday. We are sorry for these issues."" I tell her that's fine and we hang up. Well now I'm furious. So I left a review/warning on a private page of fellow owners of the same vehicle telling them what has happened and that the mechanics were incompetent.

I get a call an hour later from the head service manager requesting that I take it down because I was ""slandering"" the dealership after they have gone ""above and beyond"" what is expected by giving me a loaner and paying for the new parts (that they broke). She also admitted that the mechanic was a trainee and was not supervised while working on my vehicle. I was civil and I told her that I did not appreciate her calling me about this and that I would not take down the post until I reviewed the work done on my vehicle, and that I might not take it down because it's the truth.

So not only have they damaged my vehicle, but they have harassed me about a poor review. But now I'm worried I can be sued about calling them incompetent.

TL;DR: mechanics broke my vehicle, I left a bad review, the service department called me, and now I don't know what to do.

UPDATE: Sorry it took so long for this. I’ve been crazy busy at work and at home. I, of course, got my vehicle back 2 days after I made this post. All service was free of charge. However, the receipt they gave me at the dealership wasn’t the one with all the work listed on it. They said they would email that one to me. I received the email right as the clock hit 6:00 PM (the time the service department closes) and they had apparently broke my brake lines as well. I did a little shakedown drive with it to make sure nothing was rattling. Did an inspection and everything is tight and right.

937,not the a-hole,"Hi, so here's what happened. i was going through my game collection and decided to sell a few games i don't play anymore. At first, i took them to gamestop, who were only going to give me 2.50 dollars for each game, so i said forget it, and i thought i'd sell them on ebay


Keep in mind,  I have NEVER sold anything on ebay, i buy stuff like crazy, but i haven't ever sold anything.


So, Thursday, i posted an auction for the games. I wrote that i'd only ship to the U.S., and i specified in the auction it would be shipped using media mail. Which is cheap, but also incredibly slow. All this was specified. I did it because i want to make money, and i want them to actually pay for the games, not a exuberant amount for all the shipping.


All in all, my auction ended (35 dollars total for all the games, way more then Gamestop would've given me).


So, i check my email, and i recieved one that said ""Congratulations, you've sold internationally!""


I was confused because i was sure i'd marked ""U.S. only"", And, Just my luck. Some guy in Puerto Rico bought it. Now, at the time i made the auction, i had the shipping price be 4 dollars, which i figured would be the most it would cost to ship a package anywhere in the U.S.,  so i thought about it for a bit, and since Puerto Rico technically is part of the U.S., i just thought i'd be nice and ship it. I should've told him i only wanted to sell to Usa only, but it's kind of this whole big thing, because Puerto Rico technically is part of the U.S.. 


so, the auction ended on a Friday. i sent him an email to congratulate him, and everything, and i also left my phone number in case he had any questions (i know, stupid idea, but it was my first time). I just wanted him to be able to reach me if he had any concerns (plus, where i live, there's very bad cell reception, so my home phone is the best way to quickly contact me).


Anyway, i was curious how much it'd cost to ship the package to Puerto Rico, so i called the post office, they said about $3.95. So, i just figured i'll have to lose the few dollars. No big deal.


Anyway, about an hour later, i got a phone call (i have NO idea why he'd call me and not email me, but whatever). He called, asked if i was the guy from Ebay, and i told him yes, then he asked when i planned on shipping.


I told him i'd have to wait until monday, after the weekend, and i'd be shipping using media mail. I calmly explained it to him.


Then the guy, he starts like, yelling into the phone ""WHAT?! MONDAY?! MEDIA MAIL?! CAN'T YOU SHIP IT ANY FASTER?! CAN'T YOU  MY SON IS DYING TO GET THOSE GAMES! CAN'T YOU USE PRIORITY? YOU DO KNOW I WON'T GET IT FOR A F***KING MONTH, RIGHT?!""


So, i was kind of taken off guard, but i responded ""Woah, calm down, slow your roll buddy. All this was listed in actual auction. Plus, you only only paid 4 dollars for shipping. ""


So, he goes on another screaming tyrade, that i'm trying to scam him, and he asks why i'm waiting so late to ship. I explained to him that i live in the middle of nowhere, and have to go actually into town to get to the post office. Which is nearly a 2 hour drive, that i'd make it on the way to work on Monday. I was blunt and told him, it's just not gonna happen.


Then, he started asking ""Well, can't you at least get a tracking number or something?""


""They don't give you a tracking number with Media mail. You only paid 4 dollars for shipping. You get what you pay for""


He kept calling me a scammer, that i was trying to screw him over. I flat out told him, i was kind of frustated. (i don't like being called a liar, and this guy was majorly pushing my buttons. ""Dude, you paid 4 dollars for shipping. You know how much it will cost to send the fucking package to Puerto Rico? 3 dollars and 95 cents. So, yeah... I totally scammed you out of a whole nickel.""


So, he was quiet for a bit. I asked him ""So do you want to cancel the order? I mean, i'm sure someone else will be happy to get those games.""


He grumbled something, then he said (In a rather rude way) ""Well, it'll do. But, i wish you wouldn't be such a cheapskate""


So, i sent the package on Monday as promised. Using Media Mail as promised. Anyway, he left me negative feedback on my profile. He didn't leave any comments or anything, just a low score.


So, am i the asshole for being sarcastic to the customer, waiting 3 days to ship, and using a cheap and slow mailing service? (Even though this was all specified in the auction)",41,40,0.88
938,not the a-hole,"So a little backstory.

I work at a small local Cafe in my small town and I am the head barista. When we first started out i was making minimum wage and tips while working 40 hours.
After a few months they changed the pay of mine and two others, because we were ""managers"", to waiter pay with tips and they made us salary so we were guaranteed our 40 hours.
Now at that time I also started roasting coffee for the cafe. I'd spend atleast and 5-6 hours extra a week roasting the coffee. Sometimes id be compensated for it as a bonus and other times I wouldn't.
It went on like that for like 9 months and i never said anything until I realized they completely stopped compensating me for the roasting. At that time I said ""hey if you aren't paying me for this I'm not doing it.""
And they were like ok we will get someone else to do it.

Well I get my paycheck today to find out I'm shorted like 6 hours and I went to talk to my boss and he says I'm no longer salary. Noone said anything to me about that. I was told hey if you wanna start keeping track of your hours you can. Noone had mentioned anything to me about it. So I told them ""I'll roast the coffee I was originally roasting and get the overtime I deserved now that I'm hourly."" and they said no they have it covered so now I'm just pissed.

It feels like they were taking complete advantage of me and when I decided I wasn't gonna have it anymore they essentially demoted me. I have never been late and Ive never missed a day and I never start drama of any sort.
I feel hella unappreciated and I'm unsure if I'm gonna go back. ",53,215,0.94
939,asshole,"This sounds cliche and super familiar and I'm not looking for justification, just maybe a sliding scale of assholery-ness.

My friend has a very unstable attitude toward relationships in my opinion. Rather than talking it out, communication, and etc. etc., they will either commit themselves fully into a relationship (imagining weddings, kids, the ideal life) and obsess constantly over it, or entirely avoid the idea and put down themselves for even considering they had a chance. You get the idea. When not in a relationship, they will be bemoaning the fact they aren't in one. Past partners have found them to be clingy, needy, emotionally-draining, and their devotion to the relationship will begin to overshadow the other and place increasing growing expectations on a fragile bond. It doesn't end well.

Recently, my friend has found what could be the start of a new relationship. They've asked me for advice and I've repeatedly hammered down my belief of open communication, trust, honesty, which as far as I know, they've entirely discarded. Instead, as I tried to talk to them, they have begun spiraling into both extremes, simultaneously believing that they love the person and will do everything to marry them, while also believing that it might not work out, that they should break up, that this break-up would mean they could never talk to the person again. Whenever I try to advise against this (although I agree some initial separation can be good), they brusquely ignore my plea. I know this All-or-Nothing policy is extremely hurtful to not just my friend but also the date, ghosting is something I am highly against (unless the partner is abusive, etc. etc.) I do not want this spiraling affliction to harm others. Through another one of their friends, who I spoke to behind my friend's back, I found out who the date is. I had planned to talk to them privately and in the event that my friend decided to pull the trigger and ghost them, I wanted to offer some closure to them.

Then my friend found out through the friend I asked that I had been asking around and... told me off for not knowing the whole story and asking other people. Tbh, this kind of relationship drama is toxic and I regret getting involved now. How much of an asshole was I for going behind my friend's back?",35,45,0.91
940,not the a-hole,"Alright not looking for advice or anything because that ship has sailed but I'm just wondering what some peeps thoughts are...
So there was this girl I was really into. Wanted a romantic relationship but she said she had feelings for me but wasn't ready to jump back into a relationship (which is fair). She then tells me that she's going to Asia for 12 months, a decision which sucks but I support it, I also say we'll just see where we are when she gets back because what on Earth else were we meant to do? She has said she wants me to be happy but also that she felt she couldn't ask me to wait around.
Some time passes and a new colleague at my work asks me out. Immediately I run it past the girl, asking if she'd be okay with me just going on a date. She says yes and that she hopes I have fun.
Not literally 24 hours later I find myself receiving tearful phone calls, blocked on social media and told I'm a piece of scum because I shouldn't have gone on a date, even though she said that I should go for it the day before!

941,asshole,"Occasionally my wife has trouble getting to sleep and uses a sleep app on her phone to help her get there. I was lying awake a few nights ago and she said, “Here try my app, it’s already set for my favorite sounds.”
I listened for a minute and then looked at the names of the sounds she’d picked. It was a mix of “crackling fire” and “airplane travel.” I could hear the sounds of a roaring fire and the drone of the jet engines of a modern plane.
I said, “Do you realize you’re sleeping to the sound of a plane on fire? Would you like me to add the sounds of people screaming? You know, to get the full effect?”
Ok, I was just trying to be funny but now she’s pissed that when she uses the app now, in addition to the fire and engine drone she imagines people panicking as the plane is falling to a fiery crash.
She’s brought this up the last 3 days in a row as she searches for new sounds to help her sleep. I'm going to keep my mouth shut and not recommend something like, “children on a school bus” and “avalanche.”",59,129,0.75
942,not the a-hole,"So, today I go out for lunch with my girlfriend. When we get there the hostess seats us and asks what we'd like to drink. We were unsure so she said she'd send our waitress back through. After waiting ten minutes, she finally comes around to take our drink orders and our food orders. 
  Our food takes a while to cook, which I can't blame the waitress for, but as soon as we got our food she immediately hands us our check. 
That kind of rubbed me the wrong way.
  Then half way through the meal I'd finished my drink. Out waitress walked passed put table no less than four times in a fifteen minute span. Not once did she ask if I wanted a refill or to ask how everything was. 
I felt the service was subpar. So, I paid the bill and left without leaving a tip.

**Update**

In hindsight I should've left at least a dollar tip or something. I usually tip well. I just feel that if I were to tip her the usual 20 percent as everyone else, then it isn't fair to the servers who do work hard.  ",76,50,0.85

944,no a--holes here,"This one happened years ago.  I was in law school and dating a girl one class ahead of me.  I was a 2nd year, she just graduated. 

We only dated for 3 months total, but I knew she was getting really attached to me.  Seriously attached so for such a new relationship.  She had a touch of the crazy.  I knew by the second month things were going to end, but knew that she would lose her shit over the break up.    

The other factor was the timing.  She was one month out from taking the bar examination, the grueling 3-day test all lawyers have to take to get a licence.   I live in the hardest state, and the test has a 54% passage rate.  Yes, it takes three years of school, three months of solid 12 hour a day study, and the chances of success are only half.  High stakes indeed.  

I firmly believed, and still do, that if I broke up with her right in the middle of the prime study period she might fail, leading to a setback which, in the tight job market for lawyers back then (that year was historically the worst for lawyer employment since the great depression), would cost her significantly.  There is a cachet to being a ""first time passer"" and the test is only held twice a year.  

Another issue that lead to the breakup is a bit more shallow.  When we first dated, she was gorgeous and fit.  In the two months, possibly due to the stress of the test and the security of being in a relationship, she gained 40 pounds and I was less attracted to her.  

I didn't love this woman, but I certainly liked her and didn't want to ruin her bar exam or career.  Because of this, for a full third of our brief relationship, I lied.  I pretended to be in love with her, fucked her, and made all the usual gestures.   Now to be sure, as a mitigating factor, I didn't volunteer the ""I love yous"" but reciprocated when it would be awkward that I not.  There is no mitigation of the fucking.  

The day after the bar exam, we broke up and she flew into an expected rage/meltdown.  She also ferreted out, due to the timing, that I was playing along because of the bar exam and was pissed about that to, although I'm not sure that is sever-able from the general anger over being dumped. 

So Reddit, AITA for doing this?  I thought I was doing her a favor, but this seems a wobbler to me. ",37,91,0.93
945,not the a-hole,"This happened Saturday night. The people across the street were having a gender reveal party and I assume doing some drinking. Around 8:30 maybe, they started launching off fireworks and because it was so close to our house, they were very loud. Loud enough to wake up my infant son, but I was gonna just let that go. Hey, it's right after the 4th of July and they're celebrating something really exciting. Have your fun.

What angered me was when I looked out the window and saw that they were launching the fireworks right next to my car. Like two feet away. Now their guests had lined the whole block with cars. My car was parked across the street and maybe 10-15 feet sideways from their house, so this was a deliberate choice. Then they started piling the spend fireworks boxes on another neighbor's grass. Mind you, to do so, they had to walk to the street, pick up the garbage, and make the conscious decision to carry that garbage to another property, rather than bringing it back to their own on the way to get the next box to launch off. Needless to say, I was angry.

Here's what I did. I guess it was passive aggressive. I walked to the car between launches and started inspecting it, making sure no debris had fallen on it. One guy, 50s or 60s maybe, says to me, ""Do you want to move the car?"" I replied, rather angrily, ""No, do you want to move the fireworks?"" Then I added rather spitefully, ""You also woke up my infant son."" Then I stormed off back into my house. Immature? Yeah probably. But how could a whole group of adults make the conscious decision to launch large fireworks off right next to a stranger's car, rather than either any of the dozen plus cars that belonged to them, or in the nearby intersection were there were no cars at all?

The fireworks stopped after that.

947,colossal asshole,"So I [M22] met this girl [F22] 3 years ago. We fell for each other practically at the moment since we share loads of interests and we have similar personalities, but I was dealing with a huuuuge depresion at the time that led me to want to suicide. Obviously I never did but as I was going to do it I told her that I wanted to cut all contact. I didn't told her why because I thought it was better to not make her feel responsable. The past year we met eachother again and it seems like she's now studying in another place that it's pretty far from here, yet the things seemed to be the same as it was before I was depressed. But after a couple of months Idk why but she went from telling me that she loved me to ghosting me from one day to another. It hurt me a lot because it seemed that suddenly she did not give a shit. My last summer was horrible because I did not know what the hell I had done to her. She even deleted my number. The fact is that at the end of the summer it seemed that she remembered me again and we spoke again, but it was clear that things had changed. In october I found out that she had been fucking with someone, which happened after a short time. It's not like we were dating or else so she can do wathever she wants but that made me realize that obviously she was not interested in me at all and I decided to stop caring about her even as a friend and I stopped talking to her. 


Fast forward to this summer. Some friends and I are going to a place that is close to where she lives - honestly, I did not know this up until this morning. We have rented a house for a few days and we have planned to set up a party, to which it seems that a lot of people have been added. The fact is that she knows that I will be there for a few days and she asked me today that she wants to see me, but the problem is that I only see her as a possible hookup. As I said, I don't see her as a friend and I don't feel nothing for her either. Otherwise I just can go there and stay with my fellas having fun in the house we rented together which is after all what we planned together. WIBTA if I said that to her? I would be down for a hookup and nothing more so technically I don't think that I'm acting like an asshole specially since even if there was a huge connection between us that is long dead and it was her who cutted it.",38,26,0.74

I love that goddamn dog, we all do. Now here's the problem: my sister's boyfriend keeps  bugging him. I'm talking about scaring him by screaming at him and patting him even though he doesn't like it. My dog gets crazy, he barks, cries, hides behind the couch and things like that. We know he thinks he's just playing with him or he's doing something funny. But he's not. Not only is he harming the old fellow, it really bothers me and my sister. We've told him to just stop it, it's not good for the dog and is just overall not ok, but he just shakes it off. Today he was particularly annoying. My sister, her boyfriend and our dog were at the kitchen and I heard how my dog started to bark and sort of cry and my sister told her boyfriend to stop it, but he just laughed it off and kept going. That was it for me. I stormed into the kitchen and yelled at him to stop attacking the dog and to not touch him again. He got upset and left. Shortly after, my parents told that I should not have done that and gave me the whole speech. I tried to defend myself telling them it's not the first time he does this and that we tried to stop him in more peaceful manners but he just didn't care. Then, my dog vomited and when my sister's boyfriend came back into the room our dog hid from him. I told them that the evidence that he was harming our dog by making him angry was right there.

Cue today, I look up the rsvp and it is smack-dab in the middle of the Disney trip. I really love my friend and this is a special time for her, but I've also made the commitment to go on this trip for a while now. For context, I don't have any role in the wedding besides being a guest. 

So that brings us to my plan. **WIBTA** if I apologized for mixing up dates and telling her I can't attend the wedding?

When my sister and I were born, my parents invested £8000 for each of us with the intent to cash them in when we went to university. The one for me was in my Dad's name, and the one for my sister was in my Mum's name. For context, my parents are now divorced. They were never rich, but my Mum is big on saving and wanted to give us a head start in life.

When I was moving out to go to uni, I asked if I could have the money as my student loan was only going to be paid to me after I needed to pay my first installment of rent (it was charged by semester and was around £3000 for the first installment). My Mum was very eager for me to have it, but said that as it was in my Dad's name I would have to ask him to cash it in. 

When I asked, my Dad had actually forgotten it existed, but said that now that he knew about it he needed the money himself. He was going through his second divorce I think at the time (timeline is hard to keep up on!) and wanted the money for a deposit on a flat, but said that he would pay it to me as soon as he could afford to. My Mum was furious with him, but my Grandparents helped me with my first rent payment and we all moved on. 

It is now around 3 years later. My fiancée and I have had a lot of expenses this year, including using all our savings getting out of a moldy and badly maintained flat. I just graduated, and am hoping to start my own business as a driving instructor, with all the costs that that would entail. We also have a wedding to plan and pay for. 

Knowing all of this, my Mam asked my Dad again (without my knowledge at the time) if he could pay me the money that they had put aside for me. He answered that everyone has to make their own way in life (ironic, as he lived rent-free with my Grandparents for a long time, and they have loaned him large sums of money over the years, as well as paying for half of his wedding to my Mum - they were not happy to hear that he had said this considering all the help they have given him!). He also said that I 'unfortunately' chose to spend my money on the new flat and so had to live with my choices. 

Generally, I would agree with this. I hate to ask for help from anyone, and am proud of where I am in life due to my own work and decisions. I can also see the pov that it's not my money and so I don't get to decide what is done with it. However, that money was always intended for me, and was put away jointly by my parents, one of whom really wants me to have it.

954,not the a-hole," I was shopping with my friends in a makeup store which sells various brands. My friend likes a lipstick, but the price of that item is not written, so I grab it for her and ask an employee. She tells me that I have to ask the cashier.

I think this is actually an ok thing, since the employees don't have to memorize everything.

So I get in the line, I wait a couple of minutes, and when it is finally my turn, I ask the cashier ""May I learn the price of this lipstick?"" while making eye contact.

She scans it, proceeds to bag it, and demands payment. I politely tell her that I only wanted to know the price of it.

This is where it gets out of control. She looks at me in disgust, she basically yells a very sarcastic"" thank you"" to my face, then storms out.

I think this behavior is very uncalled for, and I am not faulty. And I think she was really rude. She might had a bad day, I am aware of that, but as a customer, I felt like this is not an ok thing to do. So I called the information center of the store, and complained about her. A week later, the store informed me that she got a warning and now I am not sure about my behavior. Am I the asshole here?

This store is  not big, there are usually 2 cashiers and 4 sales associates. The store is on the cheap side, and they have big sales from time to time. So I guess they had to change the stickers a lot, but this item didn't have any. About the sales associate, she didn't even had the leave her zone, because she could simply hand it to the cashier from where she was standing, it was that close. And I agree on people who think that the cashier might have other problems as well, this is why I am secong guessing myself. But on the other hand, even after she expected some sort of payment, I wasn't rude. I look like a high schooler even though I am older, so maybe she thought I wouldn't but anything. Even after taking that into consideration, this reaction is still a lot, since this store has a lot of younger customers imo. But I am here to ask for yours, so, thanks to everyone, you brought different aspects which I didn't think about to the table. ",51,180,0.87

958,not the a-hole,"I just woke up like 10 minutes ago and I'm on mobile so bear with me.

My BF woke me up to tell me his 2 friends texted him to invite him to brunch. They said I could come too. I am disoriented from being woken up and he wanted to leave within 20 minutes which for me isn't enough time to shower and get ready. He also mentions that his friends are already drunk from the bottomless mimosas at the brunch place.

Now my BF and I have recently moved in together and we pretty much spend ALL our time with one another. He doesn't hang out with his friends as much because usually when they ask him to hang out we already have plans. I also think he feels guilty for going out with his friends and leaving me home because I don't really have any friends which I have NO problem with. I want him to have a life outside of me.

Well when he woke me up I immediately knew I didn't want to go. The idea of not showering, sitting with his friends who I don't know that well, while they drink and talk and I just sit there because I'm not of drinking age yet and I know I'd just have to play designated driver to my BF does not sound fun and how I want to spend my Sunday.

I told him if he gets drunk, just to call me and I'll pick him up because the place is like 2 miles away. But since I told him I'd rather not go because of all the reasons listed above, he was acting very put out and annoyed that I wasn't going. He kept telling me he ""just wanted to spend time with me"". So now I feel like the asshole. So reddit, does it sound like I'm the asshole?",14,29,0.83

961,not the a-hole,"I play a lot of games online with a friend. Almost everyday. Weekends he gets his kid and thats fine. I've played a couple of games online with the kid but like most young children he isn't good with teamwork, wants the best everything, and whines when he doesn't get his way.


I've remained polite about it but made it kind of obvious I don't want to play with his kid. I dont ask him to play on weekends so I don't get roped into playing with the kid. I think he noticed because he kinda subtweeted about it by praising another friend for playing with the kid once.


Today we where doing pretty good at a shooter when I hear his kid in the background complaining he wants to play. So i know its a few more games then he will hand of the game to him. He was in the middle of telling the kid he would probably be playing with me but I told both of them bye. He seemed kind of bothered by it.


I consider both of us to be good friends and good players. We have good chemistry and haven't ever had a real argument other then in game banter.  When you are at the level we are in certain games its just really hard to play with someone who is to young not to act self entitled and oblivious to combat mechanics. I think my friend might be a little upset by it but wont say anything directly.

Skip to later and he *hates* the controller. It's not sensitive, the buttons suck and he keeps dying in his game. I told him to give it a few rounds and adjust the sensitivity. He's getting frustrated, mad at the TV, etc. And finally yells, ""why did you jinx me?""

I say it's not my fault and he would have hated the controller no matter what I said. He continues to say I jinxed him (but in a tone that isn't humorous or calm. He's still upset) and saying, ""why did you even make that comment? Now I've wasted time and money."" 

I said I didn't want to hear it and walked out to go read in another room. It seemed like a tantrum to me about the situation so I left before I got more upset. I expected him to cool down and do the same.

He came in 30 minutes later and throws some pillows as a joke at me. I say back, ""I hope you're here to apologize or I don't want to talk."" (Yeah. I know. Not my finest hour. )

He gets upset and says I should apologize and I tell him I don't want to talk as I'm obviously still upset and saying snarky things. He continues to say my comment was not appreciated (the earlier *joke* comment about the controller). I repeat I don't want to talk. He goes on for a while and says he gave me time and keeps saying what upset him and telling me not to ignore him. I keep telling him to leave. Finally I snap and make him leave me alone, making him more angry. He's out right now and we're still not talking.

I get firey angry a lot, but often repress it, so I can never tell when I'm the asshole. I don't want to apologize, because I feel like these ""tantrums"" (a subjective word, I know) are getting out of hand. Am I the asshole for wanting to stand my ground?

Me and my sister have never been on good terms, even when we were little I don't think we got along well. Before she moved out of our parents to live with her now husband, she took and I assume sold a lot of things of mine.

At the time I was in New York with a friend and his family. I came back and found my laptop, and a large majority of my game collection missing. When I called my sister about it she just said something like ""I didn't think you needed any of that crap, besides I need the money more than you need hundred of shit you don't use"". And of course my family sided on her saying it was the family's responsibility to support each other (even though I know for sure they didn't give a cent). 

I never got an invitation, though my parents asked me if I was going with them. Day after I got a call from my dad saying my sister was ""upset"" about me not going and that she didn't invite me because she just thought I was coming (even though every one else got a personal invite).

968,not the a-hole,"My husband and I have a 2.5 and 4.5 year old.  When I was pregnant with my oldest, my MIL came by our house unexpectedly and said she'd quit her job and wanted to watch our first child. She said she'd do it for free and she would take on other kids to earn her living.   The only really downfall is she lives 20 minutes away from our house, 40 when traffic is bad.  It's 'kind of' on my way to work (adds 20 minutes in the morning and 45-60 at night) and is completely out of my husband's way (about 45+ extra minutes each way).

Before we got pregnant with child 2, and before we bought a house, I approached her with what I was thinking of doing.  I said, ""Before we get pregnant and choose a house, I need to know if you'll want us to start paying you so I can plan accordingly.""  She said she would never charge us more than $200 per month TOTAL.  I made her confirm that a few times before my husband and I got pregnant and chose a house based on that promise.

Sometime around the time child 2 was born, my SIL found out we weren't paying her mother for childcare.  She called all the relatives to let them know how horrible we were, and her mom ended up telling us she needed $120 a week.  We made that work, despite the fact that we were now house poor, she had broken her promise, and it's totally inconvenient for us.  (yes, I know that's hardly any money, but it's a lot more than $200 a month).  For the past 2.5 years, we've paid her $120 a week, or $480-$600 a month.

As she's gone along, she's gotten increasingly passive-aggressive.  She gets angry if I drop them off too early, so since I can't see the future of traffic, I often pull over down her street and do my makeup or play on my phone while my kids scream at me to go.  My husband picks them up four days a week, between 4:30 and 5, and I pick them up one.  When I pick them up, it's not until 5:30, and that makes her angry.  She also takes off an excessive amount of time, somewhere around 20 days this year.  I only have 17 days off, so I have to keep paying double child care by paying for a local babysitter while still paying her.   I've used 5 days of my PTO on myself and the rest on her days off.

Two months ago I learned my husband is an alcoholic and he entered 6 weeks of rehab. I did pickup (5:30 p.m.) and drop off (7:45 a.m.) for those 6 weeks.  About a week after my husband blindsided me with his drinking, my MIL discovered I'd changed the locks on our house to ensure my husband didn't think he could come home between detox and rehab.  She went off on me in her driveway in front of my kids, calling me an f'in b\_\_\_\_.  Also that week, when she discovered I'd told her ex, my husband's dad, about his illness, she called me and cussed me out and said I had no right to tell him, etc.  My SIL in the interim sent me an incredibly nasty text that I was a strange, different, no one liked me, etc. etc.   They both subsequently apologized in a text, which I didn't respond to.

Things have continued poorly.  There were some more words this morning when my MIL learned I was picking up the kids at 5:30 p.m.  She said she had just assumed from here on out my husband would pick them up 5x a week, and at 4:30 p.m., and she had dinner plans at 5:30.  We never had that conversation!  I have *no idea* why she thought that.  My husband just missed 6 weeks of work - paid - and can't be leaving work at 4 to get them 5 days a weeks.  He's supposed to work 8-5.

Once I got to work this morning, I threw out my lifeline and called my dad.  He has agreed to give my husband and I $1000 a month for childcare, and we'll pay the other $1000.   I can afford this because I can stop paying $230 a month to park downtown (there's a free bus program for people that work downtown that I can now use since I won't have carseats), I won't be paying $200 a month extra for my kids to go to an additional preschool a few days a week, and I'll save at least $100 a month on gas.   I've found a great *local* place that is open from 6am to 6:30 p.m. and my husband was nice enough to tour it for me at noon today.  There are 1001 benefits to this place.

After the tour, my husband called to tell me that although the place is great, he wants to wait until September, or even fall 2019 when my son starts kindergarten, to make the switch.  He doesn't want his mom to be without money and, in all honesty, there is one child she's still watching, who is leaving permanently in 6 weeks, and she wouldn't be able to watch that kid and get a job, so that kid's parents would be up a creek for the next 6 weeks.  That said, we may not be able to get ours into this preschool if we don't act fast.  And if my MIL doesn't find a new kid soon, she will have to find a job and stop watching my kids anyhow, which I've known.   Also, he thinks since my MIL texted me an apology for cussing me out in front of my kids, everything is in the past and I need to let things go.

My husband is slow to act, and he's too nice to people, and I hate this situation I'm in.  I've dealt with his alcoholism and his mother and this crappy commute long enough and I have an out.  Hearing that he liked the place, I went behind his back and completed the form and enrolled our kids to start  June 16th, Monday after next.

My husband is upset because I've moved so fast.  I told him he needs to tell his mom we won't need her services after next week.   I've told him that a) he can call the new childcare place and see if he can secure a spot for September, and we can start then (he refused) and b) I'll call his mom since I'm the one who wants this change.  He won't let me do that either, probably because he knows I won't sugarcoat it.

I feel like I've had to primarily deal with his mom for the last several years while dealing with his alcoholism and that I finally found an out.  He wants to just coast along.  I need to get some stress off my shoulders and this is a great opportunity.   My husband will never make a decision on his own. If I don't do it, it doesn't get done, which is why I've signed up already. He's not mad that I signed up behind his back, just mad that I signed up at all.

AITA for thinking I'm perfectly justified to get out of this toxic childcare relationship asap with only a week's notice, and AITA for thinking you can't call your boss an f'in b..., among other things, and expect they'll give you 2 months notice before firing you?

969,everyone sucks,"So my girlfriend (whom I live with) has always wanted a dog. And me, I like dogs *but* I do not want the responsibility of owning one. Well one day she told me her sisters dog had puppies (boxers - one of my least favorite breed) and I expressed to her that I don't want a dog, I want nothing to do with a dog, etc etc. Well she kinda got the whole attitude of well im doing it anyways. I told her if she gets a dog I am having 0% to do anything with it. I'm not helping with bills, training, feeding, taking it outside, ANYTHING. I don't want the responsibility. 

Well fast forward a few months later and here we are with a 60lb 8 month old boxer.... And I hate it. We live in a smaller 750 sqft apartment so this dog is always in my presence and that alone annoys me. When left alone, It chews anything near by, destroys blinds, tears up carpet and generally trashes the place. It's so irritating to be mid conversation or mid TV show and have to stop what your doing because the dog is up to some shit again. It's a small apartment and a rather big dog. We cant put it in the bedroom alone because shit will get ruined. I know some of this may seem trivial, but when i mean I didn't want a dog, I mean I didn't want to deal with literally anything the whole ""dog package"" has to offer. 

I make sure my girlfriend knows I don't like it. I call the dog a bitch (mostly to be ironic; it's a female dog) when it acts up, push it away from me whenever it's close, ignore it as much as possible, I don't feed it, I don't let it out of it's cage, and if it whines and barks I tell it to shut the fuck up. I literally do nothing for this thing. 

Okay so that seems pretty bad now that I typed it out and am reading it and I'm probably gonna be deemed an asshole. But I've never actually hurt the dog, and never intend to. In my defense it doesn't understand English, so it's fine. 

It just sucks because I'm paying to live with this animal that I really don't want to deal with. My girlfriend and I split rent so there should be compromise, but with this dog, there was none. She brought this thing into my house and I'm already tired of it. 

On the bright side (for me) my gf knows not to ever ask anything of me for this dog and has been keeping up to that standard so far",174,170,0.81
970,not the a-hole,"I have been trying to be vegan for a bit over a year now. When I say ""trying"" I'm mean I'm in college and vegan when I'm at school, but every time I visit home for more than a day or two I end up ""taking a break"" from it because my family gets so upset that I won't eat meat with them. Not that I won't go to places that serve meat, or that I complain about the lack of vegan food at the house, whatever. I mean we'll go out for burgers and I'll just get fries and they'll get mad at me. Or, because there are very rarely things I can eat in our house because my family lives on fish and pizza, sometimes I'll just skip meals. I don't complain about it, I don't mind, I'd rather be hungry than eat dairy or meat, but if my mom notices she hasn't seen me eat in a while she'll get angry at me and I give in. Or they'll ""forget"" I'm trying to do this and they'll buy me good deli meat and then accuse me of being ungrateful when I turn them down. Or they'll get mare me something with fish and then be absolutely baffled when I say I won't eat fish, or something with just a little bit of dairy or an ingredient that is obscurely non-vegan and think I'm being nitpicky for refusing. I told them this summer I didn't want to take a break again and I really wanted to be vegan all the time, and they seemed supportive at first, mom even mailed me only vegan candy for Easter instead of chocolate like usual, but once I got home it was out the window. It's better because my dad is doing keto so there vegetables in the house now so I can eat, but it's still an issue when we go out for dinner and I have been guilty into eating dairy.

Anyway, we have a family reunion coming up, and my mom is *furious* that I'm planning on being at least vegetarian. The whole extended family is hunters and trappers, so there's gonna be a lot of game meat at every meal, and all of the major meals are going to be entirely meat-centric. My mom says that if I refuse to eat the meat dishes at the knytkalas (when everyone brings a dish and we all eat them together?) it's rude and I'll offend everyone. There's also one restaurant in the town that is a family tradition to go to, but pretty much the entire menu is just fried chicken and french fries, and my mom says it would be ""ridiculous"" for me to only eat the fries at such a great restaurant and that I'm ruining the family tradition and being stubborn if I'm unwilling to participate.

I understand that my preferred diet is very different from theirs, and I don't want to be a hassle, and I don't want to be rude, and I don't want my family to feel like they're failing me by not feeding me (something I know my aunt will think), but at the same time, separating myself from animal agriculture is important to me and I hate that I keep letting myself get roped back in.

But I know that food is love, and I know that my family feels guilty when there's nothing for me to eat, and I know that a lot of the foods at the reunion will be important and traditional and it might be disrespectful or insulting for me to refuse them.

We played mostly Rainbow Six Siege, and had fun. We started playing less & less often, because when we played he would insult me about every move I make in the game. & not in a joking way either.

You’re probably thinking “why haven’t you told him to fuck off already?” Well, it’s because I knew since the first week I met him he had depression. He had the signs in his voice & what he said & eventually he told me.

I didn’t give up on him. Even as his attitude got worse, I stayed with him.

But when I let my brother play with him, & got the headphones back, he said my brother sounded like a “fucking retard”. 

That was too far. I called him out on it & he called me a piece of shit. I left the party & blocked him. He messaged me that it’s terrible that I unfriended him because he had “horrible depression” & that I was a horrible person.

I pointed out that he was using his depression as an an excuse & he said  “I guess I’ll kill myself now” & I just didn’t say anything. I reported him & haven’t talked to him since. 

I don’t know if I did the right thing or not, I kind of feel bad.

Tl;dr:my friend was an asshole & went to far & I blocked him so he said he was gonna kill himself & now I feel bad about it.",67,272,0.94
984,not the a-hole,"My bf and I just got back from a party at a friends house. While at the party someone pulled out a joint and my bf said “that a joint or a f*ggot? I don’t want to suck a f*g”. 

Obviously this was meant as a joke, but it didn’t go over well with the audience so he continued to make homophobic innuendos using that word to try and get a reaction. A close friend of mine in the audience happens to be gay. Everybody around was clearly very uncomfortable from what he was saying so we left shortly after. 

Fast forward to us getting home and he apologizes for using that word and being belligerent. I say “yeah it wasn’t cool, especially since you said it in front of [gay friend]”

At this point he gets mad at me for not telling him about my friends sexuality. From his perspective he grew up in a very homophobic family and I should know that he makes homophobic jokes. He thinks I need to tell him which friends are lgbt so he can not make homophobic jokes around them. 

My perspective is that these jokes aren’t okay to make around anybody. Anybody around you could be lgbt so any time you decide to make a homophobic joke you accept the risk of offending someone and looking like an asshole. Also he knew he was being homophobic because he apologized to me when we got home. Furthermore “outing” someone else isn’t something I am comfortable doing to begin with. ",48,29,0.9
985,not the a-hole,"So I'd consider myself a loving husband and we have a mostly good relationship. There are quirks to it, but it's fine with me. But one big quirk is that she goes to her mom's house religiously on Sunday's like a born again Christian going to church, except she is there all day. Like she wakes up, heads out, and stays all day until it's time to sleep.

I go with her most times just to spend time together but it's honestly exhausting for me. I don't care for her mom. She's alright to me, she is just not a good person to other people. Very self serving and I can't respect her for it. Let alone do I want to spend a whole day out of every one of my weeks with her.

I've vocalized that I would rather us stay home or just do something together. But she's very defensive over spending the day with her mom. Fine...but I work nights and she works days, and we have different days off... So I like to spend Sunday days with her so that we can help make the marriage work. So I just go 90% of the time.

Now, the 10% of the time that I don't go, I always get something in return from the mom. Like a ""oh he must not love me or something!"" Kind of act. And she kind of does it a little tongue-in-cheek...But the way she has a grip over her daughter, my wife, I think in her head she's being serious about it. I'm sick of it. 

I'm sitting in my car waiting for them to get back to her mom's house now because I guess they went out together, and I spent lunch with my mom for her birthday. My wife didn't want to go to lunch for my mom's birthday...would rather hang out with her mom...fine.",74,517,0.99
986,not the a-hole,"So I moved in to this house with 3 others after leaving an abusive relationship. The 3 roommates have not worked in sometime. One of them have been trying to get disability. So whatever she is excused I suppose. But the other two are just pretty lazy and don't do anything. 

Anyways, the day after I moved in I handed over a thousand dollars. 500 for June and 500 for July. I still have not gotten a key and I have been locked out of the house... This will be the 5th time. I gave them the grand to ""catch up on bills"". When I asked for a key the first time I got locked out it was... ""I'll go get one made today"" the 3rd time I was locked out for 3 hours while they were off eating dinner... (But they can't pay their bills) roommate #2 says ""well I didn't want to make a key if you were gonna move right out"" I laughed it off and was like whatever, if I wasn't sure I wouldn't have dropped a grand to live here. Now I am currently locked out while they are asleep even after banging on the door and and windows/ calling, texting, fb messages. 

A few nights ago they came back from the store and they were like ""oh we forgot to get a key made"" like for real??? I was also locked out at this time as well..m Dude started asking me why I stay out late and asking me why I don't always hang out here. I kinda was ""shady"" as he says and didnt feel like I needed to answer any questions... For one I am the only one who pays any bills and second I am a 31 year old woman and If I want to stay out until 3 or 4 in the morning, it is my business not theirs. I stay to my self and clean up after myself. I don't ask them any thing when they leave, because they are adults and it isn't my business. 

I am considering demanding one of their keys. The chick and rm #2 share a room and maybe they would actually go get a key made. Would that be an asshole move? I don't want to be rude or an asshole... But this is getting ridiculous... I have been here for 3 weeks and I am getting sick of this. I have been sitting out here for almost 4 hours now.


Edit/ roommate #1 finally just let me in. I immediately asked that a key got made today. The two are going to Pittsburg today and she says they won't have time to get it made they would do it tuesday when they get back. I said why don't one of you leave a key with me since you both are leaving and both have a key.. She said something about not having house funds atm. I said IDC, I will use my own money. She had nothing to say. I am going to assume they will try to not give me a key for some bullshit reason. Also, they asked if I would be able to give them more money for July to ""help out""...

She didn't really have any clothes so I I loaned her an expensive jacket while she was staying with me. A couple months later she became very sick and was hospitalized. She was diagnosed with cancer. 

Her family had not been part of her life for the last twenty years. Her mother showed up at the hospitol and took her off of all treatment, stopped all visits, took her phone away, and cut her off from the outside world. She basically made it so she would just starve to death and moved her death along as swiftly as possible. 

She had the jacket with her at the hospital but I felt bad and didn't want to take it from her in case she got cold in the hospital as well as the fact that she really liked the jacket.

995,not the a-hole,"TL;DR: My boyfriend's friend shows up unannounced, asked my boyfriend to hangout even though he knows I'm over, and within the next 20 minutes I'm being dropped off at home without even a proper goodbye.  

Edit: he texted me asking if him and Andy could come into my house with no explanation. I didnt have my phone on me so he ended up just leaving. 

I've been dating my boyfriend for a year now. Due to the fact that we live close to one another, we tend to spend a lot of  each other's home. Today we were at his house playing video games and about to eat dinner when his friend messages him saying he's outside. The friend in question, let's call him Andy, has been away at University since December but they play a lot of Xbox together. Andy shows up at my boyfriend's house unannounced so my boyfriend walks out to talk with him and catch up and stuff. I don't mind. 

I'm sitting outside on his porch because my anxiety makes me uncomfortable being in his house with his family by myself (yes, even though it's been a year. Ridiculous, I know) and I want to let him talk to his friend. My boyfriend walks over to me and just says ""I'm going to hangout with Andy, we'll take you home."" It was so sudden and caught me off guard all I could ask was ""what about the pizza?"" You know the pizza we we're just about to eat? Within the next few minutes I'm sitting by myself in the back set of Andy's car with a piece of pizza on my lap while my boyfriend sits in the passenger seat talking to Andy and not including me in the conversation at all. They drop me off at my house and I get the most rushed and pathetic goodbye I've ever gotten from him. He didn't even say ""I love you"" and I didn't want to say it first in front of his friend. 

Just to be clear, I don't care that he wanted to hangout with Andy. He's completely free to hangout with his friends instead of me. I'm upset because I felt so insignificant with how fast he decided to hangout with Andy and without even talking to me or inviting me like he usually does. He has other friends that he's hung out with in the past month as they've come home from University and he's always asked me if I want to tag along or at least gave me a 30 minute heads up. Also the fact that within 15 minutes of Andy showing up, I'm back at my house without even a proper goodbye makes me feel so irrelevant to him. Not to mention how rude Andy is for just showing up and asking him to hangout out even though he knew I was there and my boyfriend was busy. ",69,191,0.94
996,not the a-hole,"So basically, I'm a 21yo female who's like 5'3 to paint a picture. I moved into a new house for my final year at uni and my first meeting with my landlord really didn't go well. 
I'd moved in early because 2 days before my bf of 2 years had dumped me. That should tell you how amazing I was feeling about life. 
So I'm in the bathroom just doing my make up (thank god) blaring my breakup playlist when my landlord bursts into the room. The bathroom, let me remind everyone. 
He proceeds to tell me he didn't realise anyone was in, as my music is still playing, and telling me how ""the door has a lock you know, you just turn it like this"" a couple of times. 
I'm pretty pissed and getting more annoyed as he keeps talking. Eventually he keeps asking why I'm even here so I kinda just let all my anger out about why I was there. 
It was bad and I feel bad, especially since he's told my roommates that he avoids me now. He'll barely speak to me, won't come in my room even if he knocks to be let in. It's awkward. It makes me think that maybe catching me at such a rough time was a big indication of me being an asshole over the break up :| 

Edit: since I'm being called an asshole a lot for me being there early I thought I should clarify that yes I was earlier than I thought but my lease had started. I was allowed to move in after a certain date and had paid an extra amount of rent to be allowed since I worked in the town. The only reason I didn't move in right away was because of staying with my ex boyfriend. Also, my landlord is not a tenant and while playing music loudly, I was the only tenant in the house at that time due to this being around September and term not beginning until late the next month.

Shortly after I got in line a woman came in line behind me so now there was a woman taking her sweet time with no regard for the people behind her, me, and another woman.

1014,not the a-hole,"TL;DR- my BIL has shown signs of being abusive and has intentionally spread rumors about me for five years. Now suddenly he’s interested in reconciliation and I’m really not interested. Family thinks I’m an asshole, so I’m asking the all knowing Reddit for its opinion. 

Long story short, I used to date my brother in law. We dated for 4 months, six years ago. Relationship was fine, then he broke it off on Christmas Eve because I wouldn’t have sex with him and immediately started spreading rumors about me. Ironically the rumors were mostly based on the idea that I had cheated on him and was a slut. I think he was trying to alienate me from our mutual friends so he could “win” them in the break up. He even beat me at a party soon after the break up and told me to “stay away.” I was too naive to report him, thinking he was a good guy that didn’t mean it. I’m an idiot, I know. But I did keep pictures. 

The better part of a year later I fell in love with my husband. We had always been close and had never stopped hanging out after the break up. I got threatening voicemails from my ex warning me to leave his little brother alone, “or else.” I love my husband deeply and so we got married despite knowing that family dynamics might be difficult. We now have a three year old son together and are even more in love today. :) 

Anyway, for the first four years of our marriage I tried reconciling with my BIL. I was kind, bought him presents at Christmas, greeted him at family functions, etc. But he accused me of trying to get back together with him even after I was married to DH. The clincher is that he started telling people that my son might be his, despite the fact that I’ve never been with anyone but my husband. 

Last summer my son gained access to his wide variety of knives and when I brought up concerns about his weapons not being secured, he told me he wouldn’t keep his gun in a safe when the kids are around because he “hates me.” We ended up yelling at each other and it was just awful. And so I cut all contact with him. My son is not allowed to be around him and can’t visit grandparents when he is there. My in-laws have stopped inviting us to family dinners and holidays claiming that I am causing a problem and am “hormonal and unbalanced.” They insist that I try to reconcile and say that BIL wants to do so as well. IF I apologize for my part of the relationship trouble. But I’m not really interested. It’s been almost five years of horribleness from him and I don’t feel like I’m at fault. I was nice for years and then have just avoided him. I’ve never spread rumors, called names, etc. Plus, I’m afraid he will start telling my son lies about me or even try to put doubt in my son’s head about his parentage. I feel like the most I can do right now is just pretend he doesn’t exist and continue to avoid him. I don’t want to be around him and especially don’t want my son near him.

1017,not the a-hole,"Next week, my family is going on a week-long camping “vacation.” The outing includes my mom, dad, sister, and her two kids. I (26F) have reservations in general about being pushed into going camping with my family for a week, as I find that overkill, but I digress: a post for another time. 

The biggest issue I have at this point is the difference in eating habits between my family and I. In the past year, I have lost about 35 pounds ([see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/progresspics/comments/8re25e/f2655_165lbs_130lbs_35lbs_12_months_married_and/?st=JIQ94NIM&sh=f82d97de)) by working out and eating healthfully.  I eat mostly fruits, vegetables, and healthy proteins, and I have cut out almost all sweets and processed foods. My family, on the other hand, regularly eats rice krispy bars for breakfast (It’s cereal, right?!) and counts jello with cool whip as a “fruit.” Hey, it’s the Midwest! Overall, they eat a very carb and fat-rich diet. (They actually have two “candy drawers” in their house!) My parents are in charge of bringing the food for the trip and will likely bring these types of items. 

I’m torn because I don’t want to offend them/start a fight, but I can’t imagine eating like that for a whole week, especially after how I’ve busted my ass to get where I am physically. Because it is a camping trip, most of our meals will be made by us, meaning I can easily bring my own (healthy) food—fruits and vegetables—and make my own meals as I am used to doing. I have battled severe mental illness in the past (hospitalized for anxiety and depression), and my new lifestyle has contributed significantly to my recovery. I feel so much better when I treat my body kindly. 

HOWEVER, my family had not been as supportive about my health and fitness journey as I would like, and I have experienced push-back from them about it in the past. They have told me the food I eat is “gross” and repeatedly tried to convince me to eat sugary foods I have already refused. In fact, my mom has asked if I need to “see my psychiatrist again” because I am getting “obsessive,” due to the fact that I work out almost every day and don’t cheat on my healthy diet. (I can assure you I am the most mentally and physically healthy I ever have been). In short, I’m afraid bringing my own food would invite criticism and cause a fight because it has been a source of tension and ridicule in the past. 

So.. If I didn’t rub in the fact that I needed to make my own food or comment on the unhealthy nature of their eating habits, WIBTA if I brought my own food on our family vacation? 

TL;DR: I eat healthy food and my family doesn’t, so I want to bring my own on a week-long trip even though I can reasonably expect blow-back from them. WIBTA?",30,32,0.89
1018,not the a-hole,"So, my parents divorced when I was two. He got the usual every other weekend gig. 

Fast forward to my pre-teen years. He would skip weekends, so my mom tried telling him there will be a day I don’t want to go to dads house because I’ll want to hang out with my friends so he better start coming. Also suggested he get his own place since he had been living with his parents (who live about two hours away) since the divorce. 

Well, the day came that I didn’t want to go to dads house as often. He would make me feel guilty when I wanted to stay at my moms. But watching him sleep on the couch, or going to see whatever girl he was obsessing over at the time wasn’t fun anymore. I never said those things to him though, because I never wanted to hurt his feelings. 

ALSO, this is going to make me seem like I’m all over the place, but my dad is a bit of a compulsive liar, and over exaggerates everything. He would tell a story of something I did, to a friend of his while I’m sitting there, and it would all be a lie. A COMPLETE LIE! He promised he would give me a cobra mustang, only to keep it for himself and rub it in my face how fast it was. We would go to the mall to shop for me and when I found something I wanted, tell me we could get it cheaper somewhere else. My dad told a story to my babysitter when I was younger about how we were going to take our jet skis out to the lake that weekend. WE’VE NEVER HAD JET SKIS. Hopefully you get how crazy it is. But it was all the time! 

When I was 18 I got my first job. I was living with a boyfriend at the time, was doing alright for myself. My dad still being my dad would call and make me feel guilty because he hasn’t seen me in a while. He guilts me in to going to visit for a weekend. Well, he sleeps the whole time. We literally only spent the car ride together. When he was dropping me off, asked if I needed any money and I said sure, well then he played dumb and said he didn’t have any. Okay fine. 

I never make an attempt to go again, I’m not going out of my way to sit in a house that doesn’t even have decent cable, and no internet. 

Now our relationship turned into what I call “Holiday Dad”.  Only calling to wish me a whatever it was.

I’ve only seen my dad a couple times now when he would show up at my previous job and stand there for a couple hours talking to me between taking orders (my grandma also did this once). 
I was working at my new job, still retail, and my dad had showed up maybe another two times and pulled that shit. 

A couple years go by now and I haven’t seen him, still only hear from him on holidays, still makes me feel guilty for never calling or seeing him. Well while I’m working one day, I call up the next customer and they say “I’m here to see my daughter” and it was then I realized it was my dad. I couldn’t even recognize him, and it was like talking to a stranger. That was the last time i saw my dad. 

Okay, so now I’m going to be 29 years old next month. I just moved to FL in December, and before that my relationship with my dad hadn’t changed much. I called to let him know when I was pregnant only because when I told him I was married on whatever holiday he called on he made me feel guilty. He asks if I want him to be there for the birth of my child and I tell him yes only because I assumed that he wouldn’t be. 
We were talking maybe once a month through my pregnancy, still felt like talking to a stranger. 

When we found out we were going to be moving to FL, I let my dad know, it just so happened though that we were moving to the city my dad was born and raised in. Now he’s all gung-ho on coming. Calling me every day, when I don’t answer calling three more times, saying stuff like “we’ve always been close.” 

Another thing I should add is when we moved here we were living in a hotel, so you can imagine the stress. We had just been on the road a week with our three dogs, and I was 8 1/2 months pregnant. 

I would tell him I don’t know when he can come, we don’t even have a house, my husbands parents are also wanting to visit (not being pushy though) so I have to work around that too. He would call me with a countdown of days til he would be here, telling me he will sleep on the floor. 

Finally I snapped, “WHAT FLOOR DAD?! I DON’T EVEN HAVE A HOUSE YET!” 
I stared ignoring him, then I gave him another chance, and it was the same thing. Started ignoring him again and it’s been 5 months now. 
He still calls maybe twice a week, still talks about visiting in his voicemails. 

My biggest question to myself is, why now? 
You used to live in the same state as me, two hours away, and never cared to come visit me then. 
The only time I saw you is when you felt like standing around at my job for a few hours instead of calling and being like “Hey, when do you get off so we can go have dinner?” 

WHY WHY WHY?! WHY?! 

It was so much easier having a “Holiday Dad.” I didn’t care if he called or not, it was like he didn’t even exist almost. But I feel guilty, and sad sometimes for doing this. Then, I always ask myself “why now?” 

Am I the asshole?

Okay so I’m a barista and there’s a regular who only orders through the drive through and it’s always the same drink. Well, every time he orders we ask “anything else?” And he replies “a beautiful smile from a beautiful girl.” 

This makes me very uncomfortable because I’ve had older men before say things to me while working here. As I was cashing him out he told me he wasn’t leaving without a smile. I told him I’m not comfortable with that and he replied, “it’s just a smile.” I didn’t say anything after that but I told him to have a great day. 

Am i the asshole for telling him that? All the other female baristas feel the same but don’t say anything to him about it. Btw I’m very friendly with all the customers but if you try to force me to smile I’m not going to be very friendly. ",69,279,0.96
1021,no a--holes here,"To provide some background, I have times where I struggle financially. The entire month of June I have been struggling with funds since I haven't received a paycheck from my job and my mother is struggling to meet her own financial needs. My boyfriend is what you can consider wealthy, but I've never asked him for money. The times he has paid for me has been voluntary on his part, usually for dates, even when I've offered to split the cost with him or cover my own. Before the semester ended and my boyfriend went home for the summer, he let me know that if in an emergency occurred where I needed to buy food but didn't have any money to do so, he would help me.


Today my housemate and I planned on picking up a piece of free furniture I had found online. My housemate however, told me at the last minute that I would have to go with him to work and afterwards we'd pick up the furniture. I didn't have time to eat or make a to-go lunch and subsequently I was stuck at the mall for 5-6 hours without food or money to buy some from the food court. My mom wasn't financially able to give me money until her payday, so I decided to take my boyfriend's offer and give him a call. He sounded hesitant to lend me money and told me that his offer was for groceries and that he didn't want to give me money if it was going to be food from the mall. He didn't consider my situation an emergency and didn't want to lend me anything for that reason. I was annoyed with his justification for not lending me money and haven't talked to him since.


I can't understand his logic in his decision when all I was going to ask for was $10. This is my first time asking for money and in my opinion, for a probable reason. He was fully aware that I'd be going almost the whole day without food but choose not to lend me money because he wanted it to be used towards groceries. Am I the asshole for being upset with him?

TLDR: I've been struggling financially and my boyfriend, in the past, has offered to lend me money for food in emergency situations. I've never asked him for money, but today I was stuck at the mall for 5-6 hours until my housemate could pick me up. I had no money for food and asked my boyfriend if he could lend me $10. He told me no because he would rather buy me groceries than lunch at the mall.

1024,not the a-hole,"My boyfriend is adopted and has no affiliation with his mother. His mother, lets call her Anne, is an awful woman at heart. I try my hardest to be polite to her, but it doesn’t work. Upon first seeing me, without ever saying a word to me, she was calling me names and making assumptions. She has a daughter, let’s call her Lisa. Lisa is a troubled child with issues only God himself can fix. Anne beats Lisa and then tells her to wear pants in 100° weather because she has to cover the bruises. This child has vandalized things and is growing up cussing people out and enjoys hurting them. She’s being raised to litter and hurt animals, including dropping them off somewhere. She’s only 10-12, but I’m afraid she can’t be fixed. Anne is a terrible woman and I think Lisa will only get worse from here. She has potential but her mother is extremely emotionally abusive, if not physically abusive. 

Their house is also an absolute disaster. The child doesn’t have a bed, a place to do work (leading to her failing two grades and being held back), lives in absolute filth to the point that more often than not their front door won’t even open, and most nights doesn’t even have dinner. Her mother couldn’t care less about her. She’s too involved in weed and her cigarettes. I know that Anne won’t live long  because of her unhealthy habits but I’m worried about Lisa until then. She’s an awful, disrespectful, manipulative child with no friends. Anne won’t let her have friends, and any time she does, they’re not allowed to come to her house. She’s got one friend, we’ll call her Haley, but this little girl is just as troublesome and sees this kids abuse more than anyone else. 

This child loves her mother with a passion and would be absolutely heartbroken if she got taken away but, I don’t think this is the life for her. I’ve heard her mother tell her that she was going to strangle her with cords, slam her head into the pavement, shut her neck in the door, and break her wrists behind her, that just being the beginning. I’ve been considering this for a while but I don’t want to take that girl away from the only home she’s ever had, even if it’s awful. She’s just a little girl and she doesn’t know any better. She doesn’t know that her lifestyle isn’t normal. She doesn’t know that normal kids go to school in clean clothes. Would it be an asshole move to call? ",28,54,0.88
1025,not the a-hole,"I have endometriosis and interstitial cystitis. I am also studying to become a medical research scientist. My tolerance for pseudoscience as a whole is very low, but medical pseudoscience REALLY grinds my gears.

On the endo Facebook group, people are always posting about how they're in pain and wishing for relief etc. etc. As a whole, many of the members seem vulnerable and are so desperate to end their pain and suffering- which I can totally relate to.

There's been an increase in posts/comments by a few people who give 'medical' advice when people are explaining their concerns and issues. The comments are like 'you definitely have leaky gut/candida overgrowth/estrogen dominance. Tell your doctor you want to be tested for *insert disease that doesn't exist*'. Now I am open to being wrong but I've searched pubmed/scholar/scopus about estrogen dominance (for example), some of the largest databases for biomedical research, and they turn up exactly zero papers on the subject. 

The same people are spruiking natural therapies instead of medical ones. For example, encouraging people to get off hormonal birth control (even though this is like the first point of call treatment for endo) and using vitamins/natural supplements instead. 

I don't want to seem like a know it all on the page but it pisses me off thinking about the poor girls who are desperate for relief and they listen to these comments that are likely exactly the opposite of what their doctors suggest. 

Am I the asshole for calling them out on this?

EDIT: I called someone out extremely tactfully and suggested that we all should be wary of things not recognised by the medical community. She replied saying that she doesn't come to this group to hear about research because she can google it herself, and that having this illness for 20+ years encourages her to listen to other people's thoughts and experiences because it is more useful than research.

My sister lives in PA. She and I are pretty close. 

About a month ago, she wanted to use my buddy passes to take a vacation from pa to Fort Lauderdale (about 2.5 hours from where I live). I said no problem. 
She also wanted buddy passes for her new boyfriend, someone I’ve never met or heard of as well. I reluctantly said okay. I have a finite amount of these things and giving them out is a big deal. Nevertheless I relented. I assumed, perhaps incorrectly that at least dinner with me was a given. However soon as I booked these passes for them, suddenly she was all “idk what’s going on yet” and “I’m not sure” and “yeah I’ll try” and “I can’t tell you yes to that yet”
Now I’ve done enough online dating to know that when any female gives you lines like that, she has no intentions of seeing you.

1037,not the a-hole,"Let me tell you a couple of things about mom before. My mom is a mentally ill person. She needs constant care.  She is a really naive person that had fallen in the tricks of horrible people. She got scammed and a dude she was dating a while ago, hit her with his car. (It later developed in a whole  mental crisis that lasted for three years and it was living hell for the family)

A couple of months ago, a former classmate from her highschool decided to call her. She was so excited because it had been a long time since they had talked. (I have no clue how he found out our phone number) Later on, this man (let's call him John) appeared all of the sudden in our apartment (Again, I have no idea how John got our address, since we didn't have any contact with my mom's classmates) 

For whatever reason, my mom didn't invite John inside and they just stood there on the outside to talk. (Mom doesn't realize that she is being rude most of the time, to be fair) 

Flashforward a month ago, John contacts another classmate and this woman (Jane)  wants to visit us. My uncle, somehow, finds out about this and he really doesn't want them to come. (My uncle is my mom's legal guardian)

They get quiet for a while, until they showed up a couple of days in our apartment, without any notice. While I wasn't really happy about it, obviously I couldn't kick them out. 

My mom apparently had a great time, despite those two people crossing the limits (giving my mom advice such as you should quit your pills...) 

They leave, but Jane decides to invite my mom to go to a festival today. Since my mom doesn't have a phone, she gives Jane my number.

1039,not the a-hole,"So this situation has a lot of little details that make it hard for me to decide what I should do. I apologize in advance for the length but I know there's a decent amount to consider and I want to give all the info I can. 

So I was given a guitar as a gift from my mom's ex boyfriend. She dated this guy for about 11 years (starting when I was about 6 to when I was 16 or 17. I am now 21). I've probably had the guitar for 5 years now. Although my relationship with my mom's ex wasn't the best because I didn't care for the way he treated her, I was very grateful for the gift and expressed that. After I got it, I played it often and even took a guitar playing class in high school. After a while though, I stopped playing it. I honestly went through a tough time after high school where I wasn't motivated to do anything and was sad all the time. That's not super relevant but I'm sure it contributed to why I stopped playing. 

A while later, my brother (19 now) decided he wanted to start playing guitar. He casually started playing mine and it wasn't a big deal and he had my permission. However, now he acts as though it's his guitar because he plays it often and I don't play at all anymore. He takes it with him wherever he wants to play with friends and never even asked before he started doing so. I mentioned to him once that I would like for him to be careful with it since he transports it a lot and he acted like I was being a bitch. 

It's gotten to the point where he even told our sister that he would be taking it with him whenever he moved out. He's never told this to me, mind you. Well now I'm actually going to move out in a few months and I want to take it because it's technically mine and I want to start playing again at some point. 

I know that he probably thinks he deserves this guitar for a number of reasons which are: 

• He plays it pretty regularly and I don't. 
• I gave him permission to start playing it in the first place. 
• He is much closer with my mom's ex boyfriend and had he expressed interest in playing before I did, it's possible the guitar could have been given to him instead. 

But the simple fact is that it wasn't. It was given to me. And I don't appreciate that he thinks he can take it as his own because he uses it more often. I think it also bothers me because he's stolen a lot of money from me before and I hate how he just generally feels entitled to things that don't belong to him. I'm never gonna get that money back but I can get this guitar back. 

The guitar itself is also really nice and if I wanted to buy another like it, it would probably be decently expensive. 

If I just take it back not knowing when I'll start playing it again but knowing that he plays it fairly often, would that make me the asshole? 

TL;DR: my brother started using my guitar and acting like its his now. I want to take it with me when I move although I don't currently play it. ",21,30,0.92

1048,not enough info,"For background: I am almost 24 and have 1 child and am married myself.

My mother and stepfather have always had a really rocky marriage and they fight quite a bit.

I’ve never cared for my stepdad much just because he’s an alcoholic, irresponsible, and generally very irritating to be around. I tolerate him because my mom love/d him.

Anyways they’ve had previous problems with him cheating (Mom walked in on him and another girl messing around about a decade ago.) He has been acting very snippy lately and about 6 months ago, caught him on dating sites etc.
She went through his phone the other night and saw texts from a woman calling him “babe, baby, and asking how his weekend was etc.” so she decided to play along as him.

So they get into a fight about that and she kicks him out and now he’s living with this other woman. The reason I know all this is because every time they fight (they’re 50, & 51 btw,) me, or my stepbrother is called to essentially “be the peacekeepers” and it’s getting REALLY old.

So now they’re getting divorced and my mother expects me (and is very hurt that I won’t) pick “her side.” I’m trying my best to support her as much as I can as a daughter emotionally without getting too involved and I guess that’s not good enough. So I eventually told her “look I don’t wanna pick sides. If I see him out and about I’m going to be polite and speak to him but I’m not gonna go out of my way to talk to him or to offer any information to him, either.” (About what moms next moves are such as her lawyer details, when she wants him served etc.)

I’m doing the best I can to be mature and I guess that’s not good enough. I do admit to being not necessarily “aggressive” but stern, yes. Absolutely. I told her I would go to her lawyers with her, I’ve offered to come over and talk with her, I’ve told her if she needs anything to call. But I really don’t want to know every little detail and I don’t want to sit and bash him for everything he’s done the last 17 years... I get she’s upset and she has every right to be but all I want is to be able to offer positive thoughts and advice. I don’t want to sit and go on and on and on about how bad of a guy he is (because what does that change?)

Now she’s playing the victim card with me, saying things like “well I’m sorry to bother you with my problems.” Yada yada yada.

Telling me something and venting is one thing.
Asking me to drone on and on about someone who hasn’t directly affected me in any way is another. I’M not married to him. My heart breaks for my mom but him being a piece of work is not a new concept.

1050,asshole for driving,"Truck driver here, made a stop in Dallas after having driven from Virginia in two days (actually relaxed timing compared to what I usually run). 

Anyways, I had a delivery set for yesterday, was kept over the entire night, and since I can’t sleep in situations when I’m on call, I was up the entire night. I’m heading for home time in two days, so I’d rather suck it up, drink coffee, and wait until tonight for sleep. Currently sleep deprived, which makes me grumpier than usual. 

I stopped at the cluster of truck stops on I-20 south of town. This area is notorious for crime, suspicious characters, and mild annoyances such as panhandlers. Unfortunately, “mild annoyance” is an understatement in this part of the world. The Panhandler problem here is unchecked, rampant, and hostile. These people will run you down just to beg for change. You’ll be standing in line or pumping fuel and getting a season’s worth of Maury, Jerry Springer, and Cheaters in a short conversation. These Panhandlers are relentless, and it’s why I dread coming here.

This morning I had to come back for fuel before picking up my next load. It’s looking to be an easy day. Drive 95 miles to Waco, pick up the trailer, and my plan is to come back to the Dallas area so I can sleep. Had one Panhandler follow me from the fuel pumps, where he had already solicited change from me, to which I denied. He looked to be on...ummm...substances, for lack of better term. One has that instinct about people when you see Panhandlers almost everywhere you go. Yes, it’s a sad reality; I’m not going to enable one’s substance abuse at the least. After the fuel pumps, he followed me into the store, pretending to look around while seeing if I would use cash or card. I was aware of his presence, so I used card. Even though I made it clear I wasn’t giving him change, despite many other people here (it’s always busy), he still asked for change from me. So I finally told him to fuck off, or call the police. A bystander said “sir, there’s no need to be rude, you cheap fuck!” So I dug up some pennies and dimes I had from another purchase, gave it to the guy, and left. I don’t feel bad in the slightest I told him to fuck off. I don’t like when people follow me in public places, and I don’t like when Panhandlers don’t leave me alone after I politely said no.

1052,not the a-hole,"Two years ago, I went through some shit...an arrest, substance abuse issues, rehab, etc. It was a really tough time for me but I'm better for it now - I'm almost 2 years sober. During this time, I continued to write music and release an album with two bandmates/friends who I no longer feel all that close with. In many ways, they both (one more than the other) took advantage of me, both financially and mentally. For example, I took care of all the logistics behind booking studio time, touching base with our producer and paying our deposit (and still haven't received all the money owed to me). To this day, I am unable to listen to that album. I ended up feeling inferior and insecure, especially considering I lived with one of the two who happens to also have issues with vanity and self-importance. 


I'll be moving soon due to a job opportunity and feel compelled to cut ties and move on without any toxic relationships/friendships. I know that, in some ways, I'm projecting my own shame/self-hatred onto them, but I've also gotten a new lease on life and therefore, I am recalibrating my thinking regarding who my true friends are, what I want in a relationship and who I am.

1053,not the a-hole,"I run an animal shelter.  Our shelter functions in a rescue capacity, meaning we take dogs that other shelters are going to euthanize.

Recently, another shelter transferred me a young female French bulldog, which is like a unicorn.  Young purebred dogs are very uncommon in shelters, and highly sought after breeds even more so.

I adopted the dog to a woman and within 48 hours she was trying to rehome it on Facebook because it didn’t get along with her cats.  She agreed both verbally and in writing to return the dog if it didn’t work out when she signed her adoption contract.

One of my supporters immediately saw the post and told her to return the dog, which she ignored.  I’ve called her and emailed her, and she hasn’t responded.

WIBTA if I reported the dog as stolen to the microchip registration company?  If she gives or sells the dog to another family, they have no way of knowing the woman wasn’t within her rights to give the dog away.  I would be potentially taking the dog away from a family that had paid someone for the dog, but a highly desirable dog can be adopted out of my shelter to a family that wouldn’t normally be able to afford a $2,000 dog.",27,32,0.88
1054,not the a-hole,"So I'll try to condense the story. No names here. 

I posted on a diet subreddit. One rule is ""NO CHEAT DAY TALK"". I have to go to another country for around 2 weeks, and my family will force me to break my diet. It sounds like an excuse but it isn't - last time I refused food they got very upset at me. It's against our culture. I only visit them once every 5 years so I'd rather have the reunion be friendly rather than aggressive.

So my question was ""How can I slowly and temporarily come off this diet to keep my body safe"" or something along that lines. 

----------

There are two people involved in this story. Rebecca and Mod (fake names ofc). 

---------

I receive a few helpful comments. Rebecca then comes in and says ""This subreddit is for diet talk only. Not getting off the diet. Go to another sub."" She wasn't horribly rude, but it was stern and an unnecessary post. 

I replied in a slightly stern but still not too aggressive way: ""Having to temporarily go off the diet is perfectly valid to ask. Don't be so elitist. There are plenty of these threads in the past as well. This sub is for all things diet."" 

My reply here was true - I had seen these types of posts many times in the past. I felt as if Rebecca was too elitist, so I called her out on it, but not in an insulting or attacking kind of way. 

------------------- 

We get into a bit of an argument. I get a bit aggressive. She continues to hold her stands but becomes more short, stern, and rude. How rude? Well one of her posts got deleted by the mods and I don't remember what it said, so rude enough. 

In the end, I say ""how can you be 39 years old and act like you're 14?"" I know that was probably a bit assholish, but this was in a heat of an argument. 

Her side of the argument was: talk about stuff that I want to use the subreddit for ONLY. My side was: my question was valid, all I wanted was help, so if you have something against me, just report me and move on. 

--------------

If you are wondering, my posts got mostly upvoted and her posts got mostly downvoted here. So it seems a lot of other users on this sub agree with me. This sub is a support sub and people should be more about helping others rather than just needlessly driving people away. 

--------

Mod comes in. As you guessed, he's a mod of this sub. He tells me the same thing. Don't come here to talk about this. At this point, however, I've had enough already. 

I searched this sub before I made this post. I saw PLENTY of posts just like it, I made the post because I wanted to see if there was any further info. People going off the diet permanently made posts. People temporarily quitting made posts. People doing half-dieting techniques made posts. So yes, there are so many posts that ask the same thing, I think it's perfectly fair for me to ask it too.

I argue against the mod in my first post. However, I said the exact same thing to him that I said to the other person. I used the same argument, same logic. Not any more aggressive (but still a bit aggressive). 

He immediately banned me. 

___________

So that's kind of what made me upset here. He saw my responses to Rebecca. He read them, and did nothing about them. Then, he also didn't delete my post. When the exact same thing was sent to him, he felt insulted, so he banned me immediately. 

I think that's wrong. If I did something wrong, I should have been banned right away for offending Rebecca. It shouldn't have lasted until I spoke to Mod directly. So naturally, I insulted him a bit more over PM.

________

AITA? And yes, I acknowledge I probably stepped a bit too far for being insulting, but seriously, a support subreddit just felt so incredibly elitist and unwelcoming. It's ridiculous to me. Moderator or not, I don't really care. He shouldn't receive special treatment for it.",22,32,0.83

She first chose to ask me if I'm really sure about this, why I like her, if I really think she's right for me, etc and then proceeded to say ""I just don't want to hurt you"", ""Not right now"", ""It's not you"", which I assumed to be top 10 clichéd polite rejections. So I asked if she could gimme some space to move on. She said she would but kept contacting me and pretending we never spoke about anything, then I gave in and asked her to atleast not tell me her guy problems, or romantic interests. 
But she went on to then tell me about someone she met whom she had history with, him telling her she's pretty but needs to work on xyz stuff, her seeing some other guy because they made up after their fight, and her making out with 2 women and getting drunk and dancing with random dudes.

So I just broke off the friendship and refused to even revisit it in the future.

1060,not the a-hole,"I attended church with my parents today. After the sermon, I found them speaking with an elderly couple I did not recognize.

I have black earplugs, custom-molded to my ears. I wear them to church because the music is too loud for me. I had not yet taken them out due to the crowd noise.

A few questions into this discussion (which, before and after what I am about to describe, consisted of standard questions on my age, life status, etcetera), the husband grabbed the front of my coat and pulled me closer to him. I was so shocked I made no attempt to break free. He commanded me something that I didn't hear. ""Turn!"", he ordered, louder. ""What's that in your ears?"" I explained, and he released me. He was a large man, a head taller than I and obese.

I stayed there stewing for another minute, answering their questions. Then I could not take it anymore and whispered to my mother ""This jerk basically assaulted me; I'm going to the car."" I left, and my parents arrived a minute later.

My mother and I debated the subject on the ride home. She said that they knew the couple (not closely, a few degrees away) and I had thus embarrassed her, and the man was confused when I left. She complained that I was being too legalistic and that I was making a mountain out of a molehill. I told her that where we live it is assault merely to hold up a fist and make a threat, and that he was lucky I didn't tell him off or fight back. You don't touch people without their consent!

1061,teenager,"So there's this girl in my class who's doesn't have any friends (in our class), because none of my classmates like her. They dislike her, because she's always late to school, gets in trouble for being on her phone constantly, skipping school, never doing her assignments, never does any of the work in group projects and she always has a negative attitude. 

I also have no friends in my class, because my best friend stopped talking to me at the beginning of the year and I'm scared of socializing. So everytime we have a group project I have to be with her, because I'm to scared to ask anyone else to be with me. 

She never does any work, I always do it. Once we had a physics paper and she didn't come sit next to me and just sat at her chair. The teacher told her to come help me 2 and she still didn't. Sometimes she even makes shit worse. She tried fixing a spelling error once and fucked up the entire page. Once she accidentally closed the browser and another time she accidentally threw away our art project while I was sick for a week. The teacher yelled at us for it infront of the class. Even though she constantly fucks up I've tried my best to always be nice to her about it. 

Another thing she does is always whisper rude shit ablut the teachers and our classmates into my ear while we're in class, which makes me really uncomfortable. I haven't told her anything about it though. I just akwardly giggle. 

So because of all this shit she does the ""friend group"" I'm in always talks shit about her. Thdy constantly say rude things about her and hoe annoying she is. I don't participate in this because again it makes me uncomfortable, instead I quietly just stand there.

But a while ago we were all walking to the bus stop and as always they started insulting her, but this time one of the kids in the group told me something I wasn't at all awear of. Apparently she called me a massive weirdo and other insulting things behind my back. I got really mad, because I knew that kid in the group wasn't lying. She makes fun of everyone else so why wouldn't she make fun of me. I started insulting her as well and went on a massive rant about all the bent up anger towards her that I had been keeping in. I told them she was insulting people in our class and how she never did shit. They all laughed and called her mean shit to. 

But when I got home I felt really guilty about what I had done, because I was insulting her behind her back. Was I being a bully?

I genuinely don't know. It's been eating me up inside for so long now.

1064,not the a-hole,"My niece and BIL came with my husband, son and I to a neighborhood park, along with our two big dogs.  There was a lady there with two small children, around 3 and 4, and a smallish pit\-mix dog.  One of my dogs is a super asshole with other dogs, so upon noticing that one of the kids had the dog's leash, I took the asshole dog on a walk around a playing field, lest the pit mix pull the kid off their feet to get at us.  When I got back, I saw that the lady, who was dressed in skin tight black capri's, tight black baby\-doll T\-shirt, long dyed black hair, and enough makeup to be visible at 100\-yards, was talking with my husband and BIL, while the kids were playing on the playground equipment.  Fine, its a free world.  But every now and then she would step away from the husbands, and leave her dog with them, effectively barring me from rejoining them.    

I wandered around the fields for a while, until I got too bored and fed up to continue.   I watched for a few more minutes, and judging from body language, she was in serious flirt mode.  The husbands, to their credit, appeared to be paying much more attention to the dog than to her (although they were aware of my presence, while she was possibly not).  The dog appeared quite friendly and nice.  

Finally, I just marched back over there.  Asshole dog did his asshole thing.  He weighs 100 lbs, and habitually lunges and snarls at any unfamiliar dogs, but he has a head\-harness, so I was not worried about losing control of him, and he has never actually eaten anyone, nor mauled any of the dogs he snarls at.  Her dog groveled at his feet for a while, but did not try to get in his face.  The lady tried repeatedly to call her dog to her, but it ignored her.  She was only a few feet from it, but refrained from taking its leash for quite a while, to the point that I suspected she was hoping one of the men would do it for her.  When my dog stopped snarling, she did not say a word to me, but glared at me with intense hostility, and finally took her dog and went back to her kids.  

I have never voluntarily approached an unfamiliar dog with my ahole dog in this way, and it felt sort of rude.  So, was my dog not the only asshole at the playground?  ",26,25,0.83

1066,not enough info,"Graduated from HS on May 29th. My father and I live in CA. Rest of family lives in PA. 3,000 mile difference. My sister tells me months ago that she reserved tickets and what not for her, her fiance, and their two kids (my nephews). 

Week before graduation I ask her if she's still coming. She texts me a message about the size of a novel about how something that happened to her. She said something about having to get surgery and that the doctor found cancer somewhere in her body. Something like that.

1071,not the a-hole,"About a month ago, a new person starting working under my wing at a retail facility where I work. He had many jobs prior, but had never really had anything where he worked with other people before or communicated with a large amount of people on a daily basis. I took a decent liking to him, and even gave him my phone number after he had asked to keep in contact. After only a couple of weeks of being on the job, he randomly quit. 

He began messaging me rather often, but not really for any particular reason. It was more or less just to send me random pictures of his dog and to give me updates on how his life was going. Now, I only knew the guy for two weeks. I wasn't like his best friend or anything. However, it was becoming apparent that he didn't really have anyone else. 

Nearly every hour, every day since he quit his job... I have gotten a barrage of messages from this guy. Yes, it turned out he didn't have very many friends and he was a rather anxious person and he was a little down and enjoyed having someone to talk to. I did, thought, tell him that the constant messages were a little much and attempted to tell him that I didn't particularly enjoy dropping everything in order to answer back all 20 of his messages every 10 minutes. It was a lot. He claimed he understood, but started messaging me again in a \*sad sort of type\*. He was attempting to make me feel guilty.

Fast forward to today. I woke up to my phone going crazy because he was messaging me again. I asked my girlfriend and another friend what I should do (I didn't want to block him right away cause I felt bad for him, and knew that he didn't have friends). I was in the shower, messages. I was garage sale\-ing with my girlfriend, messages. I went out to lunch with friends, messages. I got home and logged online, messages. Nonstop. Throughout my whole day, messages.

1080,not the a-hole,"About a month or two ago, a man approached my husband and I in our yard and asked if we’d like for him to mow. We asked if he’d do our front yard for $20, and he agreed. 

One week later he comes back and rings the doorbell and again asks to mow our yard. I politely decline and tell him it’s not needed, because the yard hasn’t grown much. He complains about needing money to buy his kids some diapers and food, so I gave him $20 as an “advance” and he told me he would be back the following week to mow in return for this payment. 

He did not show up the next week, or even the week after that. It was fine by me, being scammed out of $20 wasn’t ideal, but not worth getting upset over. 

About two and a half weeks after I gave him the money, he showed up and mowed our yard without knocking on our door or anything first. After he was done, my husband told him he appreciated it and gave him an additional $15 to mow the backyard. My husband went and unlocked both gates to the backyard for him. He completed the job and left. 

The next week, he shows up again. Doesn’t ring the doorbell or knock on our doors. He just mows the yard. I was extremely annoyed and when I caught him outside I told him he should have knocked first to make sure we were home. He apologized and I paid him for his work. 

A few days later he comes by again with his wife and they’re asking for gas money and money to get their lawn mower out of the pawn shop. I tell them I cant help them because I don’t have cash. That was the last I saw of him until today. 

Today I’m laying in bed sick, in the nude, and I hear a lawnmower start outside. At first it was hard to tell if it was coming from my yard or maybe a neighbors yard. My bedroom faces the backyard, however, and when I heard the jingling of the gates opening I knew he was in my yard. I felt extremely uncomfortable as he let himself into my backyard because we had neglected to put the locks back on the gates.... but I didn’t stop him. I just laid in bed and quietly waited for him to finish mowing. 

After he was done, he started knocking on my front door. I didn’t answer. He started knocking on my side door and ringing the doorbell repeatedly. He waited about 10 minutes, and I could hear him talking to someone on the phone outside before he started knocking again. 

At this point, I haven’t given him any indication that I’m home. My car is unfortunately in the driveway, but all the blinds are closed and my house is quiet. I do NOT want to open the door for him while my husband isn’t home, and besides, I do NOT have any cash. 

Am I the asshole for not wanting to pay him for mowing my lawn without my consent or even checking to verify I was home and could afford to pay him?

She asked him, and he said he would try to get the money in two weeks instead of a month, but that is still going to rack up $170 in late fees.

1089,not the a-hole," So yesterday my neighbor, whom I'm friends with, arrived home and started walking over to talk to me. I was sitting in my car, which doubles as my 'smoking lounge' because I don't smoke in my house. She was wearing a one piece bathing suit with shorts. I look up and you can CLEARLY see right through her suit, like it's just not opaque when the sun hits it. 

Now granted, I know I could have handled this part better because my mouth engaged before my brain and I said something to the effect of ""Holy shit I can see through your suit!"". Dickish, I know. However, later I got a text from her partner telling me she was very upset with me for saying anything. To which I responded that I was sorry that I upset her but you can see right through her swimsuit. 

Apparently they had just gotten back from swimming at her in-laws house when I said this, so I'm sure she's mortified. But would it really have been better to say nothing at all? Like I personally would be pissed if the situation was reversed and no one said anything to me.",97,375,0.97

I’ll keep this short and sweet: my boyfriend and I love and want kids - not now, but when we get married we both 100% want to foster, adopt, and/or have a bio baby.

My dad molested me as a kid. I never reported it because we were financially dependent on him but I did confront him and he apologized, cried, begged my forgiveness, all that. I’ll never care for him but I don’t avoid family gatherings he’s at either.

My mom (they’re still married) mentioned casually how she’s so excited for her and my dad to be grandparents and spoil the kids. I said, nope, Dad will never even meet any child of mine until they’re old enough to understand the weight of what he did to me and decide what they want.

My mom said why don’t you just never leave him unsupervised with them and he deserves to know his grandkids. I said nope. He’s old and not super mobile and he doesn’t see children regularly, but if he had (for example) tried to become a youth coach I’d have a problem with that too.

Do I think he’d molest them? Honestly no, but also I wouldn’t have thought he’d molest me either. I can’t trust him again.

 My dad’s keeping his head down rn but my mom is super pissed, telling me I’m an ungrateful daughter and all that, his only grandchildren will be through me, etc.

Today was the last day we could work on it and we promised eachother to be at school at 9:00 am, so i set my alarm clock i shower and i prepared myself to go to school, then they message me that they changed the time to 9:30 am, so i had to wait a little longer to go to school and we have less time to finish it now.

So i arrive at school and again i get a message from them saying we are here at 10am, so i had to wait half an our but i was okay with it because i want to finish the video, but again we had less time to finish the video.

1102,no contest,"So for the background, while I was on vacation a month or so ago I met a group of people through Couchsurf; for those who are unfamiliar, you can make hangouts and people can request to join in, then you can all arrange to meet up for sightseeing, activities, etc. 

One of them was a gentleman we'll call Gary who happened to be gay. He wasn't the only gay man in the group \(not really relevant but whatever\). He got my number from a WhatsApp group we all made \(its easier than Couchsurf if you have any experience with the app\) and started messaging me directly, at first to simplify communication since groups can get a little hectic at times. Ironically he never showed up and I never even met the guy in person. Before I headed home he let me know that he comes to my city for work sometimes and asks if I wanted to stay in touch. Sure, no problem I'm always happy to meet new people so I wouldn't mind grabbing a drink with him. For the record he was fully aware I'm straight since we had discussed who's gay and whose straight in our group chat.

He starts messaging me on and off, usually just quick ""Hey hows it going"" type conversations, but occasionally he'd send 25\+ pictures of him sightseeing and ask me to send pics as well, which I didn't do.

Just a few days ago he messages me and sends me a link to a vacation deal which has a nude beach as the primary focus. Here's how the conversation went.

Gary: Hey shimmyshammy2119, check this out!

Me: Lol, love how its advertising a nude beach \(jokingly\)

Gary: Wanna go?

Me: No thanks, not really my thing

Gary: Aww why not? Come on, it'll be fun! 

Gary: How about we go to \[nude beach in my area\] when I'm in your city?

Me: I'll pass, I don't do nude beaches they're not really my thing.

Gary then got salty, called me a homophobe, then blocked/deleted me off everything. I would have been fine if he suggested meeting up for something like getting a drink, grabbing food, playing pool, etc, but straight up inviting me to a nude beach seemed like a blatant attempt to make a pass at me.

1106,not the a-hole,"I {29/f} am upset with the several things my husband [27/m] has been doing lately.

The most recent issue: He went to the lake with his friend. I didn't go because I'm 36 weeks pregnant, didn't want to be out in the hot sun for hours and using their tiny little restroom every 30 minutes. I told him I may or may not join later, would let him know.

I decided to join hours later, I called when I got there.No answer. Some minutes later, I see his boat about to approach the dock. Before doing so, I saw him stopping next to a couple girls. They got in his boat, then another girl nearby (a friend of the 2 girls) was nearby and got in as well. He then took them for a boat ride for about 30-40 minutes. He never saw me waiting at the dock. He didn't know either because he didnt look at his phone to see my missed calls. So when he comes back, I'm pretty upset. I don't feel like he had business picking up 3 young girls in bikinis and giving them a ride. When he comes back, all of the girls give him a hug and thank him, one of them saying ""I hope your gf is not mad."" The girls didnt know I was there waiting for him. He saw me there and corrected her saying ""wife."" When they left, I asked him why they were on the boat. He said he just picked them up to help them get to the dock so they didnt have to walk a long distance. I asked how long, he said 10 minutes. So he lied straight up. I saw him pick them up, then go for a boat ride, that lasted 30-40 minutes while I roasted under the sun.

That is just one thing he did recently. I told him he is not single and that a married man had no business doing that. He says he did nothing wrong. He called me crazy and insecure. I have been in tears for days. Can barely eat or sleep well.

Am I right to be upset? Do I need counseling?

Edit: I'll just add a couple other things he has done to upset me. His ex gf called from her personal phone to let him know his deposit refund check is there in the office of his old apt, she works there (btw, it was supposed to have been mailed like the letter stated). He deleted that call from his log, went there to collect the check, and was MIA for 2-3 hours, lost his phone, and was late in picking me up. he lost his phone somewhere around that old apartment, then the car wouldn't start, he called tow truck services to jump start the vehicle when his brother lives down the street. He was not going to tell me he went there, I only found out by putting things together like his phone being lost and he's looking for it by the old apartment that his ex works at? And that he was late in picking me up bc car wouldn't start and didn't have a means to call me?

Another thing: He recently downloaded snapchat again. He was browsing through the contacts, deleting some people. This after he told me months ago that he deleted snapchat. Then I discovered that he had contacts on there and were subscribed to people he said he had blocked (these were women who sent him inappropriate videos while I was with him). These people were not just plain friends, they were exes, and women whose only purpose on snapchat is to show their bodies off.

One other thing: he's abusive. He has pushed me, twisted my hands so hard and sprained my finger that I fell to the ground out of the pain, and slapped me on several occasions. All while having a big pregnant belly. He says that if I disrespect him i deserve to have the shit beat out of me. We have different values. We're both Muslims but he is going on a different path. For instance I do not want to watch nudity or half-nudity scenes in our house. That is something he has hit me over because I tell him to stop watching it.

I am begging him to seek counsel since he thinks I am in the wrong. He says I am crazy & insecure and that he does nothing wrong. He refuses to seek counsel and says "" I dont give a f*** about what other people think is right or wrong, I know what I did was not wrong.""

1108,asshole,"Jenna has been a friend of mine for years. We've not been terribly close, but we know each other well enough. She's a very attractive woman, though nothing ever happened between us.  

She is notoriously bad with money. In the past she borrowed money from me, insisted she'd pay it back, avoided me, and then never mentioned it again. Now I didn't bring it up again after that, except for the time I'm going to tell you about, but I did mentally blacklist her from getting a loan from me again.  

So a few weeks ago she begged me to front her $500 because she needed to pay a bill, but assured me she would pay me back without fail. I responded that I didn't have that kind of money available to loan out. She wouldn't let it go asking when I got paid, asking if I had it in savings, asking if I could take a cash advance on a credit card and promising I'd pay no interest because she'd get me everything back before the due date.  I brought up that she hadn't paid me back previously, and she simply said she'd add it on to this loan and pay me back in full.  

I decided to call her bluff. I informed her that I would loan her the money provided that she would put up collateral. When she asked what she could put up, I responded the clothes off her back. I informed her that if she didn't pay me back on time, she would, at my request, strip down to nothing; not more than once a week, until she was fully paid up.  

She flat out refused, calling me disgusting and a pervert. I responded, ""But Jenna, you're going to pay me back before a single cent of interest needs to be paid, right? This shouldn't even be an issue!""  

She's since gone to several mutual friends and said that I propositioned her in her time of need and was trying to take advantage. Some friends, who have gotten burned as well, sympathize and understand why I set that condition. Others are not talking to me because they feel I'm taking advantage.

1111,asshole,"First of all, I love my GF more than anyone, and I did back then too. We had a long distance relationship at the time \(this was years ago\). This put the occasional strain on our relationship. I still think about it to this day and go back and forth on how much of the blame was on me, and how much I still think I was the reasonable one in the situation, but here we go.  

I was to take part in a black tie event for an organization I was a part of. We were all encouraged to bring a date. That was where the trouble started, because since we were long distance, I decided to bring someone else just for this occasion, an old friend we'll call M. M was someone who I had been very good friends with since childhood. There are a couple of things one should know about us. 1\) We did date for a very short time in high school, it didn't last more than a month, and we decided just to be friends. 2\) GF's knowledge of 1 led to her always being uneasy about the fact that 3\) M and I were still very close, hung out frequently, usually among other friends and almost always in public, but still. You can see how it probably was not smart of me to ask M if she would accompany me to the event.  

I will admit that I didn't ask GF before doing that if she would be ok with it, I kinda assumed she would be, and anyway while I was asking M it didn't really seem like a big deal. I now realize that this may have been inconsiderate, but GF knew that M was a very good friend of mine, and it was a very formal function. In other words, I would understand getting mad if I had invited her to something that felt more like a ""date,"" but this function felt more like a formal occasion, like as if I'm inviting my sister or something.  

So when GF found out about this \(because I told her, because again I didn't think it a big deal\), she immediately told me to call M and tell her it was off. I told her I didn't want to do that because she went and got a dress for it already and anyway I felt she was overreacting and I told her as much. GF then accused me of not taking her feelings into consideration. I disagreed, told her I felt like she didn't take \*my\* feelings into consideration.  I wound up taking M, and we had a great time. There was no dancing or anything like that. There was a buffet, speeches, singing, we chatted with everyone, and I don't regret taking her. What I do regret is how GF took it. She called me during and after the occasion to basically tell me off for bringing M anyway, she was very jealous.  

She was basically accusing me of replacing her with another girl, implying that I was cheating on her \(which I've never done\), and again of not considering how she felt about it. I saw where she was coming from, but I reiterated that she had nothing to worry about and that she was overreacting. We wound up fighting all night long. We almost broke up over this, until I was able to make amends. However, the fallout from me making amends included me not hanging out so much with M, and eventually I spoke to her about it, and we kind of ""broke up"" as friends, meaning that we agreed not to hang out anymore or talk to each other. I felt this was something I had to do to save my relationship. I still don't think I was in the wrong, but I also feel like things would have gone better had I just gone alone and listened to my GF from the start. Sometimes I feel like my decision to take M despite everything, because I felt like I was right, makes me the asshole.  

So what do you think?",34,49,0.89
1112,not the a-hole,"To clarify right off the bat, I have *no* intention of backing out of paying for the piece he already gave me. I'd never do that to someone, especially not a good friend. The WIBTA part of the question is specifically in reference to later pieces he agreed to do that he hasn't started yet.

So, my friend is an art major. I forget his exact degree, but I've seen his various pieces he's drawn/painted and he's genuinely incredible. He graduated with his bachelors *about* last year, I think, but didn't get a job after; talking about getting a ""crappy retail job"" as if it were beneath him at that point. Privately my girlfriend and I (I work in retail. She doesn't, but she started in hard labor before switching to public service, so she's no stranger to hard work) aren't really wild about that mindset, but I'm a little more forgiving because, given his home situation (Of which I won't get into the details of for his privacy), I can understand why the prospect of employment might risk making him feel a bit trapped.

He recently, however, *did* finally break down and now has two jobs lined up. It seems like the timing coincides a bit with his money drying up, however, as he mentioned off-hand that until he officially starts and gets paid he's probably gonna have to cut back pretty tight on food. After talking a bit with him about if there was anything I could do to help, I suggested maybe I could commission art from him. We're (He, my girlfriend, and I) all turbo-nerds and enjoy playing D&D-esque games together, so I offered to pay him for art of my character. My though process being that, hey, it'd maybe feel a little patronizing to just throw money at my friend. But this'd be paying him for something he went to school for, plus give him something he could use on his portfolio! He agreed, and in the end my girlfriend got in on it, too. He set his price at $50 a piece (Perfectly reasonable for me, especially given I *know* the quality of his stuff), so with one for my girlfriend and two for me it put us at $150 total.

So he did one of mine first, and it's... My girlfriend described it as a ""mediocre deviantart OC"", and the kind part of my brain really wants to refute that, but.. It does. It's really, genuinely quite bad. The anatomy and proportions are really off, the colors are exceedingly bright with really poor shading. Colors are bleeding out of the lines all over each other (This is digital art) and into the background, you can see the background *through* his pants. His one hand has unseparated squared-off *blocks* for fingers, while the other's got a Higurashi-style ovenmitt look going on; just a solid lump with a thumb separated. I also provided him with a very detailed description to work with and an image reference, and it seems like he completely ignored half of it and just did whatever he wanted. There were even points where, as he was sending me updates, I'd make a note of something asking if it could be changed (Nearly always something that'd been listed in the stuff I gave him) and while some things he fixed, others he just completely ignored me on. I tried really, really hard to be as polite as I could about it, but there were some things I mentioned *multiple times* as he gave updates and he just kinda kept doing his own thing. So on top of being poor quality, it doesn't even really look like what I'd intended at all.

Sorry this is so long. But in essence I'm really disappointed. The crux of it is I've *seen* his art before, and I know how high-quality it is. This just looks like he didn't even try, and I feel so selfish and spoiled for thinking that. But I feel taken advantage of. My girlfriend is wanting to back out of her commission for him, and is advising I do the same for my second one. I want to help my friend, but also this just feels crummy. AITA for being upset?

Dear All

I would like to bring your attention to the use of the group email function. I notice that many people are using this and would like to clarify how and when it should be used. Please note the following points:

* Group emails should be restricted to issues that always get complained about, but never change.

* Always adopt an extremely passive aggressive tone when group emailing.

* Put random words in the email in **bold** to make your point.

* Please make sure you read the date of the email in question before responding to it ;) 

Thank you for your attention

However, he doesn't know any complex stuff of how society works like what government is, how it works, how voting works, what voting does, what policies are, what taxes are and what they do and what political parties are, etc etc...

Anyone who votes should be capable of making an informed decision through their own research and examination of the various parties and policies...

So I said as much to my mother the other day... I said ""John won't be voting right?""

Immediately she got defensive and said ""why wouldn't he?""

So I replied ""well being realistic here and not trying to hurt feelings, he doesn't know how government works or how voting works so it's not really right if he votes"".

So immediately she replies ""well John WILL be voting because its his civic right and he's allowed to, so he will"".

Then it hit me, my parents are probably going to manipulate John to vote the way they want... So I replied ""okay but if he does you should let him go vote by himself. If you're planning on manipulating his vote by telling him who to vote for that's not right"".

So she replied ""OH YEAH!?"" with hostility... So I dropped it at that point.

Anyways this was a few days ago and i'd been stewing over this... And it disgusted me that they were more than likely planning to manipulate John to curry a vote in their favor since he doesn't know what voting is or how it works...

So anyways last night i'm at dinner with my dad and he gets into a political rant about the candidate he hates... I just bit my lip, I hate when my dad goes on political tangents because we don't quite see eye to eye on politics... But anyways I HAD to ask him if him and my mom were planning to use John's vote for their political party, just to confirm and so I could say something... 

So I said ""are you planning on using John as an extra vote for your party?"" and without hesitation he nodded.

So I said ""that's pretty low of you"".

So my dad got a little agitated and said ""well I don't want that buffoon getting elected"" and rambled on a little more about how he hates this particular candidate...

So I replied ""it's morally wrong and you know it"".

And he replied ""so what"" and sorta shrugged... So I dropped it there. I was feeling myself getting more and more pissed off and I couldn't keep going. 

So basically that's that. It just doesn't sit right with me... It just feels morally wrong. It's one thing to want to make my brother feel included since the rest of us are voting, but it's not just making him feel included... They have ulterior motives of telling him who to vote for to get an extra vote and that's what doesn't sit right with me.

But at the same time, I can't help but feel like a bit of an asshole since my parents tried to make me feel like i'm in the wrong... Am I out of line for thinking my autistic brother should sit this one out? Was I out of line for calling my parents out on their plan to manipulate his vote?

For the record, even though I don't think he *should* vote, if John *wanted* to vote and my parents let him go behind the ballot box by himself and he just picked one... I'd be somewhat alright with that since it'd be his decision... But it's the fact that John doesn't even know there's an election coming up and that my parents are going to bring him to the polls and tell him who to vote for that rubs me the wrong way. It just feels fraudulent and wrong.

So tell me guys, AITA? 

TL;DR - Parents are planning to use my autistic brother to vote the way they want him to. I called them out and told them it's morally wrong and fraudulent to do that. They made me feel like I was an asshole.",73,420,0.96
1119,not the a-hole,"I'm a retail manager in a large department store. This store likes to advertise all sorts of discounts that apply to almost nothing, or require opening a credit card, or have some other bullshit attached to them. Then they advertise 30% off and it applies to 10% of the merchandise with the other 90% taking no discounts whatsoever. It's frustrating and confusing, I assume deliberately.

All the time I get foreign customers who hardly speak English at all. They see these large advertised % offs and try and purchase stuff. Then they refuse to take no for an answer. It is very annoying because I have no means to explain to them that this is the case. I try not to be rude, but I honestly feel that if you can't understand the fine print and a manager is telling you otherwise, you need to shut up and deal with it. I'm sick and tired of arguing with these people for what seems like hours.

Again, I try not to be rude. I try to explain things as simply as possible, but many of these people only know a few words. When I told my friend about this he told me I'm a racist bitch.

1121,not the a-hole,"There is a common joke amongst the people with whom I work in the same company that getting something fixed will only result in it breaking down again within a week. This is true. I had the air conditioning unit for the sleeper birth of my tractor fixed sometime last month. Last week while driving through Texas into New Mexico, the unit started blowing hot, dry air rather than cold air. 

Since temperatures across the US have risen to high 80’s / low 90’s, this has made sleep somewhat unbearable. I didn’t tell my dispatch of this problem until today because I deliver tomorrow in Maryland after having picked up in Idaho, and I wanted to keep a set schedule until delivery. I toughed it out, bought a small fan to keep me cool, kept the windows down, and dealt with it. 

But when I finally told my dispatch of the problem, they replied “you JUST had it fixed. Are you serious?!”

I replied yes. I’m serious. 

They replied “this isn’t a serious problem. Get it fixed on your next home time”. 

So I told them that I took measures to tolerate it for a short time. Just enough to finish this load, then find a place to fix it. They said no. If it isn’t a serious problem, then I don’t need to stop my “work-flow” to worry about it. So I have to “man up” and deal without AC until my next weekend off, which is in three weeks.

1122,asshole,"I’ll start off my saying that I lack experience with women and this causes me to basically freeze up and not take action when I know that that action would lead to sex. I’ve also never even kissed a girl or been in a relationship, so I’m also terrified of anything leading to those. I think these weaknesses and fears have hurt good people that wanted to get closer to me and I pushed them away like I didn’t even care (even though I usually do care). The last case of this - with the girl I’m mentioning in this post - is the worst one. 

I (24m) first met this girl last year as she started working at a bar I go to every now and then. I knew she liked me, or was at least interested in me, when we first met. She gave me these “heyy you’re really cute” eyes. On the receiving end of that, I imagine that I must’ve done something similar because she is a really beautiful woman. That night we first met, I barely talked to her and already started to push her away (it felt like that anyway), when in my mind, I wanted nothing other than to talk to her and get to know her. A prime example of me falling to my fears.

After that night, however, I started to get to know her a lot better. She started frequenting the same bars as me and we always talked. We would even play songs in the jukebox together, we played footsie while talking, and she would give me these melting hugs after a while. 

Eventually, in a roundabout but obvious way, she told me she liked me. I liked her too, but never said anything that night or any night after again. She’s one of the most beautiful women I’ve ever seen and I couldn’t even give her a simple compliment. I guess I was scared that if I did that, it would pretty much be me saying that I like her... but I do like her! She had to know that I was attracted to her, so all I can think is how she must feel that I never went out of my way to tell her or try to talk to her outside of the bars (which I never did). It was like I was just leading her on or messing with her feelings. 

I started having really bad nightmares where I was constantly running for my life. I think these occurred because I was evading from the fact that I liked her.  Recently, I wanted to finally say something, but she had to move back to her home state due to family issues. I sent her a text but never got a response. Not long after that I saw her post a snap story with another guy. I sent her a snap the other day but she never opened it.

I feel like I really hurt her due to my lack of action. I often wonder how I would feel if someone did something similar to me. This is a huge regret I’m having right now and I’ve lost some sleep over it. I’m not even sure why I’m posting this, maybe just for confirmation I guess. Maybe I just needed spew out my feelings, I don’t know. I just don’t understand why or how I could push someone like her away from me. I miss her. ",36,99,0.93

I don’t speak much with this brother but I hear stuff through the grapevine. And in one of my calls with exsil she mentioned that she hadn’t gotten child support in like 2 years. And she had no idea how to get a hold of brother. Well I know that at least half of my family knew were he was staying but they denied it to exsil, because she’s not family. 

I don’t live near most of my family or that brother. But this is my niece and nephew we are talking about, and I knew that brother was working. So I figured out were and told exsil. So she reported him and he got into a lot of legs trouble, due to the fact that he committed identity theft of a super close relative who had no idea.

Now to my asshole moment. Taking the kids home today I came across a cow in the road and an old farmer trying desperately to get said stubborn cow back into the pasture. I stopped so I wouldn’t spook the cow. Radio headquarters and tell them my route is delayed due to cow on road. I see the open gate he’s trying to push the cow into. It’s beside me on the left. Farmer moves his truck over to allow me by but cow decides to move in opposite direction of the gate so I decided to back up and allow him to maneuver his truck to block the road further and prevent the cow from taking off!

Farmer smiles and waves and I feel like an awesome little helper!

There is a charity hike every year that I like to do. My wife and daughter usually come with me. Since we had something else to do later in the morning my wife wanted to cancel, my daughter didn't want to go either. The hike starts at @7am and the latest you start is 11am. The other event was 11 am, so I told my wife, I was going to go early and be one of the 1st on the trail and be finished in enough time to go to the later event. She decided that she was still going to skip this year. 
The later event was cancelled a few days before so I asked my wife if she wanted to go. She said yes and I also made plans to take my daughter and her friends swimming after the hike. 
The morning of the hike my wife says she needs to go to her weight watcher meeting and there were somethings she needed to pickup at the store before the hike. Prior to this there was no mention of the WW meeting, so I got a little pissed. I asked if she could go but leave a little early. No the meeting was an hour and  she intended to stay for the full meeting. I told her I would stop at the store, but I was taking the kids swimming, so I wanted to be start as early as possible. 
I get to the hike at 10 and message her, of course she stayed the whole meeting and is half an hour away. I told her I would start and take the long route (5 miles) if she took the short route (3 miles) we should meet up where the trails meet back up.   
I get to the meeting point and text her, but no answer.  I waiting a few mins then start off again. She calls crying, saying how she just wanted to spend time together and how mean I was being. I asked where she was and turned around and walked back to meet up with her. She was upset and I guess felt I need to apologize, but I told her that she made her choose (the WW meeting) and that she shouldn't have sprung the meeting at the last min or been willing to compromise and leave the meeting early. 
She is still pissed today, because I didn't apologize. My initial reaction was to say I was sorry, but I didn't because I don't feel I was wrong.

So I mentioned one ticket, and he said she will need a ticket. So I said, ok, I will try to get one for her. 

I had already assured the girl from my school that I would give her a ticket, and going back on my word makes me feel literally physically ill. My plan was to try and buy a ticket from someone who has a spare, but no one has any.

My mother said that family is more important than the girl from my school who I barely know. I ended up having to lie to the girl and deny her the ticket. I feel horrible, and I am fuming that my sister\-in\-law basically invited herself to my graduation. Particularly since I didn't get to invite my sister, who will hear about this and think I like my brother more than I like her. And the girl from my school thinks I am a liar and a real jerk. 

My mother also says that if you invite a married person to an invent, it's expected that their spouse is also invited. Is this true? Am I an asshole for not inviting them as a pair and for being livid that she weaseled her way into an invite?",17,39,0.92

1158,asshole,"Her dirty/unpleasant habits. 

She shreds hair like a bear, never has the initiative to pick up/sweep her hair in the room and the bathroom. She is also an unorganized bathroom user. She leaves all her bottles scattered, and some soap suds are not watered all the way down the drain. I mean, isnt this just common courtesy for the next user?? 

Her dishes. Horrible. Flies come in our room ‘cause her dishes are left for 3 days. I come home late so i cant initiate washing, but she’s there as early as 6PM. And it’s HER dishes.

The microwave, gosh, it’s mine btw. When she eats her food, it has the tendency to splatter all over. She does not have the initiative to clean up after. There was a time when I came home to an unpleasant smell. I traced it going to the microwave, and to my surprise an oyster meat was freaking sitting there all weekend!! With molds!!! And again I come home late and eat dinner out 99% of the time, but I still clean the microwave since it’s mine and I spent for it.

Lastly, she’s fond of watching TV series on her laptop in full blast, even when im resting/sleeping. I work in a very toxic place, so i just want to rest (in peace, literally) when i go home. I hear war sounds and noisy angry movies (she likes these things) as I lie down on my bed. This is the point when I tell her to please turn down the volume as Im resting. She’ll agree but when she gets carried away after a few minutes, she blasts the volume again! And reacts with a shriek on every intense movie scene!

She’s 35 and Im 23, AITA for expecting her to be more mature by this time? I am not the type to call out (introvert issues) so i just express my disappointment thru silent treatment. I did reminded her to fix her ways nicely one time, but she’ll just change for 2 days. Afterwards, it’ll be like nothing happened. I cant bear to talk to her these days. Zzzz",29,33,0.9

1160,Def. not a-hole,"I probably sound like an asshole but hear me out. I’m an admin of a local Facebook group for parent  meet-ups and kid activities. People have to answer how old their kids are and what neighborhood they live in before they can join the group (it’s for parents with children of any age, we just have to make sure they HAVE children). 

A girl tries to join the group and says she has one angel baby. There are plenty of moms and dads in the group who have lost children and we welcome them, but then I look on this girl’s profile and it looks like she had a miscarriage when she was 7 weeks pregnant and has no other children. I get that that’s very traumatic and sad but she’s not a parent. It’d be one thing if she had a born child that died, then we’d let her in, but a miscarriage and no other kids doesn’t count as being a parent. 

I didn’t say that to her though, just declined the request and moved on. A few days later she tried to join again and I declined her once again. Then this morning she tried AGAIN and I just blocked her from the group. Then I get a message from her asking why she hasn’t been added. 

Not wanting to be rude I asked if she had children. She said yes. I asked how old. She said ‘he died when he was 7 weeks old’. I played dumb a little and said ‘oh I’m so sorry, that must have been so tough, I know people who have lost their infants too and it’s absolutely heartbreaking’. She replies ‘well I was 7 weeks pregnant but it still counts because life begins at conception’. Then I asked if she had any other children. She said no, so I told her she probably wouldn’t be interested in our group because it’s for parents to meet up and have play dates and such. 

Then she said ‘I’m a parent. My child died’. And I said I was sorry but I had to respectfully disagree that a miscarriage with no other children counts as being a parent, but that I could direct her to some pregnancy loss support groups that sometimes do meet ups, if she was interested in that. 

She went OFF on me and said how I dare I tell her she’s not a mom, she carried that baby inside her for 7 weeks (not technically true but whatever) and she loved that baby as much as she’d have loved it if it had been born, and starts spouting off all these pro-life statements and I’m not here to debate abortion or anything but I don’t think I was wrong in telling her she’s not a parent and she can’t join a parenting group if she doesn’t have a child, living or dead. The child simply never came to exist outside her womb. I’m sure she has some issues stemming from her miscarriage, and of course that’s a very traumatic thing to have happen, but I still don’t think that makes her a parent? And I tried to be nice, it’s not like I reached out to her to tell her she’s not a parent, SHE messaged ME.

1161,"not a-hole, dense","I won't say much but here's a brief condition of the situation that's bothered me lately.

I [F16] am close friends with a guy [M15], for more context I had a crush on him at some point but gave up on it since I knew he was seeing someone else [F17] (they're close enough to dating and are pretty intimate towards each other, but aren't dating yet). Long story short the she and I also became friends and we've hung out a lot since then. We'd go out for food, or to the mall, casual stuff like that. We've probably hung out more than 10 times in the span of 3 weeks and that's quite a lot IMO.

Anyways, it's been good and all up until today. I asked them if they'd like to grab lunch at a restaurant near school since I would be going there alone and... why not? I thought we hung out a lot and it wouldn't be such a deal anyway. She said yes, he went along with it. During said lunch, he and I talked about game strategies (nothing big, he just told me the tactic to complete the game 2048) and I guess she felt left out somehow..? After that we then split up.

In the evening, I walked to the local mall (Note, WITHOUT any plans with them) alone and there i spotted them at the arcade. Then I approached them, since I was going to the arcade too (we hang out at the arcades a lot as well) and played a few rounds of Pump It Up, like usual. However, she seemed oddly quiet. After done being at the arcade then we walked back together (I have no idea why they waited for me, but they always have; so that was why probably). After these encounters, the guy chatted me (since she was also there with us) and told me that she's jealous of me.

I have no idea how...? Or why...? I feel like an asshole for thirdwheeling their relationship as well but I've been distancing myself from him because I was scared that this exact thing would happen (and it did... sighs). I did nothing out of the ordinary and yet... she also asked him why i was around, even though besides the lunch I never planned anything else with them that day. I thought we were friends and that'd be alright, but I feel like such an asshole right now even though I can't seem to figure what I did wrong. 

So folks, AITA?

A few years ago I was shopping with my friend and once we finished up, we got in my car. As I started the engine, a young family of 3 (mom, dad, infant) walked in front of the car. The mom  immediately looked at me and shouted ""Whoa!!"" Then mouthed ""Are you crazy?!?"" The dad, who was holding the child, kind of waved the child's hand at me saying ""heeey!"" as if to say ""look there's a baby here, be careful"" 

I sat there baffled at what just happened. What did I do? My friend was confused too. She thought that maybe it was the fact that they had the baby that made them react that way. Is it a crime, though, to start the engine as people are walking in front of you? The kid wasn't right in front of the engine, it was at the father's roughly 5'8 eye level. Also it's not like there was a threat of me running them over, I could only reverse to move at all.

However, I was joking around with him and then told him I read a theory about how the next Avengers movie will be 10 years in the future and the casualties of the movie

1175,not the a-hole,"So over two years ago a cat appeared in my yard. He was skinny, skittish, unneutered, and had a serious abscess on his rump, likely from a cat bite wound. I took him to the vet that night and had him treated. The vet estimated he was about six months old.

I called the local county shelters to file a found cat report. I also posted on Craigslist, posted his info at local vet offices, and kept an eye out for flyers. He was scanned for a microchip and didn't have one. 

At that point I didn't intend on keeping him and planned to find him a home when he was healthy. After his abscess healed he was still limping and we discovered his hind leg had been fractured and healed poorly. I spent several thousand to fix it and he just sort of slipped into the family.

To recap...I found a sick cat and spent a good chunk to get him healthy. The cat had no id and no one responded to my efforts to find the owner. I've now had the cat for almost two and a half years.

Recently someone contacted me on social media claiming to be the cat's original owner. The cat has distinctive markings and he has pictures to back this up. They allowed the cat to free roam and assumed he had been killed when he failed to return home one night. The owner's daughter was very upset by the loss. He wanted the cat back.

I refused on the basis that I've now had the cat longer then the original owner did, and his lack of responsibility in searching for the cat or providing a form of id. I feel I did my due diligence and I'm now very attached to the kitty in question. I also worry about his future if I did return him. 

I've been told by the owner and some of his friends that I'm a giant asshole for disappointing the daughter and stealing the cat. I think they're the asshole for writing their cat off as dead without a search and expecting me to give him up after having him for two years

1177,not the a-hole,"I will be graduating from college in a week, and while I am happy to be a college graduate, I am not exactly pumped to fork over another $150 to my college for a stupid ceremony. My parents and relatives on the other hand, won't stop talking about it.

If I could choose, I wouldn't even go to the stupid thing. As far as I am concerned, this is just another money grab by my university. I graduated Summa Cum Laude, got a very good job offer in my field, and used very little of my parents money to do so. To me, that should be what is celebrated, not me walking across a stage and shaking someone's hand for a piece of paper that is only going to collect dust. 

I can understand why some people might enjoy the ceremony, and they have every right to do so. But I'm a 3rd generation college grad from a middle class family, and the 8th of my familial generation to graduate, so its not like it was some HUGE battle to get here. To be honest, graduating college was always the bare minimum expected of me, and finally doing so is basically just a ""you didn't fuck up"" type of thing.

When I proposed to my family that we just skip the ceremony, and have a dinner or party instead they shot down the idea. Now as we get closer to graduation, they are constantly badgering me about getting extra tickets, picking up honor cords or stoles (which cost extra btw), getting grad pictures, etc. They also take it upon themselves to constantly make jokes at my expense about how ""I don't care"" about graduating, or how they didn't expect me to do so well.

1178,not the a-hole,"So, here is the situation. 

A few months ago (December 2017) my best friend and his girlfriend offered me to go to Oregon with them for a month. His girlfriend’s parents live there and it seemed like a cheap easy way to visit Oregon.  Also it is important to note that we live in Wisconsin, and Oregon is a 2000+ mile trip from where we live. Wanting to take this trip I told them I would go but i was not going to stay for a month. Instead I would drive up with them, stay for 8 days, and fly back, so I bought a 300 dollar plane ticket.  We also decided to save on hotels and stuff that we would drive all 30+ hours of the drive consecutively. 

It started out that we were going to take his car (he had bald tires.... very very bald) and he told me he was going to fix them. Money and time pass and he never fixed them. So, last week he told me instead we were going to take his girlfriend’s car. I told him I was fine with that as long as the car is safe. I just looked at the tires of this car though and they are only slightly less bald than his car! 

Her car’s tires have five lines going around the tire for the tread pattern. The outer most lines are completely bald and the deepest part of the tread (the middle line) only goes up to half of the word “we” in “in god we trust” when you do the penny test on the tread. 

This worries me because to my understanding bald tires issues are...
1. They are more susceptible to punctures. 
2. Have bad handling in weather (hydroplaning). 
3. Summertime heat + 33 hours of nonstop friction + bald tires = shelling a tire at 80 miles an hour and possibly dying/getting injured. 
4. Braking takes longer. 

When I brought this up to my friend he said i was crazy and that it is totally safe to drive 5000+ miles on bald tires and that I was causing unnecessary anxiety to him and his girlfriend. He said he drives on bald tires all the time. My retort was how many times did you drive 2000 miles nonstop on bald tires. 

If he doesn’t have a feasible way to fix the tires in a day before we leave I am not going with on the trip. 

Am I being an asshole? Am I being a pussy? Please lemme know. 

Tldr; Canceling a 2000+ mile road trip because my friend’s car’s tires are bald and unsafe.

A little background...

I [20F] have been casually dating this guy [21M] for about two months. I thought I was head over heels for him, but this last week I have realized he is unintentionally super self centered. I feel like I can hardly ever get a word out whether we are on the phone or in person. Other than this, he’s super sweet to me, sweeter than any guy has ever been to me. 


However, today REALLY pushed me over the edge. So, today is his birthday. Last night he apparently got super drunk because its his 21st. This morning he asked me if I wanted to go to breakfast. I picked him up and also gave him a gift. The whole time he was bitching about how much he drank, how hungover he was, etc. When we got to the restaurant he immediately went to the restroom. He did this about four times. I would be mid sentence and he would sprint to the restroom. He would also hint to the waiter how hungover he was to.. brag? I don’t know. Example: “hey can you bring me a room temperature water instead? it’s way more hydrating if you know what I mean.” 

So after a lot of bitching and moaning, he goes to the restroom again for about 30 minutes, leaving me at the table. I decided to pay for the bill because I’m a nice person and it is his birthday after all. The bill was 70 dollars, which would otherwise be fine... just a little annoying to spend that much after the whole ordeal, and he had about two bites.. not even bringing it to go. He immediately comes back, says he’s done and walks out of the door leaving me to carry everything. 

On the way home he continued to complain about how hungover he was. I told him I was just going to take him home so he could rest since he doesn’t feel well. My mom is in town visiting, and his excuse was “yeah also you should go spend time with your mom”. My mom has been here for a week... I have been spending time with her the whole time she’s been here, so it was almost like him saying that was to have me not come over, when I already said I was going to give him space and let him rest?! Then he asked if I was coming to his birthday celebration tonight and I said yeah, if you want me to! He then says he does but he will probably be talking to others quite a lot so he doesn’t want me to feel awkward. Hm.

I can’t tell if I’m being over dramatic/bratty/the asshole or if this shit really is annoying and gross like I think it is. I get that he was sick, but why ask me to hang out if you felt that ill? Ugh.

1184,not the a-hole,"I'm 9 months pregnant. As in I'm due in 5 days and could literally have this baby at any time. For anyone that doesn't have first hand experience with pregnancy this stage is exhausting. Your body is working super hard and just carrying all the extra weight if the baby and fluid around means your need for sleep is way higher than usual. But it's also way harder to sleep because you need to pee more often, get heartburn, and it's super difficult to get comfortable because of how limited you are in what positions you can lie in.

Now my husband for the past few weeks has had a pretty terrible flair up of sciatica. He's been put on anti inflammatories and muscle relaxants and been referred to this back therapy place that does all sorts of treatments for him and it has helped a lot but he's not 100% yet. Lying in bed for several hours does still often cause him to wake up sore and tight (not every night but often enough)

For both of us the situation seems to be that if you are asleep you'll stay asleep but if something wakes you up you'll be just uncomfortable enough to have a really hard time falling back asleep which between each if us tossing and turning with our various discomforts is definitely feeding into to both our issues. For example, tonight I woke up around 3 to pee. I don't turn any lights on and do my best to be quiet but when I got back in bed I had definitely woken him up because he started shifting a lot and was clearly uncomfortable because he started doing some of his leg stretches in bed. They're not super crazy and he wasn't being super loud or anything butbibwas already awake and just uncomfortable enough that the little bit of movement and hearing him exhale slightly louder than usual was enough to keep me awake. It was probably about a half hour before he was able to get comfortable and settle back to sleep but by then my hip was starting to get sore from lying on it so I had to roll over which is a bit of a big production when you have a giant watermelon strapped to you and have to rearrange all your pillows which I think woke him up a bit more so for a little while we were both shifting a bit trying to get comfortable. By the time we both were I had kind of gotten to the point of just being awake and lied there fora while longer before I just decided to get up at about 430. We also have a 3 year old so getting a nap in is pretty iffy

So I think we'll both sleep better if we're in seperate rooms for a little while, either until his sciatica is better or I have this baby. The thing is the extra bed is a twin so it could be viewed as a downgrade. I don't really think it would be, your own bed, even a twin, is probably going to result in a better sleep overall than sharing a queen with another pers .on who is super restless and tossing and turning a lot. I'd honestly have started sleeping there myself if it weren't for the fact that we bought this gel mattress topper that has made such a huge difference in my hip pain. There isn't really a way to fit a queen sized mattress topper onto a twin bed but it has helped so much with my hip pain that I suspect sleeping by myself without it would be just as bad.

At the same time though, suggesting my husband sleep there feels like I'm essentially kicking him out, blaming him for my sleep issues, and not being sympathetic to the fact that he's in pain too.

Should I ask him to sleep in the twin spare bed anyway or just suck it up?

Edit: Thanks for the input everyone! I'll ask him to try it for a night and if he has a worse sleep or his back gets worse than welcome him back happily but hopefully he'll at least be status quo or even improve with the firmer bed (and I'll get to toss and turn to my hearts content)",116,212,0.93

1190,not the a-hole,"Let me preface by saying this: I have a complex mental health history that makes anxiety attacks and paranoia an unfortunate part of my life.

Edit: I mean “not talking to” in the sense of opening up. I will still talk with them when we get together and I want no bad blood between anyone.

Cast: 
Mom= mother in law 
Wife= sister in law

That said, I talk to my sister regularly about things but not really anyone else. I talk to my mom and dad but my relationship with them is very superficial. For all they know I’m “just depressed”. 

My husband is not the greatest when it comes to dealing with my bad days. He doesn’t know what to say or how to help me and has frequently told me to open up to his brother’s wife (we all went to high school together and we’re pretty friendly) or talk to his mom since she’s more open than my own mom. 

The few times I’ve opened up to either the wife or the mom, it always gets around. For example, the wife and mom have a great relationship. They see each there almost everyday and when they aren’t together they’re talking about making plans. I confessed to the wife that it hurt me to see how great her and the Mom’s relationship is. I told her “I wish I had what you had with Mom. I feel like mom and I never had a chance to build any kind of relationship.” For context, we all grew up in the same area. My husband and I left the area when I went to college. The wife was understanding and even comforted me saying that whenever they did something together they wished it could be the three of us. 

A few months later, the family is hanging out after the wife/sister in law just had a baby. Mom pulls me aside and says “I hope you don’t get upset with her but [wife] told me that you don’t really feel like part of the family. I’m sorry if I’ve ever made you feel that way. It’s just a distance thing. You live so far away.” I was pissed. If I felt comfortable talking about this with the mom, I would have brought it up to her at the beginning. 

That same day, I made a comment about how spending all day with the baby was making me want one. “This baby fever is killing me. [Husband] and I might have to talk about having one”. My husband and I are in no way ready for a baby. Financially or health wise. It was just a comment. I love babies. Fast forward two weeks and we’re back in their area to visit and see the baby. My husband’s father (moms husband) comes up to me and says “so I heard that you want a baby. Are you really sure that’s a great idea? Being a parent is hard and I know you and [husband] have had your share of issues.” He went on to tell me all the difficulties I could expect from having a baby- basically lecturing me on why we’re not ready. He wasn’t in the room when I made the baby comment previously and I thought I was clearly joking. I made the baby comment to Mom so she could be the only person that would tell anyone. 

My husband is very open with his mother. Whenever we fight or I have a bad day, she hears about it. Once she hears about it, she tells her husband because they have “no secrets” and usually my sister in law finds out because “she’s family now”. I end up walking into a family function with everyone knowing my business. It’s embarrassing and hurtful. 

AITA for not wanting to talk to them anymore? My husband says this is how families are and I just don’t know because my “family is so fucked up”. ",29,31,0.8
1191,not the a-hole,"Hi guys. I'm feeling really conflicted about this situation. I have been living in a four bedroom apartment alone for the past five months. Each lease is individual, so I was always waiting for the landlord/management to move more people in. They didn't so this apartment has pretty much become completely mine in a sense, even though I knew if someone moved in, it wouldn't be ""mine"" anymore. 
Note: the apartment is advertised and only has ever been advertised as unfurnished by management. 
This Tuesday, three new roommate moved in. I wasn't happy, but obviously I have to live with it and I typically don't mind having roommates. The thing is, they all brought minimal kitchen supplies and have all decided that without asking if it was okay, they would use all of my stuff. Cups, plates, pans, utensils, everything. I only have three bowls, cups, plates, and each utensil. Had they asked, I would have allowed them to use everything, as long as they clean it right away because it's my stuff and I want to be able to use it when I want. 
But the thing is that they haven't asked me once and I will go to eat something and everything will be dirty in the sink. So, I packed everything up in boxes (since I'm moving in 10 days anyways) and only use it when I need it. I politely texted all three of them that they would need to get their own kitchen supplies from now on (they were going to have to when I left anyways) and that I did not appreciate them using everything without asking. They all replied that they thought everything in the kitchen was fair game (um wut... That's not how living with strangers work) and that I should just deal with it until move out and then they will get their own stuff. I am saying that that isn't fair to me. It is my stuff and they didn't ask, which is rude and not how you treat roommates you met for the first time a few days ago. I would also like to be able to eat when I want without having to clean the dishes that they used. 
I feel kind of bad for taking everything away from them and on one hand I feel like I should just deal with it for 10 days, but on the other hand, I'm annoyed that these people I have never met think they are entitled my belongings without asking. I will say I am the asshole for taking the microwave, toaster, and blender out of the kitchen, but I'm just annoyed with everything else. 
So am I the asshole?

1193,asshole,"My mom is the nicest woman you will ever meet. And of course I love her to death, but she is irrational and quite frankly irresponsible. Anyways, our house has always been messy. It's just how I grew up, didn't think twice about it. But as I've grown up, I am 19 now, I have started to actually care about what it looks like. Not for other people, just for cleanliness sake. So about 3 months ago I committed myself to cleaning 1 thing every 2 weeks. Up until now it has been dressers, cabinets, a freezer, etc. And stuff is finally getting cleaned around here. Note: My dad doesn't really clean but he gets a pass for working 60 hours a week. My mom works maybe 35 hours a week. No pass for her. Regardless, today I started on this large cabinet that is in the dining room. Just looking through the glass on it there is old China dishes with dust on them, torn apart board games, Christmas ornaments, etc. And then there is important stuff scattered in there as well like her childhood dog's ashes, family pictures, misc. jewelry, etc. So I get to work. I start sorting everything I think is worth keeping in one small pile and the rest goes in the bin. I am about done with half of it and I hear her get up. I already know I am about to catch some heat because she has tangled with me on some other stuff I have cleaned recently, but it has to be cleaned so I just wait. She comes around the corner and says ""What are you doing?!?!?!"". She starts digging through my trash pile and picks out 2 insanely old blood glucose machines and yells ""These are worth a lot of money, why would you do this?"". I begin to argue with her that I am keeping all the family and sentimental stuff, just getting rid of trash. It doesn't get to her, she keeps digging through the trash. Then she finds an instant drug test from 2005 and says to ""I keep one of these in here for emergencies, do not throw this away."" I stand my ground and tell her that if I let her keep things she think she needs then I will never get anywhere with this cleaning, so I am throwing away the drug test and blood glucose thingy. She was on her way out with my sister at the time she came around the corner so on her way out she throws the 2 things into the kitchen, hitting an ironing machine, and spilling its water onto the floor. Before she shuts the front door to leave she screams ""You are such a disrespectful little shit."" Boom. She's gone. I took it pretty well and just continued cleaning. Now I kind of get where she is coming from, she basically just wants to be the judge of what gets thrown out and what doesn't. But if I let that happen I won't be able to clean nearly anything because she is irrational in what she believes she needs to keep. AITA? 

Edit: I may not have explained it well enough but it is literal trash. We are talking ripped open bags of guinea pig hay with some sort of goo in it & old pieces of mail that came from some Auto-mail service for a car check-up. Am I just ignorant to some sort of mental condition? It doesn't seem that way at all but I am no expert. ",42,34,0.87

1195,not the a-hole,"So my cousin got married recently. I received an invitation well in advance, but surprisingly I was only invited to the party afterwards and not the actual ceremony.

I asked her about it and was quite offended to be told it was close family only. We are a close family, or so I thought. I'm older than her, we've been in regular contact since she was born and I used to babysit her. She wouldn't give any further explanation, so I told her if she doesn't think enough of me to see her get married, I don't want anything to do with the wedding.

I didn't go, now several family members including her are refusing to speak to me. I've been told I'm rude and disrespectful and that I should have been grateful for the invite. I've even been told to apologise, which I'm refusing.

AITA or nah?

EDIT: For more context; yeah I was butthurt, the reason I was hurt is because I've done more for her throughout her life than almost anybody else there, given her money as well as a place to live for free to stop her becoming homeless, and given her a job. I've never had as much as a 'thank you'.

I also have a 2.5 year old and a 2 month old with me. 

There are exactly 3 spaces in the line that are shaded. If I'm not in one of those 3 spots, then the sun is beating down directly on me and my 2 month old.

1202,not the a-hole,"I've been contemplating this issue for a long time (this happened in October) and I still am not sure if I was in the wrong here. It is a long story, so I appreciate if you are able to read the whole thing.

I had the same roommate since sophomore year of college-- we met freshman year. I'm a senior now. Things have been rocky since junior year mostly, but I decided to live with her senior year because she wanted to live together and I wanted to live on campus. I also considered her my best friend, and she considered the same of me. 

During all of junior year, and also less severely during sophomore year, things would be good between us for a period of time (usually a few weeks-max 2 months) and then she would seemingly randomly blow up at me. The reason was usually if I said or did something she didn't like or approve of, such as saying no to going somewhere with her or ever raising my voice (which is something I rarely do.) Throughout junior year we both struggled (she was in the midst of some health issues and I lost two people who were very close to me.) We tried to support each other but it was hard. I really don't like arguing and I told her that the arguments upset me, to which she told me that we don't fight that often. I really tried to apologize if I did something wrong and tried to avoid setting her off, but it never worked. She also made me feel guilty when I would try to do things on my own (would jokingly tell me I'm a bad friend.) She also used her medical issues to guilt me (you'll be sorry if I die.) I walked on eggshells to avoid upsetting her. She also had alarms go off really early in the morning for hours everyday and left our room a mess, but would get upset with me if I said anything about it.

Forward to senior year. She received news that she has a serious health condition over the summer (scared she might find this post if I go into more detail.) One that will progress over time, not something acute. She was having a very hard time dealing with it. I tried to be supportive but really don't know what to say. The first fight of the semester happens-- I do something with my roommate I said I would do with her and because of my idiot brain I unintentionally leave her out. She took offense to it-- I didn't react well and kind of just left for the night. Then another fight happens-- she goes to my house to pick up a package she had sent there and my Mom asks what's going on between us. She proceeds to tell my Mom for about 45 minutes about all the things I've done wrong (2 fights from this semester and not being supportive about her illness.) I decide that this is the last straw and submit a letter to move out. I couldn't mentally handle the fighting anymore or the anxiety of being around her, wondering the next time she was going to snap. Move out request was approved-- it was on campus apartment so this in no way impacted my roommates financially, the only way it impacted them is that they may be assigned a new roommate.

Basically, I'm stuck wondering if I'm the asshole for leaving someone who was struggling and really didn't have many other friends. This was mostly because she doesn't really like anybody, but I still felt bad leaving her. This was an extremely hard time for her and I still feel in the wrong for leaving someone at such a bad time. I haven't heard from her or seen her since, but I still can't move past this. It probably won't change anything in either direction, I just want to hear objectively if I was in the wrong here to better myself in the future. ",17,52,0.95

However, he lives with some people that use his debit card to make purchases and I know he isn't able to give permission. My name is also on his bank account as a joint account holder and I'm so afraid that they'll go clean the account out and spend every dime of it with him incapable of consenting.

Would I be the asshole if I went and moved money to another account with his name on it that they can't access and gave my dad cash when he demanded or needed it?

Should I wait until the court proceedings are finished?

His memory problems are so bad that while we were at the hospital yesterday he forgot several times why we were there, told the nurse the wrong problem, and asked why we made him have an IV while sitting in surgery pre-op. He's not aware of the next surgery he has to schedule because he's forgotten it from yesterday.

Yesterday, after surgery, they took him home (as one of them is his girlfriend) and immediately called me angrily demanding to know where his money was because his card wouldn't work. When they dragged him to the bank this morning and found out it was because of online charges that triggered fraud protection, they blamed me in front of the bank manager.

I currently don't have a debit card for the account, only he does.

Update: I did move the money to another account without a debit card. I've been to a lawyer and we have proceedings I don't know if I'm supposed to talk about yet.

1205,not the a-hole,"So long story short we basically date for about 4 months. We’re both very headstrong and dominant so from day 1 we had some friction, but we both wanted to make it work, and this guy is truly kind and caring towards me, so I thought we could try. 

Near the end of our first major argument 2 days ago (over the phone), he said maybe we should stop trying since it’s so hard. I know for a fact I’m less invested in this relationship, but even I thought it was silly to call it quits while we’re both high on negative emotions and bias and told him so. He insisted and I said yes, but you have to really mean it. He asked me a few more times if I was sure about this and I said yes, clearly and unwaveringly. He hangs up first. 

Then this guy continues to blow up my phone not 5 minutes after we hung up. He has these loooong conversations with himself, just sending me wall after wall of text that went from begging to just downright worrisome and creepy (the only text I sent him was to stop calling me and he responds with “hope you had a nice day! Etc. etc.”)

But I understand what heartbreak and grief can do to someone... and even though I found him too selfish and incompatible, he truly is a wonderful person and I feel bad for kind of leaving him with no closure or full explanation... but it exhausts me to even think about calling him. 

I did call him briefly after he sent me a text where I “broke” him and he can’t function at work. I felt for him so I called him briefly to tell him we’re both great people, just not good together, that he’ll be fine and move on and that I had been thinking this way for a long time, it wasn’t just a heat of the moment decision (for me at least). He started to say “if you felt this way why didn’t you tell—“ and I hung up on him. From day 1 this guy wouldn’t listen to me until I screamed the issue at hand in his face and even then, he’ll put the blame of him not listening onto me as “not voicing myself clearly enough.” I’m worried if I talk to him and he does that to me again I’ll most likely lose my cool and yell... which I don’t want to do. 

Initially, he clearly thought I was going to say something like “oh, don’t say that, let’s talk through this” when he called it quits—I know because he even said so, confirming my suspicions in one of his long ass texts. The biggest reason why we didn’t end up working out (and why I prefer to ghost him) is because of his little manipulation tactics and masterful use of words. Like, I’m way above that shit now (shoutout to my horrible ex) and it doesn’t work on me (which is why I think he just fell so hard for me) but it’s still exhausting and draining to deal with. 

The compassionate side of me wants to call him, let him vent his heart out to me, and I answer any questions he may have. But the tired, pissed off side of me doesn’t want to deal with any of his mind games and sobbing-pleading, and truthfully, a part of me doesn’t even wanna give him any type of closure. Let him suffer and wonder what he did wrong when I’ve been open and honest about it with him from day 1. 

Btw I’m a 21-year-old student and he’s a 28-year-old established guy. I’ve only had one relationship before and I don’t even count it as one because I was so traumatized and abused by it. I just don’t understand—isn’t he supposed to be the mature and rational one in all of this?? My personal belief is to discuss important things (things like ending a relationship) in person and in civil conversation.

I couldn’t let the cat stay there and face jumping from the 2nd story to the ground, but I also couldn’t let her be near my own cat who has previously shown a lot of aggression and fear when faced with a cat outside our windows.

First I took a few pics of the cat to show my roommates later.  Then I closed my own cat in the bedroom, opened the patio door, carried the cat through the apartment and put her outside the front door. Not a single scratch, pretty successful mission.  I did notice the cat was very vocal and clean, which was strange for a stray.

My messages would be ignored or maybe I’d get one reply with excuses “oh, I don’t get the text messages cz I’m on the school WiFi, or I’m not gonna see my dog soon” when we’ve had like a whole freaking month to do this thing! So anyhoo I end up looking up all the sources needed, putting everything in bullet form and even made a brochure myself because I don’t trust these chicks to do a good job. I took the responsibility of editing the video because again based on their attitudes I don’t trust them to not make some last minute thing, and I don’t want to put my name behind some BS. So in the past week, I’ve managed to get them to send me voice overs, and the two of them said they would make a brochure. The one chick sent me a 1 second video of her dog  panting in the car and a video of her dog at the vet but mostly the wall (so basically not helpful at all). I had to film my dog, my boyfriend’s dog and get stuff from YouTube. 

So WIBTA if I gave them low scores on the group member evaluation part of the project, even though they’ve been kinda helpful towards the end? I still feel like I basically did all the freaking work. It will affect their grade for the project and they’ll probably know it was me who gave them the low scores. ",20,44,0.95
1217,not the a-hole,"AITA. So I have a nice big garden, not overlooked, and live in the UK so sun is a rare luxury. When it is sunny I like to get out and either do some gardening or sunbathe in just some shorts.

I see my garden as an extension to my house, so if I'm in it I expect it to be my private space. Not bothered if the neighbors see I'm there, however my next door neighbor thinks it's fine to head straight to the fence when she spots me or any of my family, leaning over with her toddler and trying to talk to me.

I like my neighbor any other time, and they sometimes visit for a coffee and a chat so the kids can play together.

But surely I can go in my own garden without being bothered by them, or is it me being an asshole?

We have also in the past caught them, and visiting in-laws peeking from behind curtains to look at me and my wife sunbathing, which we found very creepy.

1218,not the a-hole,"On March 16 I got an email that I could preorder Infinity War tickets. I bought them right away, choosing two middle seats right behind some metal bars so my husband and I could put our feet up without bothering anyone. Our tickets were F11 and F12. We walked down the aisle and I stopped at F11. A man was sitting in F12. 

I've been in movie seat disputes before. They interrupt the movie and are inconvenient not just for those involved but for everyone. Its distracting, and it could cause a ripple effect down the row if he just chose the seats randomly. Along with that and not liking confrontation, I checked my tickets to make sure I wasn't mistaken. After checking and gathering my courage I turned to him to ask if he had the correct ticket. Before I could get more than ""Do you-"" out he says;

""Yeeeah, I bought seats F10 and F13 but I wasn't not going to sit next to my daughter."" I said it was fine and sat back. But while watching the movie I began to get more and more pissed off. My husband was sitting behind a seat instead of the bar. We weren't in the most middle of the theater now, this dude was. I bought those tickets 6 weeks in advance, and he just took one hoping his seat neighbor would just roll over and not bitch?

After the credits started to roll he and his daughter left, so I moved over to sit in the seat I paid for. I'm probably overreacting, but that feeling of sitting in the middle seat feels so good and the view was just a bit better. 

I didn't complain because I would have looked like an unreasonable bitch splitting up a dad and daughter going to the movies. But I prepared damn it. I would think that would count for something. 

Tldr- I bought tickets to a movie and a guy rearranged the seating situation to suit his needs (which meant taking the best seat for himself)

Edit- Lots of tough love here, but it's pretty accurate. My therapist said similar things in response and I found I was more upset at myself than the guy at the movies. Thank you for the comments (even the harsher ones). I appreciate it. ",24,59,0.91
1219,not the a-hole,"A bit of backstory:
- I’m 22 years old, and when I was around 1.5 years old my biological parents split up due to various issues.
- My mum got full custody and from what I have gathered my biological father had me on weekends. 
- After about a year or two (I was a baby so I can’t recall), some shit went down between BF (biological father) and his parents, my grandparents. He didn’t like that they continued a relationship with my mum and supported her just as they did for him. It sort of put a strain on their relationship.
- Meanwhile, my mum is a struggling single mother who made a lot of sacrifices to take care of me. She’s never phrased it like that, but I know it to be true. 
- When I was about 3 years old, mum bought me a pair of fairy wings because I liked them in the store. I pretty much wore them everywhere, even to bed. BF hated this, and guilted my mum into giving him some money towards a Power Rangers costume. Then, he went to his parents and asked *them* for money for the costume, effectively making money from a gift for me.
- Mum found out about this, and her and BF has their first and last argument since splitting up. Mum questioned why it was so important to him, and BD said something to the effect of “/u/luuvin is just going to grow up to be nothing but a poofter”. 
- Mum asked that he spend some time away from me if he was going to make those kinds of comments, which he did. NOTE: Not once has my mum ever denied him the right to see me, this was the only time she requested something like this.
- BF had a huge tantrum, and made his parents and their extended family choose between staying in contact with me/Mum and him. They chose me, because it made sense to favour the 3/4 year old than the baby. 
- After this all went down, I lost contact with BF for at least 10 years. During this time, mum found a partner who has raised me since I was about 5/6 years old. That’s my dad. He gave me two amazing sisters and has done everything a father should do, including support me when I came out as gay (even as a devout Christian, it’s never been a problem for him). 
- Apart from one instance when I was 13 and BF tried to Facebook message me (which I deleted and blocked him), there had been not attempt at contact.

So here’s where my dilemma lies.

It’s been almost 20 years without contact, including with his own parents (my grandparents, who I see all the time and have a great relationship with). 
Mum asks me every 6-12 months if I have thoughts about meeting BF, letting me know she supports whatever decision I make and she wants me to be happy. 

This past weekend, my grandparents reunited with BF and my grandmother called to inform me the day after. It sounds like he dealt (and is dealing with) some substance abuse issues, but he’s been sober for a year and has a wonderful new partner and adoptive daughter. That’s amazing, good on him. 
His meeting with my grandparents seemed to be part of a step-program where he admits and owns up to all his mistakes and hurtful choices, which honestly sounds very brave and important for him. It sounds like he understands what his actions did to his family, including me, and thats an important part to adulthood that he’s finally grasping in his 40s.

My grandmother mentioned that he’ll probably look to meet with me eventually, as I’m sort of the biggest mistake in his life. He knows I’m gay, and have a partner and a father and sisters, and is apparently incredibly happy for me. 

My problem is, I don’t necessarily have any interest in this meeting. I haven’t for 20-odd years. It would be like someone walking up to you on the street and saying “Hey, wanna meet John Doe?” 
I don’t know who this man is, other than the fact that I share his DNA. Which to me, has never been important — I already have a father who I share no biological relation to and we have an incredible bond. 

If it’s forgiveness he’s after, I can’t give it to him, because I don’t hate him for what he’s done. I have a family and a life that I’m proud of, even at 22, and it’s not because of or in spite of his actions. But I can’t forgive him. It wouldn’t feel true and right. And I don’t want to meet him. Not out of hatred or fear, but out of apathy. He is no more or less important to my adult life than John Doe. I hope he is very happy and health, though, but I would feel this way for any stranger. 

Am I an asshole for feeling this way? ",14,31,0.88
1220,not the a-hole,"A bit of backstory. My dad's parents have 5 grandkids. My brother (28), then me (26), then my sister (21), and then two male cousins (20 and 18). My grandparents have always put my two cousins on a pedestal. The favoritism is blatant. My siblings and I have sat around for years watching my cousins be gifted with surfboards, a drum kit, new guitars, a car, you name it. And the cherry on top now was one cousin getting a motorbike, and the other getting a ridiculously expensive gaming computer. For my birthday last year, they gave me a spoon. I shit you not. A fucking spoon. And for the past few years, my dad, my siblings and I have pulled out of buying Christmas presents for all 15 members of the family. Not for selfish reasons. We told them that we would rather use that money to donate to charity. Which we've done for the past 3 or 4 years. And we have been ostracized for it.

They also never ask me how I'm doing, I never hear from them and when I do see them they shit me out for not visiting, even though they know that I literally only get 2 days off of work in a month.

My boyfriend says that I should still spend time with them because they're old and probably won't be around much longer. But why should I spend what little time I have off of work with people who make a point of making me feel like I'm not good enough.

The bus situation in the city is somewhat bad, even though not horrible. I learned that it´s custom to wait until everybody got out until the people got into the bus.

1224,not the a-hole,"Going to try not to make this the longest post ever.

I use to fold my husband's clothes as well as my own AND put them away. Several times, he criticize HOW the were folded (with no ""thank you"" for folding them) and I eventually just told him ""hey, I'll just stick your clothes to the side because I don't fold 'em like you do and I can't seem to get them to fit in the drawers."" No big deal.

It's been this way for....years now. Now, we have two sons so I fold and put away their clothes, as well as my own and, again, set my husband's clothes to the side. It's not really been an issue until tonight.

A few days ago, the bed was COVERED with clothes--not just his, everyones! I needed to get them all put away so I could strip the bed and lay a new sheet down. I texted him and told him that I would fold his clothes and sit them in his closet and he could organize them when he got home (because I didn't want to throw a fuck ton of clothes, unfolded in his closet and I didn't want to put them on the floor while I did the bed because we have dogs that tag EVERYTHING.)

He was cool with it at the time but came home and proceeded to get sort of pissy that I had folded them and put them in his closet but I didn't sort them first. Seemed kinda petty to me so I told him that he is welcome to fold his own clothes and that I did what I did as a favor.

Flash forward to tonight:
I did 3 loads of laundry today (again, not just his, everyones). So the bed had a decent amount of clothing on it. I folded mine and the boys and, while in the room, my husband called out and asked what I was doing (he was in the living room). I told him I was busy with laundry (so he knew there would be clothes for him) and I left his clothes where I normally leave them. Again, no big deal.

We get ready for bed and I finish brushing my teeth, our toddler's, and change the baby and come into the bedroom to all of his clothes on my side of the bed. I laughed it off and told him that I had put them on his side so I could put everyone else's away. He laughs but you could tell he was pissy and tells me that I was (paraphrasing) an the asshole for ""just throwing them"" on his side of them bed and not warning him before he laid down that he would have clothes to fold. 

So, instead of folding them, he did exactly what pissed him off in the first place and he threw HIS clothes on MY side and left me no where to sleep. I inform him of what he's done and that I couldn't sleep in the bed because his shit was in the way. And he just keeps saying ""okay, babe, okay."" He keeps saying this as I'm asking where I am suppose to sleep and when I ask if he is being serious. He eventually gets pissed enough to throw his shit in our floor. I grabbed my pillow, phone, and blanket and am currently on the couch. Told him I wasn't going to deal with that kind of attitude all night.

I heard him get up a bit ago and mess in his closet so he either put them away or shoved them in there unfolded. I find I don't really care. This is a dumb, petty-ass thing to fight about. I told him he could be really selfish sometimes and left it at that. I just hope I'm right about being upset about his attitude. I mean....I put his clothes away, he complains, I stop. Then I sit them folded in his closet once, he expects me to do it forever or ""warn him."" I feel like that's a really childish thing to complain about. 

No one ""warns"" me that I have a sink full of dishes to wash when I wake up--that I'll have to clean before I can cook. No one ""warns"" me that there is a fuck ton of clothes to wash--that I'll have to wash before I (or anyone else) can take a bath. I just have to know these things or I suffer the consequences.

But, maybe I'm being petty? Or maybe we both are? (Probably)

Edit:
Wow. Did not expect this post to take off like it did. (May not seem like much to you guys but this is the most attention something of mine has ever gotten.) I sat down and wrote him a letter in the middle of the night. He may or may not have read it this morning, not 100% sure because I was  half asleep with the kids when he left but he did kiss me bye and tell me he loves me. May not be a big deal to most people but, for my husband, it says a lot. Most of the time he just stays mad, doesn't say anything when he leaves and gets in a worse mood at work, doesn't call to check up on us or anything. So, that is very telling for him to tell me good bye. Obviously I'm not leaving it at that and I'm going attempt to actually talk to him once the kids get to sleep tonight. 

I have a good feeling about this because I'm going in, for once, sticking to my guns. I told him in the letter that something just HAS to give. That he has always been my very best friend but I feel this distance and I believe it is what is causing us to have these dumbass petty fights. So, I'll keep everyone updated if something crazy happens. Certainly didn't come here for advice but I'm very, very glad you guys gave me some. Thank you so much.",117,169,0.97

1226,not the a-hole,"Sorry for format, using mobile.

So a little bit of background before I get to the actual prank. I (19,male) am in my second year of university  and am living in an apartment with 5 other uni students (2 girls and 3 other lads). Knew the lads before we started living together so we were already friends. Only met the girls this year. After an awkward start (due to me being incredibly shy meeting new people) we became really close friends, to the point were they said that I was their best male friend and vice versa. Would spend hours talking about literally anything. 

Every weekend the girls go back home (leave Friday evening and return Sunday afternoon). 

So on this particular weekend when I was doing my laundry I came across several sheets of paper with “out of order” printed on them. I thought it would be pretty funny if I stuck one of them to the door of the elevator in our apartment. (Apartment is 3 stories tall, I live on the 2nd floor).

My first housemate to return was one of the girls, we’ll call her Tall girl. So she arrives at about 6 in the evening and hear her come in the door and put her bags in her room before leaving again to go park her car in the car park. (The car park is about 5 minutes away from the apartment and the area outside the apartment is set down only). 

I time it pretty well and just as she’s returning to the apartment I’m removing the sign from the elevator. She sees me taking it down and realises that the elevator was not actually broken. Her reaction is pretty much what I expected, anger at first but then she sees the funny side and laughs. 

I ask her should I leave the sign up for our other housemate, short girl. Tall girl says “well you put it up for me so it’s only fair if you do the same for her”. I agree and put the sign up again. 

We return to the kitchen and chat about our weekends etc until short girl returns. Again we hear her come in the door and wait a few minutes until she walks into the kitchen. As she walks in I ask if she had many bags to carry. She replies “not really. Just my backpack and 1 suitcase.”
“You know there’s nothing wrong with the elevator? That was him” Tall girl admits while we both try to suppress laughter.
As she says this I’m expecting pretty much the same reaction as before. But boy was I wrong. Short girl immediately starts shouting and snapping at me. Saying that “it’s not a funny prank. It’s a shit prank actually. And it’s a pretty shitty thing for you to do and I don’t see why you’d think that would be funny” 

This is also like the only time she’s ever been actually mad it me I’m the last 6ish months. I’ve never been on the receiving end of one of her outbursts and I instantly knew that she was actually mad. 

She storms out of the kitchen and doesn’t talk to me until the next evening. When she does talk to me she says that it was a stupid prank and that I was being an asshole.


Am I the asshole?

1229,not the a-hole,"It's a long story so I'll try to summarize it as briefly as I can.

Basically my gf and I had been dating for a while and we ended up breaking up for about a month because we couldn't resolve some issues. We got back together a couple of months ago. Now that were back together, things are better than ever between us.

We were going to go to prom together before we broke up. 

In the time we were broken up she's decided that she's going to prom with another guy, as they're good friends. 

She still wants to go with him.

I feel like its important to mention that I am not in school.

 BUT, she fully expects me to dress up and make an appearance there while the parents are there and socialize, and watch her do a grand march with yet another one of her guy friends as I stand on the sidelines. I would have to leave with the parents afterwards, while she spends the rest of the evening there. I don't even own dress clothes.

 So I'd be buying dress clothes just to stand around a bunch of adults and peers who I don't really socialize with for maybe 45 minutes or so, probably with my hands in my pockets and my head down, just to leave while she spends the rest of the night with her prom date. I told her today that I'm not interested in going (in person) and now shes not replying to my texts. 

I feel like she would be beside herself if the roles were reversed.

She told me that she only doesn't want to go with me because it would be unfair to her current prom date, since they're such good friends.

I have no problem with the guy whatsoever, I just think it's ridiculous that she expects me to sit there and watch her take photos and dance with 2 other guys. 

Edit: The reason she thought it would be unfair for the other guy was because he'd have to find a new date, which he may or may not have had trouble doing. That was 3 months before Prom. Prom is now about a month away, so it's certainly too late to find a date, meaning she's almost certainly not going to change her mind even if she starts seeing things clearly. 

Thought I should mention that I'm in no way jealous of the other guy, nor am I insecure that he is in any way going to try or do anything, they have been friends for years and nothing more. 

I just think it's stupid that I should have to go ""Show my support for her"" as she put it, on her prom night, when I am in no way directly involved with her that night, other than the fact that everyone does know that we are dating. Thats part of the reason why I feel like it's weird.

I confronted her about it tonight, asked her how she'd feel if she were in my position. She got pretty upset that I didn't want to go and said she'd absolutely go and show her support for me. I'm not so convinced of that.
What woman would stand for a guy going to prom and grand march with 2 different girls, even if they're just friends. 


It's just ridiculous.

This time; however, one of our friends' boyfriend (who none of us like) brought a bong and some marajuana. I begrudgingly said that it was okay as long as it never entered my house and was never smoked in my house when his girlfriend asked if he could bring it this one time.

Well, wouldn't you know it, he brings it into my house and immediately pulls out a lighter and tries to light it right in front of me, first thing. I told him to stop and not to do it again. He did this three times during the night between going outside to smoke. 

Then, at 11:30, I had to leave to take two people home, and according to the other people there, he both asked his girlfriend for sex, both in my room and on my couch and then he proceeded to again attempt to light his bong before the others could stop him.
When I came home, I had to tell him a few more times not to smoke on my house. 

When my girlfriend and I went to bed, his girlfriend and he slept on the couch and another friend slept on the floor. The floor friend reported to me this morning that he apparently asked his girlfriend for sex a few more times and apparently he heard some faint sex noises from the couch.

I texted him and told him that he was no longer allowed to come over because he disrespected my home and he disrespected me. He never replied, but his girlfriend texted me and my girlfriend claiming he was just joking about the weed.

He would get up and go to work either way come morning. We moved in together after only 3 months (I was living with a friend and it was a bad situation) and everything was fine at first.

I also don't want to talk about my other friends unless they are actually present. But I'm happy to talk about nearly everything else.

I get mean looks and now a lot of people think I’m transphobic and are very rude to me. I feel really sorry for doing it and I don’t mean to cause harm.  Am I the asshole? Am I transphobic? Am I part of the problem? Are people like me the reason trans kids kill themselves? ",64,42,0.8
1238,not the a-hole,"For some context: 

I'm a 17 year old girl, and I was adopted and raised by my grandparents. Growing up, life wasn't bad at all. I mean, I was a happy kid. I went to school, made straight A's in elementary, would come home, and pretty much would just watch TV, play with friends and toys, and was content with what I had. But as I got older, things between my grandparents began to kind of spiral out of control. My grandpa used to work for sears, but he retired. After he retired, he was extremely unhappy with life. He would sit on the couch day after day, and just watch TV. He was also really overweight, and was unhappy with himself for it. But he'd often take it out on my grandma, to the point where it would escalate to a bunch of insults being thrown at one another, but it would never get as bad as it does now. 

But as I've continued to get older, it's gotten worse and worse. To the point where it often escalates into screaming matches between the two of them. Most of the time they end up taking it out on me as well. I mean in the past I've been pushed and hit on out of anger because I'd get frustrated and felt so ignored that I decided I'd ignore the things they'd tell me to do. Basically I wouldn't listen, like when they'd tell me to get off the computer to go shower(I was 12), and when I made it clear I didn't want to listen it would escalate into my grandma actively trying to pushing me out of the chair. They never bothered to ask me why, and I was too young to totally understand what I was doing or what I was feeling. I mean, at this point in time, I was 12, and in 6-7th grade. I was at a private school, had gone from an A student to a C student at best, but I didn't have friends so I'd come home and get on the internet. Literally every day, and my grandparents would be out either working, or they'd go to the casino. Most of the time though they wouldn't be home until after 6 PM. It was incredibly lonely. I have siblings, but we are all separated and don't get to see each other that much. 

Now, I'm a junior in highschool, and I'm really close to dropping out and getting a GED. I will be going to college for sure, I have enough determination and will to make sure that I'm able too. But I'm making straight F's in school, and at this point school feels like my only reason for existing, and I've felt so lonely in dealing with everything at home it's insane. 

Not only have I been dealing with my grandparent's feuds, I've been dealing with their illnesses and sicknesses as well. My grandma is diabetic, but she doesn't watch her sugar as carefully as she should. There have been times where me and my grandpa have had to force feed her because her sugar would get so low that she'd basically turn into a 200-pound baby with no ability to think or act for herself. It's so hard to watch this happen when it does. 

And my grandpa doesn't make it any easier to deal with this stuff. He sits there and tells me all this crap like my family is nothing but ""drug dealing sons of bitches"" and ""I'm just one of them"". In the past he's called me things like bitch, stupid, lazy, ect. But he's just an asshole. A miserable, miserable asshole. 

But from my grandma's perspective, she's been treating me good for the last 17 years of my life because she and my grandpa paid for private school and would give me everything I wanted and needed as a young child. But to me, I haven't been as happy as she thinks. To me it never felt like she was giving me those things out of love or because she cared. My grandpa only helped this mindset of mine develop because he'd tell me she only gave those things to me to make me shut up. I mean, am I supposed to be happy when I'm being insulted on a daily basis, guilt tripped, and made to feel like I have no control over anything in my life? 

I've tried so hard to keep my feelings in because I didn't want to hurt my grandma's feelings. But today I just couldn't take it anymore. I ended up telling her how lonely I've felt, how I hate that they take their issues out on me, how I can't spend my life taking care of the two of them or making them happy. I've tried so fucking hard. I used to go to school just to make them happy, but I can't keep forcing myself to do things for them. Because of that, I was never able to really enjoy myself at school. I just wanted to make them happy, so I ended up doing everything for them. I've been so stressed out for the past few months, and I feel like I'm going crazy. 

After I told her how I felt though, she started crying and told me to go live with my dad. My dad has gotten back into drugs, maybe not hardcore, but something like Opoids or Oxy's. Maybe Aderrall. Either way, I don't want to be anywhere near that kind of stuff. But she doesn't believe he's done anything like that. She genuinely believes she's been treating me like a queen the past 17 years of my life, and that my dad is perfect. I feel like such an asshole. But I just don't know. ",33,113,0.93
1239,asshole,"There is a dance coming up at my school and one of my friends has been battering me with talk of getting a date. Personally, I really wouldn’t mind having one, but at the same time, I don’t want him to get one for me.

He constantly tells me, “I can totally get you a date. You just have to trust me.” Every time, I tell him no. If I am going to get a date, I want to do it on my own. I’ve told him this multiple times, with those exact words.

Despite this, for almost all day on Friday, he was joking about and pretending to talk up girls for me, just to get on my nerves. He pretended to text the girl I’ve been interested in all year, and took a really bad video of me and pretended to send it to the girl I intended to ask. 

From his point of view, he was doing this because he has a complex. He believes that doing something to help someone, regardless of how they feel about him doing it, is always the right thing. He also believes that whatever he thinks is the right thing is always right. It’s impossible to reason with him, and that’s probably why he wouldn’t listen to me.


So I yelled at him.

He pulled the final straw, and I got very angry with him. I was quiet at first and then slowly got more and more agitated, until I was practically screaming at him. Even after this, he came back,  just to joke around some more, so I yelled some more, to the point where I think I hurt his feelings a bit. I probably embarrassed him as well from what I can tell.

She's really nice, but when they have sex she makes the absolute loudest noises I've ever heard her make. It seems like she's trying to get attention from those not in the room, as when we play music to deafen it she seems to get louder. This makes me, my guests and my brother (who also lives with us) very uncomfortable. I've brought it up once before, she apologized, and it didn't stop. One of my friends, who Brad and I will be living with soon, said hes going to ""make Brad pay for sound proofing if that shit keeps happening"". Another one of my friends had to go on the porch it made him so uncomfortable. 

It's not just the sex noises though. She forced herself into our DND group (nobody wanted her to play) and her oversexualized antics negatively impact the game. I was walking Brad through a scenario and Christy started kissing all over him to the point I just fucking gave up. We were all really excited about this campaign, but everyone is already so tired of her I'm afraid she's going to run all of the players off. My gf and I went on a double date with them, and she resorted to obviously taking pictures of her underwear under the table and sending them to Brad. We find it to be inconsiderate and just immature, and Brad doesn't do anything about it.

I could go on and on about the other obnoxious shit she does, like embarrass our climbing group by swinging and yelling on the ropes at our gym, or constantly interject to tell long winded, clearly exaggerated stories about herself. 

WIBTA if I told him that he needs to talk to her about it. If he said no, WIBTA if i just talked to her about it? It's my brother and it's apartment too, and it often ruins our conversations and hanging out with friends. I feel like I have the right to ask him to shut her up or I will. ",19,56,0.95
1243,asshole,"I was bullied relentlessly from 2nd-6th grade, but these kids never got in trouble. I spent probably 1/3 of my 2nd-4th grade years in ISS, but once I joined band, I got a lot less... tense. 

It eased up from there to graduation, but one day in my junior year, I fought back for the first time since 5th grade and all they got was bus suspension. I appealed and got my 5 days OSS reduced to 1 day OSS and 1 day bus suspension. The day of the bus suspension, my dad drove me to school (tech school 45min away) and his tire essentially popped on an interstate highway, so I got a tardy and my bullies refused to pay for a new tire, despite the fact that would've never happened if he hadn't had to have driven me there.

Two years after graduation, one of them comes into my workplace and tries to tell me my mom has died. I got written up for ""telling a customer to 'go fuck himself.'""

For the last few years, my bullies have started to end up in jail on drug related charges. The recently mentioned bully's mother died about 8 months after he told me that, and then he ended up in jail for assault and drugs. 

One bully drowned, and (I wholly admit it was an asshole move here, disregard this part in means to the whole post) I drove 3h round trip to his funeral just for personal closure. I legitimately felt odd being the only one with a slight smile on my face.

About a year after that, a locally loved kid was flying a plane and it crashed which left him and his passenger, a bully of mine, both dead. When I asked a couple of friends if it was wrong to hear my bullies were getting hit with karma, they almost immediately said yes. So here I am now, wondering if I'm the asshole for what I feel is years of long overdue justice being dealt.

I'm a better person now, but I have a ways to go to let go of the shitty childhood I had. Thank you for your responses, they're giving me much needed alternate views on how I've reacted to these things.

EDIT 2: Yes, the past is the past. I'm moving on with my life (moving away from this awful rural area will help immensely). The friends' response has stuck in my head for a couple years and I literally found this sub two days ago. 

I didn't wish for them to die or be jailed, but that was what happened. I was expecting a long term relationship to end, totalling their car or truck (their pride and joy) but not hurting anyone, something like that. Karma kicked in and it helped far more than the 3 months of therapy I had in 2016, which did next to nothing for me (and it wasn't $120/month). Also fixed a spelling error.",101,164,0.9

The cable bill was due on 4/15. Total of $130 so their half would be $65. I put the bill in the kitchen (our only shared area) on 4/13 when I checked our mailbox. I’m sure they’ve seen the bill because they’ve cooked a handful of times in the past few days and our kitchen isn’t *that* big. 

It’s now 4/21 and they still haven’t paid it. We have opposite schedules (they’re students and work nights. My husband and I work days) so talking to them in person is difficult. And I don’t want to leave notes around and risk coming off as passive aggressive. We have no problems with them except for this bill. They were late last month too.

So at the start of the school year. Like any other year we got freshmans. But this is the first year we had someone with a disability. Lets call this kid Ryan. Ryan has had trouble fitting in seeing as he has autism (not the high functioning kind) so he does tend to walk around alot. Now recently he has started asking people for food. And seeing that he has a disability people feel bad for him. And it was all fine until he started taking advantage of the children at my school. He knows people will give him food without complaints. So yesterday he went up to my friend Mich. So Mich just gets out of the dining hall with her food (At my school you can buy different types of food. Pies, fries, burgers etc.) And Ryan walks up to her and says he wants her food. He doesn't say please or anything. Just that he wants her food. So Mich gives him her food and goes on her way. I was kind of annoyed that she didn't atleast try to keep some for herself but the worst was yet to come. 

Later, during recess me and Bill are sitting by our table eating. And Ryan just walks up and takes Bill's sandwich and his Kit Kat. Ryan walks and I tell Bill that he just had Mich's fries. Bill just responds with ""I feel sorry for him, okay?"". I decide to leave it and finish my lunch. I shit you not. Ryan was standing behind a tree.

Lately, almost every time she calls me she starts talking about some new moral dilemma/philosophical issue that she learned about in class and asks me what I think. It's pretty interesting and I wouldn't mind except that if I ever disagree with her she gets annoyed with me and asks how I could possibly think that. For example, maybe I'm just an asshole, but I think it definitely makes sense to kill one person to save the many, and she disagrees. Sometimes I feel like she believes she has a greater/better moral compass than me and honestly maybe she does, but she's the one who keeps bringing up these hypothetical situations and getting annoyed when I don't agree. She asked me if I would abort a down syndrome baby and I said yes, and she gasped and asked me how I could possibly do such a thing and acted like I was a horrible person. It just makes me feel like she looks down on me cause she thinks I'm immoral or something, but honestly I think my views are relatively rational and they're not that far out there. 

She also became a vegan about a year ago, which I'm fine with but I eat meat. I agree that the treatment of animals in slaughterhouses and stuff is horrible, but honestly I just don't want to give up eating meat. Maybe that does make me a bad person, idk. She's started getting a lot more ""stereotypical preachy vegan"" about her veganism lately, asking me how I can eat a cow if I won't eat a dog, that I shouldn't be ""speciesist"" and stuff like that.

However, I’ve come home to have her announce that she’s given my third ticket away to another one of her friends. She didn’t even ask me first! When I suggested that maybe she should have checked with me before handing out an invite, she absolutely lost it and argued that my text suggested that she had free reign to give out the third ticket. The argument ended with her announcing, ‘FINE, I will simply tell Friend #3 that she can’t come now!’, as if it’s my fault when I didn’t even say Friend #3 could come in the first place.

This graduation is a big deal to me - I’m graduating at a top university after coming from a pretty humble background, so it kind of feels like my biggest achievement and I want it to be my special day. I don’t have a problem with Friend #3 or anything, I like her but she’s my mother’s friend and not mine. I just wish my mother had checked with me first in case I wanted to invite someone else who I was close to. This isn’t surprising since my mother is extremely controlling, but honestly this is a situation I hadn’t expected until my wedding!

Am I the asshole? Or did my text imply that my mum could give out the third ticket without needing to ask?",16,33,0.92
1267,not the a-hole,My fridge went out last night and we lost hundreds of dollars in food. She and I both were shopping for refrigerators. She had no idea of the value or sizes.  I was explaining to her what cu. ft. were and fair prices for a fridge.  Today she went out and bought a 3000 dollar fridge without consulting me.  On the drive home from work she told me she went and did the paperwork and scheduled a delivery for today.  None of this was known to me.  Am I the asshole for getting upset over a major purchase without being consulted?  I now have to make payments on this damn thing for the next year or so ,68,199,0.97
1268,asshole,"AITA for being pissed here?  We're not newlyweds. We've been happily married for 14 years. When we were married, we couldn't really afford a big wedding and exchanged modest wedding bands in front of a Justice of the Peace. But it's something I know she always wanted a big beautiful diamond ring but never would ask. 

This year on or anniversary I surprised her with a beautiful diamond and Platinum engagement ring with matching wedding band. The stone was flawless.  The ring was beautiful. I've never been happier spending $25K on anything.  

It's a weekend, and she works at the hospital. Today i stopped by to drop her off some lunch and coffee.   She tells me to check in the bedside table for her ring. She level early and was tied and forgot it.

I went home and checked.  There's no ring. Checked everywhere. It's not here. Gone. W...T...F... I'm pissed. I think I have a right to be. I just changed insurance agents and hadn't yet added the rider to our home owners policy, so it's not covered. How fucking irresponsible it's that??? 

I can't really afford to replace it without taking money from savings designated for something else, like retirement or the kids college fund. I'm just sick about it.  The fucked up thing about it is she probably feels even worse, which means I'm not allowed to say anything that would make her feel worse. WIBTA if I did?

UPDATE:
I found the ring the following morning wedged between the floor trim and the carpeting.  Apparently, the previous morning she had decided to grab all of her clothes and the ring and get dressed for work outside of our bedroom door so as not to disturb my sleep and didn't realize she never put it on. Then she or someone else must have kicked it and that's how it got wedged into the carpeting. 

Very glad I didn't react in the moment or I'd definitely feel like a huge asshole. 

Guess who's calling his insurance agent this morning...",60,71,0.91
1269,not the a-hole,"I've been friends with this girl, Barb, for years. 

Problem #1: She talked me into going to a University that she was going to go to - took me there for a tour, etc., and then a month before the term started, she told me that she was going to go to a different university an hour away, and would be getting an apartment there with a friend of hers. 

Despite her saying that she would be in the area often and we would see each other all the time, I saw her three times in the next year. 

Problem #2: Dating. I had a really rough relationship in high school, and after that I decided to stop dating for a while, until I felt confident that I was making good decisions. Because I trusted Barb's judgement, I told her that I would want her to meet anyone I got seriously involved with, and she agreed.

It took a few years for me to work my way back into the dating world, and I was really nervous when I did. I wanted to meet other introverted people like myself, so I joined an online dating site. I had a date set up with a guy who sounded great, and I was excited to tell Barb about it. I was not prepared for the way she reacted. She said that online dating was for desperate people and losers, and I needed to just get out there and meet people the regular way. It actually made me cry that she disapproved of me.

A few months later, I met a guy who was really great, and I brought up the idea of them meeting, like we had always talked about. She said that she absolutely did not want to meet him, under any circumstances. I emphasized that I wasn't trying to get them to be friends or anything, but I wanted them to meet because this person was important to me. She still refused. I dated him for 9 months, and he and Barb were never in the same place.


Over all this time, Barb and I still talked every day. We still had friendly conversations, and we'd send each other links or pictures of things we saw online. Whenever one of these problems came up in conversation, like if I tried to make plans with her, or if I talked about something I had done with my boyfriend, she would get quiet and change the subject to something happy or funny, and we'd continue on with that.

I felt, as time went on, that our friendship was becoming more and more superficial. We hardly ever talked about things that were going on in our lives, and stuck to safe topics like movies and TV shows.

Around Barb's birthday, I asked if she had any birthday plans, because I wanted to take her out for dinner sometime around then. She admitted that she had a big birthday celebration planned where a bunch of her closest friends were going to get together at an adventure park, and that she hadn't invited me or told me about it because she knew I wouldn't be able to afford it. 

Last year, I held several parties that I invited Barb to, because she is a fun, outgoing person who enjoys parties. Every single one, she came up with an excuse why she couldn't come. I had a housewarming party, a mystery game party, a pre-Thanksgiving feast, and a birthday party. She would usually tell me that she wanted to come, and would talk with me about the preparations, but then something would come up at the last minute and she wouldn't be able to make it. 

After my birthday party, I gave up. I decided that our friendship was finally dead.

About a month later, Barb got engaged to her long-time boyfriend, Tom. Tom had never liked me, and I knew that Barb had cheated on Tom numerous times over the years, so I didn't have much confidence in their relationship. I hadn't really spoken to Barb for a while, so when I found out about the engagement via social media, I didn't respond.

Maybe a few weeks after that, Barb sent me a message saying that she was hurt by my inaction. I don't remember her exact words, but it was something to the effect of ""to not hear anything from my best friend after this huge life event"". I told her congratulations, but that I wouldn't consider myself one of her best friends. She seemed shocked by this, and asked why not. I told her that we're not really involved in each other's lives anymore, and at this point I was really hurt, myself. I pointedly asked her if she could tell me anything that was going on in my life at the time. She could not, and I started ignoring her messages after that.

Am I the asshole, for ignoring her engagement and telling Barb that she can't call me her best friend? Or was I justified, because she doesn't treat me the way friends should?

EDIT: I guess a less-biased question would be ""Is it normal for friendships to grow apart yet for people to still consider someone their best friend despite little interaction, but insist on maintaining the status quo of the relationship and not acknowledge the fact that maybe they're not as close as they once were?""",15,58,0.93

1272,not the a-hole,"Tl;dr: My stepmom is upset that I made an Instagram account for our dog without talking to her first.

I made an Instagram from the perspective of our family dog. I did it for a school project where you had to make an Instagram that was from the perspective of a character. The project is simple and only worth 3% so I made one for the dog, I already had pictures of her so it was easy. 

My stepmom is upset about this for some reason. I don’t know why because it’s an Instagram with two pictures of our dog. The only human in the pictures is my lap because she sat on it. I don’t even say anything mean about the dog, I just joked about how she takes over the bed and likes to watch for squirrels through the window. The dog only “follows” other dog blogs, national geographic, and my brother because he asked to be followed. I wasn’t going to follow family or friends because of privacy issues, but his Instagram is private, so I figured it’d be pretty harmless. 

It’s probably been graded by now but I left it up with the intention of handing it over to my bro. He thought our dog having an Instagram was pretty funny and would probably enjoy actually running it. 

My stepmom messaged me today about it and she seems upset by what I did. I’m honestly really confused because this is incredibly harmless in my eyes.

I felt bad for the other passengers, but my wife and I couldn't get him to calm down for around 30 minutes. We got some unpleasant looks from the other people, but I didn't think much of it, it was understandable that they'd be somewhat annoyed.

Anyways, we finally landed (about 15 minutes after my son stopped crying), I stood up to get our overhead bags off. Behind us there was a man that was seemingly in a rush to get off who had dropped his bag. I picked it up and handed it back saying ""here you go"" and he replied ""Thanks, asshole."" This caught me completely off guard, and I asked him what he meant. He said something to the effect that he had to sit behind a kid screaming his head off and two incompetent parents who couldn't even shut him up.

I was pretty pissed at the guy, but I let him go without saying anything. I think that he was overreacting and an asshole himself, though I did feel bad for the other passengers who had to listen to my boy cry for a while. So AITA?",114,89,0.88

The last manager I had, was...overcome, by the amount of power she had and made sure everyone knew how important she was and how much money she made compared to the rest of us lowly cashiers. 


Well, she was the reason I quit, and I ended up getting a job in the Tech industry. Two years later, she's still working there, and I ran into her and she couldn't resist telling me that she's making $2 more and hour than she was when I worked there. 


A slight chuckle slipped out and she asked ""whats so funny"" and I couldn't help but tell her that I make twice as much as she does.

1281,not the a-hole,"I agreed to help a long time friend in need to overcome alcoholism, debt, and get away from the bad crowd he was in. He flew in to my state and I got him all set up in my spare room. My girlfriend and I let him know that we are here to help him out the best we can. He was of course excited to start a “new” life. 

Before we started the process of finding a job I let him get acclimated to his new surroundings and caught up with each other. It felt really good knowing that my friend will find his way and strive to succeed. After about a week, I bought him a bike so he could ride around and job hunt. He eventually found one and was excited to start contributing around the house because he felt bad. I told him to only focus on not drinking as much and make money to pay his debts to the collectors hunting him down. He lived with us and I did not expect rent. 

I made some rules: no alcohol or drugs in the house, clean up after yourself, don’t eat what’s not yours, and don’t wake me up (I have to be up super early every morning due to my occupation). He agreed.

Time passed and he got pretty complacent. He’d start coming home in the middle of the night, piss drunk, and would leave all the lights in the house on. He would call me in the middle of the night to get a ride from the bar by his work. He would come into my room while my girlfriend and I are sleeping just to tell me he would try to do better. 

One day, I opened his door to his room (I usually stayed out) to turn off the light and fan. Right there on the floor was a six pack of beer. Also, he somehow managed to break a fan blade from the fan. I took the beer, trashed it, and left 4 dollars on the floor where the beer was. He got home later on and I confronted him about it. He apologized and said work got to him. I understood the best I could and reminded him why I agreed to let him live with us. 

Fast forward a little more to the night he broke up with his bar girlfriend. I got a call at 1am from him begging for a ride. I picked him up and he confessed that he’s been doing coke. We talked about this and he said he just wanted to be honest with me because I’ve been helping him out. 

A few days later, his guilt died and would come back home drunk. My girlfriend was tired of the almost everyday trend of coming home drunk, slamming doors, and pleading him to not come in my room to wake me up to tell me stuff that can definitely wait until the next day. He would get in her face and call her a bitch, push her, and complain that I need to take care of my animals. This is what got me to give up on him. 

I’m not a loud voiced angry person. I’m more of a talk it out kind of guy. I told him that he needs to start looking for another place. He seemingly understood... I was wrong. He blew up on me and my girlfriend. Being disrespected is not my forte. While he was at work, I packed all his things for him, changed the locks, and put his stuff on the side of the house concealed from the street. I put his bags in trash bags to waterproof it and let him know where they were. 

He left work early, blamed it on me, took his bags, and tried to kick the door in. I haven’t heard from him since. 

Could this have been handled better? If you have further questions that make your decision of me being an asshole or not, please do ask. Thanks all.",85,148,0.94
1282,asshole,"Im just going to type out the exact conversation and you guys can make of it what you will.

---Edit---

I left very little context to try to avoid bias, but that led to a number of assumptions from being made. The situation is that I don't check my phone very often, and this is the first direct communication I have gotten from my aunt. I did not see the messages until today. I considered her 'follow up' message extremely childish and wanted to avoid having those sorts of interactions going forward as they are very common in my family. This is mostly here for clarity/posterity, judgement seeeeemssss basically done. (IATAH)

My objective in my (rude) 3-sentence message was to make it clear that I considered her message unacceptable, That I understand that she is upset but it is not a good reason to send messages like that, and to avoid having those sorts of interactions in the future. The negative-caps lock-angry messages is something that is common in my family and which I hoped to 'put my foot down' and avoid in my adulthood.

I interpreted her response as a 'dodge' and deflect. She has a history/reputation of being extremely petty/passive aggressive (something I didn't want to share initially for bias reasons). Asking someone to ""see a professional"" is a very common and fairly serious insult in my family, as there is a major stigma against mental health issues.

A few commentators don't believe me that I don't check my phone often, which is odd. I have attempted to be a 'reliable narrator', as much so as possible. I do believe everything I am sharing to be true. If I was interested in making myself look good to internet strangers, it wouldn't be hard to make actual changes to the narrative to do so, or share more 'context' then what is necessary to understand the situation.

1284,not the a-hole,"(Side account because reasons) 

Please let me preface this by saying I understand this situation probably sounds super petty and stupid. I'm posting it because it is far and away not the first time something like this has happened between my boyfriend and I and I'm just getting tired of it. 

A bit of back-story - my boyfriend and I don't live together although this is the eventual goal. He has a very hectic work and social life which causes friction between us sometimes when I feel it gets in the way of us building a life together. 

The situation: Late last year he told me about this particular hotel in a foreign country that sounded amazing. We were excited about this particular hotel as it's in a country we've never visited and it would be something different. Originally we were going to go in May - that changed as he realised work prevented him from having time off. Fine, no problem at all. It then changed to June which was perfect for me as I am self employed and need to plan my holidays carefully to avoid losing too much money. 

A couple of weeks ago circumstances changed again and he has a free week at the end of this month and can't do June. I tell him that doesn't work for me due to my working circumstances. But there is definitely a week in October that we can both do. He mentions he still wants to go away and I tell him I really would love to go this hotel so could we aim for October? He says he will look at going somewhere else by himself at the end of this month. Nothing more is said about it. 

I phone him for a chat the other day and he tells me with glee that he's booked his holiday and he's going to this destination we've been chatting about. Alone, without me. I tried to sound happy on the phone as he was just about to head to an important work function but he heard the disappointment in my voice. We talked again last night and I told him it was upsetting that a) He didn't talk to me about his plan to go ahead and book it and b) That he's happy to visit this place without me despite us both talking about it as a shared experience. I just feel shunted out of the picture. I think the thing that irks me most is that he's made no reference to the conversations we've had about it and is acting as if me being upset is completely out of the blue and unfounded.

Two days later a different roommate who I am also friends with texts me the same request/demand, that they need $100 from me and that even though it was an accident I need to accept some responsibility. I balk and ask again for the total cost and state that I don't feel responsible, that it was a freak accident. She says it's my fault for improperly carrying the box from the sides and not the bottom and the full total is $150.

It's been around 5 days, and obviously I miss him. I wanted him to call last night and he didnt but he suggested that we hang out on discord over lunch today. I was happy enough with that.

So lunch time comes and goes, and he is awake at 3pm. We messages a little bit but he goes offline right as I ask when we're discording. A bit later I sent him a message being like I'm disappointed that you're not even saying when you're rescheduling and after a bit he messages me back saying he's disappointed with the nagging, but doesn't rescedule.

He was awake and about for an hour or two, where he could have messaged saying oh let's reschedule for x time, but instead he just leaves it and me getting upset cause he just won't say. I think this is really rude! Eventually he says in another hour from now. 

I have a tendancy to get upset over things like this. Am I justified in being a bit annoyed? Is it rude to just leave me hanging like that? I feel like he doesn't respect my time or understand why ditching me with an apology upsets me. 

edit: thanks for your replies! I got some really helpful advice, which helped me calm down and take a more reasonable approach. It's been suggested that perhaps he just doesn't want to talk to me, which isn't the case at all, I mean he says he misses me and seems keen to do these things, which were his suggestions afterall, just not as rigid a time - he thinks I should be very reasonable and flexible because it's online and we're both on our computers all day anyway.",20,53,0.85

1293,everyone sucks,"A couple days ago, I went to go hang out with a couple of my friends and my boyfriend. These are some of my closest girl friends, and they’re both cool with my boyfriend. Basically, none of us really have any reason to feel shy about saying shit because we all know about stupid and embarrassing things that the others have done.

At some point during the hangout, someone suggests to play “Never Have I Ever”. Obviously, since we’re all stupid teenagers (17), it’s gonna get sexual and gross really quickly. My turn comes up and I say,

“Never Have I ever done anal”, knowing that one of my friends (who will be referred to as A) has, and it would be funny to see her reaction. Mind you, prior to me saying this, we had each spilled some pretty embarrassing sexual stories (FWB stuff, sucking dick at school, we’re gross people lol). Everybody else had been honest and ready to be exposed. I see that A doesn’t drink after I say this, so I jokingly say “Well, I know someone’s lying”, prompting her to then drink. It’s obvious at this point that she’s upset with me, semi-jokingly calling me an ass and whatnot. I do genuinely apologize because it wasn’t my intention to make her uncomfortable but, knowing that she has a plethora of sexual info she can expose me with, I tell her that she can shoot her best shot during her round.

The game progresses a bit later and she still hasn’t said anything lethal. She finally says to our other friend, “Ooh, I’ve got a good one for /u/sadbg” so I’m ready to take my drink and blush a little. When her turn comes up, she says, “Nah nah, it’s really rude. Let me not say it,” but we all press and make her say it. She finally says,

“Never have I ever forgotten to turn my location off.”

Seemingly harmless, but as soon as she said it, I almost threw up. The backstory:

About a month ago, I had a huge falling out with my extremely verbally abusive mother. She (during a previous argument), had told me that she didn’t care when I confessed to her that she had made me suicidal all through middle school. During the current argument, I brought it up to her and she called me a liar. She was gaslighting me to no end to the point I had to call my sister and make sure I wasn’t crazy. It was at that point I decided to leave. I woke up early the next morning, packed my bags, and took my stuff to A’s house after school in hopes of being able to stay with her for a while. I didn’t come home after school, which made my mother and step father look for me. I thought I had all my bases covered, until I receive a text from my boyfriend saying that my mother had called HIS mother to find out where I was, and his mother used Snapchat Maps to find me at A’s house. My mother and step-father arrived and got the police involved and I was forced back into their care. A watched as I cried and defeatedly grabbed all my bags and listened to the police tell me that there was essentially nothing I can do.

So to hear her bring up, of ALL things, one of the worst and most heartbreaking days of my life, all because I mentioned she had anal sex, makes me question whether or not she even gave a fuck about me that night, and if she even gives a fuck about me now. I texted her later that night to once again apologize for bringing up the anal thing, not even bringing up what she said. Her response was, “I really wasn't making a big deal about it but like you kept bringing it up, but it was very unnecessary and a bit out of pocket. I mean I don't really care because it was just our group but seriously don't do that shit with random asses around.”

A) I brought it up one time, which was when I first said it and B) there was nobody else around besides our group, so I don’t know who the “random asses” would be. I wouldn’t bring that up in a setting where we were with people I was unsure if she were cool with or not.

We’ve had a very long friendship, but I am honestly not okay with what she said. I talked to my boyfriend about it and he said that he’s sure she didn’t mean it that way, but I’m just having a hard time wrapping around how a poke at someone’s sex life makes me deserve to have that thrown in my face.

TLDR: game of “Never Have I Ever” went awry. I made a joke about my friend having butt sex, she retorted with bringing up how I failed to escape my abusive mother.

EDIT: I’ve talked to her. We are no longer friends.

EDIT 2: She did apologize to me pretty late last night, and I didn’t get the chance to respond until this morning (y’all that wasn’t out of spite, I literally have a job. I need sleep). We’ve both apologized for being thoughtless and stepping over boundaries.

1294,asshole (Kind of),"My wife and I live with my mom and stepdad and while we working (currently I have a job and my wife is out of one(the guy who owned the place had to close)) aren't made to pay rent. We are VERY appreciative of them for this. We walk (all 14 of the dogs(2 are ours)) at the very least 3 times a day without so much as a peep from us as well as other household chores (dishes, laundry etc etc). So we all used to play on this private Vanilla WoW server together but my wife wasn't getting her loot because the people that ran the guild were shitty at doing so. So she stopped playing and soon after I stopped too. Now onto the main topic. We (wife and I) very much don't like the game because it takes so much time to do anything. You need consumables for raiding (potions, buff food etc) which takes hours of rigorous farming. Raiding takes about 4 hours. Almost every night. Most of the times they won't stop raiding until about 12:30am-1am. Up until very recently dinner wasn't getting started or made at all until they are done. Most of the time they will start something up and we will end up having to finish the meal ourselves(this is the situation, I'd say 70% of the time). There are times where we take it into our own hands and make dinner all by ourselves (I'd say it's about 20% of the time).
10% of the time they get it done before raid. They raid anywhere between 4-6 days a week. Now more recently they've been getting dinner made before raid (which has been pretty nice seeing as I have to be up at 7-8am any time I work) and that was only after I asked my mom if they could please get it done before raid. So any time they raid if anyone and I mean ANYONE talks while they are raiding then we are told to shush, and I quote ""we are doing something important right now."" They even do it when my friend is over and he is on the same consensus (with my wife and I) that they are doing ""important stuff."" He doesn't much like wow as it destroyed one of his friends life. Also playing on this private server uses a lot of internet. I mean A LOT. So any time they raid they ask everyone to get off the internet so they can play. Another issue is this game causes arguements between them I'd say 30% of the time. Sometimes one of them will die and blame the other one. Or one will do something without proper communication and then they both argue about it. Recently they have been raiding mid day to avoid raiding later but since they've done that they just raid mid day and then do their night raid. While I have expressed to them that I understand that they play the game for fun, we very much dislike it and wish they would not play it as Its very disruptive to the household flow. Most times I bring it up with them it's a ""we pay rent so we can do what we want"" even though the rent is paid like 90% by my father (child support). I agree that it's their place and that we live here free but if we were doing the same thing (which is not feasible because we don't have home jobs) the house would be in a terrible way. So am I (wife and I) the asshole?

EDIT: There is also two kids (my brothers(11&17)) that live here as well (why my stepdad and mom receive child support) and are affected by the awkward schedule that we have. They really dont have any say (like most children to be fair)",58,40,0.87

1297,not the a-hole,"So I'm using a throwaway because the girl in this story uses reddit frequently and knows my real account username and I want to keep this anonymous.

About a week ago me and a couple of friends were together (about 9 of us) and we were drinking and just having fun. One of the girls and one of the guys in the group were dating and were both mutual friends, I've known some of the guys for longer but only knew these two for a little over a year, we were still good friends and frequently drank and met up together though.

During this night we tried a new game that was kind of like cards against humanity but it asked questions about the people playing. We were used to roasting each other so most of the jokes were kind of ""no holds barred."" For example one of the questions was ""If (my name) could have a lifetime supply of one thing what would it be?"" And the winning answer was ""anti-depressant pills"" which was because these friends know I've struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts a lot. I took it as a joke though and it didn't really bother me.

The problem came later in the night in one of the later rounds when everyone was a bit more drunk. The question was ""What does (girls boyfriend) not want anyone to know?"" And I Answered: ""His side chick Grace"". For reference Grace was a girl that we all knew and more importantly knew that (girls boyfriend) used to be really into in the past before they started dating.

At the time a few people laughed, everyone knew it was just a joke. No one said to me ""wow that was too far"" and I didn't get that vibe from the way the reacted. However, the next morning the girl sends me this message on WhattsApp (privately not in a groupchat):

*""What you said last night was the most disrespectful thing anyone has ever done to me. I thought you were a good person and a friend, but what you said changed the way I think of you...""*

At first I had no clue what it was referencing because it was a long night and we were talking all night. I only figured it out when I was talking to 2 other guys from that night, they said that the girl in question wasn't talking to them anymore just because they picked my answer about Grace as the winning answer for (girls boyfriends) secret.

So I replied to her with this message:

*""I'm sorry, I didn't know you would be this upset over it, if I had've known I would have never mentioned it. You're my friend and I want you to know that I wouldn't say something just to try and hurt you.""*

She read it and never replied, a week later she still isn't talking to me or the other 2 guys that voted for my answer.

**So my question to you, judge me as harshly as you want because honestly I'm torn on this: Am I the asshole for saying this?**

I’ve been fine with it up until recently but the usage has skyrocketed so much to the point where I, the only person paying for the account can not use it. I got upset, reached my boiling point and changed the account password. 

Here’s the thing that upsets me, I’m willing to make upgrades to the account to accommodate everybody that uses the account, but for what? Nobody has ever reached out and said thank you, or has even ever make a contribution to make sure that it gets paid for. I would only hear from them when the Netflix password doesn’t work.

The question that one should ask isn’t “did you change the password” but why do you change the password. I would’ve told them that the password is being passed around too much before giving them the new one. Maybe I shouldn’t be so passive aggressive, but I shouldn’t have to spell out anything to two adults that they aren’t owed anything, I shouldn’t have to say please do not to give access to the Netflix account to anyone else. Maybe I should layout some ground rules? Let me know your thoughts

My mum planned Easter dinner for Sunday at 4PM. On Saturday night, I admittedly went out drinking with a friend of mine and stayed up pretty late. I set an  alarm (for 2:30PM) so that I would wake up, have enough time to prepare my meal contribution, get ready and be there on time for dinner.

In the time I was sleeping, she called me twice, texted me twice and called my boyfriend (who I live with, who was also sleeping) and we didn't hear it. So, at 2PM she called and I heard it, she said she moved dinner to 2:30PM, and I panicked, jumped out of bed, got ready to go, got my boyfriend out of bed, and called her again to apologize for not hearing my phone  and let her know I wouldn't be able to bring my salad but would be on my way shortly. She changed the time so she could watch her show later. 

She didn't like that I was still sleeping. 

She freaked out, and said she ""expected"" this from me, and ""of course"" I wouldn't be able to bring my salad and that she'd see me when I got there. I got offended, and texted her and said I wasn't going to come because I'm not sitting at a family function while we're fighting, because it's not comfortable for anyone.

Now, I know I sound like the total jerk here, but I swear, I've never missed a family dinner, I've always shown up on time and brought whatever it was I was supposed to bring. That's why I got defensive and decided not to go. Everyone else is always late, but I'm always the first to show up! 

She messaged me back, told me to ""sleep off my hangover"", told me that I always do this to her (which is not true!) and told me not to talk to her for the rest of the day. So I didn't.

Yesterday, she sends me a super long message, attacking me and stating her disappointment that I don't make an effort to invite her and my step dad to my home (I don't, but that's another story all together, basically it boils down to the fact she's a super neat freak and judges people's houses, and I don't have enough room for a table, so I don't really have room for 4 people to sit and visit). She goes on again to say she's angry at my non attendance to dinner due to being hungover.

Yes! I was hungover, but fully prepared to attend the dinner. Once she snapped, I wasn't so inclined.

In any event, I responded (nicely), and explained why I don't invite her to my home, and I apologized for not attending dinner etc. I told her I loved her and missed her and now she hasn't responded.

I don't know what to do.

This is a train station in the middle of a city, aggressive pan-handlers and storytelling con artists are par the for course, so any time someone approaches me for something my immediate reaction is ""no.""

Granted, I probably should have heard her out because it's possible she just wanted directions, but at no she sank into her hip and went ""No. You don't have a phone I can use?"" Knowing this could be a ploy to steal my phone, I lied and said ""no, I don't."" She gave me a very snotty and sarcastic ""thanks *so* much!"" before storming back inside the station.

Turns out, a concert had just let out and there were a lot of teenagers and college students going home (or back to campus in a nearby city) at that point, and there's a good chance this girl really was just trying to call her mom, or figure out which train to take, so even though that (despite her reaction) she wasn't entitled to my stuff, and I can't be too careful in that area especially late at night, there's still this nagging feeling that I should have been kinder in the situation.",21,34,0.97

I noticed an envelope labeled for tips at a hotel recently, and when I asked a friend about it I was informed that such tipping is strongly encouraged. When I said I didn't think it was mandatory, I was (jokingly) called an asshole for all the poor housekeeping staff I stiffed. I still, however, think that I'm not the asshole for not tipping hotel staff. I paid for the hotel, and housekeeping staff are paid a full wage, not a servers wage. When I arrive at a hotel, I usually hang the do not disturb sign as soon as I arrive, because I really don't want/need turndown service, fresh towels, etc. The 6 towels in the room are usually quite sufficient. So my thoughts are that the only cleaning/service I receive is when I check out and they turn over the room for the next guest. That's the service I paid for when I booked the hotel.

I got upset for a variety of reasons: I rarely use the desktop/usually guests (like my little brothers) use it, the bf had changed some settings on my antivirus - presumably to find the photo, and I had recently told my roommate that my boyfriend and I had been experimenting in the bedroom so to say and I feel like this particular photo was chosen to make fun of that.

1322,not the a-hole,"Hello,

So, I was on a bus, got up from my seat and started to walk to the door in the
middle to get off (the door was open). I saw a middle-aged man who was blocking the way, I asked for permission. He kept saying ""wait a minute, wait a minute"" and then the driver closed the door. I said ""great, the door is closed"" and got agitated because as a rule drivers cannot drop you in between bus stops (even though they do it when they feel like, it is sometimes dangerous to ask because they can scold you). 

Then, I saw an elderly person in front of this guy. They were together. I thought they were rushing to the empty seat I had just left. 

(This happens everyday, you leave your seat to get off and people rush to your seat from the opposite direction and block your way. As a result, you struggle in that ocean of humans till you make it to the coast (bus stop). This behavior had always annoyed me. Because it happens a lot. Also, just blocking your way for no reason happens even more frequently.)

So, I said ""You'll sit. The seat is free!"" (With an agitated voice I guess). And then, as I approached the door to go on with my business, a girl (in her late teenage years or maybe early twenties) intervened in and began scolding me: ""What happens if the driver closed the door? You could have told the driver and he could open it again!""

(The girl has no relation to the other two people.)

I am not used to such a confrontation from outside and I got shocked. ""How is it your business?"" I said. 

She said ""you are creating tension. She (the elderly person in front of the guy) couldn't hold on (anywhere on the bus).""

(This girl seemed to have secured a really nice corner on the bus, I should say. I kept wondering why she didn't leave her corner for this elderly person, if she is so dear to her- but I didn't say anything.)

Then I said ""how could I know there is someone in front of him? He doesn't say anything."" (Except ""wait a minute, wait a minute). Meanwhile, the elderly person was seated on the seat I left and the middle aged guy turned to me. 

He made some voices that started with sshhhhh and continued in a very rude way (just voices, no meaningful word). He was trying to shut me up. 

I was afraid that other people could join and lynch me. It already felt like lynching. 

I said ""I shall leave you alone, tete-a-tete,"" called out the driver to open the door and got off the bus some 100 meters away the bus stop. (I was afraid the driver would reject the request, but he didn't). 

While I was getting off the girl was saying things behind my back ""it's that simple, all you have you to do is to tell the driver etc etc"" 

As soon as I got off the bus, I felt terrible. I wanted to die immediately. 

When something like this turns into an attack from unexpected fronts, I feel like  I should die because I am a misfit or something. 

I believe that people owe an explanation to other people if they are blocking their way. (Something more than ""wait a minute""). I always explain it with a few words if I there is something about me that affects other people on a crowded bus. It doesn't take more than 3 seconds, honestly. 

I believe that people should not rush for someone else's recently vacated seat if it is going to block that person's way. 

I feel alienated when something like this happens.

At the dinner table when eating breakfast or dinner, which is almost the only time we sit together, they are mostly talking about what they previously have done together as a family or about people that only they have relations with. They almost never include me. I would be fine with this because it's often funny stories and we all laugh a lot during dinner. My issues with it started when my SO's parents expressed that they don't feel they know me good enough, even though I try to tell stuff about my self whenever I get the chance to say something that is remotely relevant to the topic at hand.
My own family on the other hand include my SO in conversations and have whole conversations with her without it being a simple series of ""how's this and that""-questions. I am feeling that my SO's parents should be doing the same towards me. But they haven't once in the 2 and a half years me and my SO have been together.
I am also a bit introverted. Making an effort to include my self and getting my SO's parents to get to know me is therefore very tiring.

We couldn’t stay up past 11, watch certain shows or movies, play our music aloud if it wasn’t Christian, if we made food we had to share. I LOVE living in my own apartment with my bf. I can make cookies at 3 am, play my music loudly when I shower, and sleep whenever. My parents basically guilted me into coming home for the holidays, and the whole time I just wished I was back at my apartment. I don’t want to hurt my parents feelings but they want me to come home again for summer. At this point I’m just going to say no. I might be an asshole for that but honestly I would probably have a way better time spending summer with my friends and working than laying around at home. All my friends love going home to see their families so I feel like a weirdo for feeling otherwise.",16,32,0.95
1327,not the a-hole,Recently I went to pick up dinner togo from a local bar and grill and while I was waiting for my food I was approached by a very intoxicated woman (IW) who demanded that I give her my name because she was calling cps on me for having my child in the restaurant. I was completely in shock as the situation began to unfold. (I should mention this was not the first time she had said something to me about not having my child there. Also I am close personal friends with the owners and had been in the back office with them and my child while waiting for my order)  I had to walk past IW to get to the office and that was the first time she said something. I said yeah whatever lady and kept walking . After spending a little time in the office we walked back over to the other side of the restaurant and stood by the kitchen to wait on the order. While we stood there waiting my child and I were dancing to the music that was playing on the other side of the restaurant (it was a live band). We were having a good time enjoying the music and talking to some of the people who work there that we know. The next thing I know is this woman is practically right on top of me demanding my name and threatening to call cps because I am a horrible person for having my child in a restaurant with a live band. The owner immediately came to my rescue and basically told her to F off and she started to usher us away and into the kitchen entrance. The other owner (husband and wife) heard what was happening and then confronted the IW and very calmly told her that if she ever threatened me or spoke to me again that she would be barred permanently. I was so shaken at this point that I was in tears. The owners and servers all comforted us and walked us out once our dinner was ready so that she wouldn’t try to follow us out. So AITA for taking my child with me? Am I a horrible parent for taking my child to pick up a togo order?,37,30,0.8

1331,everyone sucks,"Earlier yesterday I messaged my sister, offering to babysit her two kids today as I was just given the day off. It's spring break and she, her husband, and our mom all work during the day. It was last-minute but I babysat her kids Saturday, Sunday, and she asked me to babysit Monday as well but I had to work, so I figured she could still use more help. She told me that our mom was off and was going to take them to Chuck E. Cheese, but I was welcome to go with. I declined. She said ok and then asked if I could watch them the day after, on Thursday, and I said yes. 

A while ago, my mom tagged me in a happy family type post on Facebook, complete with cute smiley family pics, ending with a ""wish you were here"" with my name-- but they're not at Chuck E. Cheese, they're all at the beach, my sister included. So I feel kind of lied to. They'll often go on nice trips without me, but I don't complain because I don't really reach out to them, so I don't expect them to do so to me. But I just messaged my sister yesterday, I don't understand why she didn't tell me if they wanted me to be there. We've never had a bad relationship.

I haven't done anything yet, so WIBTA if I took back my offer to watch her kids tomorrow? I don't feel like helping my sister with anything right now, feeling pretty disrespected and purposefully left out. But tbf, I was invited to *something* and declined.

On top of this, my bf and I have had a BBQ planned for three weeks, coming up this Saturday. It was supposed to be a nice little family thing, but I'm not quite feeling those wholesome family vibes anymore. I (and my bf) want to cancel this too. Would I be double the asshole?",39,59,0.93
1332,not the a-hole,"EDIT:  Thank you all for your comments.  It truly helps so much to hear that I'm not the crazy one here.  I will definitely be looking into the subs you all have recommended!

Hi all, posting on a throwaway but I'm having one of those days where I need a sounding board to check that I'm not the the asshole here.  

I am 1+ year no contact (NC) with my family.  When I moved back home six years ago after living alone for five years, I was back under my mother's controlling thumb.  We never had any issues unless I was going out late with friends (late was anytime after sunset).  I met my partner after about a year, and she is the most wonderful person I have ever met.  This is when all the trouble began, and here is a list of my ""grievances"":

- I was yelled at for staying out late 2-3 times a week, despite being 25 at the time.

- I was told that I was making myself too easy, that I was ruining my chastity, and that I was a slut for staying out late.

- I moved out for a new job an hour away, and she barely talked to me the day of.  I ended up breaking down into tears right before leaving because she (and my sisters) were not supportive of my decision to move out.  They did not acknowledge my hurt and I left in tears.

- I got engaged.  None of them were happy for me.

- I picked a wedding date that worked for both families (partner's family all owned businesses and were coming from halfway across the country, so we picked a holiday weekend to accommodate them closing their businesses for a few days).  My mother was not happy with our choice of date due to a superstition that we are all 99% sure she made up, and tried her hardest to make us change it. Note that 90% of the wedding was being paid for by my partner's parents.

- On father's day, she threatened me that my father will not be walking me down the aisle because of the superstition, unless I changed the date.  This was after they met with my partner's parents to discuss the date, and they didn't bring any of this up then. 

- My sisters, who were also in the wedding party, called me a selfish bitch for months, for not bending to our mother's wishes.

- We stuck to our guns and she made us have a wedding celebration for just my side of the family and her friends five months before our actual date, because none of them were going to show up on the date we picked.  We had to give her money (thousands) to throw the reception dinner, despite having to fund the wedding we wanted.  (They all showed up anyway.)

- The day before the big day, they missed the rehearsal brunch entirely.  We had the party room for three hours, and they showed up after we had to leave.  My partner's entire family waited around to meet them, until we had to leave.  Then my mother got mad at me for not being happy to see them, and called my partner rude for not being happy either.

- To date, they have not once tried to get to know my in-laws, who are absolutely wonderful people. 

- They did not once make the effort to visit me in my town, despite me going back to visit them at least once a month before I went NC (it's a 1.5 hour drive each way). Even then, I was told that I didn't make an effort to stay in touch.  Note, none of them ever texted me first or called me first about family events, despite them all leaving under the same roof and I was the only one living separately.  I was the one who always reached out asking about plans for events that I was aware of like Mother's Day/Father's Day, and nothing would ever get decided until the night before, which really screwed with me trying to plan my own life schedule.  When they decide to have a family dinner, they'll call me the day before or sometimes even hours before to come, but I've had to say no due to having to work or had to study (I work a full-time job and take classes for roughly 3-4 hours at night for a graduate degree).  I would get yelled at then, even if I couldn't come because I had to work.  

- Over a year ago, my mother called me about a big family event less than 24 hours in advance.  I had already scheduled other plans two months in advance, and those plans involved ten other people (all in-laws) and an important milestone as well.  When I said I would try but I'll have to talk to the others before I can commit to a anything, I was instantly guilt-tripped about how it's my family and they're more important.  I responded that it was not fair to expect me to just say yes when I don't get any notice, especially since I now have a life of my own.  I was then screamed at and told that I would never be invited to anything again. 

And that was the day NC began.  She has not tried to contact me once either.  AITA for staying NC?",27,114,0.94

1340,not the a-hole,"I am NOT looking for advice, as I know how to handle the situation, I just want to know if I'm the asshole. 

I'm a 22-year old freelance multimedia designer. I do pretty much everything, from writing to music production to animation to voice acting and more. I recently got a client, let's call him Andrew, who wanted me to make an animatic (basically a moving storyboard synced with sound or music) for a new product he was developing. My work is already 60% under priced, but I deliver on quality and professionalism. 

Andrew met up with me twice and we discussed what he wanted. I asked him what his budget is, and he shrugged it off and said he doesn't have one. He never asked me what my rates are, but I told him I charge per video, per minute. For example: A full animatic (images drawn, voice overs, music produced, editing, sound effects, etc) would cost $350 per minute (I also do 99% of this alone). He was fine with it. He gave me 3 days to finish the entire animatic, I said I can't promise anything as these things take time, but he told me he needs it for an important business presentation. Eager to please, I worked all 3 days almost non-stop, pushing away other already paid projects to get this one done. 

In total, I drew 104 images in total, and had a 2 minute video as a result of a script he sent me. I didn't have time to set up and send him the contract, my prices or an invoice before starting the work, so I told him I'll send everything at once and he agreed to it. I know that was dumb of me, seeing as I always charge 50% before I start any work. So anyway, I actually managed to finish the animatic within those 3 days, but to me personally, it was bad as I didn't have enough time to add quality. Apparently, his entire team LOVED it, but he didn't. Now, my contract states that he can have 3 minor changes for free, but if I deem the changes to be redesigns, it'll cost extra. 

For about 2 weeks I heard nothing from him, despite sending my invoice and details through to him a few times. Then suddenly, I got a call from him a week ago, where he said it's unfair that I'm charging him $700 for something he doesn't like, and he continued to compare art/design to buying things from a store. He said it's ridiculous that he has to pay another $700 to have the animatic redone, because he won't be using the one I sent him. 

On one side, I understand, $700 is a lot of money. But as stated before, I'm 60% under priced, and these animatics include sound, music, images, editing, voice acting, etc - all done/created from scratch. I also owe a friend who helped with the voice acting some of that money. Andrew wants me to redo the whole animatic with a different script for free - his argument is that he wants to pay for something he likes, not the work/time I've put into projects for him. The problem here is that he can keep being unhappy with the projects I give him, and I'll continuously have to redo them for free. I personally believe it was HIS job to ask me about my prices before telling me to do any work. I've been expected to lower my rates/prices before, but never has someone told me I have to redo work for free...

Am I the asshole for refusing to redo a project until my client is happy with it - for free? ",34,65,0.91

1342,not the a-hole,"I met ""R"" [28F] and ""L"" [23F] through my boyfriend ""J"" [23M] about a year into our relationship and I'm still very much getting to know them. I have hung out with them a few times and while they are mostly nice, I find ""R"" quite difficult to navigate. ""R"" has a very intense personality and was often the one to plan group hangouts. Often they would be organised very last minute and I was hardly able to go to things because of work or uni. If I said no to an event, she would plead and would get very irrationally upset about it.  However, I have a new job where I work regular hours and would like to get to know ""J""s friends better. 

Fast forward to last Tuesday. ""R"" and ""L"" let me know that they plan to go hiking on the weekend and invited me along. I initially said I was interested and was free for most of the weekend, apart from Saturday night. It got to midday on Saturday and I still hadn't heard anything about their plans for hiking. From what my boyfriend told me about these friends, they are quite flakey so I assumed that since I hadn't heard anything about it, they must not be going anymore. Instead, I made plans for the Sunday with my boyfriend and we went to the beach. 

I didn't hear anything about the hiking plans until 7pm on Saturday night. ""R"" texts me saying that her and ""L"" are staying the night in an Airbnb near the hiking track and for me to meet them there at 9am the next morning. The hiking track that they went on is 2 hours away from where I live and isn't accessible by public transport. I would've had to drive up. I also had my friend's birthday party that night and knew that I wouldn't be getting home until way past midnight. At the time, I decided that it was best for me to pull out of the hiking plans and I told ""R"". She was very upset about it and accused me of not liking their group of friends.

1355,not the a-hole,"So, this is kind of a long one fellas. Apologies in advance.
This is all a couple years old, but it’s been weighing on my mind for a long time and I need to know if I what I’ve done is wrong.
So, to start: I (female) used to be best friends with boy (who we’ll call J) and girl (who we’ll call E). We were all teens at this point, and we were at that stage in life where we think that the friendships we make then last forever. I remember I was really happy and I felt so lucky to have them as my friends. 
But it wasn’t all perfect, because E suffered from depression and anxiety, since before we’d even met. Like, the really bad, suicidal kind. J and I felt so bad for her, and I like to think we did all we could for her. We genuinely loved her so much and it really hurt me to see her suffer. She didn’t like seeing her therapist (I’m still not sure why) and wasn’t on any antidepressants, so she kinda relied on us pretty heavily for emotional support. Of course, that was fine by us! We wanted to help her. But then everything changed when E and J became a couple.
I won’t lie; I felt pretty sad when that happened, because although of course I was happy for them, it was hard for me not to feel left out, since up until then it had always been the three of us; however, I had other friends, so I was okay. I distanced myself from the pair of them for about a year - not completely cutting them out of my life or anything, but not being as close as we used to be. I don’t think that was a dick move or anything on my part, I was just trying to give them space, but if it was, please tell me!
About a year after they got together J started talking to me more than he used to, and we started becoming close again. He eventually confided in me that E had become, for lack of a better word, slightly unhinged. For starters, he told me that she’d said he wasn’t allowed to talk to me anymore, because I was a girl and she didn’t trust him (we have never been remotely romantically involved, by the way) And her depression appeared to have become even more extreme. She would tell him she wanted to kill herself if he tried to spend an evening apart from him, on several occasions. If he ever tried to fight back she would just scream at him. Several times, in public, she would scream and berate him for being a shitty boyfriend, reducing him to tears. He told me he felt humiliated and pathetic. I told him he should break up with her, and asshole or not, I still firmly stand by that. 
Anyway, fast forward a couple months, J breaks up with E and they go no contact. She messaged me a couple times, calling me names, saying I was a stirrer, she hated me, I’d ruined her life, etc. That wouldn’t necessarily upset me except coming from someone I used to be so close with, it really hurt. Eventually I just started ignoring the messages and they stopped. E and J stopped communicating with each other too and, to my knowledge, have not really spoken with each other since.
My issue here is, am I an asshole for not forgiving her for the way she treated him, or me? Don’t get me wrong, I’m genuinely sorry for her. I’ve suffered from depression since the incident and am still on the medication, and it’s not something I’d ever wish on anyone. Since I started my medication, though, I can’t help but wonder if I treated her badly. I just think that while she was suffering and that is horrible for her, it doesn’t excuse her behaving so badly.
I’m sorry if I am the asshole, and also sorry for the crazy long post. Thank you so much for getting to the end of it.

I wasn't aggressive, and I don't think I came off as condescending. He clearly thought otherwise.

**My Perspective:** I'm willing to accept that I was 'nagging' rather than 'reminding'. I'm assuming he thought I was undermining his sense of responsibilty. 

My only issue with that is that history has shown that he *needs* me to nag him about responsibilities, or he simply won't do them. And then, if I haven't done everything to force him to do something, it's my fault that it hasn't been done. 

Example 1: When he was working, it would be my fault he was late if I didn't wake him up in time. Or if I did, and he fell back asleep once I'd left for my own job. The idea of setting an alarm himself was apparently impossible.

Example 2: He needed to see a dentist. We've recently moved, so I hadn't set us up with the local dentist yet. Mostly because they were only open during my work hours, and I haven't had chance to take leave to go sort it out. When I suggested he go set himself up with the dentist (he wasn't working by this point), he went off on me, saying that, since I was the reason we moved, everything was my responsibility to sort out. I had to take a longer lunch than I was allowed to sort it out the same day - fortunately my manager didn't notice. 

Example 3: He quit work because he wanted to go back into education. I've had to be the one to call the college and fill out his application. It's my fault the process has taken so long, but I was also a b*tch if I asked him to do some of these things himself.

I could go on, but I'm sure you get the gist. I'm honestly just sick of having to be the responsible one for literally everything, whilst still getting it in the neck for 'nagging' him when I try to remind him of things he won't take responsibility for on his own. At the same time, though, he makes me feel like such an asshole every time this happens. So maybe he's right and I should trust him to do things, despite his track record?

**TL;DR:** I 'nagged' my boyfriend by reminding him he had to be awake to receive a costly engineer visit. He made me feel like an asshole for this, even though he has a track record of failing to do things (and blaming me) when I *don't* remind him. AITA?",146,113,0.93

At my job I don’t mind referring friends who would work hard because it helps me out as I get a bonus and I get to have friends work with me. The would be employee first fills out an application and when I give management their name and number they are guaranteed an interview and almost always the job. In my position we are required to operate heavy machinery and prior to our first day we have to take a drug test. A friend of mine asked me to refer her and although I knew she smoked weed heavily I knew she would keep it professional at work. I told her I gladly would and told her I would wait a bit before giving her info to management so she would be able to pass the drug test. Two days ago I gave her information to HR as I thought enough time had passed for clean results. Management thanks me and tells me they will call her this week for an interview. The same night she  sends me a video on Snapchat of her smoking weed. At this point I decide she really isn’t serious about this and go in the following day to tell them she wouldn’t be a good fit  AITA for not telling her this?

Now let me preface this by saying I'm not much of a clean freak. I don't mind wearing the same skirt a few days in a row, or using the same coffee cup a few mornings without washing it.
 
Normally I'm up about an hour or so before anyone else just because of schedule differences. Pretty much every morning is the same, get up and throw on some coffee, boil some water in the kettle and grab a couple packets of instant oatmeal for breakfast.
 
Now, this morning one of my roomies happened to be awake at the same time as me and she happened to come down into the kitchen right as I was making my oatmeal. I boil the water, grab a measuring cup and use it to measure out the right amount of water for however much oatmeal I'm making. Soon as I'm done I shake the cup dry and toss it right back into the drawer. I thought nothing of it before, but my roommate absolutely FREAKED out. She started yelling at me for putting dirty dishes with clean ones, and yelling about how everyone would get sick and so on and so forth. I told her there was NOTHING in it except for boiling water, which was then dried out and it would be a waste of water to put it through the dishwasher every single time that happened.
 
I do NOT do this if I use a measuring cup to measure out flour or milk or anything else mind you, ONLY water and 95% of the time only BOILING water at that.

My boyfriend had been texting me over the break asking if I would be okay with him coming over on Saturday (when I got home). I usually said something along the lines of ""I might be tired, we'll have to wait and see"". When I got home Friday, he texted me again, asking the same question, and that time I flat out said no. He seemed to accept it and I thought that would be the end of it. Then, this morning (Saturday), he texts me again, asking again if I want to go out or have him over or come over or just see him in some way. This time, I have to make up an excuse as to why I can't leave the house and he can't come over (I'm pretty sure I said that it smelled like paint or something). He finally gave up but got mad at me because it seemed like I was making up excuses to not see him today. I don't know what to think.

1379,not the a-hole,"My girlfriend is possibly Asexual, it’s not 100% certain but in some degree she does not have a desire to do anything from kissing to sex with an individual. 

I would like to say she does not find it disgusting to kiss me but nor does she find it enjoyable, she simply is neutral on the matter but leans more towards preferring not to. We have discussed this a couple times and eventually came to an agreement to where we would do some things in moderation due to me viewing physical attraction as a very necessary element of a relationship.

I want to make it clear that I explicitly said multiple times that she has the right to say no or the right to push me away if she doesn’t feel comfortable, I also said that my main priority is her feeling safe, I never want her to feel like I’ve broken our trust. I iterated multiple times some boundaries I’d like to set such as us having to discuss anything involving any clothes off shenanigans and also some boundaries around both of us being accepting of one of us seems very physically distant or if one of us seems to get a little too close sometimes.

I’m mainly wondering if I’m in the wrong due to how she does indeed prefer not to do these things, I just want to sort of know what the line is between a compromise you would make in a relationship and the line you would make between someone’s sexual desires. 

Edit: After most responses mostly addressing sexual incompatibility I would like to say I may have overstated that it matters a lot to me. More or less for me personally physical things act as a progression of trust, the way I phrased this post at 12 am when I posted made it seem like to many constant sex was a must to me. It’s not really and I do plan on pursuing this relationship, to those wondering as well we are both younger and have currently been together just about 5 months now.

Before we dated, Susan had a friends with benefits named Mark. According to her, the two agreed to stop this arrangement once one of them starts dating someone. However, Susan also told me that she decided to still stay friends with Mark. 

However it got weird fast. She would always tell me she's ""hanging out with a friend"", although I was aware who Mark was. She'd disappear for hours and every time she called me she'd sound exhausted. I calmly confronted her about this, and she asked how she can prove that nothing is going on between them. I told her there's really not much she can do but rather only I had to trust her.

So it seemed okay. However, I noticed Mark would chat her up way too often, and he would usually be the most recent person she talked to on Facebook. They would go out late at night to eat dinner, and she'd post Snapchats about it. I was concerned but trusted her anyway, and sent her a text ""what are you eating? :D"" She responded with ""Yeah....he was having girl issues so he wanted to hang out"". I never asked her why she was with him.

It got weirder. She started canceling plans with me for weeks. The final week we were together, once again she told me she was ""hanging out with a friend"".

She had the nerve to post a Snap of her hanging out at his house. Just the two of them alone. Not having any of it, I angrily told her I can't deal with this. I also confronted her about canceling plans with me but fulfilling promises to him. She got pissed, hung up, and asked for a break. I told her I wanted a full breakup.

1391,not the a-hole,"My mom was a single mom, raised 3 kids after a difficult divorce from our dad. About 15 years ago, she started dating Bob*. Bob is 11 years older than her, also long divorced and has 3 or 4 grown kids.

In all the time that we’ve known him, he’s never really gotten to know me, my sister and my brother. We know nothing about him except what I have mentioned above. We have never really had a relationship or connection with him. Our only common ground is my mom.

I also want to mention that his children, I don’t even know their names or how many of them there are, refuse to speak to or even meet my mom. They steadfastly believe that their mom and dad belong together and absolutely deny my moms existence after 15 years of them dating. 

In 2012, Bob and my mom decided to get married. I was worried about it at first but I wanted my mom to be happy, I thought I was just being jealous and I waved it off to be supportive and helpful to her. 

Wedding planned and set for 2013 and then suddenly, 2 weeks before the wedding, my mom locked herself in her room, cried a lot, didn’t go to work and wasn’t speaking to anyone. After about 3 days of this, I discovered that Bob cheated on her and called off the wedding. I can’t explain to you the anger and the hate that I felt for him during that time. It was immeasurable. I hated him for hurting my mom after all she had been through. I hated him for embarrassing her and for treating her like a piece of shit.

Fast forward to late 2013, and my mom and Bob are back together. Of course, my siblings and I are livid. We tell her how we feel about him and express our concern that we never want to see her hurt. She understands our concern but stands by her decision to stick with him.

Now here we are in 2018. It has been five years and guess who is still treating my mom like shit? Bob. I swear he gets off on making my mom upset and then rushing to apologize to her. I do not know if the cheating has continued but the high school drama definitely has. My siblings and I have been tolerant of him and cordial to him,  but it’s been pretty frosty.

I had an anxiety attack on Sunday after an argument that I had with my mom over Bob. He has decided to take her to southern Mexico to meet his extended family. Knowing and explaining to her the strong warnings about Americans traveling to Mexico, I suggested that she might not go. She insisted that she would be safe with him and that nothing bad would happen to her. That night, anxiety just took over my mind. I envisioned every terrible thing that could potentially happen to her. I broke down. It started over Mexico but morphed into everything about Bob. 

I decided to talk to her about it. I could no longer remain silent on what has been the slowest, largest train wreck I have ever seen. 
I told her how I felt about Bob, how deeply his betrayal affected us all, how he continues to be such an ass and how much more she deserves in a partner.

My intention was not and is still not to make her choose between us and Bob. I will never give my mom an ultimatum because there is nothing that she can do that will ever make me disown or stop loving her. 

I just wanted her to know that I will not support her relationship with Bob but that I am still here and always will be. I wanted to point out to her all of the things about him that she may or may not have seen. Love is blind and when you’ve been with someone for 15 years, the thought of being alone or starting over seems terrifying. 

She was pretty combative with me, she said I need to go to therapy, she defended him but ultimately she said that she will call him and tell him it’s over and will never speak to him again. I reiterated that I am NOT giving her an ultimatum, I am NOT asking her to leave him.

Someone starts commenting with me. I know they’re agreeing with him and not me, but he keeps egging me on by sarcastically agreeing with me. The poster and I get into it a little bit until he says he’s trolling me as well. 

I’m a little confused at this point. I know he’s right wing (he was born in New York but he only wears confederate flag clothing) and I’m left, so I don’t think he’s trolling in that he agrees with me on gun control. He also says he and his co-workers got a good laugh out of hearing me talk. 

We exchange more words. I say something like “I feel a little better knowing I’m not a college freshman dating a high school freshman who still uses the word ‘trolled’.” He says something saying he feels better knowing women like me can never take serious offices. Then, I sat the thing that makes me wonder if I’m the asshole here. It was something like this:

“I would hope we could have political conversation without you feeling that people dying is funny. Maybe, if your IQ was as high as the number you see on a weight scale, you would understand that it doesn’t matter if cars kill more people then guns do: If any death is preventable, it should be avoided.” 

He disabled comments and didn’t say anything back, and we haven’t spoken since. But was it wrong of me to say that? I struggle with my weight, and he might as well (I don’t know him well enough to say), and I think I would be hurt if someone said that to me. So, am I the asshole?

Update: I took the ruling you guys gave and tried to apologize to him using my art account, but it turns out the comment didn’t post.

1399,not the a-hole,"... Okay, that title sounds a lot more parents-basement-y than I intended, I'm just not sure how else to concisely sum this up.

Context: I [30M] adore my mother [68]. I've done the whole left for university, moved back in for the better part of a year, and then 5 years ago moved into my current place. I'm a full-time successful middle school teacher, own a car, live with my wonderful partner, yadda yadda yadda. 

My parents don't live far away, but they are very respectful of my space and boundaries. They have also helped me a *lot* over the years (they paid my tuition, my last car was my dad's that he kinda just gave to me while I paid insurance, so on). They're extremely generous people when it comes to me, and I'm very thankful for that, and so I try not to throw it in their faces when they get into ""parenting"" moments because I recognize that I was a bit slow finding my own two feet. Besides that, I do ask them for help in other ways (e.g. my mom directed many school plays over the course of her career, brilliant ones, and now that I'm doing the same thing at my school, both she and my dad have been very generous with their time to help me out with it).

All that said, the one piece that I have a hard time setting aside is when my mom goes into ""mom"" mode on the fact that I don't lead the most active life. I'm healthy, I try to eat well, but when I get my own time, I'm very likely to spend it in front of vidya, especially given that my job keeps me massively busy. I'm a bit insecure about this aspect of my life (I try to work out a few times a week, never seems to pick up that well but I try) and this isn't helped by the way mom, well-meaning, tries to insert herself into it.

Example, it's March Break, and just before the break started mom said, bluntly, ""let's try to get you outside a few times this week."" She brought it up again a few days later, similar tone. I can't remember exactly what I said, but it was along the lines that she doesn't have to worry quite so much about me. 

So, here's my question: I kind of want to gently sit her down and say something like: ""I value what you bring to my life and I appreciate that you give me my space while still being there when I need you, but on this one thing, I'm going to have to figure it out on my own, and I need you to let me do that."" 

However, again, this is one of very, very few ways that she inserts herself negatively into my business, and I don't want to sound like I'm taking her and my dad for granted, given everything they've done/continue to do to (non-financially) support me.

So, WIBTA? Should I have that talk with her, or should I just suck it up as a price tag for the other awesomeness? Help. <3 ",26,28,0.9
1400,not the a-hole,"TL;DR at the bottom. 

I’m a junior at university and for my math modeling class we have a huge group project worth 50% of our final grade. There are three of us in the group. 

The professor tries to group people together based on their similar interests/focuses in their major so they can do projects about those. I’ll call my group members Dave and Mia.

My group starts texting, just deciding when to first meet and where and all that. After some snow days and shuffled plans, we decide to meet on Monday. Again there was a snow day on Monday, so last minute I text the group and Dave and I are trying to decide where to meet this week before the first part of the project is due. We finally decide to make some quick plans to meet on Tuesday. Mia has not texted in the project group chat since before Monday.

Dave and I show up at the library as scheduled and we wonder whether Mia will make an appearance. She straight up stopped responding in the group after we said we had to change the plans for Monday. So Dave and I started chatting. We’re both looking to go into finance and start talking about a “predicting stock prices” project. About 20 minutes after we were scheduled to meet, Mia shows up, sits down, opens her laptop, and starts clicking away only saying, “I’m Mia” (since we had never met face to face yet). So Dave and I ask Mia what she likes to study to see if we can get her on board with our proposed project. She says she’s into physics. We tell her about our project idea, but she says she doesn’t know anything about it so we shouldn’t do it. She proposes her physics idea now, but neither Dave or I have experience, besides intro to physics, so *we* don’t know anything about her project. I made a small case for the project Dave and I proposed (in short our project was simpler mathematically and the big research paper we had to do could be “fluffed up” with ease). After I said my point she said, “yea, that makes sense. We can do it.” I should note I did make a point of being absolutely sure she was ok with our project idea.  She consistently insisted it was fine. 

So we began some little research right there for our abstract. Dave and I began writing the abstract rough draft. After about 30 min of that, I asked what Mia was looking up on the computer (as in “did you find anything to add to the paper?”). She did a half smile and said “oh, hahaha, no.  I don’t get any of this.” I said she could join the discussion with Dave and I, just listening would help (as Dave and I were just looking up things and defining them because the abstract had to introduce our biggest concepts and goals). Anyway, she declines and says she’ll look it up at home. Ok, whatever that’s fine. There are a few points where we reference things from class. While discussing them, Mia laughs and says “Oh I don’t really go to class....or pay attention...” Dave and I are kind of like “this is great” *cue eye roll.* After another 30ish minutes, Dave and I feel like we have a good first draft going, so we finally call it a night and all go home. 

The next week we don’t see her in class at all. 

Now it’s the beginning of the week and the draft is due on Thursday. Dave texts the group Monday morning saying he edited it a lot over the weekend, so we just need to add a little more and edit with a fresh eye. I had a crazy week (as I assume everyone did, it’s midterm season), so I got back to him late Tuesday night to say I was editing it at that moment. He had added a ton, almost 2 pages when we only needed 1 minimum. I jump right in and add another paragraph or two and then edit the whole thing. I shoot another text to the group chat saying it’s looking good if anyone wants to take a peek. Still have not heard from or seen Mia in class (or elsewhere) since the first time my whole group met. So I assume she’s a last minute person: on Wednesday night she’ll go over the abstract. Thursday morning comes along and I reread it before passing it in. It was 100% only what Dave and I put in there. She had not added anything whatsoever. It was identical to how I left it. We get to class and pass it in. A few days later, the professor compliments us on our abstract. 

Now I’m really annoyed that we haven’t seen or heard from her since we first met. We wrote the entire abstract, just me and Dave, yet her name got put on it too. She has literally done nothing. Now I get if she was uncomfortable with the topic, but why didn’t she say *anything* and insist it was fine when I asked? Why didn’t she even say, “hey guys, I have no clue what I’m doing for the abstract, help.” I would’ve gladly helped if she just asked. 

Would I be the asshole if I told the professor about her? I want to ask if she withdrew from the class or something, but it also feels shitty to point out to the professor himself that she didn’t do anything for the project.


TL;DR: Have a class project. One group member goes MIA for a week and a half and doesn’t do any of the work due for our project. WIBTA if I talked to the professor about her?


Edit: Thanks so much guys! I think I’ll delegate  some simple tasks directly to her to try and see if she’s willing to put in any effort. If she still won’t participate, I’ll go to my professor and have a chat about it. 

Edit 2: Some are saying that she is just uncomfortable with the topic. I understand that completely but my biggest issue is she made 0 effort to communicate with us or to do *anything at all* for the project. I understand if you don’t know anything about a subject it’s daunting to jump into a huge research paper about it, but why couldn’t she even read the abstract and say “yea looks good guys” or say anything at all about the project.",36,78,0.93

She drives in the middle of the road sometimes forcing oncoming traffic to dodge her. Today we were at Home Depot and she was fucking driving in the middle of a two car lane forcing cars to turn away from her (she also pushes a cart and walks through stores like this). I've been with her when she straight up blows red lights or stops at green ones. Her speed is never consistent. Sometimes on the interstate she'll go from 60 mph to 85 then back down. She ALWAYS cruises in the left lane with the same approach. You get my point. 

The worst part is she doesn't believe me that she does these things and does not believe it needs fixed. She sees absolutely no issue with her driving.

1406,asshole,"Everyone in this situation is you’re basic white suburban folks.

 I’ve been a big comic book fan forever and have seen every comic book movie to date in the theater, usually on opening weekend. My wife and I (we’re child free by choice) have a nephew (he’s 11 now) who was into superheroes as a really little kid. Especially Iron Man. But he had never seen a modern superhero movie outside of the first two X-Men movies, so that means no DCEU, and no MCU. 

But his parents, my in-laws, *have* since taken him to see Wonder Woman and Black Panther. But like, only those two. 

Now, I’m a big whiny rainbow flag waving libtard. I’m right there with the rest of the “libtards” and bleeding hearts cheering on more diverse leads in these movies. But I also think that my nephew’s parents are teaching him that diversity is more important than if a movie is something you actually like by doing things this way.

Like I said, I champion diversity, but I don’t think you should go see something just because of the diversity. Go see something because you like it. My wife is a hardcore feminist, but she didn’t want to see Wonder Woman because she just finds the DCEU characters mostly boring. She found Suicide Squad a bit more interesting because it wasn’t the same old boring Batman or Superman bullshit she’s seen a hundred times. But when other women, including her sister in law heard she hadn’t seen WW, they made her feel like a “bad feminist”. Can’t someone just not want to see a movie because it doesn’t look good to them, while still cheering that it got made and did well?

The thing that really bothers me is that I think my nephew would really enjoy the other Marvel movies. And it’s not like they haven’t taken him or shown them to him because the movies are too white or too male dominated. Its traditionally been because he’s been too young for them in their opinions, which is fine. But now it’s fine I guess? Well my personally mission is to get the caught up by Infinity War.",53,36,0.74

While I would prefer they take it outside they're usually brief and it's not a huge deal. Today a couple sat down next to me and the woman took a call but it was only a few minutes. Then she took another. And another. Then the guy started sending text messages via voice dictation. I'm usually not hesitant to ask someone to get off their phone in situations like restaurants but I felt less certain here; this is a coffee shop. There are customers placing orders, staff yelling out orders for customers, the sound of the espresso machine, and people having normal conversations over coffee. This couple wasn't being unreasonably loud but I found there was something about the phone conversation vs a two-person convo that was distracting. It was very disjointed because the other party wasn't there and my ear kept picking up on it even though I couldn't (and didn't want to) hear the contents of the conversation.

After the morning surprise and a long day at uni, we meet up at night. It's me, Betty, Angie and another friend of ours (""Daisy"", 19F). We've all been friends for a very long time.

I mention that if I couldn't find a way to make the surprise in her house, I would have come to her university. She freezes, and says something along the lines of ""I would have never fucking talked to you again"". 

She explains that being the center of attention would have made her feel extremely awkward and she would absolutely hate us for making her do this. Me and Betty argue that this would be really ungrateful, as someone prepares a lot of stuff to make you happy. Daisy agrees with Angie and says that making her blow her cake candles in front of her uni classmates would have been absolutely awful. (I wrote the points here, but it wasn't a civilised discussion.

1410,not the a-hole,"I normally just mess around on my laptop during class if I already read ahead or am just bored, which I assumed was a normal thing to do.

1411,asshole,"I know this seems like a silly question, but just about everyone in my life (especially my parents and sister) has told me I would be an asshole if I chose to drive knowing I have these disorders because I’d be putting not just myself but other people at risk. I’ll break down each disorder and how people fear they’d affect my driving:

1. My seizure disorder. I am officially diagnosed with conversion disorder where I experience seizures that resemble clonic tonics, brought on my stress and/or trauma (we have yet to pin down any actual triggers). There is no official treatment for this condition other than therapy. I do have some Ativan that I take a tiny dose of sometimes and it helps to relax my body and stave off the seizure, but I usually just let them happen and go on with my day. I do know when they’re coming on, and can hold them off long enough to get myself somewhere private, so I don’t see why I couldn’t just pull over into a parking lot or something if I’m in the car. My family thinks I’d just have a seizure at random and cause an accident, which is possible but not likely.

2. ADHD. I space out a lot, I miss small details, I get lost easily, and I am not very observant of other people around me. I do take adderall, and it seems to help with some of this. I’ve heard a lot of people drive with ADHD, so there has to be some way to manage symptoms while behind the wheel that I just haven’t learned about yet. 

3. Dissociation. This is what worries my family almost as much as the seizures. I have borderline personality disorder, and a symptom of this is dissociation, especially derealization (surroundings don’t feel real) and depersonalization (self doesn’t feel real), and both often occur at the same time. This one I can understand the worry about, because people who are otherwise cognitively “normal” often dissociate while driving, and so I can see myself dissociating easily while behind the wheel. There’s really no treatment for this, but there are coping strategies like practicing mindfulness and grounding meditations that I can get in the habit of doing.

4. Dyscalculia. This one I don’t see so much as being an issue after I’ve been driving for awhile. This is a math learning disorder, but also causes me to have a difficult time telling how fast someone is going or how far they are from me. My family thinks I could easily cause an accident by not being able to accurately judge speed and distance of other drivers around me. 

I guess I’m ultimately hoping that I could learn to handle driving, despite all of these things. I’m so tired of relying on other people for rides to places, and my city’s public transportation is shit (buses only run Monday through Friday and most routes end at 9pm). I’ve tried services like Uber and Lyft but I spent almost $800 one month just on transportation since my city is so spread out. I just want the independence of getting in a car and going wherever I want, whenever I want.

But would I be an asshole for it?

1419,New Rule,"Commenters providing advice *instead* of judgement has always been a bit of a nuisance because it muddies the purpose of the sub and complicates flaring.  But to ask an utterly unwashed mass to dictate your actions without ever more than superficially understanding your scenario is a *recipe for disaster*.   As sub creator and a mod, I don't want to provide people with a forum that invites submitters to do this and then stamps our approval on the most exciting advice after it enjoys 24 hours of popularity.  It might be cathartic to type that some bad actor you read an angry rant about deserves to “catch a beating”, and it probably feels just to upvote the idea and thereby express displeasure if you don’t like what the submitter claimed he did.   But when that gripe is construed as advice, and blessed by the popular vote of the crowd, and the submitter goes off and makes it reality, something reckless has happened.   

I think there is a lot to be learned by asking the general public what their mores are and how they react to one action or another.  But, when totally uninformed strangers on the internet start telling arbitrary people that it's time to attack another person--or, as in another recent example, invite government agencies to uproot their life—without any idea what the consequences of those things will be, we're entering dangerous ground that is well beyond the purpose of this sub.   Since I can’t vet everyone on the sub for relevant life experience, or law degrees, or medical degrees, or social worker licenses, I don’t think it’s reasonable that I should tell a stranger to trust that their advice is well-informed, or even the completed thinking of an rational adult.   

Because of this, we’re now instituting the rule that **All submissions that ask for advice will be removed.**

We’re not yet saying that commenters may not give advice; we just need it to be clear that it’s not what we do here.  As long as you make your judgement clear, follow up advice is allowed.

Before you tell someone to throw a punch in righteous fury, try to remember you don’t necessarily know the legal consequences of battery where he lives, or if the target has deadly martial arts training, or rather an undiscovered heart condition that means he’s going to die if he takes a harsh tap to the chest.

We recently had another baby, and my wife is on maternity leave. We had family members come to stay with us for the first few weeks to help out, but now it's just the two of us in the house with the baby all day while our older child is at school. I handle everything for our older child before and after school, and help out with the baby whenever I can. But during the hours that I'm working, I'd prefer that she treat me like I'm not in the house. 

She comes into my office at least 2-3 times an hour to chat with me or ask me questions about things that could absolutely wait until later. She asks me to take care of the baby at least 4 or 5 times a day for 15-30 minutes at a time while she showers, uses the bathroom, has a meal, or chats on the phone to her family (I shower at night after everyone else has gone to bed, and let the baby sit in her swing if I'm alone with her and need to use the bathroom or eat - she sometimes fusses or cries a little but I'm always done in a few minutes). She also yells for me to come downstairs and help her with lots of random little things, like getting something off a high shelf (we have a step-ladder) or going to get the mail because she's curious if something has arrived (it can wait). 

I think a big part of it is that she's lonely spending most of her day interacting with just the baby, and I do try to go check in on her when I can and give her company, and I always offer to take the baby off her hands and give her a break when I take my lunch. But I'm basically MIA for up to 3 hours of each 8 hour work day because of this, and my boss isn't pleased with my performance.

Shortly after he had enlisted and left the state, our mutual friend (who brought us together, we were a trio) took his own life. That was about three years ago and it brought Jake and I even closer.
  
Currently, I am struggling with leaving an emotionally abusive relationship. Jake knows this, and has listened to me talk for hours about my pain as well as vent about how I don't have it in me to feel for anyone romantically at this point. I'm also preeetty close to being a lesbian, which he also knows. I've talked with him just as much about his romantic troubles which include a divorce and a relationship with a woman who was getting a divorce.  
  
Throughout our friendship, there were a few times I thought maybe he was dropping hints that he was romantically interested in me. I made it very, very clear that I wasn't interested. I regularly told him how great it was that he's the only male friend I've had that hasn't ever made a move on me. At one point, he promised to maintain that status, which he did until a few weeks ago.  
  
Jake got drunk and confessed to me that he's in love with me. I could've excused that and let it be, but he got sort of aggressive about it and made me incredibly uncomfortable. He'd previously asked me about falling in love with friends, and I said it can suck but it happens. After his initial confession, he brought that up and told me ""you said you understood. Don't be weird about it."" He also referenced a time I jokingly agreed to marry him if we were both alone at 35, saying ""we should just do it now. You know I could take care of you."" It was just... weird. His behavior bordered on Nice Guy level and it made me feel so gross.
  
It also made me uncomfortable because when he visited home a few months ago, I let him sleep in bed with me after a night out drinking. He asked if we could cuddle, and I said yes because why not? I was drunk, he was my best friend, and I trusted him. Plus, he's always been a very touchy friend. Never in a weird way, just lots of hugs. At the time, it seemed perfectly normal.  
  
I haven't talked to him much since then. I feel betrayed on some level. I understand we can't necessarily help who we develop feelings for, and if he'd confessed differently, I don't think I would feel quite the way I do now. As it stands though, I don't think I want to continue the friendship. It hurts, but I just feel dirty talking to him now.

Because of this, I feel very uncomfortable over there. There is a lot of tension and I'm angry on my boyfriends behalf and don't want to go over and pretend to be polite because i feel it will only make me angrier. 

I told my boyfriend that I'm not going to his house anymore and he seems upset about it. Not outwardly angry or anything, more sad/hurt.

1438,asshole,"My neighbors are really nice people, but they tend to have what I think is a bit of antisocial behavior. The worst of it is their noise. We have never had any problems with previous neighbors but these neighbors seem to be the loudest ones we've ever had in this neighborhood. They hold parties that go well into the early hours. They let their kids play outside (where they scream and shout) at night. Their yappy dog constantly barks. 

Now, they don't do this a whole lot. They probably have about 6-8 parties a year and most of them are on weekends (though they have been known to do weekdays). When we do ask them to keep it down, they tend to comply a bit.

We are in houses, not apartments, in a suburban neighborhood. We are a couple in our 30's with our own children. We are early birds, we go to bed early and get up early. We are also very light sleepers and cannot go to sleep when they do these things. And our bedroom window is right next to their back yard so we can hear everything they do when they're back there. 

Yesterday, this all came to a head when I had had enough of their screaming kids and yappy dog. I had a headache and we were supposed to be up early the next day for a big event that my kids have been working on for months. Their kids started playing outside at almost 11pm (this is a weekend, not a week day) and their dog had been barking. I went out into my backyard and told them that they needed to stop screaming and take their dog inside. I did yell it, but in a sterm mom voice, not in a crazy lady voice. 

This morning I got this FB message:
*Hi Neighbors Good morning. I don't have your husband cellphone but please share this message with him too since my wife is already aware too .I heard you guys were bothered last night when our kids and cousins decided to use our trampoline for about 15 min last night ""Friday night"" to play. To be honest with you I feel that you guys are exaggerating and unfortunately it is not the first time you guys texted us over when we decided to celebrate our bdays or christmas since we don't normally make parties at our home. I don't think it's fair; if you guys decided to have early games on Saturday to have fun with your family its ok but that doesn't  mean that you can shut my happiness when I am trying to have fun with my kids and family at home! I would kindly remind you that we live in a house and not in an apartment but on top of that we normally don't do parties. Our rare ""family""reunions will keep happening, especially Christmas, New Years and our bdays. So when you notice that, please feel to move into a different room in your house or just deal with it for that day! I really hope you understand my point and that this doesn't create hard feelings. In regards to my ""new"" puppy dog barking, I can definitely keep him in but that's it) i think we both are a very nice family oriented neighbors and we get a long pretty well!

1441,not the a-hole,"The case: I was home and had plans to stay home and have a meal with my younger brother. My SO texts me and indirectly tells me ""lets hang out"" and then says that she wants to have dinner with me. I tell her about my plans and tell her that I cannot meet up with her. She keeps on insisting that she found about a restaurant that looks nice and wants to have dinner. I tell her that since I already had plans with my brother, it would not be nice to suddenly change them. This similar dialogue goes back and forth for a while until she gets upset and I get mad.

The details: 


- She texted me at around 6 p.m.

- I usually eat dinner at around 6 or 7 p.m.

- I was with her last night until noon, where we had to separate.

- She thought I was only thinking eating and staying with my brother and did not think I had already informed my brother of my plans

- There has been three cases in the past where I already had plans with other people but she wanted to do something else with me. She would persist and plead that we do what she wants and I have had to ditch others for that. After the second time I told her that her acting that way is selfish and puts me in a bad spot no matter what I choose. She did it once more but was not as bad so I just looked over it.

- She is currently studying for a test and had told me various times that we should not meet until she finishes, which would be next week Friday; however, she is always telling me to go over to her house, meet up and have a meal or go out.

I decided to call her after her last message and tell her that it is not cool to put me in a spot where I have to choose on sticking with my plans or making her upset.

1442,not the a-hole,"So my 11 year old is good friends with another little girl in her class, we’ll call this friend Kelly.  Kelly lives with her grandma who speaks only Korean.  I do not speak Korean, so generally we have to rely on Kelly to translate/relay information.  I generally try to double check with a parent when one of my kids want to spend a night with a friend, especially if it’s going to require that I leave my kid there late into the next day or whatever — I frequently work on weekends and am a single parent, so I’m not always available to pick my kid up on Saturday morning unless it’s before 7am.  The girls also attend a magnet school so we don’t live as close as you would expect classmates going to a regular neighborhood school to live, so my daughter can’t just walk home in the morning.  

Recently it’s happened a few times that my daughter has called or texted from school on a Friday to ask if she can get on Kelly’s bus and go home with her for a few hours, which is generally fine with me.  Then when I text or call to say I’m coming to get her, she asks if she can spend the night and if I’m working the next day she and Kelly will say that Kelly’s grandma has offered or agreed to drive my daughter home or to let my daughter stay till late in the afternoon Saturday or even all weekend (I think all weekend is just flat out weird, tbh, and I don’t allow that).  I’ve even heard Kelly say to me on the phone “Lemme double check with my grandma” then say something in Korean to her grandma and receive an answer in Korean from grandma and then tell me “my grandma says she’ll take Christy to your house after church so it would be like 11 am”.  I usually say no, but once I said yes, the girls were adamant that Grandma was bringing my daughter to my house before noon Saturday.  But when I got off at 4 my daughter was still at Kelly’s and I had to go get her and I seriously wondered if Kelly had even actually gotten her grandma to agree to take my daughter home or to let her stay over.  I was seriously like “um, oh shit, does Kelly’s grandma think I just abandoned my kid with her?”

So anyway, I figured no more sleepovers with Kelly because I can’t reliably check with the parents due to the language issue, but I do allow my daughter to ride Kelly’s bus to go over after school on days when I can easily pick her up, but it seems like now every damn time I do, I get a bunch of texts not just from my daughter but also from Kelly asking if she can spend the night.  Then when I show up, Kelly asks again.  And again.  I’m about ready to say no more visits to Kelly’s house at all, but I feel like a heel about it.

Details:
Kelly is a good kid, apart from pestering me and possibly lying about whether her grandma will take my daughter home/whether her grandma really says it’s okay for my daughter to stay late.  She gets good grades and participated in the same activities at school as my daughter.  Kelly is also not allowed to go to other people’s houses on the school busses, her neighborhood has a lot of retirees and few if any kids, and her only sibling is a toddler.  I think she’s probably pretty lonely outside of school, but they do also go to a Korean speaking church on Saturday and Sunday so she does have some social outlet besides school.  My daughter is a good kid too and I really don’t need to punish her or anything.

I am also a little weird here — I’m pretty introverted and at my daughters age I would sometimes lie to my friends who wanted me to sleep over and say my mom wouldn’t let me.  I honestly think the amount of time that Kelly wants my daughter at her house is weird, but I know I’m not exactly normal either so I’m not sure what is.  I also get really irritable having other people’s kids over for very long and I’m maybe a little paranoid about my kids annoying the host parent.  My daughters father thinks Kelly’s grandma probably wants our daughter over to keep Kelly entertained...which isn’t implausible but since I can’t get it from Kelly’s grandma directly I’d rather err on the side of not dumping my kid on her.

TL;DR:  my kids friend lives with a non-English-speaking grandma and always wants my daughter to spend the night and I don’t want to let my kid go over because I can’t communicate with the grandma...which seems unfair to the kid",32,72,0.9
1443,not the a-hole,"My wife and I have been together for over 10 years, but for the last few our relationship has been suffering. I'm afraid we don't have very much in common anymore (as far as interests and activities, wants, etc.), and it has been partly the cause of some friction.

What I'm coming to realize now is that she is incredibly controlling and stubborn, and I am afraid she may be gas-lighting me without actually meaning to.

As our arguments got worse, ""we"" decided it would be a good idea for me to go see a therapist. You see, after arguing for a few hours and feeling completely unheard or acknowledged, while being interrupted constantly, I would explode, get loud, and say hurtful things. So I went to a therapist in order to work on those ""scary anger issues"". I'd like to say that these ""hurtful things"" were bottled up criticisms from our past, i.e. ""You constantly interrupt me"", ""you have hypocritical double-standards"", etc.

After going to see her for a year, my therapist says that my wife should be in therapy. Granted, she had only heard from me, but god that was validating. Shortly thereafter the therapist goes on maternity leave. I noticed that the therapy wasnt helping me very much, and in fact was making me more upset because all I would do is complain about my wife, then get tools (that didnt work) to help with the arguments; so when she came back from maternity leave I discontinued seeing her.

Fast forward some time and now I'm just getting depressed and anxious pretty often. I start having panic attacks on my way home, thinking about having to deal with her, ""what if shes in a bad mood, etc."" And so, I decided to get on zoloft to see if that would help (and it really has).

Now it is a lot easier for me to let things go, and we don't argue nearly as much. However, we do still of course have our occasional spates, and I still feel REALLY bad after, even though I don't really blow up anymore.

So then, I started recording our arguments without her knowledge. I legitimately wanted to re-listen when I get to a calmer place, and see what I can do better going forward. And while there are a lot of things I can work on, I'm starting to think of these recordings as proof that I am actually not crazy.

Does that make me an asshole?

FYI we are in a single-party consent state.

1444,asshole,"I just got this email from my kids school:

“XYZ Elementary is in desperate need of Lunch Room Monitors for our school for the remainder of this school year. Currently these roles are being fulfilled by our teachers and this is taking away from their own personal lunch hours.”

Isn’t that the teachers’ job? I would love to have volunteers come into my job and do it for me, too. But that’s why I have the job, so I can do the work and get paid. I frequently skip lunch when I’m busy at work. No big deal. Grab a snack on the move. Eat a big dinner. Whatever. I would never ask for someone to come do my job for me so I could have a lunch hour. 

I know some teachers go all out for their students and that’s awesome. But the idea that they need help because they need a lunch hour...I don’t know. It just rubs me the wrong way somehow. Many professionals work long hours and are underpaid. I frequently put in 12 hour days w/o complaint. Why do teachers get free helpers?

Note: I’m the son of a teacher and husband of a teacher so I have a lot of sympathy for them in general, esp. the low pay and long hours. They’re also highly satisfied with their careers so it’s a trade off. 

Edit: thanks everyone. I’m an asshole for accusing teachers. 

I’m justified in my anger (probably) at being asked to volunteer but not for the reason I thought. As many pointed out, it’s not the teachers I should be focused on but the district for not providing enough personnel so that teachers can have a reasonable work life and probably the state for lack of funding.

We only met every Tuesday and Thursday and it was given on a Thursday. The weekend went by and when Monday came, I was surprised to discover that only a few of us had done it. 

Among us was this A-lister group of friends who only kept their work to themselves. My friends, however, were not able to do it or were too lazy to do it during the weekend. They asked me if I had done it already and since I usually allow them to copy my homework for other classes (only the easy ones like definitions from the dictionary and the internet), I already knew they were planning to do the same with this one. I didn't want to because it was a personal summary and I had a hard time doing it since it consumed my entire weekend. I said I wasn't able to do it.

However, they weren't the only ones who asked me. There was also this other group who were my classmates from the previous semester who knew I was doing good at school.

1451,asshole,"So we have this office Risk game going.

It's pretty casual and lighthearted, not a whole lot of participants but that works out because we don't want to rotate the roster too much and give everyone a chance. Most of my coworkers know that I'm a bit of a stickler for rules, so when I see someone make a clearly unfair move, they're not surprised to hear me call them out. The following happened over the past week and has transpired to the point where I am creating a Reddit post to suss out the solution. Am I taking things too far, or do I have a legitimate complaint?

First of all, I would like to point out the fact that the Risk manual has been sitting by the side of the Risk board and in eyesight of anyone playing the game for several months by now. Anyone unfamiliar with the rules could have caught up with them, and they are [even available online](http://www.ultraboardgames.com/risk/game-rules.php).

I have slowly expanded across Europe, and a coworker of mine made some erratic decisions when we met in Greenland. After he forced me to fight, costing me tens of soldiers due to some crazy luck, we ended it there and he took North America.

Long story short, my coworker expanded across South America, but I was able to take North America, which is what leads us to where we are now. I had finished my turn taking North America and fortified Mexico against Venezuela. He had started, laid down cards, and placed his entire new troop of 30 armies along with those already in Brazil, threatening Northern Africa.

And then he sat for three days, but it is not unusual for us to take breaks, as I often take breaks on my turn as I try to analyze each one of my coworkers' plans in order to have the upper hand on the battlefield.

Finally, he continued his turn, moving ten of the armies from where he had placed them in Venezuela up to Brazil, and attacked Northern Africa with his troops he had left in Venezuela, moving on to the rest of Africa. It was at this point where I looked at the game and saw what he had done. Those ten troops that he had moved to Venezuela, which I was planning to invade from Mexico on my next turn, should not have been there! As soon as he had laid his last army, *the armies laid are the armies played*, in terms I coined. His turn had ended the second he had laid his final army, three days before he continued his turn.

My argument is that the second he finished laying his final army, he had concluded step one of the turn, i.e. [Receiving and Replacing Reinforcements](https://pasteboard.co/H9ORhFL.png), after which he may not move said armies until he'd hit step 3, ""Fortify Your Position.""

I've agreed to continue to play -- as long as my opponent keeps his 10 troops in Venezuela without movement to Mexico -- as a truce. We can agree that these troops started in Mexico and moved to Venezuela after the turn as a compromise, in which he cannot use said troops to fortify Mexico. He doesn't agree, and believes that the entire three-day period was part of his deployment period, but those were three days I spent making my plans, a fact he should respect given that I spent three days planning my strategy before he changed his entire strategy.

It's been nearly a week now, and as Thursday rolls around, things haven't changed much. I haven't eaten lunch with him, we don't talk as often, and tensions are high as Risk can get, as it's by nature a high-stakes game.

In fact, last Friday, after some heated arguments, I decided to send an email that went out after everyone was gone, ensuring this would be the first thing they see on Monday. It outlines all of my thoughts and concerns, but it belongs more in /r/cringe than this subreddit. Of course, if there is interest, I'll consider posting.

In the end, I'm interested in your thoughts on the rules, but also on our friendship. Is this worth arguing over, and if it is, who wins? If it's not, who wins anyway? Sure, this is all about a board game, but everything is its own battle to me, and I'd like to know who ends up the conqueror in this one.

EDIT: [Here is the email in question.](https://imgur.com/a/Te0Rk) Never say I didn't deliver.

EDIT 2: I must confess that this was not me, but me writing from the perspective of the coworker/friend in question. He actually suggested that I post this to reddit, so please no hate, and sorry for anyone I've bamboozled. This is still a legit situation, the email is real, and and I have no doubt he would have written this up similarly. Please continue sharing your thoughts and I'll share with him later.

Now, to keep a very long story short, my mother was living in one of my grandfather's houses to try to escape a bad situation and my brother moved with her. A mix of complicated family drama, and the introduction of a new step-mother, ended up exploding. This caused a fight with my brother and my mother moving out. On top of that, family members and the step-grandma had started to remove family heirlooms and some of the most valuable stuff disappeared. To protect what was left, my mother moved a large amount of heirlooms related to family history with her. I've been through it, and nothing I've come across had any monetary value. I've also talked to my grandfather and while he wasn't happy about it he didn't demand the items be returned. That said, the fight with my brother and mom, and her exit, made him angry enough to write my brother out of the will. 

Now, my mother has made several conflicting comments. She has said she might have also been written out of the will, and (to confuse everything else) all of her children might have been written out of the will. She has also said only my brother was written out. She has also said that I should expect a large amount of money from grandpa when he passes, but that may or may not depend on if his current wife survives him, and it may or may not depend on if my mom survives him (she has cancer). 

I have received a few heirlooms from my mother already, but now I am really confused about if I need to expect something else or not. I really want to call up my grandfather to get everything clarified. I have visited with him personally since the drama, and it was a happy meeting, but other than that distance and life has prevented me from calling regularly just to talk.

Would I be an asshole to call my grandfather just to ask about possible inheritance?

EDIT: Thanks for the replies. I thought it would be an asshole move, but sometime you have just have to get that confirmation to push you away from doing anything stupid. Yes, I'll call him to say hi and tell him I miss him. No, I don't think he owes me anything but I am concerned and confused about something that could potentially create big drama. Yes, he has his will and testament set up and the only person on that side of the family I trust is his executor. No, I don't think sit around and think about how I can get my hands on his money, but I am cursing my mother for being an asshole in more ways than one, especially in how she has gotten me confused about it all.

I don't think the expenses are much since she lives with them, eats very little and has health insurance.    They're now building a 4,000 sq ft home in a gated community for their retirement.  MIL gets social security and she owns a house  in another country.  Many years ago she put the house  in my husband's name, and so now legally I have inherited it.  I have suggested to my SIL that she keep records of her expenses, and I can sell the home, put the $ in an account for her mom, and SIL can reimburse herself and use the $ as she sees fit.  She hemmed and hawed and told me her mother does not want to do that, although MIL also has dementia and will never return to that house.   She's told me she's trying to get the house back into her mom's name now, and the only reason I can think she'd do that is she does not trust me.  She's asked me to send her a copy of my husband's ID to help her with the process, and I don't see why not, because I don't care if she takes control of the house.  She takes care of her mother and I'm not planning on keeping any of the proceeds from it.  Bottom line, I don't feel obliged to help her out with her mother.  I'm pretty sure she feels it's unfair that she's the only one helping her mom.

1456,asshole,"About a year ago, I was working a summer job and met a girl there. She was super cute, really funny and seemed to have a genuine interest in almost everything I did. Every time she opened her mouth and spoke to me, it was the absolute highlight of my day. 

A few weeks after the summer job ended and I went back to my regular job, she just stopped talking to me entirely. I had no idea why. I would try and text her, and I used snapchat a few times as well, we had a 'streak' together (a streak is the number of days two users have kept in regular contact) but she never responded to me. I was thinking about her the other day, and it made me really sad that I had never been able to really do anything special with her, and I messaged her again. She responded last night and said she was super busy all the time and never had any time to do anything. She apologized for not being able to make time for me and said she would get back to me when she would be free to meet with me. 

That didn't really satisfy me, as I was a little pissed that she left me hanging for months without a legitimate answer as to why she cut off all contact with me. So I messaged her a few more times. Along the lines of ""I really, really would like to see you. If it's difficult for you to meet me somewhere, I'd be more than happy to drive out and get you"" and she said something like ""I would love to but I'm super busy"". Still upset. 

I said to myself: ""There's no way in hell that someone can have a schedule COMPLETELY 100% packed every single day, for like 7 months. I never took my anger to her, I came to her with more of a confused vibe. After a bit more talking, she just says ""I don't think it's gonna work out. Sorry."" 

So, I was wondering about messaging her again to truly understand why she might not want to see me/be with me, etc. 

In short, AITA for being possibly too pushy about this? Is it worth messaging her again to truly understand?? Any additional input from relationship experts would be very, very appreciated.",28,34,0.83

She kicked out the boyfriend a few months ago and went to rehab and then came to live with us (me and my parents) and about 3 days after she was released from rehab, she went back to her (ex)boyfriend and soon got addicted again. I’m at the point where if she calls me for help or money, I don’t answer and I tell her it’s her own problem.

1460,everyone sucks,"I asked an acquaintance to watch my apartment and two bearded dragons over the weekend (the one is too small yet to travel) and she said she was available. Let’s call her A. A asked if her friend M could stay in the apartment with her and I said yes because I also know M somewhat. 

Friday to Sunday we’re good until I got a text from M saying that A got really sick and she had to take her home. I knew A wasn’t feeling well before I left so that wasn’t a big deal, I just got another friend to pick up the keys to check in on the lizards Monday morning. I got home around 2:00 Monday afternoon and put my bags down and noticed a few of the following things. 

1-they left a massive pile of towels and sheets and blankets which costed me around $20 to wash. 

2-Instead of using the dish scrubby that was hanging on the kitchen faucet, M had dug through the cleaning cabinet and took a used sponge to wash dishes. This sponge happened to be the sponge I use to clean the bathroom including the toilet. So all the dishes had to be rewashed and sanitized. 

3- Even though the dishes were “washed” there were still chunks of food stuck to them

4- there were two full garbage bags sitting on the kitchen floor.  

5- there was poo all over the toilet seat

6- there was poo on the floor 

7- there was poo flecks on the back of the door 

8- the bathtub was filthy

9- oh and more poo on the radiator

10- One of the bags in the kitchen was a bag full of poo soaked paper towels. In my kitchen. 

So I’m conflicted. A obviously had no control over her bowels due to sickness, I feel bad for her and honestly when you got to go you got to go. So she went home and trusted M to take care of cleanup and she did a crap (hehe) job.
I am really mad at the quality of cleaning as I keep a very clean house. I don’t know if I should pay A for the weekend because she did watch the pets/apartment for 3/4 days, or not pay her because of the mess, almost like that covers the cost of cleaning.

1461,not the a-hole,"I’m 19 and my sister is 14. We were pretty close growing up, but she also had a huge behavior problem stemming from adoption issues and general mental health things. Mostly she just lashed out at my parents, but as she got older she began treating me like shit too. I can’t go into too much detail cause we’d be here forever, but she would basically insult me, gaslight me, and treat my family like shit emotionally.

I noticed a few years back that I couldn’t have physical contact with my sister. If we even touched hands accidentally, I’d physically cringe and need to wipe my hand somewhere. I can’t help it. She has gotten a LOT better but I’m still unable to touch her.

I recently started my first year of college and obviously when I was dropped off there was a lot of hugging. I couldn’t hug her. When I go home for visits, I can sometimes force myself to do it, but not always. I feel bad because I know she’s trying to repair our relationship, and I feel like a total asshole for rejecting her. But at the same time, I can’t physically bring myself to hug her.

1463,not the a-hole,"I live in a two person apartment with a roommate I can’t stand. We were best friends before moving in. One of those situations. A while back, I stopped allowing my roommate to use my xbox. I was deemed not the asshole then by popular consensus. That story can be found here https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/7he9j3/aita_for_punishing_my_20_yr_old_roommate/?st=JE4R8KTN&sh=df377b54. 

Now, it’s been a few months since. We get along sort of. We don’t hangout besides if we’re at the apartment at the same time though. 

One thing I cannot stand is playing maid. Which is non stop with this guy. It’s seriously ridiculous. I assigned us duties around the house that he agreed to. I said I would load dishes in the dishwasher if he started the load and put them away. He agreed. 

Now, here’s what I can’t stand. When he eats, he uses a lot of sauces. BBQ, Ketchup, etc. He NEVER cleans the sauces or any excess food off. We have a garbage disposal and he puts the food on the non garbage disposal side. So, if the food falls off, he assumes I clean it from the sink. I told him he needs to wash the plates/bowls after he uses them and get that shit off.

also, if he uses the pan to make food, or the pot to make ramen, he leaves behind the residue. I always, always, always take the 10 seconds after using either the pot or pan and give it a quick scrub, making it look clean and not left with anything on it. 

I asked he does the same. He said he will, but whenever i come home, it’s the same thing for plates/dishes/pots/pans/bowls. I am so sick of playing maid especially when it’s me that supplying everything. So, here’s what i plan on doing. 

I will give him 1 cup. 1 bowl. 1 plate. 1 pan. A few of each utensil (spoon, forks, etc.). If he wants to eat, and his plate,bowl, w/e is dirty, he will have to clean it himself. Does this make me an asshole or is it understandable that I’m not his mother? ",30,31,0.9
1464,not the a-hole,"So, my ex invited me to her birthday party last weekend, wich took place at another friends location, because its easier to reach via bus/train. Anyway, we've been good friends almost ever since we broke up two-three years ago. She's got a boyfriend since about two months after we broke up, I've been single, mostly. So I made out with a friend of her on said party. She didnt say anything right away but kinda went to sleep (?) for about an hour until I drove her home, because I actually stayed sober all the time. Wich is when she asked me, if it was possible for me to not date one of her friends because it would be 'hurting to watch' - I'm paraphrasing.

I felt like she was overstepping some boundary and decided to just not answer at the time, and to also ignore her request. While I'm confident that I'm in the right, thinking its unfair of her to ask me something like that, it still made me feel bad and continues to do so to some degree. So I just wanna make sure, Am I the Asshole?

1465,not the a-hole,"My brother and I used to be good friends when I was a kid. We hung out, played vidya, and enjoyed each other's company. I looked up to him (he's 13 years older).

About the time he joined the navy and he had his first kid with his first wife, things changed. He started acting like my dad and shitting on me for everything I did.

As his marriage fell apart and they had two more kids, he started getting angrier and angrier with life in general. Physical altercations between him and I became more of a regular thing.

He's been remarried for almost ten years now, but his anger has only gotten worse. He screams blue murder at his kids for doing regular dumb kid shit and whenever I pull him aside to tell him to chill, he threatens me saying I'm ""patronizing him"".

I met my now wife and he's said awful things about her weight and career choice to me, but insists on asking her advice for kid stuff (recently his eldest son shit too close to the house, in a manner of speaking).

He ruined a trip my wife and our parents made to his place for new years with one of his explosive outbursts to the point we left his house and celebrated new years eve in our hotel room. 

Our mom claims that he's jealous because I'm happier and I don't have kids and have all my disposable income to spend on fun shit while he's drowning in debt (mind you, he bought two large swaths of land and a used $16000 beemer and a used $40000 truck).

I'm at the point that I'm going to tell him to exit my life and to only talk to me when mom and dad die because his negative influence literally drags me down (he used to put all kinds of negative shit in my head about my wife cheating on me, or trapping me into having a kid and then never working again and it used to get my wife and I into arguments because of how paranoid he made me).

I wish he'd realize I'm a grown man and if he needs to reach out, to have enough respect for me as his brother and fellow man to ask for help, but he won't.

1466,not the a-hole,"I had a pretty awful day at work today. I work retail, and it was a tough, stressful day. I called my mom up when I finished (I live with my parents, paying rent and all that), asked if she wanted anything bringing home for dinner, and told her I'd had a not great day and would like to talk about it when I got home. She said okay, I got the stuff she asked for, and went home. 

I get home and she's watching tv, so after I put my coat away, I waited a few minutes for her show to finish. When it does, she tells me to tell her about my day. It wasn't mean to be a super long story, but a LOT had happened, and I think I ended up talking non-stop for about five minutes when she got a phone call. She looked at her phone, waved a hand at me to say ""hold on"", and answered the phone while I was in mid-sentence. 

Honestly, I found this super rude. Its a struggle in my household as is to be heard sometimes, and the fact that my mom thought it was no big deal to answer a phone call while I was talking hurt. It was my dad, and he just wanted to talk about their weekend plans. She stayed on the phone with him, while I got up at started to put the shopping/my work stuff away. A few minutes later, she gets off the phone and asks me to continue. I'm still putting the shopping away, so I asked her to wait a moment. She got a little offended, and said, ""I thought we were having a conversation?""

I replied back, (dumb, but I was pretty annoyed), ""well, you were the on the phone."" She waves it off and just says, ""oh like you wouldn't have done the same thing."" I told her honestly that no, I wouldn't answer a phone call in the middle of a conversation I was having with someone else, and that it was a little rude. Voice was calm, not yelling or angry tone, or anything like that. She just rolled her eyes at me, and said ""seriously?"", and then started to ignore me. When my mom is mad at people, she gives the silent treatment. As a child I would literally beg her to talk to me, but as an adult I have no patience for it. So I went and fixed myself some food and went upstairs to my room, and we haven't spoken since. We likely won't speak until I make the first move

Thing is - was I being a petty asshole? It *was* just a few minute phone call, and I'm not sure if I blew things out of proportion and made things worse rather than just moving on and finishing what I was saying. Now we like won't talk until tomorrow when she 'forgives' me - was I an asshole for pushing it that far instead of just letting it go?",33,44,0.92

Well, one day my dad was at the kitchen table drinking coffee with his friends, when he saw my cat messing around with one of his plants. He called me into the room to make me make the cat stop, so I picked him up and took him to my room. Well, a few hours later, i'm getting ready for work and the cat does it again so my dad yells at me and tells me ""get that thing under control or i'll take it outside and shoot the fucking thing."" I put the cat back into my room, closed the door and told my dad ""Fuck off you psycho"" and went to work. I come home after work and my birth certificate, Social Security Card and other paperwork are on my computer desk.

I pack up some things and i lived with my girlfriend for a few months before working at mcdonalds for a while and getting enough to have an apartment.

1468,not the a-hole,"My friend Jasmine and I both tended to cover each other when we are short and want to go out when we were young. Alex has always been our friend and is actually the one who introduced us back in high school. 

I went to college, neither of them did. While I was in college I was working multiple jobs and pretty much living the poor college student budget (noodles almost ever meal, never going out, ect.). Even with the extra funding I got for being the only person in my family to ever go to college and poor person scholarship money I had trouble paying the bills. 

When I would come home to visit Jasmine would cover my way when she knew funds were really tight for me, and if I came when she was having a bad time (hours cut at work, other normal stuff like that) I would cover her. Alex pretty much never had money and never covered either of us, despite working a way better job then either of us had at the time. 

When Alex did have money she would ask for rides to places that were pretty far out (45 minutes to a sex shop we had all visited together before), to buy things for herself. She never offered to treat us back. One time we talked about all going to get our eyebrows and nails done together as a celebration (I got all A's my first year, Jasmine got a good raise), Alex just assumed that we would be paying her way. 

The point of this is, we got very frustrated with Alex's behavior. I just graduated college and got a job in my dream field. I am making more money then I ever expected to in my life when I was younger ($40,000 a year, its amazing). Anyway I am coming to my hometown again to visit and to help my Aunt move in to a new trailer. When I told Jasmine and Alex what days I would be able to meet and the reason I was coming down Jasmine offered to come and help my aunt (who she has never met move) and informed me that she wouldn't really have the funds to do anything big while I was in town but would be happy to meet up and just walk around town. 

Alex did not make any sort of comment offering to help (not that I would expect it), but did comment that she did not have any money either and suggested that we go see a movie. In this thread of texts she also called Jasmine her Sugar Mama and implied that she expected Jasmine to pay the way. On top of this I am the only one with a car (Jasmine walks 45 minutes to a bus stop for work each day, and then takes an hour and a half bus, Alex has her parents drive her to and from places, and always assumes I will come pick her up even thought she lives around 40 minutes from the area Jasmine and I grew up, and Alex lives in a house that has more bedrooms then people).

I feel like I am going on and on and haven't even really touched on why I am posting. I want to take Jasmine out and treat her to anything she wants, but I don't want to pay Alex's way. Am I an asshole?",29,71,0.92

My husband's job sometimes has him go on overnight house sitting gigs during the weekend,and he takes the family's only laptop to play games on during his down time so he isn't as bored. I currently have a job, but it has begun leading to depression, sleepless nights, and overall hatred for the weekday, so I had spent all morning working on my resume so that I could find another job ASAP, but (forgetting completely that he takes the laptop on overnights), put off applying for jobs until he left for the night so I could spend some time with him during the afternoon. Before he leaves, I see him packing up the laptop and I ask him if I could have it to apply for jobs while he was gone so we could hang out more the next day (we don't get a lot of time to see each other during the week, so we try to cram it in on weekends). He says he wants to use it for games. I ask him if he could use his two phones (one of which is inactive and exclusively for games) for the night.

I had saved the money in a joint account between my mother and myself cause I was only 19 at the time and had yet gotten my own separate bank account.

So of course I get suspicious (this isn't the first time she has done shady shit like this) I question saying ""where did my loan money go"" she tells me what she did with it, as I expected. Now upon telling her that it is my money and now that I am out of her house and 21 years old she no longer has the right to watch over my money.

The day before my mother in law had said that I’m dead to her and used the word “disown” in reference to my husband. She tried to play it off as a miscommunication I asked her to leave because it was wrong and it had hurt my feelings.

She didn’t leave and an argument started. I yelled because there’s been a lot of manipulation on my mother in law’s part and I was super pissed that she wouldn’t take responsibility for it. I know yelling isn’t okay. I shouldn’t have done that.

In this argument I had to point out that she is not my step daughters mother because she’s been putting herself in a parenting role.  “Tina” is not her child, I said and before I could get to the list of parents she said “yeah you’re not her parent either”

Tina is my daughter. I’ve raised her since she was three, she is nine now, and love her like my own.

In our discussions of previous relationships, I have told her that I don't like to stay in contact with exes, whereas she likes to be on speaking terms with everyone in her life. Unfortunately, the breakup was a little complex so we didn't stop talking immediately.

Since then, we've been texting, talking, and even hung out a couple times because I'm a spineless cretin who can't stick up for himself. At this point, would I be the asshole if I decided to stop talking to her?

Edit: I didn't really want to add many details, but reading over the first couple responses made me realize that I was insanely vague. We were friends for about 7 years before we started dating.

This girl is really shy and has very few friends. She has some pretty big family issues, so the only people she really interacts with socially are her current boyfriend and her exes. I feel like an asshole to essentially rip 1/3 of her friend group away from her.

Fast forward to yesterday. My friend and I work for the same company just different departments. She asked me to have lunch with her which i said yes to but she said she wanted to go to the nearby mall as there was an event being held for a little boy who is blind and has just beaten cancer and loves fire trucks. There was a fire truck organised for him to go on and the public were welcome to come and cheer him on. 

I told my friend I really didn’t want to go to this. Children with cancer make me quite emotional and it’s not how i wanted to spend my lunch which i told her. Any way she insisted i go with her. As we approached the mall there was a very large crowd of people, i kept telling her i didn’t want to go to this but she kept saying we won’t stay for long. I should point out, i have anxiety and hate being around large groups, which she knows. 

Any way, the crowd was massive, we could barely see anything, i was being pushed by people wanting to get closer and it was just crap.

1476,not the a-hole,"Background for context

I have Spotify premium. 
I also have a best friend Steve. I’ve been letting him use my Spotify because 1. It would be $10 a month for him, and he doesn’t have a job and 2. I am always in “offline mode” so I really don’t mind that he’s using it, until recently. 

On to the story

Lately I’ve been online because I’ve been listening to new music, but every time I go on Spotify, he’s on it. If you don’t know, Spotify (the regular version) isn’t meant to have two people listening to it, so I can’t use it while he’s using it. If I try to change it to my music, he just changes it back, so it causes a “war” between us. I’ve talked to him multiple times about it. He assured me that he downloaded his music and he’s offline now, but he’s not?? 

So onto the “am I the asshole” part. I changed my Spotify password. It logged out all of my devices, including his phone. So basically it means he can’t listen on my account anymore. Again, I’ve asked him (nicely) multiple times to please go offline so the actual subscription payer (read- me) can listen to music without having to worry about him being on there. I feel a tad bit bad about it because he is my best friend, but I’m tired of him doing this to me, especially since I’ve asked him nicely multiple times to stop.

About 6 months ago, I moved from my parent’s place to a student house for college, I have 4 other housemates, we share one smal floor together (kitchen, shower, etc).


I really like living here, and my housemates have been pretty chill so far, everyone has their own livestyle. Apparently there is no space for my lifestyle here though: I’m a friendly stoner.

I’m a night owl so I mostly stay up to around 3-4 am while getting high, playing games, and generally just having a good time. I got a few noise complaints (I play some online games that really just require voice chat to play properly so I might yell a bit or laugh out loud sometimes) but all was good, everyone still liked me. I sometimes hung out and had a beer with one of my housemates who is also the guy that complains the most, so it can’t be that bad.

Last month, one of my overseas friends came to study here as well, and because housing isn’t easy to find here, I offered him to live with me indefinitely. My room and the house are tiny but I don’t need a lot of space anyway, I’m a chill guy.


Ever since he moved in I get multiple complaints a week, ranging from people being annoyed by the weed smell (We smoke inside because it’s literally freezing right now) to noise complaints from the same guy as I described complaining about our ‘noise’.  We always stop playing music after midnight, after that it’s just us watching shows, talking, some weed, and a fun time. Yes, we often don’t go to sleep until 3 or 4 am, but it’s not like we’re being loud on purpose. We make sure the TV isn’t super loud and we try to keep out enthousiasm while playing games in check.


Still, this one guy keeps complaining. He even treatened to contact the landlord because apparently we can’t smoke indoors, do drugs indoors (lol it’s just weed), I’m too loud, and having someone extra just live in one of the rooms is apparently worse than murder for some reason. He told me I need to respect the fact people work get up early for college in the morning (I have a job next to college too, big woop) no matter how quiet I think I am. If I am disturbing his sleep after 12 in any way, he’ll get pissy. 


Once again, we are not being excessively loud. Some people just need to chill. I know my lifestyle might not be a perfect match for some people, but I’m always chill and would never rat someone out like this myself.

I get that everyone has a different lifestyle but it seems unreasonable to me to ‘force’ me to stop being a night owl.

**edit: Okay so apparently I am an asshole. I don't really agree though. In case it wasn't clear from my explanation: It's a student house, not a dorm. It's like your regular family home, except we only have the bottom floor. We have a kitchen, a bathroom, a shower area, a basement, and 5 rooms where people live. Every single person living here is always welcome in my room for a talk, a beer, a joint, or whatever they want. I'm always nice to them. Maybe I understated it, but we're really not being loud at night. Especially for the last week alone, we tend to just keep our media on mute most of the time and have regular conversations. The walls might not be the fattest and most insulated things in existance but how is a conversation in another room going to keep you from sleeping? Okay it might not have been the smartest move ever to invite my friend to come live here, but I really wanted some company since I'm foreign in this country and don't know that many people yet. He makes sure to pretty much be a ghost to everyone that lives here.**

Today they had sports day, parents were invited to watch.

However last week they had a swimming day and I went to watch and because he knew I was there he didn’t participate- he insisted on sitting with me and cried whenever he had to leave my side. It is unsettling for him to have me at school. 

So I told him I couldn’t come and watch sports today because I had work - I lied 

I did go and watch his sports day, but I hid from him. I watched him so proudly and I knew if he saw me he would stop and want to just hang with me so I didn’t go over until the end of the day.

He was sad and asked me why I couldn’t come and watch because the other mums did. 

This broke my heart. I told him I was there and I had waved to him but he was so busy doing such an amazing job he must not have seen me, this seemed to cheer him up but I can’t stop thinking about him looking at the other mums and thinking I didn’t go.

My heart is breaking for him. I have no idea if I did the right thing now. AITA?",28,300,0.98

1483,not the a-hole,"My girlfriend and I are looking for a new place. Her uncle recently bought an older house and wanted us to buy it from him in a rent-to-own fashion. He offered us a negotiable rate of ~60k for a 3br and 2bathroom which is nice, but he’s hit some kinks. He gutted all the walls, added on to them, and is planning on redoing plumbing and electrical so it’s up to code. 

But that was about a year ago. Today, the walls are still gutted, the outside looks horrible, the inside needs all new walls and floors, all of the electrical needs to be done including sockets, and the cellar has black mold/animals in it. His excuse is he’s running out of money for the house , but personally I think that’s just an excuse. The rest of the family seems to back him up so I’m giving him the benefit of the doubt. Anyways, now  he’s asking us to pay for the contractor to build on the house so it gets done faster. I flat out said no, and my step mother said he *might* take the contractor cost out of the final payment if we did. 

Now I’m sitting here with my girlfriend talking about it. I’m still flat out saying no and we should just find another place that isn’t 10% done AND we don’t have to pay the contractor fees that we aren’t responsible for. She’s calling me an asshole and to give the guy more time, and paying for a contractor isn’t bad as long as he takes the payment off at the end. 

Edit: thanks so much for the help, and sorry I’ve not been here but, I’ve been following your guy’s advice and we’re talking to him. So far, we’ve decided to talk to him today about setting up a meeting between him and us.  Thanks so much you guys!",27,67,0.96

So, let's make nicknames for participants. My friend (a girl, my friend and teammate) is A, the boy (my friend and now my boyfriend) is B.

I know both of them for quite a long time. On some parties, we were talking with B and then one day he sent me a message and we started chatting. Then he took me for a trip and I knew that something was going on, but I was still unsure. After a while he told me that A had a crush on him and kept asking him to date her.  B didn't want to, because she is much older then him and because he doesn't like her so much. A now has a boyfriend (B thinks that it's out of desperation). We are now together with B.

He also may have molested my sister. 

Since becoming adults none of my siblings or myself have had much contact with these grandparents. We have no relationship with them and while this bothers my Mom, we’ve all been pretty steadfast in cutting my grandparents out of our lives. 

I had a baby a few months ago. My parents only grandchild.  About a month before, my grandmother died. My Mom is devastated by the loss of her mother and ecstatic with having a new grandchild. However she has been asking me, insisting actually, on a regular basis, that we go take my baby daughter to meet my grandfather. 

I understand that he is my mom’s only living parent and that this is my mom’s only grandchild and she wants her father to meet her. I just cannot place my daughters in the hands of a known pedophile. 

People have said well you’ll be right there with her. To me it doesn’t matter, it makes my skin crawl. But it’s gotten to the point now where I can’t keep making excuses and I’m either going to have to give in a take her to see him (which I will not do) or have a long talk with my mother about why this will never happen.

1490,not the a-hole,"So I posted here a little while ago about an argument I had with my parents that eventually led to me being kicked out of the house for a few hours. Well, it's happened again.

So I was doing some math homework in the kitchen and having trouble with it. I've never been great at math but I need it if I want to do economics, which is what I'm currently going for my degree in. After I had so much frustration with the homework I decided to sit down with my parents and have a talk about the possibility of changing my major from economics to history, something that I've always been good at. 

My parents were really opposed to this change and tried to tell me that I could do the math with a little more effort and that when I got out of school I wouldn't need to use a lot of the math anymore. I disagreed with their second point, saying that economists use a lot of math and that I'd have to know how to do advanced math and probably use it frequently. I also said that I wanted to change majors because I didn't think I wanted to do economics the rest of my life, even if I technically could do it. This went back and forth for a little while and the argument got more and more heated over time. Eventually, it got to the point where my mom was cutting my off in the middle of my sentences, mocking me, telling me that I had quit everything I had ever done in life, and eventually began yelling at me. 

When I pointed out to her that this type of behavior was wrong and that she would not tolerate it from me and called her a hypocrite because of it, she told me to ""go to hell"" and to go to my room and grounded me from a few of my things.

I went to my room and was enraged that I got in trouble for simply pointing out that my mom was being way out of line. This is when I realized that when we had had our first argument a few weeks ago where my parents kicked me out my mom had taken away a pistol that I had in my room (that had been given to me by my grandfather) without explaining why. I had been thinking of asking for the pistol back for a while and I figured that since I was already in trouble, I couldn't lose much by going and trying to get what I considered my property back. 

I went to ask for the gun and my parents refused to give it back, this went back and forth for a while and then my dad came in and forced me into my room. We had a discussion for a little while and I told him about my problems with the way my mom and how it was wrong for her to speak to me that way. He told me that he didn't think that she had done anything wrong and that they didn't want to give me the gun back because they thought I may harm someone or myself with it. Something I want to make clear is that I had no intention of doing any of that and have never so much as slapped any of my family members, nonetheless try to shoot them. The idea itself is absolutely appalling to me. 

At this point, my mom walked into my room and the argument started again. It got to the point where my mom got extremely angry and began to throw things across my room, knock things off my walls, and get into my face like she was about to hit me. 

After this, she told me to leave the house and I told her that I would happily leave if I could take everything that was mine with me. My mom refused this and told me that she was going to get a bat. My sister stopped her from taking the bat into my room, but my mom still demanded that I leave the house, which I did. I went out on the porch and called my grandparents to come pick me up.

In the meantime, my mom made my sister go and get the bat, which she had thrown into the yard to prevent anyone from using it. While my sister brought the bat back inside, my mother told me that if my sister hadn't stopped her that she would have hit me upside the head with the bat.

After a while, my grandpa showed up to pick me up, and I informed my parents that I was leaving. They didn't like the idea that I was leaving, even though they had told me to leave earlier. I got a few of my things and went to my grandparents. 

There's a little more to this story that transpired today. I went back home to collect some stuff I needed for school and in the meantime I apologized to my parents for some of the things I had said and done (I had used some strong language and points and told my mom to go to hell after she had told me to do the same). I was hoping that they would apologize for their actions too, and that we could get over it and move on. My parents never apologized though, and proceeded to tell me how I was responsible for everything that happened. My mom denied that she had mocked me and even denied that she had told me that she would have hit me in the head with the bat. The argument only got more heated until I decided to leave and go back to my grandparents. My mom told me that if I went back to my grandparents, that I couldn't come back to house again and basically that she wanted nothing to do with me anymore. Given the situation, I decided to leave in the hope that everyone would calm down in a few days, but I'm really concerned that my family may have been damaged very badly. 

So, was I in the wrong here? Also, if you'd like to help me out, what do you think I should do from here on out to repair the situation.",50,67,0.91

But today, I walked out of my gym and a cab was right there, and since it was raining I just figured to take that home. It’s about a 1.5 mile drive home, and the final price was $7. We get to my destination, and I try swiping my debit card a few times, each time not working (I’m not sure why, it was an accepted card and had sufficient funds for a $7 cab ride). 

Either way, I figure no big deal and use my American Express. As I swipe, and it goes through, the cab driver kinda rips into me a little bit, saying because I used that card and didn’t tip I ended up losing him money, and next time don’t do that to a driver. I didn’t really know what to say, so I just said something along the lines of “oh. Ok”

At the same time I don't him want to take the other dog, because 1 he's semi-homeless, 2 he's a awful owner who resorts to yelling and hitting his dogs (along with a whole laundry list of things), and 3 this dog he left is a genuinely great dog.

These dogs are his property so would I be the asshole for getting rid of it, or should I try harder to get a response from him?

Basically I got him a Switch for his birthday. But I thought it'd be funny to play a little prank on him.

Then in the original Switch box I put a couple packs of underwear.

On his birthday I gave him the box first, and he opened it and it was just underwear. Then I gave him the gift bag which had the socks and actual Switch in it.

My nephew took it in stride. Obviously he looked really disappointed at first but once he opened the bag and realized he actually was still getting a Switch he was super excited and thought it was funny. 

My sister is losing her mind though. She's told me I'm a ""borderline sociopath"", that it was a cruel joke to play on a child, etc.

1510,not the a-hole,"I'll try my best to not be biased here. I know yesterday was Valentine's day but she's strongly against that specific day for her own reasons, so it meant nothing to us. We are long-distance, and we decided to celebrate it entirely during my next visit to her. We did a long skype call instead. 

**Background info:**

- Yesterday I worked from 6:30AM (begin commute) to 8:30PM (end commute). I was busy and had a 30 minute lunch break. I texted her during every other small break I had. 
- Yesterday she went to class/work from 9AM to 6PM. She then had to read assignments from 8PM to 11PM.
- We skyped from 9PM until 1AM. 
- I had to wake up today at 6:30AM whereas she has to wake up at 9AM. 

Here's a breakdown of events: 

1. I called her at 9PM. We had a happy skype call at first; she had readings to do so I did my own stuff while she read. I told her I was tired and asked to sleep at 10:15PM. 
2. She said that was a bit too early and wanted me to stay up. I said sure, I'll stay up for you. She said she'll be done reading at 11PM.
3. At 11PM, I was barely staying awake. I saw her texting her friends and playing a phone game for a little bit as a break. This got me impatient and I told her to stop and try to hurry. She's the type to get upset/sad if I end the call if she still wants to talk, so I tried to get her to hurry and not waste time so that we can come to a stopping point. 
4. At 11:30PM, she was finally done everything. I was already a bit stressed out because I wasn't gonna get enough sleep by my body's needs and I kept myself up since 10:15PM. 
5. She needs a lot of reassurance so she kept asking me to say that I'll treat her nicely. I'm used to this at this point, but this time she asked me 5 or 6 times to repeat what I'm saying.
6. Eventually I lost my patience (my fault) and went ""okay okay can we please sleep"" and basically rushed her. Keep in mind that during this time, although I'm rushing her, I'm saying it with an expression that is a mix of joking around and annoyed. Not angry or upset. 
7. She gets upset because she hates it when I rush the goodnight routines. She gets angry at me for rushing her. She said she was literally going to let me sleep in a minute but I ruined it and made her upset. 
8. After a bit of argument I tell her that she needs to consider my time. Texting friends and playing phone games made me more rushed about it but it didn't make me angry. I told her that although I'd prefer her not to do it, it's not what's making me upset. It's her not considering my sleep schedule. 
9. She says how she does consider my sleep schedule, and that I'm the one who wanted to stay up so I shouldn't have gotten rushed about it. 
10. I apologized several times during the next hour but I didn't want to pass up my issue. I apologized but tried to get her to recognize that she should have encouraged me to go to bed. 
11. After an hour of it escalating, I decided to simply say, in a somewhat cold tone: ""We need to take tonight off to cool down. I'll call you tomorrow. I still love you, but right now we will not resolve anything and I want to sleep."" 
12. She didn't want me to sleep because she didn't want to sleep while still being upset. She was angry at me, and refused to accept any apologies or admissions of fault on my end.
13. I felt myself getting increasingly upset and impatient. So I told her ""I'm sorry, I need to sleep now. I love you, good night."" And I hung up. I sent her a long text apologizing and reassuring her (she wants reassurance, especially after fights) that I still loved her, and went to bed. 

I know I did some things wrong, but I feel like I already admitted my wrongdoings and apologized for overreacting about being tired. It makes me even more upset when she never accepts apologies and makes mountains out of molehills. I thought hanging up on her was very immature for me to do, but I was pretty fucking pissed off. 

Am I the asshole here? Even if I'm not, was there anything I could've done better? Keep in mind my reaction to being impatient was not controlled - I usually try to keep my impatience in check but I don't think I could've just prevented myself from getting impatient this time.",19,41,0.89

I put my phone down and go into guilt mode. See, my boss is my friend both at and outside of work. I don't have those in person anymore because a lot of folks moved away after high school. I know she's already going through a tough time after a bad break-up. I helped her move out, I helped her shop for new furniture, I helped her get settled in and I've been her designated driver since she drinks but I don't. I know she counts on me to be there. She's told me I'm one of the few reliable elements of her life currently. I start to feel like my choice to not help her during a family emergency is selfish.  
  
&nbsp;  
I spend the next three hours guilt-ridden, my mind going over the possible consequences over and over again until my fiance actively steps in to redirect my negative thoughts on the way to the restaurant. With his help, I put the incident in the back of my head and we have a stellar fucking night.  
  
&nbsp;  
This morning, I start work at 7:30am. She's here to run an appointment. I ask her what's wrong in her family, she says she doesn't want to talk about it. Oop. Guilt is back.

1517,not the a-hole,"Hey guys,

basically I’m a twenty something med student in a larger city. My girlfriend is studying the same as me. Because of school, I need to study four or five hours a day for around a year (not American) for a big exam in 2019. My girlfriend is in the same phase as me. 

 Now the thing is, me and my girlfriend both live at home with our parents, respectively because rents are not affordable for students. While I get along with my parents pretty well, she wants to move out ASAP. The problem is, she just earns around 600 dollars a month besides school because we need to study a lot and her family can’t help her. But with that amount she won’t get pretty far. Now the logical thing for her to do is to propose we’d move in together. And I thought about moving out to be able to have more space for me (our apartment is very small with my parents) but not because I don’t like my parents whereas she doesn’t get along with them at all. 

Now here comes the issue: She asked me to move in with her and I told her I want to live alone first. This exam time is really bad on time and I feel overwhelmed. I’m very angry all the time and my parents understand but I don’t think i could live with someone I’d always have to talk about things. Like at home, my parents support me where they can, be it cooking cleaning or what ever. Living alone, I would just have to care for myself too and clean up after myself. With her, we always would need to argue about who does what because were both in extreme stress situations. Also, i study in the morning whereas she is a night person meaning she stays up late watches shows and so on. This is already a problem whenever I sleep over at her place. At least at home I can be more free. If we’d be living together, I would eventually get used to it. But with our limited budget and this freaking exam year, I’m not myself. I’m very easily annoyed and passive aggressive. I don’t think it’s a good idea to move in with somebody during such a time. And of course I know it sounds bad to somebody you love if you tell them you want to move out but not with them at first knowing theyre done with home like her and not having the funds to do it.

1522,not the a-hole,"**Background:**

I volunteer to run D&D at a local business, and as the game master (GM), I essentially get the final say on rules, lore, and how situations play out. My job is to make try to make the game fun for everyone, myself included, and to lay out the adventure for the players. Recently one of the players, Cory, has been a little difficult to deal with, often taking the fun out of it for other players and me. He constantly argues with other players and me, gets into a foul mood when things don't go his way, cheats when his dice don't roll his way, and doesn't let others do what they want to do in game (often cutting them off).

**Incident:**

It all came to a head today after a joke didn't land well with Cory (he tried to use real-world mythology to justify an in-game action, I told him the game world doesn't work that way, he does it anyway insisting it should work, and I later present a situation where his action clearly did not work). The table enjoyed the callback, but Cory gave me the finger with the full intent of saying 'fuck you.' After several incidents, I just don't want to deal with Cory at my table anymore.

After I got home and vented my frustrations to a friend, I found out that Cory has Asperger syndrome (something Cory freely shared with my friend yesterday but never told me me). While I can empathize with the level of difficulty this can add to social situations (and I could have given him a little more patience than I normally would if I had known), I still don't think Cory should get carte blanche to pull everyone down with a crappy attitude, argue, cheat, or dictate what other players do. I'm ready to email the business owner/event organizer to let them know that I don't want Cory at my table because it's not fun for me or the other players (this would not prevent Cory from participating at other tables unless other GMs did the same).

**AITA/WIBTA:**

AITA for thinking that Cory, as an adult and choosing to participate in a social activity, should take some responsibility for his behavior (despite his AS)? And WIBTA if I emailed the business owner to express my frustrations and request that Cory not be at my table in the future?",32,131,0.95

I'm 16 and my brother's 14. We normally get on really well, but recently we had an argument about breakfast

We go to the same school, so we get up at the same time, eat breakfast at the same time etc. We're both in a hurry and pretty grumpy in the morning, so there isn't much conversation going on. The thing is, my brother is an extremely loud eater, and I have severe misophonia (my brother knows this), so it makes me very anxious to listen to him during breakfast.

 I've tried talking to him about it but he won't listen, and I can't turn on the TV or the radio to mask the noise, because the rest of our family is still asleep and I don't want to wake them up. 

Eventually I gave up and started having breakfast in a different room. This really helped, but my brother took offence to this and we got into an argument about it. I told him it's not a big deal, it just helps make the morning routine less stressful for me. He called me an asshole for ignoring him (despite the fact that I explained my side of the story to him several times). I can understand why he feels offended, but he won't listen to any of the solutions I offer him. It sounds petty but the arguments has been weighing on my mind for a while.

 I have apologised to him and told him I won't do it again but I feel that he's being a bit unreasonable as well. Also, since I promised I wouldn't do it again, I'm going to have to find another solution.

Am I being over sensitive? Are we both being over sensitive? Are there any solutions that work for both of us?

TL;DR- I have a condition that makes me anxious and annoyed at loud eating, my brother is a loud eater. We have breakfast at the same time (not as a family, just me and my brother). I started eating breakfast in a different room to make mornings easier and less stressful, my brother took offence to this. I apologised and said I wouldn't do it again, but now I have to find another way around this. AITA?

1529,not the a-hole,"  I am on mobile so I apologise for any mistakes. 
 My friend had surgery in the middle of December on her foot. She is not just in a walking boot. Since her surgery, she has been on two different opiods for pain, claiming her foot still hurts. She is the kind of person that overdramatizes everything, so me and my friends suspect she is not in that much pain and get high off of them, but she denies this. 
 Since we have gotten back to school from winter break, she will ask me to do a few favors for her because her foot hurts. When she was still on crutches, I had no problem occasionally bring her food or picking up a few things for her when I was out. I knew she was the kind of person to abuse this power, but I felt bad. 
 Once she was allowed to walk with her boot, the favors didn't stop pouring in. She would ask me to go to get her groceries occasionally and said she couldn't come because she was in pain and would actually go with her friends to get her nails done or go hang out with other people. She hardly asks other friends to help her. 
 I finally lost it when, as pretty as this sounds, she left a bunch of junk food at my apartment and when she could come pick it up. I told her I would be home at 1. She said she would pick it up at 3. Great. I took a nap and woke up at 2:30 to texts and calls from my friend. She said she was outside and NEEDED her food. Junk food. I texted her back letting her know that I was asleep and she said she was coming at 3. All she wanted to know was when I would bring her her food as if this was my fault. I told her when I walk my dog around 9:30/10, I would bring it by. She told me she would be asleep by then and I apologized and told her I can't leave because I have three tests the next day that I am studying for, but she can come get them. No response. I texted her at 9:30 and never got a reply. 
 Fast forward to 11pm. I'm at the library and my friend says shes coming home from a friend and NEEDS her food because she had a rough day. I simply told her I'm sorry, but you told me you would be asleep and I have to go back to studying. She continued to text me that I should come home to get her food. I stopped replying. 
 I know this all sounds really stupid, but stay with me. They next day, after pulling an all nighter, I have a different friend over and my friend calls me and asks for me to bring her her food. I told her that I am cooking dinner with a friend, but she is more than welcome to come by and get them. She told me she can't walk. Her foot hurts. I told her she would have to wait then. She then told me ""fine. I guess I'll take more pain meds and walk over""
 I lost it when she said that. While I should have called her to tell her this or spoke to her in person, I was pissed. I told her that ""I am sorry her foot hurts, but it's been almost two months since her surgery and this is getting out of hand. People learn to adapt after surgery. I had major surgery on my foot and I learned to deal with it. You refuse to use crutches, so you have been relying on me too much. While I want to help you because you're one of my best friends, you have other people around you and I don't appreciate being used and lied to. (I listed a few occasions she has lied while asking me for favors.)"" 
 I also told her that I did not appreciate the way she treated me in the fall when she had mono. She would always claim that I would call her and wake her up and that she needed to be selfish and sleep all the time. I get it. I've had mono. But she would send me messages on Snapchat at 2am and I would reply and then she would tell at me for waking her up. And there was one time my dog was injured under me bed and I needed help. She lives the closest out of all of my friends, so I called her at 8:30am on a school day. I got yelled at for that. 
 I'm ranting now, but I am almost done. To all of this, she told me that her doctor told her not to walk (but she refuses to use crutches) and that as her friend, she thought I would help her more, but I am not a good friend. 
 I want to help her. I really do. But being lied to and pushed around when she lays in bed and smokes and hangs out with other people makes it really hard. I am the one who always gets called a bad friend. She has excuses for all of her actions. 
 So, am I the asshole for not really wanting to help her anymore?

1534,not the a-hole,"Please be gentle, I’m more of a reddit lurker than a poster and I apologize for any formatting errors because I’m on mobile, but I really just want to hear some outside opinions on this because I feel bad about it.

So I’m a university student currently doing their third year into the field. I’d like to just quickly clear up that I’m rather antisocial with my classes—I’m here to learn, to get my money’s worth, and to get that decent GPA, not make a bunch of friends and party constantly (I usually make friends outside of my discipline).  As far as class goes, I’m not the best student, but I do give it my all.

I do have a couple friends that are in my major, and one of them I’ll call B for the purposes of this post. B and I started talking about midway through my second year (and her third year), having had a class together. We don’t have a TON in common other than our major, but it’s nice to have someone to discuss lectures with and bouncy ideas off of that understands your subject matter. I like B as a person and this is really the only thing I’ve had an issue with during our friendship. 

So the part about possibly being an asshole: 
B asked me a couple days ago (Monday) to read over/edit a paper she was writing for a class. I say absolutely, no problem, I’ll always edit or do read-throughs so long as I have at least 24 hours notice that you’re wanting me to do it (so that I can plan around my other work for my classes and/or job). She says okay, sends me the paper the next day, and I edit it and send it back. A note about editing her work: her grammar is ATROCIOUS. And by this, I mean it actually almost hurt to go through five and a half pages of work. She didn’t use the right “then/than” once, had a a bunch of missed commas and misused apostrophes, and a couple sentence fragments. Okay, whatever, right? We all have our skill sets, and obviously my writing level is higher than hers. She’s better at other types of tests. 

A couple hours later, she texts me and asks if I’d mind reading over another paper she’s done. I reply reluctantly with “well, I guess so” because I’m working on an essay for a class we’re in that is due three days later (today, actually). I explain that I’m working on my own course work and trying to get through my own essay, but she assures me that it’s only a two-page paper and she’s already revised it herself. So, wanting to be nice, and because it’s shorter, I say okay, shoot.

Reddit, this paper is almost as badly arranged as the previous one. It definitely shows that she wrote this at 3am. These papers are taking me quite a long time to revise because of *how much* needs to be corrected. Usually (or at least for myself), when you send someone your work to edit you try to see it from their point of view first, right? Try to poke holes in your own arguments, clarify any ambiguous statements. I still don’t understand about a paragraph of the text, and it’s not even like she’s writing about a subject that I know nothing about. I edit, send back, she thanks me and continued texting me (which I ignore to finish my work, which I will admit is a bit of an asshole move).

Onto today, where she texts me asking when I’m getting to campus: 
I respond “I’m here, you can come sit with me if you want, but I have a lot to do and will be unable to talk. I need to get a lot of work done before class”. She comes, she sits, it’s fine for a while (other than asking me a few times how to cite, which I explain is in the syllabus. “Is this correct?” “I don’t know, I’m busy right now, look in the syllabus”). I submit my assignment for the class we have together. B sees that I’m done that class’s work (I still had other work to do, however) and asks me to proofread hers so she can submit it. I’m super reluctant because I have work to be doing for my other classes, explain as such and that with my job and the test dates I need to get a hop on it because I’m going to have little other opportunity to. She says please, I comply.

She has obviously not edited this work at all. I get about four sentences into the introduction of this five-page essay, and am already lost. I’ve corrected at least three things per sentence, and her one of her sentences is a completely unintelligible fragment. I give it back to her and say “I’m not finishing this right now, you need to read this out loud to yourself and fix your grammar. I’m sure your points are great, but I honestly just don’t have time to be doing this level of editing on a paper right now. Honestly, it looks like you haven’t even read through this yet yourself.” She admits that she once again wrote it in the wee hours of the morning, and that she hadn’t looked it over before asking me to edit it. 


I’m sorry for the long text, but I wanted to be clear about where I stand here. It’s not that she’s asking me to edit her work, but the fact that she’s having me look over stuff that she’s obviously not reviewed herself yet, and that she’s expecting it of me when I’ve vocalized concerns about having my own work to get done. However, the tossup is that I DID offer to do it for her at the beginning of the semester, and that she HAS given me 24 hours notice (on all but the second, two-page paper). I’ll feel guilty if she does badly because I’ve said I won’t revise her papers, because I offered to and I really do like the girl. So AITA if I go back on my word and stop agreeing to edit her papers?

TL;DR: at the beginning of the semester I offered to edit a friend’s work, on the stipulation that she give me 24 hours notice before sending me papers to read through. Although she’s mostly adhered to this condition, my writing level is much higher than hers, making it a long process for me. Today she asked me to read work that she herself hasn’t even read over, knowing I had my own to be doing. AITA for wanting to tell her the deal is off because she’s asking me to read unreviewed work?

If she was planning an event with friends it would make sense for her to plan it plan the flight rooms etc and just get money from everyone. But no we’re expected to book it ourselves. As in any random flight/ random hotel. It to me defeats the purpose of going “together” if there’s a likely chance we won’t be at the same hotel or can’t get similar flights. It’s also worth mentioning that I’m already 21. I did not expect anything for my birthday and was fine with that. This friend did not do anything for my birthday and that’s cool. The problem is she expects us all to go and has told me she would be extremely mad if I don’t go. I know her as a friend and I know she’s expecting a grand gesture where we all take her out buy her drinks /money to gamble.

Also, they have already been invited, which my mom knew because she is doing the invites. She's now saying that my boyfriend ""took it upon himself to invite his family"" (like 5 people from his family) even though she was there when we made the list of people to invite. I basically told her that I wasn't going to ask my boyfriend to uninvite his family because it's too late. My parents say that if they want to come they have to pay for half of it or throw their own baby shower for us. I didn't even want to have ONE shower, much less two. I feel that it would only cause drama and hurt my boyfriend's feelings to ask them for money or tell them not to come. 

So, AITA for refusing to uninvite his family to something that I'm not paying for? Also if my step-dad refuses to let them come, would I be an asshole for cancelling the shower entirely?

1544,not the a-hole,"In college. My three friends really love going out and partying on weekends, and always want me to go with them. I used to go out with them during the first few months of this school year, but I stopped because it just wasn’t my thing anymore. I wasn’t having as much fun as I was just drinking in my dorm. (EDIT: I don’t drink alone in my dorm. I spend time with my roommate when I do this, and we normally get into some pretty interesting conversations which is why I prefer it.) I have told them before (as soon as I realized I didn’t like it anymore) that I don’t want to go out, and still tell them every weekend that I don’t want to go out with them when they ask. 

Their response when I tell them no is always “why not?” which frustrates me because I have told them multiple times my reasoning. I understand they want me to have a good time with them, and I believe they want me to experience things that they will eventually bring up later in conversation so I get their jokes and such. Yet they’ve never really gone into detail about why they want ME to go with them so badly. 

Some weekends they’ll get impatient with me and insist that I need to go out with them for them to have fun. I tell them no, but they’ll keep nagging me about it throughout the day. When that happens, I hide in my room between 7pm to around 10pm, turn my phone off/ignore their calls, and then tell them I accidentally fell asleep and my phone died. I know lying isn’t morally good in any matter, but truly they get on my nerves with constant asking. In past situations, they’ve come to my dorm and banged on my (locked) door trying to get me to come with them. I just want to know why they won’t take no for an answer and if I’m being a dick for ignoring and lying to them. 

TL;DR: my friends always want me to go out, and when i say no they keep bugging me about it. I ignore them through the night until they’re already partying without me. AITA? ",20,51,0.92

1546,not the a-hole,"My roommate Kat (age 24)and I (age 24)have been friends for 9-10 years now and recently decided to move in together with 2 other friends. Things were going well for the first 6 months or so, we even bought a dog together because we were so sure we would be living together for a while, but lately every time Kat is around I feel myself wanting to leave the room and it's leading me to believe I should move out when our lease is up. 

This is because I've noticed Kat treats me very differently than she treats others. She always speaks with a negative intonation to me; for example, when I say something like ""oh look Puppy is getting so much better at _____"" she will reply with, ""yeah, but she still sucks at this..."" I find this attitude very tiresome to be around, as I am someone suffering from depression and being around constant negativity is hard for me.

Kat also treats me like I am a child sometimes and is super critical; if, for example, Im cutting some vegetables for a meal, and doing it in a way she doesnt like, she will criticize me for not cutting it her way.

Kat is also defensive and never likes to admit she is wrong. When we get into an argument, even about small things, she will not believe she is in the wrong. One example I can think of is the other day when I told her I would be taking our dog our of town for 4 days to visit my family. We were texting about it and I said I would be taking the dog if that was okay with her and she replied with ""i guess."" then I said ""okay thank you!"" and she said ""read between the lines bro lol thats a long time to be gone."" I then gave her multiple reasons why it was a good idea that I took the dog (its only 4 days, she works a lot, she gets annoyed with the dog at bed time, etc). She replied with ""i didnt say dont take her, I was just making a comment."" Maybe it's just me, but the read between the lines comment seems like a roundabout way of trying to guilt me into not taking the dog.

So i confronted her about this and said ""come on, Kat, your comment is basically telling me not to"" and she said ""its actually not, but alright."" so I thought about it for a second and replied ""try to think about it from my perspective... what did you expect would happen as a result of your comment? what did you hope I would say or do because of that? and then think of how your message COULD have been interpretted. i dont want conflict with you Kat, especially over the dog but honestly...""

she just replied with ""its fine"". I did not reply to her and have been trying to limit our contact in real life too. It feels like that text conversation was the straw that broke the camel's back. Ive been staying in my room which is in the basement, and only go upstairs for food and stuff. I know this might sound juvenile, but I really do not know what to say to her, it's like I'm realizing shes not a good friend for me due to her controlling, negative and attention seeking behaviors. I should also mention Kat has had like 6 different roommates in the 2 years before we lived together and has had conflicts with all of them.

She does have a great side to her; when she is in a good mood, she is one of the best people to be around: happy, funny, being positive. She is also lets me use her car, and makes good food.

It made me sad to think about moving out, because I do love Kat as a friend in small, controlled doses, but I'm thinking it may be what is best for me. Our lease is up at the end of August and I'm considering telling her in the next few months that I may look for a new place to live, I'm expecting static  as we always talked about being here for 3 or so years since that when we will both be done school. Im considering moving out and cutting ties to her

My question is: will I be the asshole for telling my roommate I want to move out? Will I be an asshole if I want to cut ties to her? How do I keep the interaction positive and avoid pain or  bad-blood? ",32,74,0.93
1547,not the a-hole,"Hey

So for background, my bf used to work in the city. He would get a bus straight there and that was perfect for him. I work in the opposite direction to the city. I drive about 15 minutes to work and that's great for me. I've been telling my bf to get his drivers licence  (he's 21) for about a year now. He was working part time and so easily had the time to do it, but he wasn't bothered. 

So this week, he finds out he got a offered a better job with better pay and better hours, pretty near where I work. It's about a 15 minute drive with no traffic from where I work. I ask how he will get to work every morning and he says ""I would have to get 2 buses, but I was hoping you would drive me there every morning"". 
I immediately shut that down, telling him I would have to drive 30 minutes to bring him to work, then 15 minutes back to my work. That's 30 minutes extra driving every morning and I was not okay with that. That's not even mentioning the fact that we font live together, and so I would have to drive 10 minutes on top of that to collect him from his house.  

He was belittling the amount of time saying ""it's pretty much on your way"" and then stopped talking to me after he called me selfish. I told him that he should have gotten his driving licence months ago and it's not my fault he was too lazy to get his licence but then ignores me the rest of the day. 

Am I being unreasonable? Am I being selfish in valuing that 1 hour extra sleep every morning? 

Love to hear an outside perspective. 

Thanks.

I don't know him very well but he's a good guy. When I texted her late at night, she replied that she was in her bed. When I asked where he was sleeping, she casually said that he was sleeping beside her. Now that was kind of a shock to me. I know they used to share a bed sometimes before we started dating but I assumed that she wouldn't do that anymore. I tell her that I was uncomfortable with it and she immediately went to sleep on the living room couch.

I fully trust her but just the thought of her sharing a bed with another man fills me with unease. I kept feeling guilty all night because of it. Am I just old fashioned? Am I an asshole for not being comfortable with my girlfriend sharing a bed with another man?


Edit: Had a talk with her. She initially got a little angry because she thought I wasn't trusting her to be faithful, but then she understood that boundaries had to be set. This whole thing has just confused me about my own feelings. After reading the comments, I'm questioning whether I have puppy love for her. Maybe it'll change over time. ",122,228,0.97

1555,not the a-hole,"   Asking for my friend

   A friend of mine, D,  is turning 21 tomorrow. My best friend, E, is her roommate. Their other roommate, A, is throwing D a party. D and A are best friends. E is a close friend of A, but not on the level of D and A. A has been asking E to chip in to throw the party. She wants E to buy around $30 worth of supplies. E doesn't mind if A throws a party at their apartment, but she's more of a hang out with a few friends on the weekend and watch Netflix or bake cookies kind of person. She also doesn't really know most of the people invited to the party and there's at least 30 people coming. It's not that she's opposed to anyone having a party at the apartment, she just doesn't think its necessary to chip in because she isn't throwing it. 
   E is hesitant to tell A no because A has been saying that because it's their apartment and D is both of their good friends, she has to chip in. A has been saying this all week and it's wearing E down. She has $60 in her bank account for the next two weeks. A doesn't care. It doesn't help that their third roommate, L, who isn't really friends with the other three is agreeing with A and is chipping in, too. L is a bitch, and everyone knows it (unrelated to this situation), so everything she says, in my opinion, is irrelevant. 
   E made D a gift (she's an amazing artist) and spends plenty of time with D, so she doesn't think this is called for. She wasn't the one to want to throw the party. She simply agreed to letting A use the apartment for it. I have been telling E that this is not her responsibility, but she is still really hesitant to say no.

He never asked if he could record his album in his room or if he could conduct music lessons in his room or our living room. He just tells you it's happening. Our landlord's sister lives in the house with us in the largest room that connects to the living room. He usually has his music lessons in the living room and would wake her up.

So we stay and have a couple more drinks. I walk over to their house and take my gas can back because fuck j&c. Then I get a phone call from B asking where the gas is. I said fuck j&c they can run out of fuel for all I care. The bar closes at 1130 and we get the waitress to drive us to r&bs to get my cooler of beer and not a word was said from R&b. We left and went to another town and had a great rest of the night. A couple days later I text R and tell him I’m sad and angry and heartbroken. I told him I hope he has a deep and meaningful friendship with j&c because I can’t be friends with them anymore. He hasn’t replied and we ran into each other about a week later. He claims he tried to talk to me but I honest to god didn’t hear him or I don’t know because I have no recollection of this happening. I’m an adult an am willing to sit and discuss anything with anybody. So now B is talking to mutual friends and taking low blows at me. Insults regarding appearance and calling me other unsavoury untrue things based on the people I associate with. I don’t know who else she’s been saying these things to. I’m still not that upset because she’s always saying “I don’t judge I love everyone” and now I see the truth. I finally have the truth from her. And that’s a relief. It’s all really upsetting and I would’ve liked a response. At least a “ no you have misunderstood here’s what happened” or “ fuck you you loser” something.  But this not responding and talking behind my back is juvenile. There’s always 2 sides to the story and if they have one I’d like to hear it but I don’t think it’s on me to seek it out.

1575,asshole,"I go to a support group for people with eating disorders every week. I am pretty deep into a relapse, and it's one of the few methods of real objective support I get.

My friend, ""John"", has also struggled a little bit with disordered eating, but is doing well now. John also attends AA and NA meeting, and has a really strong support system through those programs.

John mentioned wanting to tag along to the ED support group with me, because I mentioned how it's been helpful for me. I didn't really mean it as an invitation.

So: I understand that I can't control what they do. I understand I don't ""own"" the support group and have no say over who goes. I understand that even if John is doing well, they have the right to seek more support. If John thinks it would help them, then it would probably be an asshole/selfish thing of me to say no.

However, John is doing really well with food stuff. John has other outside support. I honestly don't think they need it. I've had other friends show interest in the group, and I've been happy to have them come with, because they're really struggling and looking for support. I don't think this is the case with John though.

For me, it's one of the few places where I can speak to and listen to other people who really understand me in an anonymous setting and get objective, down-to-earth feedback. I like that it's my own thing. I like not knowing anyone there.

So, would I be the asshole?

Saturday night, I received a call from my mom (my grandma's legal power of attorney) that they were going to let her go & cease medical care. She told me that she already told my older brother, who was flying out that night from Arizona to say goodbye. He was taking a one-way flight because we didn't know when she would pass afterwards. She said she understands money is tight for me, but would like for me to fly out regardless so the family could be together. 

I received a call from my brother who told me the same news, so I told him I couldn't afford the flight from LA (where I live) home. One-way was about $400. He blew up on me:

1580,not the a-hole,"So I was just added to a group chat, a chat made specifically to discuss an upcoming event we were planning. I was introduced to a few people and we chatted a while and had off topic discussions and it was fine and all, overall good time. Well it's like 1am and I am like, gotta sleep now, see you later, and the person I was chatting with makes a big deal to the rest of the group that they are not sleeping. Whatever, not my circus. All night, every couple hours, they are up posting on the chat, random things and a lot of ""haha not asleep!"" Stuff. Again, not my circus. After a few of their friends ask them to get rest the day goes by and I pop back on around midnight. 

Now, through the day, they were making posts about not sleeping and were arguing with their friends about how they don't need sleep because they deserve to suffer and crap. This is a chat to orginize a game, with a lot of strangers, but I'm an empathetic person, they seem really unwell, I am concerned.

 It's midnight now, their friends have begged them to sleep amd themselves gone to bed, and they post to the empty chat something like guess who still hasnt slept! So I tell them, hey, thats actually really serious, going on 36 hours no sleep. It can be dangerous. Tell them they should try to rest. They reply ""im fine dont worry about me"", like, dude you obviously wanted people to worry posting it here. I reply back, how tough it is on your body to go 36 hours sleep deprived. They snap at me and say ""you dont even know me why do you care??"" 

Like dude, group chat, sleep deprivation is serious. I tell them I dont know them and I care because its serious and their friends are obviously worried for them and ask them to try to rest. They reply a long comment about how sorry they are for dumping it in group chat and being self depricating and saying well it hasnt killed me yet nobody worry about them. They seemed really put out about it and now I'm worried their friends are gonna jump me for upsetting them when they wake up, I didn't mean to scare them off from sharing really, I genuinely wanted them to know sleep deprivation is serious and know they had people caring for them.

1583,not the a-hole,"First of all, I want to clear up that this might have been the tip of the iceberg of the relationship, not that everything was amazing and I liked an ex’s pic and that cause everything to go down hill.

My gf and I had some jealousy issues going on, but since the beginning of the relationship I made it clear that I did not have any feelings for my ex and that I’m indifferent with her, but I don’t hate her because she helped me through one of the worst times of my life, while her on the other hand thinks you have to hate your ex like she does with a burning passion for you to  actually be over them. Anywhoo, she’s a big instagrammer, she takes it very seriously and posts very risqué pictures all the time and it bothers me a bit, but not enough to cause anything in or relationship. She gets hundreds of likes from thirsty guys messaging her non stop as well because of the pictures she takes and her ex’s message her and like her pics, she responds sometimes and sometimes she doesn’t. Then my ex posted a normal pic of her and a friend in a park in NY, I’m from the south so she’s pretty much gone out of my life forever, and a fully clothed, non sexual pic at all and I liked it. She screenshots it and yells at me, calls me names, etc. she then makes me unfollow her account on Instagram and to block her. Like I said, she (my ex) helped me through a tough time in my life so I don’t hate her and we’re cordial, but I have a new girlfriend who I chose to be with so I block my ex to ease her mind.

One month passes and Instagram glitches and shows I’m following my ex on ig still for some reason, she screenshots it and sends it to me and breaks up with me, calls me all these names and stuff, says her friends all agree with her, and I tell her I’m not even following my ex on ig and I totally forgot that the situation even happened. I let her login my account and my ex is still blocked on ig but she still proceeds to breakup with me because “it’s my fault for her to even feel that way with me and my ex and she can’t trust me” 

Some notes to think about: 

1) my ex does randomly text me here and there, but the texts never last more than a couple exchanges (happy birhday, merry Xmas, etc.) so maybe my gf thinks that I could still be interested in her.

2) I did tell my ex that we shouldn’t text (when my and my gf first got into a relationship) because I’m in a relationship and I showed my gf this text.

3) my ex talks about her ex ALL THE TIME (in good and bad ways) I had to tell her to stop and how I feel about it because everything that comes up that reminds her of him she has to tell me for some reason whereas I never brought up my ex once which is why I’m confused about this.

4) we both have jealousy issues as well, I get tired of guys hitting on my girlfriend all the time from the pics she posts and her not saying anything shutting them down (which I’m most likely in the wrong) and she believes I shouldn’t have any friends that are girls even my best friends that are girls way before me and her even got into a relationship.

Tonight, when this girl comes over and sees that I'm sitting on the couch she goes ""Umm I wanted to sit on the couch"". I most certainly did not move and stayed on the couch.

Then one of the guys who comes over that I actually get along with wanted to smoke so I pulled some out and the same girl and her boyfriend complain that they hate the smell of it and asked me not to smoke. I told them I would smoke away from them but that it's my apartment and I'll do what I want.

I'm just tired of a select couple of these people trying to impose themselves on me in my home when I don't even really know them.

EDIT: In all fairness, it isn’t the whole poker night I have an issue with, it’s this one couple. Everyone else who comes over, while they may not be my favorite people in the world, is pretty okay to be around. A little rowdy but nothing excessive at all.

So I wouldn’t ask them to not do it at all, but this couple is really salting my caramel.

He changed his work shift to supposedly spend more time with me, but ended up having to work even more. He works (according to him) 12-14 hours a day.  I never see him.  I saw him one night 3 weeks ago and for one hour, 2 weeks ago. He calls me for 2 minutes at a time and then says ""text me later"" or something.  Some days I don't even get that much: some days, he says he'll call me later, but never does and he'll maybe text me a bit throughout the day. I totally understand him needing to work. He is a supervisor, and says if he declines work they'll give it to someone else and he's out of luck.   It just seems like he doesn't care to talk to me anymore but seems confused when I ask him if he's even still interested in this. 

 I confronted him about never wanting to talk to me, and he got really defensive and said ""I told you I work a lot at the beginning.""   Basically, his answer is, too bad, I get what I get and it's probably not going to change, so suck it up.

My mom is much more charismatic than I am and has a lot of friends and a great social circle. Mostly this only comes up when I go visit her. My personality is much the opposite, I don't really enjoy large groups and I'm not able to be myself around strangers. I have a lot of anxiety. When I go visit her I sometimes get dragged to events she had already agreed to go to and usually feel really uncomfortable since I don't know anyone but my mom, but I get through them okay.

In the past few weeks I've been super down and stressed out, and I was really really looking forward to my mom coming to visit me tonight (Friday) and staying overnight until Saturday. We usually have a nice time and I can talk to her about what I'm going through and she tells me about her life and we just have a great mother-daughter bonding sesh.

1600,not the a-hole,"I'm 21, he's 23. We've been dating for about 7-8 months. We met through a mutual friend and we've been together since. He's been nothing but amazing and great to me, and we usually never fight. 

While we were on a date, David (my boyfriend) was trying to tell me a funny story about some kid in his class who has no friends and it somehow got into how he and his friends tease this kid by pretending he doesn't exist, making fun of him when he asks questions in class, and saying things like ""you're like the loner kid"" if anyone else does anything awkward or annoying. This is to his face.

I'm not in this class, but apparently this has been going on for a few years. David told me that the guy in his class doesn't laugh at the jokes, so I'm just assuming that he doesn't find it amusing at all. I got extremely angry at David and told him that he needs to apologize. He refused to do so in person, so he composed an apology note in five minutes and sent it to the guy on FB. 

I was really proud of David for acknowledging how wrong he was to bully someone (especially at this age) until he showed me the apology. He apologized for ""not getting to know 'the loner' better"" and that he was sorry for ""being immature and poking fun"" at him. He also stated qualities he liked in the kid, such as his work ethic and creativity to ask questions. I was really annoyed at this apology because it was extremely rushed and he just wanted to get it over with. It felt like he was minimizing his actions by saying he was just poking fun at the loner for years. 

I've asked my friends, and they agreed with me that it was a shitty apology - but at least he apologized. As someone who's been bullied before, I just put myself in his shoes and I absolutely would not accept it because it just felt disingenuous. 

We argued over what a proper apology should be. I told him he needed to address his behavior better. David said wrote the apology based on what he would want in one, but I can't help but feel like he doesn't feel that sorry... especially since in all those years he never thought about how the other guy would feel - and especially since he was so apprehensive about apologizing in the first place because he didn't want to look stupid. 

I really can't tell if I'm the asshole in this situation. Part of me feels like I am, and I'm just projecting my anger from when I was bullied. Since they're all adults, they should be able to handle it themselves right? And David already apologized, so I'm making a bigger deal about this than it needs to be since I kept badgering David. But at the same time, I just don't feel right about it at all. It makes me genuinely upset.

At first, when they started being loud, i went up there and knocked. They refused to answer the door, so I left a note saying i could hear their conversations and tv clearly, and asking if they could try to be quieter.

When that didn't work, i called residence life and made a noise complaint.

I get that living in close proximity to others comes with challenges, and more times than not, i just let the noise go if it's not crazy. But its getting ridiculous. I'm thinking about going in and talking to reslife about the issues these guys are causing.

I told them all this in the morning and 3:15 rolls around and come to find out we still need to drop the partners gf’s dog at puppy sitters across town. I say I’m leaving at 3:30 for our destination with or without them so I am not late, two minutes later they say they are ready so I finish my eyeliner and we go to take off. Turns out I misunderstood what ready meant, they meant ready to drop the dog off and leave from there, I thought they meant ready to leave for our destination. Anywhosal, I’m fuming because now I know I’m late, I really love my boss and want her to succeed and my being even 10 minutes late will stress her and put us behind. I didn’t act my best self in this moment to those in the car but I texted my boss I would be late due to unforeseen traffic and left it at that. I’ll take my lumps for misunderstanding since there was nothing to be done. 

The issue is: What I found out at the end of service from my boss was that my boyfriend texted my boss explaining the real situation and took blame. I told her I had not known and she told me she knew I didn’t know because I didn’t seem like I needed a man to send my late text for me. When I went to pick them up I was exhausted and upset. I smiled at the party but as we were leaving I pulled him aside to figure out if maybe it was a miscommunication and when I heard “be sure to text her” it was really “ I’ll text her”. He told me no, he didn’t ask, he just sent it. When I was upset by this he retorted that he had been in the industry longer and something along the lines of he’s a boss so he knows how upset she will be by my lateness. I dropped it because I could tell we were not getting to the bottom of it that night and did not feel like fuming for the entire drive home. Am I the asshole for still being upset and (I haven’t yet) revisiting the disagreement this morning? I feel treated like a child, as a boss myself in a different seasonal industry, I don’t care what the late excuse is unless it’s something major, just text me and if it’s a reoccurring problem then it becomes an issue.

1606,not the a-hole,"In about October of last year my band teacher told all of us that we would have to perform a piece of music with our respective group of instruments, and that the performance would count as our midterm grade. Now, about three and a half months on, we have had ample time to learn how to play this quite elementary piece of music. There are two people who, instead of using the multiple days in class we’ve had to work, messed around all semester, and now they are barely able to play beyond 30% of the music without error.

A few days ago I texted the main person who was distracting the rest of the ensemble, and in the text told him, to step it up and practice his music, and learn how to do what he said he was going to do three or so months ago. He proceeded to call me, and everyone else in the ensemble, both of the c-words, and call us “fat-asses, who don’t understand how smart he is.” It sounds like something straight out of r/iamverysmart. 

The whole point for this whole build up, is to ask if I’m the asshole, or aita, for saying that he is not going to play with us on the midterm.",19,59,0.92
1607,everyone sucks,"So this is a bit of a long story so I'll try to keep it short and answer any questions you may have afterwards.

So some information you may need to know to make an accurate judgement is that I'm 19 years old, work part time and go to college full time, and still live with the parents for the time being. 

So earlier today my parents told me to clean my room, which was a bit of a mess, and I complied. Once, as I was going to the laundry room back to my room I sat down on the couch in the living room to pet the family dog for a minute. In the time being, my dad happened to mop the hallway leading from the living room, where I was, to my room. So, with my mother sitting on the couch next to me, I asked if it would be ok if I could sneak into my room to finish cleaning it. My father said no, but he said it in a bit of sarcastic tone of voice and my mother laughed. I thought that maybe I was missing something, I was just trying to check to see if walking back to my room would cause too much of a mess on a newly cleaned floor. 

So, thinking that my dad wasn't being entirely serious I tried to take large steps to my room to leave as little dirt as possible and in the process I fell on my back. The first thing I heard after hitting the ground was my dad saying that I was an idiot. My mom and sisters did try to see if I was ok though. So, I got up, and told my dad that it was kind of rude for him to be so mean and asked for an apology. I pointed out that if I had said the same thing to him or my mother, I would be in big trouble and likely would have been slapped. My mother stepped in and defended him, telling me to get over it and she mocked me in the following conversation. It all ended with me going to my room.

An hour or so later, I was doing homework when my parents tried to get me to go with the gym with them, which I had twice earlier in the week. I told them I would like to get my schoolwork done instead. They did not like this and the thing soon escalated into an argument and the previous falling event came up again. I still wanted an apology, and I still never got one. It ended with me being called several curse words by my mother and her trying to justify their actions by saying that they've done a lot for me, which is true. In the moment, I tried to undermine their argument, but ended up saying that they hadn't done much for me. 

The argument only escalated from there and my mom proceeded to slam my door, knock stuff off my walls, and throw and framed picture with glass in it across my room. My dad told me to leave the house, which I did. I got a ride from a neighbor to my grandparents. I stayed there for a few hours until my father came to get me. My grandparents were mad at him for kicking me out and my dad was mad because they hadn't called him to let him know I was over there (I couldn't call or communicate with them because they had taken my phone and car keys). We argue for a bit, but my dad gives me a half hearted apology and I apologize to him. When I get home I'm told that I have to issue a public apology to the whole household, including my sisters, which I did. My parents gave no such apology and my mom never apologized at all. Afterwards they took me to my room and told me that I would now have to start paying for all kinds of stuff, even though I pay my car payment, for much of my own food, and paid for my tuition in full for college this semester. I thought that this was unfair and asked them if they were getting any similar punishments for their actions throughout the day. My mom went on a rant in which she proceeded to call my grandparents who had taken me in ""Dirty shits"". At this point I was fed up and told her to go to hell, one of the only times I'd ever said anything like that to my parents. More yelling ensued but it ended with my mother getting in my face, mocking me some more, and telling me to get out within 30 days.

Just want to know what you think about the situation in general. Who did wrong when, should I seriously try to leave, or do I have a lot of apologizing do. I've no doubt I have some things to apology for that I did today, but I don't think that I'm the only one who did something wrong today.",16,30,0.85

It is coming up to his 1st birthday and now she is being very vocal about not wanting people to give him gifts and instead wants cash. 
My point of view is that gifts are the way that we build our relationship with him. I am willing to give her cash for her birthday for his college fund, but I feel that if she accepts cash we should be allowed to give him a gift.

Let me make this clear, I don't do this excessively. When I coast my car is still going at a decent enough speed to carry itself to the lights. If I start from a green light and there's another red light a couple hundred meters away, I will not speed up towards it. It does make sense accelerating from a red light to 70 kph only to hit the visibly red light a couple hundred metres away.",37,39,0.91
1611,not the a-hole,"I’m getting married in 2.5 months and am currently on my way back home from my bachelorette party. All of my friends had a great time, got along great, and made sure I had a great time.... except for my “best friend”, the maid of honor.

During the bachelorette weekend, the MoH was constantly picking at me and everyone else and pretty much refused to say anything that wasn’t a sarcastic/snide/rude comment. This culminated two nights ago when I had had enough and told her (a bit snappily) that I’d appreciate it if she would be nicer to me and everyone else. She yelled, “Fuck you, you fucking bitch,” stormed out, and left early. The day we all had together after she left was honestly the best day of the whole trip.

Our relationship has always been.... odd. We’ve been friends for twelve years, making her my oldest friend by one year. We’ve had multiple discussions about how draining her negativity is on me and (on her side) how I need to deal with her sarcasm better. We’re typically fine over the phone and have had a long-distance friendship for five years, but almost every time we’ve hung out in person for the last couple of years, I’ve been getting progressively more miserable. Which is unfortunate, because she knows almost everything about my family situation, career path, etc. and I enjoy discussing our lives. But she also gets jealous when I hang out with my other friends or talk about my fiancée, which is weird.

Anyway, after she blew up at me and has not been even a little bit helpful in the wedding-planning process, I’m seriously considering either demoting her or removing her from the bridal party altogether. I’d replace her with who I think is my actual best friend- a girl who I’ve been friends with for 11 years and has always been kind and supportive. Of course, I am going to call my current MoH to try to understand her side of the story, because I honestly have no idea what it is.

So with that said, WIBTA for demoting my MoH?

Some background:
Last year, my boyfriend and I had this huge fight about him talking to his ex, because they were talking about their relationship when they were together, and texting at 3am, among a couple other inappropriate things.  
Today, while using his phone, his ex texted. (His messages pop up automatically). I asked him why they were talking again, to which he got all tongue twisted and couldn't answer me with a straight response. He said ""nothing's going on"". Okay, well if nothing is going on let me see the texts between you two...Long story short: she was texting him about her dreams of him and they are dating ""like it was in high school""-her words. (Folks, we graduated in 2004 okay, get over your high school reminiscing.) her dream consists of them having sex somewhere, they have kids, but his ""crazy ex"" comes in, etc. Not only that, but she was bringing up their past relationship any chance she could, and he went along with it. I got upset because him and I agreed last year, we weren't going to talk to our exes  anymore, so why is he if ""nothing's going on?""

Anyway, he got mad at me for even thinking there is anything there and I'm just over reacting. 

Who is the justified asshole here, my boyfriend, or me?",26,49,0.96
1616,not the a-hole,"Background: I work at a small business-oriented hotel in a part of town that isn't the best. We're like .5 miles from section 8 government housing and we sometimes get drug addicts coming in here to try to do whatever it is they do (we've found people passed out with needles in their arms in the bathroom before). I also live in an illegal state, but I smoke weed regularly at my house/in my car in front of my house (this is relevant).  

Yesterday 2 guys came in that I know weren't staying here (I check almost all of our guests in, and business is very slow right now so we only have people in 5 or 6 rooms right now) and they both went right to the bathroom. Our bathroom is just a single toilet and sink so I thought it was pretty weird that they both went in there but I'm a girl and have gone into the same bathroom as my friends before so I let them be. They were in there for about 15 minutes, and I was about to go knock on the door and ask them to leave when one of our guests came down to try to use the bathroom. When the guys heard the door handle rattle they left like right after that, and I went in there to see what they were doing. There were cigarillo guts (tobacco) all over the floor and in the toilet, and there were weed flakes on the sink counter, as well as a very strong weed/smoke smell indicating they smoked a blunt. I called my boss but since they left he couldn't really do anything, and I figured they wouldn't come back because who would be that stupid?

Anyway, today they both came back. One of the guys came in our side door and went right to the bathroom so I couldn't see him, and one came in the front door. I immediately told him that he needed to get his friend out of the bathroom and get off the property. They were hesitant to go but eventually they left, and they walked around our parking lot for a few minutes. I called the lady who works at the hotel next door (my boss owns both hotels) cause they were standing in between them, and we shooed them off. They took off running into the woods behind the property, and she told me to call the cops (my boss also told me to call the cops if I saw them again). So the cops got here and I gave them their descriptions and told them which way they went. I had good descriptions and the way they went is pretty straightforward, so I would guess that they wouldn't be that hard to find. 

So here's my issue. I'm a frequent smoker, and obvious proponent for legalization. Since I work here, I know it's my job to enforce the rules, but I feel like calling the cops on them makes me a hypocrite. I would have been fine just shooing them off the property for trespassing, but since I gave the police their descriptions I feel like they're probably going to get arrested for having weed as well as trespassing. I just feel bad, because I don't think weed should be illegal, but also I would never be stupid enough to go into a hotel I'm not staying at to smoke weed in the bathroom literally right next to the front desk. Am I the asshole here? I was just following rules. I would be very upset if the cops were ever called on me for smoking weed, but also it is illegal, so that's a gamble I'm taking.

Now, this time I'm planning to pay for all of it on my own, but I looked at the number recently and it looks expensive as fuck.

I've told them not to call me during work hours unless it's a life and death emergency.  

This led to the following exchange:  

Me: What's up?  
Her: How are you?  
Me: Fine. What's up?  
Her: Everything ok?  
Me: Yes. What's up?  
Her: Ok. Because you sound upset.  
Me: I'm working right now. What's the emergency?  
Her: Just calling because I needed to vent. Do you want to call me back during your lunch?  
Me: I can't, I eat lunch with my boss and we're discussing business.  
Her: Ok. I'll call you later.  
Me: Just text me.  
  
Another common occurrence is the 5:01 pm phone call because they know when I leave work. Then they're shocked when I'm not on my car heading home already.  

When it became clear that these friends were going to just call me up at work just because they were bored, I started ignoring phone calls. That led to this exchange:  

After an ignored phone call she texts me, ""Call me back ASAP. 911.""

I respond, ""What's the emergency?""  

She calls again and I ignore it.  

She texts, ""Need to talk, pick up.""

I write back, ""Busy now. Let me know what's going on and I'll see if I can get away to call you.""  

She calls again and I let it go through to voicemail.  

""I can't take personal calls at work unless it's an emergency! Stop calling my phone!"" I respond.  

""Call me as soon as you can..."" She replies.  

Another, it's gotten to the point where I can't even post on Facebook that I have a night off, because then I'll start getting texts from her, ""So I saw you're free tonight. I need groceries if you can swing by tonight and pick up some things for me, I'd really appreciate it, thanks!"" She's also an unemployed serial work hours caller.  

Recently one of them snapped at me saying that even outside of work hours I was very snippy on the phone (yeah, I get a few hours to read in my sweatpants and you call me up either wanting something or keeping me on the phone complaining to me for three hours) and that I was acting like an asshole. She said, ""You know, not every time I call you is an emergency. Sometimes I just want to talk to my friend.""

1623,no a--holes here,"I’ll try to keep this short. I had a job interview today at a local bank. I was contact by a recruiter last week and we had done a phone interview. At the end of the phone interview, they told me they were doing open interviews at a nearby branch between 9-12pm and to come in during those times. He also emailed me this information to confirm it.

When I got to the interview at 10pm, one of the reps said I was scheduled for 9am. I apologized for misunderstanding, as I was under the impression to show up anytime between 9 and noon. The rep said she apologized for the miscommunication and it was not a problem.

After the interview I called my SO to let them know how it went. I mentioned the miscommunication thing, making a joke that maybe I shouldn’t work for a company that gives their interviewees wrong information.

My SO told me that this is a standard business practice that companies do to ween people out. He said I should’ve showed up at 9am because that’s when the interviews started. I argued with him, saying that if they wanted me there at 9 I would’ve been scheduled for 9, not this whole open interview thing between 9-12. Basically the whole argument continued with him saying that all office jobs do this and that I should’ve shown up earlier, and my argument was that they should’ve told me to be there at 9, and there would’ve been no way for me to know I HAD to be there at 9 on the nose.

It basically ended with both of us calling the argument there before it got worse and hanging up. But it was such a stupid argument to begin with.

1636,asshole,"It's not that I'm *not* a people person, I love people and I genuine value time with them. However, people do drain me and I can only handle interaction in smaller doses than average. I'm very sensitive to other's ""vibes"", as well as intuitive about a person's character and selective of who my energy goes to, simply because I don't have a lot of it.

These 3 people talk to *everyone*  and never stop talking. Ever. I bet they talk in their sleep. They're all super sweet but a couple of them I think are just leeches. Other people see them as caring and friendly of everyone while I see them as trying to pull in as many people they can to maintain a constant source of energy/attention. 

1. While he is the least chatty of the three, he stresses me out the most. He has some kind of mental disability like severe autism or high functioning borderline retardation of some kind. So it's not his fault. But the way he says my name or greets me literally makes me dread coming to work. He yells, ""UhLYSSA!"" Really loud like my mom just caught me doing some shit and follows with, ""How are ya?"". I'm a very jumpy person and super sensitive to noise...this scares the shit out of me and pushed me over the edge when I was trying to calm myself from a panic attack. I know I'm such a pussy snowflake anyway but this shit would *still* annoy the fuck out of me even if I wasn't.

2. Let's call her B. B is an older lady and reminds me too much of my late aunt who's a bipolar addict and some other family members...who are also either bipolar, addicts or both. She's so sweet, too sweet. Never says anything mean about anyone ever and looks like a cute little old lady. Even buys me snickers from time to time. However, she literally never shuts the fuck up and butts into conversations that don't include her at all, even ones she can't relate to. If she's not talking, she'll sit somewhere in the corner or behind you and you can just feel her waiting to be acknowledged all sulky and shit. If you make the mistake of listening to her when she's talking about how hard her life is, she'll forever make you her ""go to"" person for sympathy. I can't stand her because I feel like this ""sweet lady"" act is just a manipulation tactic to lure people in and suck the life out of them. I grew up around people like that and my natural instinct is to just avoid and ignore the fuck out of her. One time she asked me how my Christmas was, just to coax me into asking about hers. I told her it went fine and didn't ask about her Christmas, she still proceeded to tell me how lonely it was for her and that she was sad she couldn't go see her grandchild in Virginia. Her daughter bought her a plane ticket though and she decided to move all the way out here for practically no reason or vague reasons. So I just said, ""That sucks."" And turned the TV up.

3. S is clearly an addict and not even recovering. I can barely ever understand her because of her slurred Spanish accent until she starts talking shit about dark skinned  ""Mexicans"". While racist, she's actually pretty nice and if she didn't talk so much, I'd  like her better. I can tolerate the racism only because my family is also like that so I guess I'm just desensitized to it, they're Hispanic too. However, what irritates me is that because I'm light skinned, she assumes I subscribe to her way of thinking and tries to ""commiserate"" with me. My family didn't teach me Spanish so when someone spoke it to me, I asked S to translate, she did and later said, ""Why can't those wetbacks speak English like us?"" As in, we're ""classier"" Hispanic people because we speak English. 

Anyway, everyone loves them but I wish I didn't have to see them at work anymore.


UPDATE: This shitpost is still getting responses from time to time so I thought I'd come back to it to let new comers know that my perspective has changed. They're all still somewhat annoying in their own ways just like anyone else is but I've actually come to like them and consider at least B someone dear to me. I think a lot of my frustration and judemental attitude indeed came from personal issues I had with family and unfortunately I projected that onto these random people. I was definitely the asshole.

1638,not the a-hole,"I know this sounds super petty, and it is.  An argument hasn't broken out about this, but I have expressed my annoyance but not in a serious way, and I'm wondering if I should. 

My boyfriend and I both enjoy gaming, mostly on PC. We both have desktops and Steam accounts full of games, but we aren't often into the same games except for some overlap here and there. However, our relationship is long distance, so I can't bring my desktop with me when I visit him (I do winter vacation trips to his place). Instead I bring my laptop which can't hold many games due to lack of space or play any graphically demanding ones, especially not the ones I've been really into lately.

My bf's PC has no independent graphics card; the kinds of games he plays don't require one really (he likes grand strategy, 4X, RTS). The games I've been playing recently on my PC are pretty graphically demanding, so much so that his PC wouldn't be able to handle them, so just opening my Steam account on his PC and installing my games isn't really an option. 

So the last few times I've been at his place I've gotten pretty bored at times due to not having access to my desktop. Well, I got a Nintendo Switch this Christmas with a couple of games. One of them I've been playing pretty non-stop having a blast during downtime when my bf and I aren't otherwise hanging out.

When I brought the game out at his place, he kind of teasingly shat on things he doesn't like about the game while watching me play. Then hours later decided he wanted to play as well, so I let him, thinking he doesn't like it that much and just wants to mess around a bit. Then he got pretty hooked on it too and has started playing whenever I fall asleep first. Ok, I'm asleep. That doesn't bother me. But then he starts playing when I have just woken up or grabs the controllers when I step away for a moment. 

The reason I'm annoyed is because he has his PC full of games that he uses daily right in front of him and while I *don't* have access to many of my games and other applications I use except the ones that can run on my laptop/his PC, yet he wants to play my Switch and the games I got for Christmas which is most of what I've been using for downtime entertainment since we can't entertain each other 24/7. 

It seems we're both engrossed with the game right now. I get the feeling of really wanting to play something that you're enjoying and finding addicting; it can make everything else seem uninteresting, so the Switch game we're both attached to is probably more appealing to him than his whole library right now. But I feel like I really do have nothing else to do but surf the web when he's playing my Switch and he's not recognizing this. 

Am I the asshole for being irritated by this?  Am I selfish for it? I'm pretty sure if I did have my desktop and he wanted to play my Switch, I'd be much more cool with it, as I wouldn't be relegated to PCs that have nothing I want to play or do on them. 

TL;DR: Switch with a few games is all I have for entertainment while at my boyfriend's house for winter break. Boyfriend has access to his whole Steam library but wants to play my Switch instead, leaving me with nothing to do at times and it annoys me, but telling him he can't seems selfish. AITA?

1640,asshole,"So I'd been dating my girlfriend since September, coming up on four months this week. We've had problems in the past, and it's honestly been a pretty rocky relationship because we're horrible for each other and want different things out of life (she wants a successful career as a baker, I run a small business and am glad to break even and don't need fancy things, she wants a house and two kids and a white picket fence, I want to start and live in a music venue, she wants a husband with a 9 to 5 stable job, I want to produce peoples' music and am okay with being broke sometimes, she's asexual, I have a very high sex drive, etc). Honestly we've even taken a couple of breaks (never a good sign in a 3 month old relationship).

ANYWAYS, so last night was New Years' Eve. I've only actually been dating someone on NYE once and it was in high school, and I was excited about the prospect of being able to kiss someone at midnight and all that, but she ended up not even hanging out with me on New Years Eve and going out with friends instead. I texted her a kissy face at midnight and she responded with a generic ""Happy new years"". I asked if I was even gonna get a kissy face back and she responded ""Not likely."" 

This morning, I found out from a friend that she had been hanging out with a guy friend and cuddling up to him during the party they were at. Nobody could verify it and she denied it, but one friend said he thought he saw them kiss at midnight. I messaged her and said ""I heard about last night. We're over. Don't text me."" because honestly I had been kind of wanting to break up with her but I'm really bad at that kind of thing. Am I the asshole in this situation, knowing that I don't know for sure what happened at the party and knowing that she is asexual and doesn't really enjoy kisses? ",39,135,0.91
1641,not the a-hole,"Ok, so this has been bothering me a lot. Previously our relationship had been pretty good, we've had our differences and fights but we always bounced back. This changed when she started to have issues at home, causing her to be colder and unforgiving of mistakes in general. I tried to be supportive and understanding, but I didn't have any clue how to help so I wasn't able to contribute much. This started to make her resent me in a sense. 

It started with her comparing me to her more mature friends, and asking me why I as someone in my 20s couldn't be as reliable or as mature as her friends who have already established a career and a family. I told her it wasn't a fair comparison and she told me that this was the kind of person she needed right now in her life, not me. I tried to shrug it off and be a better partner, as well as change for her, in the sense that I had to grow up faster. However no matter how hard I tried and how fast I grew, (or at least by my judgement), it wasn't enough. There would always be a failing she'd pick on. 

Admittedly, this made things really difficult for me and I found myself snapping a lot more and just keeping my distance. Things picked up for a while when I managed to finally help her by working a part time job and partially supporting her through that pay, and for a while I thought things were fine. Then she told me that she didn't think she loved me, or was just incapable of feeling the emotion of love. At the time, once again, I tried to shrug it off as nothing and told her that I would be here until she figured things out, but then things got bad again, and I found myself hurt, bitter and resentful about everything. In a sense, I felt unappreciated by her. I wasn't expecting flowers or songs of praise, but I was hoping to at least still have the assurance that I was a meaningful part of her life. We fought again recently because I picked up my smoking habit again due to the stress of working a job and studying for Uni. Harsh words were exchanged and while I patched things up, I'm really not sure if I want to keep going on. This is also complicated by the fact that as of now we have different goals in life, goals which changed after the change in circumstances. I still love her, but I don't know if I should. But obviously I would feel bad because she's going through a lot of shit, and I'm really not exaggerating on that. It's really bad.  

TLDR: the relationship is strained because of her family issues, I don't know if it's right for me to be unhappily loving her, or to be selfish and choose myself over her.

I posted two pictures of me and him at age 16 and 18 in a group chat saying “do you ever look at old pictures and wonder why you wasted so much time”. One of his friends has seen this and started messaging me calling me disrespectful, I replied normally at first saying I don’t want to stop people being friends with him but I will never like or respect him. She’s escalated to personal things such as calling me a cunt. 

I think I shouldn’t have posted the pictures but it was a private group chat, it wasn’t public like Facebook or twitter. I don’t think it warrants being called a cunt or being attacked, after all it’s MY feelings about MY relationship which I believe was a waste of time.

1665,not the a-hole,"  Throwaway. Sorry for any typos. I’m on mobile and pretty mad right now 

   Let my preface this by saying me and my brothers are all in college this year. Well one of them took a gap year to play hockey. Last year, they were seniors in high school, so they were still at home with my parents and being 100% supported financially by them. Clothes and electronics (laptops, new Xbox) and all. For the past three years since I’ve been in college, I’ve been in college, I've been financially dependent on them for my plane ticket home from school, my phone and food when I'm home. Everything else I get is paid for by a student loan that I have to pay back. 
  Last year for the holidays (we don't really do Hanukkah or Christmas, just a random day where we give eachother a few presents), my brothers got Calvin Klein winter coats, Lululemon clothing, $200+ cologne (they were 17!!!) and new phones. I got a pair of socks and a graphic shirt. I shit you not. I'm not trying to sound ungrateful for getting something. I honestly didn't care if I got anything at all. I just felt like shit watching them open all of those nice gifts and then I got socks and a shirt.  
   It was an awful feeling because one of my brothers (the one taking the gap year) is the obvious favorite in the family and everyone including friends and extended family know it, but my mom refuses to admit it. He gets whatever he wants throughout the whole year including really expensive designer clothes and brand new hockey equipment which is upwards of $1000 for the skates he uses. If he does that get what he wants, he gets nasty and violent. 
   This year, my mom asked me to go shopping for present s with her and I refused because I went with her to buy all of my brothers presents last year and spent hours finding the perfect stuff for them and got nothing in return. I didn't need anything over the top, just a little more effort than socks. 
   So I called my mom out on what happened last year and she went off on me about how I'm ungrateful and how I'm gonna a put her in her grave and that she does everything for me and how she has no money. I fucking lost it. I mean every now and then she’ll buy me a new dress or a new phone case or something like that if we are out shopping together, but I never DEMAND she does it. She does it because she’s my mother and she’s being nice even though I cpuld buy those things for myself. And my parents dont live paycheck to paycheck but they definitely struggle sometimes. Yet she buys such expensive shit for my one brother all the damn time and if anyone in the family calls her out, she explodes. She just visited him at a hockey tournament in Arizona for a week (we live in NY and she flew and booked a resort hotel) but then we struggle to have food in the fridge. 
   I don’t need to get gifts from her for the holidays. I really dont care. I just find it unfair that she gets my brothers such nice things then makes up lies for why she wont get me anything nice. It just makes me feel like she does’t care about me as much if that makes sense. I’ve told her this, but her response is that I’m a spoiled bitch and I’m going to put ber in an early grave. 
   So, reddit, am I the asshole for calling out my mom?

A waitress walks past and I ask her quietly if she could ask him to turn down. I could've said that to him myself as he was so close but I felt awkward about it. The waitress said she would go and get her manager. 

The manager comes to our table and says she cannot ask him to turn it down as it is his right. She said that it's the same as a baby crying. I admit that this is a bit argumentative of me but I said that I thought it was a bit different to baby crying as obviously a baby does not have a volume adjuster or headphone jack. She agreed with me but said she still couldn't do anything. She offered to move us to a different table. I declined as we were pretty close to finishing our meals by that time. I thanked her and she walked away. 

The guy glared at me until we left. 

Am I the asshole? I'm trying my best to not be high strung and go with the flow but clearly I need a lot of improvement. ",58,85,0.98
1673,not the a-hole,"About 2 years ago, I moved in with my grandma due to coming on some hard times.  My female cousin (Lisa), has also lived here for about 9 years with her 10 year old son (Chris).  Some background.. my grandma's house has always had an open door policy, many family members have lived here throughout the years with no questions asked.  Lisa and I get a long ok, but has always resented me for taking over her sons playroom.  A little more background on Lisa -- she is a very spiteful person who has grudges with just about everyone in the family.  She also likes to use her son as a pawn to get what she wants, and if something doesn't go her way, she threatens to leave the house and take her son away, which greatly upsets my grandma because it's her youngest great grandchild and she loves that kid.  So because of this, everyone walks on eggshells around her and is terrified to get her upset, or else she'll leave and take her kid away.  Oh, also, she doesn't pay any money to live her, my grandma does all her laundry, she doesn't cook for her own son, and she pretty much just lays around all day.  It's a pretty messed up situation.

The room that I moved into 2 years ago was my little cousin (Chris) playroom.  He has his own room separate to this room.  The playroom (my current room) had a couch/futon in it that Chris occasionally used, but mostly he stayed in his own room.  When I moved in, I started using the futon to sleep on. 

My grandma has been sick, and she is getting a hospital bed in her room, so I will be taking her old bed.  I came home yesterday, and apparently Lisa told my grandma that she says that I owe her $400 for the futon that I've been using for the past two years.  According to my family, she told them she paid $220 for it when she bought it. When I started using it, it was already about 6 months old.
I was a little upset at first, that a faimily member would want to charge someone for using a piece of furniture, something that I would never do.  I told her that she can have the futon back, and she said she doesn't even want it anymore. 

After giving it some thought, and realizing that I did move in and kind of take over her son's playroom, I told her that I understand that, and I offered to give her $200 for it.  She said that was an insult and did not accept the money.  She took her son and went to a hotel, saying that she doesn't want to be in a house with me anymore.  My grandmother was crying, and since she was sick, she thought she'd never see her great grandson again.  This is typical of Lisa, like I said, she threatens and does this stuff in order for people to take her side.

I'm a pretty laid back person and although I didn't think I owed her anything since she doesn't even want the futon back, to keep the peace I still offered her the $200.  My whole family is on my side with this, but won't say anything to Lisa's face because they are all scared of her for the above mentioned reasons.

I feel like I am being extorted by my own cousin for $400 for a futon that she doesn't even want anymore.  Am I the asshole?",22,76,0.96

1678,not the a-hole,"I'm 25 now, and when I was 13, I fell and knocked out my front tooth, and had to wait until I was an adult and my jaw finished growing to get a permanent replacement implanted. Over the last year or so I got the implant installed, with the actual false tooth only being installed a few weeks ago. I personally didn't really care if it got replaced or not, but my parents insisted that it needed to be done and bankrolled the $5k+ process to get it done.

Apparently, when the tooth was first knocked out way back when, the oral surgeon should have put some artificial bone under my gum to give the implant something to be drilled into, but they did not. As a result, the implant had to be angled back a little. Long story short, this resulted in a noticeable gap between my front teeth, more than wide enough to fit a quarter between all the way up to the gum. This does not matter to me, and I'm happy with the way that I look (I was even without a tooth but that's in the past now.)

Upon seeing the implant and the new gap, my parents and grandparents all insisted that I get THAT fixed as well, even though I made it very clear I was happy with my mouth and didn't consider it necessary. A few days ago my mother made me a dentist appointment without my knowledge, intending to get an impression of my teeth and explore options for getting the gap fixed. I told the dentist that I was happy with it and didn't particularly want the gap to be closed. Doing so has upset my mother very much, and now she doesn't want to talk to me. I've been called ungrateful and rude, and I feel like it doesn't matter to her or any of the rest of my family that I am happy with MY mouth and don't need or want to go through more appointments and procedures just to 'fix' something that isn't broken.

1692,not the a-hole,"I walk the stage for my Associate's in May; before I head to a University and start my journey towards an Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering.

It was hard getting my associates because I struggled with depression (caused, a majority of the time by my psychotic, narcissistic mother and her  behavior). 

In the course of my lifetime, my mom has physically abused me, emotionally manipulated me, and gaslighted me. 

She's ruined every romantic relationship I've ever been in, chasing each guy off within a few short years. 

Things she's done to me within the last two years, in chronological order:

- Alienated me from my sibling by pitting us against each other.
- I failed a math class(took the advanced course over the following summer, passed with a B), and she stormed into my room drunk and told me that because I failed I was a disappointment, that I clearly wasn't smart enough for my major, and should just drop out.(April/2016)
- During that same drunken rant, told me that she loved my brother more ""because he isn't in her face all the fucking time"". (April/2016)
- During that same drunken rant, she also told me if she could, she'd have had my brother first and then gotten sterilized. (April/2016)
- Threw 3 full glass jars of pasta sauce at me, which shatteted as they hit the ground, showering me with broken glass and left me bleeding, taken dry goods out of the pantry and thrown them at me, then proceeded to **grab my face, drag me close to her, whisper ""I wish I could hurt you"", before bouncing my head off of our refrigerator**. Why? Because I wanted to use my own money to buy McDonalds(September/2016). 
- Stormed into my room, held me down by my ponytail, and punched me around my head, face, and back because my ex hadn't paid her the rent he owed her. (Jan/2017)
- Charged me because I told her I couldn't do something she wanted me to do on her timeline, she caught me by the hair, and ripped a two inch section clean from my scalp. (Thanksgiving/2017)
- When my dad grabbed her to stop her from hitting me, she bit down on his arm, and broke the skin. She pulled away, slapped the gray out of his hair, and then threatened to have us both tossed into jail for touching her. (Thanksgiving/2017)
- Accused me and my dad of having a prolonged, sexual relationship behind her back(he's my biological father)(Thanksgiving/2017).
- Denies having told me to drop out of school, and attempted to gaslight me. (Dec/2017)

Basically, I'm done with her shit. I don't want her in my life anymore, therapy hasn't worked(she just lies to them and makes herself out to be the victim), reasoning hasn't worked, compromise hasn't worked, and I'm done trying. I honestly don't have a need, or a want for her constant, overwhelming drama.

I have plans to go No Contact when I leave for College in Fall/2018, but my Dad still wants to make things work, and wants to uphold the ""happy family"" facade.

I don't want her at my graduation, especially given that 1) she told me to drop out, and called me stupid. Its clear she doesn't/didn't support my efforts to get an education, 2) she thinks me and my dad are having sex behind her back because he protected me from her beating the shit out of me. 

Am I the asshole for not wanting my psychotic, narcissistic mother at my graduation? Is it easier to just invite her and then go no contact when I leave for college? I know there will be some blowback from this, because thats just how she is, and I'll have to live with her until atleast August 2018.

1694,asshole,"I will refer to my two friends as E and J. I apologise in advance as this is quite a long one.

 
First, a little backstory:

 
E, J and I have been friends for around 6 years. We were a trio up until E and J fell out about 6 months ago. The reason they fell out was a whole other drama in itself, but basically can be summarised as E being unhappy that J was ‘ditching us’ for a new boyfriend. In actuality, J had only asked to rearrange a girls night so she could see her boyfriend that night instead. The whole thing was blown out of proportion and as a result, E no longer wanted to speak to J, but I stayed friends with J because… well, why wouldn’t I? I know they had a big falling out over messenger in which some pretty harsh comments were thrown back and forth, but I made it clear to them both that I wasn’t going to take sides.

 
Fast forward to last Friday night. As I said, I’m still friends with both E and J even if they won’t talk. If I’m honest, I’ve always been closer with E and she lives in the same town as me, so I have spent more time with her in the 6 months since the trio broke up. However, it was J’s birthday last week which I wasn’t able to attend, so I invited her to my flat for a takeaway and drinks.

 
A little into the night, J told me her dad had died earlier in the week. J had a weird relationship with her dad; she was basically raised by her grandparents and rarely saw either of her parents, but he was still her dad so she had some very mixed emotions about it. We discussed it a little, but almost as quickly as J had brought it up, she changed the topic.

 
A short while later, I went to the bathroom and when I did, I sent E a message letting her know what had happened to J’s dad. E and J have had fallings out in the past, but part of what always brought them back together was when one reached out to the other after some emotional event that made them forget their falling out. I will admit at this point, I was being selfish in hoping I could get the two of them talking again. I also felt E ought to know, and that it might make her realise how insignificant their falling out was in the first place. *This is where I first evaluate my Asshole Status.* In retrospect, if J had wanted E to know about her dad, I’m sure she would have told her herself. I am an Emotional Drunk, but I can’t 100% use that as my excuse.

 
At first, E and I exchanged empathetic comments and she seemed 100% ready to forget about what had happened and reach out to J herself. However, at this point in the evening J and I made the decision to pick up some more alcohol so we left my flat. In the 20 minutes it took to go to the shop and back, I returned to a tirade of messages from E.

Here’s the message trail: https://imgur.com/gallery/mf7rt

 
At this point I confessed to J that I had told E about her dad. J asked to read over the messages, which she did. Her feelings were she had no interest in E reaching out to her and was annoyed that, in her words, E felt that I shouldn’t be hanging out with other people. J asked me not to give E her number. Frankly after the messages E sent me, I had no intention of giving her J’s number anyway. We continued to enjoy the rest of our night until J went home.

 
Mine and E’s conversation ends at my last two messages. Neither of us have said anything since Friday night. I’m conflicted, because I have a bad habit of taking 100% of the blame in situations like these and part of me wants to message her again with another, more in depth apology. At the same time, I feel E has blown this out of proportion just like she did to J 6 months ago, and I’m hurt by the comments she made about the two former friends who I no longer have any contact with (I haven’t for several years, so I feel like E was reaching to make that dig at me).

 
So, *am I the asshole*? Should I just suck it up and reach out to E, or am I right to feel she overreacted?

**EDIT: Thank you everyone for your comments. I seriously appreciated all of them, the “yes” and the “nos”.**

After considering everyone’s advice, I made the decision to send E and J two separate apologies.

I apologised (via messenger) to E for putting her in a shitty situation, and let her know I had passed her condolences on to J. I also said I couldn’t force her and J to be friends and I would be more mindful of that moving forward. No response yet. 🤞🏻

I apologised to J for telling E about her dad without her permission. To be honest we’d already discussed it on Friday night, but we were drunk and I wanted to send her something more sincere. She said she was surprised I brought it up again and that she was completely fine with the situation. So it seems like it’s only me still dwelling on the situation, ha.

But I did say that she and my sister were still more then okay to go if they wanted to, but I didn't really want to go.

She then canceled on going to the Christmas lunch on behalf of the whole family. Now Shes speaking in that tone of voice that is clearly a guilt trip. She says she doesn't want to leave me alone for Christmas (which I'm fine with.).

Idk I feel as though shes guilting me into going to this lunch because that's what she wants to do. Making it seem like I'm ruining the Christmas plans. But what about what I wanted to do for Christmas? She didn't even ask me?

1699,not the a-hole,"AITA for cutting off someone I've known for fie years for issues not even directly done to me, but to a mutual friend? I'll refer to them as ""Alex,"" and the mutual friend as ""Jesse.""

Alex and I had met IRL during some classes around high school, and hit it off immediately: we were both Tumblr people (I know, shhh), had a similar sense of humor and interests, and were both from abusive families and suffered from some pretty fucked up shit. That part will be relevant later.

Alex was homeschooled, and introduced me to their online group of friends, including their now-boyfriend, and Jesse. We all got along beautifully - it was the gaming guild built in heaven, full of people with the same sense of humor who stayed up all night laughing and talking and just having a good time. It was absolutely wonderful for a lonely kid like me: for a long time, these people were my only friends, and I loved them to pieces.

At some point along this line, Alex had some pretty Fucked Up Shit happen to them: their boyfriend at the time had extorted them, using suicide as a method to force Alex to stay with him, eventually leading to an explosive breakup and a really scarred Alex. Eventually though, everything was okay, and Alex ended up getting together with their current husband, someone in this same guild.

Around this time, Jesse messages me asking for advice managing his feelings, and drops a huge one: he's in love with Alex, but they don't love him back. Jesse feels like he owes so much of his life to Alex that, and I quote, ""we might as well be the same person."" That was my first big hint that something really unhealthy was going on, and I express my concern. He then informs me that Alex had told him some pretty concerning stuff, and was so close to them because he felt closer to Alex than anyone he had ever known, and knew pulling away in any way would devastate them. Huge red flag #1.

Alex, to leave their abusive family, eventually packs up and moves in with their now-husband in another state. This is the last time I see them in real life.

A few years pass, and a huge triple-A shooter is released. We're all PUMPED to play, and start taking it pretty goddamn seriously. Almost too seriously. The guild splits into two factions: Alex, their husband, and their friends, wanting to take the game as seriously as possible, and Jesse, his friends, and I, wanting to just have a good time. The first faction's definition of taking the game seriously involved the complete ban of non-game-related chatter - effectively demolishing any ability to socalize while playing.
That'd be perfectly fine, especially creating a different voice chat so they could play seriously while we had fun. But Alex instead decided to create an entirely new guild, with a voice chat LOCKING OUT the non-serious players, and left our guild entirely.
I was desperate to get us back together, as I'd assumed the position of guild leader over the years, and was seriously emotionally invested in its health. My mistake #1.

I talked to and soothed Alex, eventually convincing them to talk in a chat created for the purpose, to explain their misgivings and - I hoped - heal any issues.

That was not what happened.

Alex posted...a huge, huge, HUGE chunk of text, screaming at every single member of the fun group but me, calling them all immature, rude, and terrible people, not respecting them and their mental illness (of which they had several they were being treated for), and that they could all go fuck off and die. Red flag #2.

None of the fun group responded, I deleted the chat, and went the fuck off at them. How dare Alex be so rude, how could they refuse to see other people's feelings! Their response was something along the lines of ""I didn't mean to hurt anyone's feelings!"" I said, ""No one cares about what you think you said, people only care about your actions and how they affected them.""

Alex blocked me. Red flag #3.

I told Jesse, who then told me: Alex did this all the time. Whenever someone hurt their feelings, they would absolutely blow up until someone apologized, no matter who was at fault. We went through chat logs, finding places where they had manipulated or shown bad information, in some cases lying to me about Jesse to try and get me to see them as a bad person - things Jesse never did, and vice versa to me, about things I never did to Jesse. We realized we were being played off each other, and got pretty angry - but Alex was our friend. They couldn't do something that horrible!

My stupid ass didn't take the warning - I begged on my hands and knees for them to come back, I was wrong, I mistyped what I meant to say and I was so, so sorry please come back you're my only friend

And they did.

Except...no one wanted to talk to Alex or their group anymore, except for me and Jesse. And even us two were talking more to each other than to Alex, trying to piece together the puzzle, wondering what else they had done over the years. Eventually, Alex and their group leave the guild for good.

At some point along this line, Jesse grows increasingly fed up about Alex's manipulation, blatantly ignoring him to talk about their own problems, then getting upset when he refused to engage. Eventually, Alex ends up in the ER, and tells me: but not Jesse, not even if they're alive. Jesse is so livid at this after the fact that he blocks them on all platforms, cutting Alex out of his life for good.

I'm left as the unfortunate messenger, giving the details to Alex as to why Jesse left. They're full of the same shit: their mental illness and cocktail of drugs meant they couldn't talk to people well, that their job was really tough and they were having a hard time adjusting to married life, that Jesse was an asshole.
And finally:""just be sure to tell him that his lack of contact, all while I've tried to contact him, has lead to me wearing long sleeves today. you get the idea. congrats Jesse. Congrats.""

The last vestiges of whatever affection I had for Alex fell away. They'd done exactly what had been done to them: using mental illness and suicide as a weapon to get people to stay with them. I was devastated, and refused to reply.

Several months pass. We rarely talk, and if we do, it's 100% not related to this. I keep up with them on social media though: and their Twitter is just an ever-increasing crazy train of the nastiest, meanest shit, and eventually leads to Alex asking me why all their friends were being so fucking mean and cutting them off. I told them straight: they were being a fucking asshole, and had to stop to keep their friends.

You can guess their excuses. Exact same shit as before.
I didn't reply again. Yet more months pass, during which time I go through the stages of grief, realizing that my old friend was dead and that I had to give up Alex for good.

During all this time, Alex had never done a single bad thing directly against me, except to use me as an object for manipulation for Jesse ""ZombieBiologist would never say stuff like that!"" and so on.

Suddenly, they message me again: could they please send me a Christmas present? I want your address~

Alex had been known to doxx people.

I was absolutely done with them, sent a long, involved message phrased as formally as possible, citing their insults and my lack of trust in them, and block them on all platforms. But I forgot my phone.

They sent me a HUGE chain of texts, all saying - YA FUCKING GUESSED IT - the same shit as before, ending with ""I just don't fucking need this right now. Please, please, please talk to me again."" They never actually apologized for their actions either. at any point in those texts.

I - stupidly - replied, saying they needed to take responsibility for their actions, no matter what. They just told me to go fuck myself, and a few days later, I'm getting tens of texts from their various twitter followers that I was an asshole: they'd posted my number.

I enlisted a friend to report the tweet for me, but I was still pissed the fuck off.

And now that I've had time to reflect...

Alex was serious about their mental illnesses. They weren't making it up in any way, and had been getting professional help for years. And I was being really fucking rude, demeaning they take responsibility for actions that were caused by their mental illness, instead of suggesting calmly that they seek help: because I knew they already had gotten help, and were still getting it. They never really did anything that warranted ME being so cruel to them by cutting them off. And I feel like a real asshole for doing it.

So, please judge me: was I being the asshole for cutting off this person?",13,37,0.9

1701,not the a-hole,"So background info I have 1.5 year old son with an ex-girlfriend who my mom and Dad have never met despite numerous opportunities my ex and I have offered. My mom and I have had a tumultuous relationship since I was 16 (I’m 23). There’s been a lot of emotional manipulation on both sides, my mom telling me I’m worthless and aren’t capable of this or that and then apologizing by giving me money. And me just generally being an asshole to her having blocked her several times. 

Anyway flash forward to the other night my parents invite me over to their place for dinner after I decline their invitation to fly out to San Francisco for Christmas. I pretty much told both my mom and Dad that if they want to have a relationship with me they need to start getting involved with their grandson’s life. When they made it clear that wasn’t going to happen I stormed out of the house and blocked both of their contacts.

1702,no a--holes here,"Sorry for the clickbaitey title but I'm not sure how else to phrase this. I care about her as in I care about her wellbeing, but not really her day to day happenings. I guess I care about her more as though she's some random child and not a blood relative.

Anyways, she's 3 years old and was born to my mom and her husband. I'm 19 and living with a close family friend just down the street. I live here and not with my mom because there's suddenly a lot of people living with my mom (her bf and his 2 kids, my sister, and two other relatives) and having grown up an only child in a household with just my mom and dad I couldn't stand all the chaos and noise. I mention this because I want to stress that I don't not care for her because I dislike my mom's bf. I don't like him, but I wouldn't take that out on a child. It's not her fault that her dad and I don't get along.

However, the family friend I'm living with loooooves my sister. Whenever I get home from work she always wants to give my a play by play of what my little sister had done and I guess she expects me to dote over her as well, being as she's my sister, but I just... don't really care? I'm glad she's well and she seems to be a pretty smart kid and all but I just don't really give a shit about that cute thing she said, or how much she loves this cartoon. 

For the record, I've never said that I don't care about my sister, but I get the feeling that the family friend knows and is trying to push us to be closer. I guess the best word I could use to describe how I feel about her is ""Indifferent."" I feel about her as I would feel about someone I see on the street. I'm glad their alive, and if they look unhappy I would be sad for them, but I don't really want to know about their lives.

I guess, with the evidence presented would I be an asshole? I certainly feel like a bit of a jerk for my indifference, but I don't outwardly show it and I would never be rude to her or anybody that wants to talk about her. Am I an asshole?",20,66,0.91

I don't care that she said no. But when I asked, she exploded at me, calling me selfish and that it was my problem and not hers. I understand that, but I don't quite get why she couldn't just say no.

**TLDR: roommate stole from me, I told him he was being kicked out, he threatened suicide, I called the cops.**

That post was about a strange favor my roommate manipulated me into doing for him: buying a laptop on my credit card with the expectation to be repaid after he got paid for the work the laptop would enable him to do. The consensus of this community and everyone else I talked to was that my roommate was manipulating me and I might be a bit of an asshole for going back on the deal, but I really had no choice. 

After the laptop was shipped, I decided to intercept the shipment and hold it until we could further discuss the matter, and I gave him an opportunity to repay the money he already owed me. I didn’t directly ask him for money - I simply made my presence known and waited for him to offer. He did not. Without further discussion with him, I went to the store and returned the laptop so that I wouldn’t be tempted to give in to further manipulation. 

While this was all going on, there were other issues going on and one of them was a case of disappearing alcohol. I had a box of wine in the fridge, unopened; on the day that he asked me to buy the laptop, I saw him drinking some and he said he’d had two glasses. I had a glass too. The next day I decided to pick up the box to see how much was left, and it was just about empty. I removed it from the kitchen. I wanted a drink and since the wine was gone I went to a bottle of bourbon I’d just recently opened which was in my bedroom, and I noticed that it was half empty. I didn’t remember drinking that much and suspected he may have come in my room to take some. So I lined it up a particular way so that I’d notice if it moved, and when I got home last night sure enough it had moved, although there wasn’t that much more missing. I texted him to confront. No answer, and when I looked for him he was sleeping on the couch. I was very upset and ready to kick him out over this massive breach of trust. 

This morning when taking my AM pills I discovered that my Adderall bottle was very light. It had to be missing at least 15 pills. I was livid, but I had to go to court so I just left. I texted him that this was the last straw and he would have to leave. I offered to forgive what he still owes me and pay airfare for him to get back to his family so that he didn’t have to risk homelessness in the northeast as the snow is starting. 

Eventually he texted back. No denial, just a short apology and “Never again. I honestly don’t know what to do. I am in a crisis.” Ordinarily this kind of language would be enough to make me cave but I held firm and told him we were past that, I will help him get somewhere else but he has to leave. He replied by threatening to kill himself. He repeated it a few times as I urged him to go to the ER or something. 

At that point I was in a real bind. I’m a city away right now, and I was about to go into court (I’m an attorney). I couldn’t exactly leave work to go take care of him, but I wasn’t going to not respond to a suicide threat. I decided to call the local police and ask them to go check on him. I gave them my address and my permission to enter the house to check on him. I texted him that I was going to have someone go check on him, and of course *then* he said that he was just talking and needed to stay home to get work done, and said I would be ruining his life if I did this because if he didn’t get work done today he would be fired. 

Absolutely not my problem. 

As I see it, at this point, someone texted me from my house threatening suicide, so calling the police was the only available response. I can’t think of a possible alternative action I could’ve taken besides calling the police at this point. In hindsight, I can think of one other alternative; perhaps I could’ve called a social worker I know and asked her to make an emergency visit, but this is not her problem and I’m not sure it would be safe for her. So no, I had no other option. 

Well anyway, that’s the update, I’m about to head home and see if he’s there, I’ll call the police on my way to see if they’ll give me an update. 

Oh yeah, I need to add the obligatory part. 

AITA for calling the cops on my roommate in this situation?

Update to the update: I spoke to his mother and to the hospital. Definitely a crisis and definitely beyond my resources. The mother says she’s grateful and that she had been considering doing the same based on her knowledge of the situation. I’ll see what I can do to help preserve his work situation, I’ll visit him when the hospital calls back to say whether he’s admitted or discharged, if he’s discharged I’ll encourage him to focus on work in crisis mode for a day or two, if he’s admitted I’ll figure out how to send a message to the boss and give a vague statement that there’s a medical emergency. I doubt the guy wouldn’t be understanding under those circumstances but then again his patience has probably been stretched as far as mine. The mother also confirmed that she can’t take him in and isn’t aware of any viable alternatives so I’ll see if I can get him enrolled in an intensive outpatient program; if he is committed to getting serious help I will let him stay a while until he is better able to take care of himself, but I will erect more enforcements of boundaries.

1706,not the a-hole,"I’ll try to make this short. My dad relocated for a year and found a woman to watch his two cats (both 12 years old). Unfortunately this woman died from the flu last week. So I’ve been very panicked trying to find another place for my cats to live until my dad returns in July. 

One of my mother’s friends offered to help. I dropped off the cats yesterday but she made it very clear that she wanted to declaw them as she has cats as well and is worried about their safety. Although my cats have never once attacked each other or any human, I understand the concern. 

I did some research today and called a few vets to book the appointment, and I hadn’t realized just how dangerous it is for older cats to go through this procedure. It can cause so many complications and is incredibly painful for old cats. I don’t want to go back on my word, but the thought of causing any permanent damage to my sweet fur babies is making me sick to my stomach.

At the time she was okay with it but apparently she must have forgot and got really upset with me last night and said that I just didn’t tell her.

She gets passive aggressive and bitter towards me saying that I don’t care about her and that I don’t try enough so she can get what she wants.

1710,not the a-hole,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

So for a little bit of background, we are both 21 years old and in college.  We've been together about 6 months, and our relationship had been somewhat rocky for a while before this happened.

So about a month and a half ago, I missed a few pills and had unprotected sex with my boyfriend during that time.  It took a week for us to figure out that we weren't still protected, and that there was a chance I could be pregnant. We knew the date I was supposed to have my period and waited for it anxiously- and sure enough it didn't come the day it was supposed to.

In the days leading up to when I was supposed to have my period I did a lot of soul-searching and realized I couldn't terminate if I was pregnant, but wasn't sure how to bring it up to my boyfriend until I was a week late and we were starting to get worried.  He told me he'd go half on an abortion, and I calmly said I didn't think I wanted one.  Then he absolutely flipped out. 

He started yelling that I was ruining his life, he wasn't even sure if he liked me that much, he couldn't have a child with someone who wasn't Jewish, etc. He told me that I should drop out of college out of shame and kept calling our potential future child a ""bastard"" and asking me if I really wanted to be a ""single mother of a bastard child"".  He took me to the store to get a pregnancy test and screamed at me the whole ride there about how he was going to find a way to ""make"" me get an abortion because it wasn't fair to him. By the time we got to the store, I was in tears, and he refused to even look at me when we got the test and purchased it. The whole ride home he just kept glaring at me and shaking his head, and I just kept saying over and over he could leave if it was positive. It was honestly the most terrified I had ever been in my life- it was dawning on me I was going to be completely alone in raising this our potential child.

Luckily it turns out, I wasn't pregnant. The second we got the negative result his attitude completely shifted and he immediately wanted to go out and celebrate, but I still haven't been able to shake this ""off"" feeling about the whole experience.  

Part of me thinks his reaction was justified, as it's natural to be scared in this situation.  But I can't help but feel that a lot of his true feelings about me came out during the scare, and that his reaction was inappropriate. It hurts me that he wasn't able to control his emotions for my sake, and that he showed no willingness to help me out if I didn't do exactly what he wanted to do.  I also wonder if I'm expecting too much from someone in such a scary situation, though.

1711,not the a-hole,"So we have this thing in our department at work where a few of us get together and decorate whomever desk’s birthday. 

Generally this is done after work. I recall spending an hour or two. Because we care and we go all out. 

Well the main girl who always does the most work for everyone’s desk, it was her Birthday recently. She was off and the coworkers wanted to decorate her desk. 

It was a busy day, we had lots of customer calls coming in. More than normal. We had lots of customer emails as well. Needless to say my day was packed. Except it was worse for us who were not away from our desk. About five people were up decorating the girls desk during work and was even told by a supervisor because the supervisor sent a group email for everyone to get back to their desks due to the workload. I had to go drop a package off in the mail room and as soon as I was back up to our floor. I walked past and commented how nice the desk looked. They asked if I wanted to help. I blew up six balloons (at my desk while working) and then gave them back. Then one girl began to complain to me about the supervisor getting on to them. 

I simply started to walk away and said I wasn’t losing my job over a desk. 

The next day, birthday girl was short with me. I apologized to her for not giving my time as I had work to do. She said it wasn’t a problem and she didn’t care. 

Today, we’re extremely slow at work so I offered to help her cut some things. She said “no I don’t think you want to” after bickering back and forth about it, she reiterated what I told the other coworker while she wasn’t there. Which means they were talking about what I said. 

I simply got up and nodded and walked back to my desk. I’ve got no time for stupid drama. My job is more important. I’m trying to move up.

1713,not the a-hole,"I've got the flu. It's pretty bad. My boss gave it to me last week when he came back to the office, and he was out for four days. Sorry if this comes across as rambling. Anyways, here's the situation.

I have a son. He's 4. My Mom, my Sister and I go out on Fridays with him for dinner. It's fun, and it's kind of our thing. We make it a weekly ritual. On Friday my Sister asked me who was picking him up and I told her I was sick (I had just started feeling the flu). By dinnertime I was feeling pretty crappy, so I decided to sit this week out. My Sister asked if I wanted them to pick something up for me, and I said sure. Went to sleep around 5. Woke up at 7 hungry and wiped out, and just generally feeling shitty. I waited for them though because I was really looking forward to the sushi my Sister offered to get me. Around 8 my Mom called and said she was bringing my son home from dinner. I asked about my food and my Mom told me, point blank, that they forgot to order it with everything else and by the time they did remember they were ready to go and didn't want to be slowed down waiting for it. So they didn't get me anything, which would not have bothered me normally except I was really, really tired and really, really hungry. I didn't have anything ready to eat at home, and cooking felt like a hassle - it was hard just to get out of bed at that point. Anyways, I did it. After my Mom dropped off my son, I got up and cooked some food and everything was fine. No big.

The following day, my Mom came to pick up my son so she could take him to a park (I want to be clear about something - in context it might sound like she did this to give me a break because I am sick, but that was not the case. She picked him up to spend time with him, not as a favor to me). Before she left, she asked if I needed anything and I told her I could use some medicine. The only medicine I have is children's medicine for my son since I don't get sick very often. I also told her it would be nice if she could get me food since I was still sick and tired and cooking was hard. 

Around 4 she called and said she was on her way back and asked what I wanted as far as food goes. I suggested a couple quick options on the way home, but she declined and said ""only somewhere with a drive-thru"". For me this is frustrating because I am vegan (half of you probably just said 'yep, you're the asshole' lol), so there aren't a lot of places I can get food from that have drive-thrus. She ended up getting me Taco Bell, which was actually very nice of her - if you didn't know, a lot of Taco Bell's food is vegan, including their beans. She also brought me medicine. Here's the crux of the asshole question...

The medicine she brought over was Nyquil. It expired two years ago. After she left, I noticed something was wrong when I opened it and saw an oily film on the top. I was very frustrated and angry at this point. I called and told her that the medicine wasn't good and I was really counting on it to help me sleep and feel better, and she called me ungrateful and told me I should be appreciative for what I have, and to try the medicine because expiration dates are misleading. I offered to pay her back for the Taco Bell she brought me, and would have given her money to pick up medicine from the store but she said she didn't want to drive that far. It's not far... less than a quarter mile from either of our houses.

1715,not the a-hole,"I live with my boyfriend and our two dogs that weigh 90 lbs and 135 lbs.  They are family and, as with all other family members, they are allowed on the furniture.  

Our living room is small and has two walls that couches or chairs could go on.  To maximize seating and floor space, we had a sectional.  Before the sectional we had a couch and an oversized chair, but we hated the wasted space in the corners of the room since it made the useable floor space so much smaller.  The sectional was a perfect fit - room for an end table on one side, and the ottoman could be moved to the end of the chaise side to open up floor space.  It was microfiber, so dog hair vacuumed easily and all pillow covers were machine washable.

Several months ago, my bf said he wanted a recliner.  Our living room is not big enough for a recliner.  I asked if he planned to get rid of the sectional and put his recliner in the middle of the living room because it has to be so far off the wall to recline there'd be no room for other furniture.

After pointing out the limited space for a recliner, I told him I do NOT like recliners that look like recliners.  I hate them.  If it looks like a normal chair *and* it reclines, great - but I don't like fluffy, poofy recliners

The recliner he was looking at was leather.  I told him that my parents have very expensive leather furniture, and their dogs that weigh less that 20 lbs have destroyed parts of it.  There is no way it'll hold up to our giant pups, and I won't tell them they can't be on the furniture.

Now, on to the AITA part. . . 

Several days ago, I walked in to my living room to find brand new furniture.  Now, I'm sure you're thinking, ""It's a recliner,"" and you're right. . . But there's more.  In addition to the recliner is a loveseat that *also* reclines!  It is all leather, and it all looks like recliners.  The loveseat has a center console, so it's basically just two individual recliners.  My living room looks so small because the loveseat is 24 inches off the wall.  When you sit in the recliner, you can't see the loveseat because it's entirely behind you.

My first thought was I'm not happy, my second thought was that I'm sad that my dogs won't get to be on the furniture.  My third thought was oh well, I'm not paying for it. . . But that all changed when he said, ""Happy Birthday!""

Happy Birthday?  Happy Birthday??  I told you I didn't want ONE leather recliner, so you bought me THREE???  Bullshit.  This is not for me.  *You* wanted a leather recliner.  You bought furniture for *yourself*!  

Since the furniture arrived, I haven't said anything about it.  I only pointed out that it will get ruined quickly because, even though we can keep the dogs off of it while we are home, they roam free while we are gone.

What I want to say is, Do you listen to anything I say?  Ever?  What about the bench I said I really wanted when you asked what I wanted for my birthday?  Where am so supposed to lay down without a couch?  Am I supposed to yell at the dogs every time they try to do something they've always done?  What are we going to do with the wasted 24 sq ft behind the loveseat?  Why did we go from comfortably seating 7 adults to seating 3 adults *and* lose floor space??

I love my boyfriend, and I know he at least had me in mind when selecting the color.  I know he wants me to be thrilled with it and I know he is excited about it.  I think he knows I don't love it because he said, ""I tried.""  It makes me very sad that I don't like something he went to the effort of picking out and purchasing, but I don't understand how he managed to get all three things that I said I did not want in one set.

I am not an ungrateful bitch.  Had he not gotten me anything for my birthday, I probably wouldn't have noticed.  And even if I did realize he didn't get me anything, I wouldn't care.  I just don't like that he is masquerading something he purchased for himself as something he purchased for me.  ",75,93,0.96

He seemed overly lonely and was saying things like ""you're totally perfect in every way"" and other such nonsense. I caught myself thinking ""God I wish I didn't have to go on this date tonight"" because one of my friends is going through some tough stuff and needs me, and I realized I just really wanted to go on a date so I was forcing it. 

I told him about my friend (with NO intention of not going, just a ""one of my friends is going through a tough time 😞"")  and he said, ""I feel like I should order you to come."" He actually said that. Fuck off. I just blocked him. 

I still feel bad tho because it sounds like he didn't get a lot of dates and I feel like this might hurt him a lot... I feel like I led him on way too long, we've been talking for a few weeks now... It's gonna crush him 😞. He had been saying things like ""I can't wait to see you"" and other such stuff.

1720,not the a-hole,"Ok so I managed at a restaurant owned by a douchebag of an owner who refused to allow us to pay regular staff a reasonable wage and refused to allow us a reasonable labor percentage (wanted 21% including management). Suffice it to say his expectations were absurd. However, the other 3 management in the team were good people. And we had a few solid employees as well.



A few months back I put in my two weeks notice and my district manager pulled some strings and got me almost a $3/h raise, which is pretty damn significant. So I stayed. Which was what he wanted. Obviously. I stuck it out for as long as I could but the stress became too much and it was affecting my home life. I put in my two weeks notice knowing full well that they'd be screwed because there's no way they'd replace me within 2 weeks and even with me they were short-handed as we'd just lost a full-time employee and fired 2 people. 


It's been a week and a half since I've been officially off payroll and they've opened late and closed early almost every day since then. This obviously affects the owners profits, but I obviously don't care about that as he's a top notch cunt. But it also affects my former co-workers, who I do care about.

1721,not the a-hole,"Hi, r/AmItheAsshole. I’m 17F, and I have a friend who is something of a troublemaker—he’s already been suspended three times this year. Let’s call him Saul. Today in class, Saul had his seat changed and was put next to me. I was not pleased with this arrangement, because Saul has taken up excessive swearing, lewdness, and overt insubordination. I planned to have my seat changed ASAP; Saul is a distraction and tends to talk to the people sitting around him, getting both them and himself into trouble.


The teacher of this class is not too fond of Saul, and the feeling happens to be mutual. He tries too hard to be funny, and often tries to evoke a reaction from the class (there’s only 11 of us in this particular class; it’s a language course). Today, he had already been admonished for doing just that, and was audibly mumbling profanity. The teacher was opening our assignment on her computer, heard the mumbling, and asked, “Who is that talking?” She looked to me, since I am somewhat talkative, but I pointed to Saul and several others nodded in agreement. She took Saul outside, gave him a talking-to, and separated his seat from everyone else’s.


The thing with Saul is, he’s a good kid but he also has a mean streak. He has insulted other people’s appearance, insinuated that two boys were gay because they liked Dynasty, and he is constantly swearing at his cousin, who is in the same class. I befriended him last year; he wasn’t so bad then, just a few tellings off for talking in class and the like. This year, he seems to have deteriorated into cursing out the American teachers in our languages (we are Pakistani and speak Urdu and Punjabi as well as English). His most recent suspension was just last week, when he stole one of my books to copy off homework that he’d forgotten to do and then lied about it. He was also briefly upset with me for not lying to the principal about the incident. His mother has gotten into contact with me and requested that I keep an eye on him, steer him away from trouble, and he has even made a pact with my mother (who he is fond of, since she’s humorous and gentle) that he’d keep away from the bad crowd. He now exclusively hangs around with a boy who is so obnoxious I can’t bear to sit with him for more than ten minutes because he cusses and is constantly making references to how many bitches he can fuck, how much weed he’ll smoke when he grows up, etc.

All of my cousins (I have a lot) met up and went to a pub to basically get ridiculously drunk and cry.

Now:
**1:** I'm not a very ""let's go out and get drunk"" person.

**2:** They were going out at 7:30pm,  I live an hour and a halfs train journey away, and even after getting the train there's another 40 minute walk to the pub that they went to.

I didn't see the point in going out for 1 hour then walking back to the train station to get home, so I just didn't go and didn't message anyone to let them know, because it never usually matters if I show up or not, and now everyone is pissed off at me like it was mandatory for me to go.

1728,not the a-hole,"My brother-in-law works for a start up in that collects important (but sort of niche) news and organizes it into a daily newsletter. The newsletter is mostly geared towards business-minded people who want to know about the news in China for their business-minded ventures, but some of the readership is just people who are interested in world news and current events. I don't subscribe to the newsletter and when they recently started a podcast I did not subscribe to that either. I already have the news sources that I like to use, and I like the podcasts that I listen to, and even sometimes struggle to make time to listen to all of them. It's not that I think his stuff is not worthwhile, I just don't want to bother integrating it into the other media that I already consume.

Over the Thanksgiving weekend, we were all talking about some news event, and my brother-in-law mentioned something that he had written about in the newsletter. My husband I hadn't read the newsletter that he mentioned, but my father-in-law had, so they talked about it. Somehow it came out that I did not subscribe to the newsletter and my brother-in-law seemed upset, although he did hide it for the most part, I think. Later, my brother-in-law was asking to borrow an Android phone, because they were troubleshooting something about their podcast on a certain podcast platform that only works on Android phones I guess. He took my husband's phone at first, but when he mentioned the podcast app, I told him that that was the podcast app I used so he could look on my phone and not have to download the app again. He looked on my phone and scrolled through my list looking for his company's podcast and then he said ""oh you don't subscribe to our podcast."" There was an awkward moment and then he just went on to look for what he was trying to find.

Am I the asshole? No one is being frank with me and coming out to tell me whether or not they think I should just subscribe to the newsletter and download the podcasts, so I don't know if I'm just reading into all of the little hints that they're dropping. I know that if I subscribe to the newsletter, it would just be like every other newsletter I've ever subscribed to via email and it would eventually just be archived without me ever opening it. I imagine the podcast would be similar; I try to to control my news intake because I have depression and the news makes it worse. I used to be addicted to news sites so I only have one news podcast that I listen to.

This seems like one of those things that maybe you just do because it's a nice, albeit empty, show of support for someone in your family. But I don't like those. And similarly, I write monthly for a Blog and I don't expect anyone in my family to subscribe to the blog just to read my post every month. If they like the blog, sure go ahead, but they don't need to do that just for me. But am I just being a hard-ass about this? Should I just subscribe to these things and at least look like I participate in them?

EDIT: Thanks for the feedback, everyone. I think, while asshole is maybe too strong a word, I am the jerk in this case. You all made good points, and I think I was really just making immature excuses. I subscribed to the podcasts and downloaded the newsletter app and I'm going to try to be more supportive.

1734,not the a-hole,"I play an online game a lot at a pretty casual level, and because I'm not terribly skilled at the game, I tend to get randomly matched with younger players often. Enter B.

B sends me a friend request after I compliment him on playing a character well while playing on a team together, so I accept to be polite and make a potential friend. He asks my age/gender so I tell him mine (19F) and come to find out that he is only 12. I don't really like keeping players on my friends list if I find out that they aren't at least 16 or so because they tend to be immature and I feel really weird if they decide to tell me super-personal information. B is no exception to this, but I decided to give it a chance. 

B tends to get really angry in-game and flame teammates despite being prone to making game-changing mistakes himself, and I have had to apologize for his behavior to other teammates before. He is also extremely clingy and does not seem to have many other friends to play with. He will just message me ""wanna play?"" and get super offended and pouty if I decline. This game in particular is not a super-social activity for me, so some days I just prefer to play alone or with friends who I am much closer to. I have tried integrating him into other friend groups in the past, and he sometimes ends up picking fights with other members. I now had no choice but to exclude him if I had already made plans to play with someone else. I did oblige to play with B alone every now and then, but things got to the point where I became convinced that he just sits around and waits for me to come online, which I am really uncomfortable with. I ended up playing on an alternate account for a couple of weeks just to dodge him because I didn't think it was worth confronting him about it.

Another part of my reason for not wanting to play with B very often is that he's just not too much fun to talk to. I have tried to start conversations with B about life in general or about new features in the game, and his answers are often one word answers or super vague at best.  Does that make me cold for not trying even harder to actually be his friend? I didn't want to make it weird though by asking him anything too personal with the age difference and all. Maybe he's just not great at holding a conversation because he's young, but it made me feel like he just wanted to use me to rank higher in the game. I feel like he doesn't have many friends irl because he is almost always online, nor in the game either since he seemed so obsessed with playing with me. That makes me feel really bad since I wasn't super popular at his age either but...

The last straw was when B messaged me out of the blue asking me (and by ""asking,"" more like demanding in his wording) to use the game's version of real-life currency to buy him a newly released character (even though characters can be purchased with in-game currency). This is not the first time he has done something like this, as he has asked me to use real money to buy him characters/cosmetic items before and I have always declined by saying some variation of ""Sorry, I'm a poor college student and need that money to pay my rent lol."" After sending that tired message for the last time, I decided to just remove him from my friends list because I'm not about to let stressing out over one person keep me from playing the game. Am I in the wrong for doing that?

**TL;DR: 12 year old friended me in an online game even though I prefer to play with people closer to my own age. He is clingy and sometimes rude, and he has not-so-politely asked me to buy him things with the game's paid currency even though we are not that close. However, I feel really guilty for not trying harder to connect with him because he does not seem to have many friends. Am I the asshole?**",24,31,0.82

Fortunately for me, I just received approval for my disability benefits, plus back pay for nearly 3 years. One of the first things I did was sign up to be a gifter on the ""Santa"" subs to try and payback the goodwill that was shown to my family last year.



While looking for a family to assist, I came across one family in particular who has posted asking for help for three years running. They've gotten gifts for their kids,as well as themselves, from fellow redditors for the past 3 Xmas's.


I guess what grinds my gears, is in their post history's (mom posts in one sub,dad posts in the other), they have gotten new pets every year, constantly post in the gaming subs with the latest games, and without giving out too much info, seem to be doing okay by all accounts. Dad works, Mom is SAHM,and the kids all go to school.


Until Xmas comes.


Then there's a laundry list of reasons why they were going to be helpers this year,but then blah,blah,blah happened and now they are the ones who need help.


Maybe I am just a natural cynic, but to me, if you can't get it together over 3 years to at least do ONE out of three Xmas's, without help from others, maybe its time to stop being a SAHM (whose kids are in school, btw) and get a part time job.

I’m an artist myself, so I like to support other artists trying to make a living. He is pretty widely followed, with 50K followers on IG. I noticed that he was selling flash sheets. I sent him a DM and told him that I was interested in buying one. He linked me to his BigCartel page, and I purchased a print. Told him transaction was completed, and he said he would box it and ship it right away! I left it alone, and about 3 weeks later, sent him a DM asking about it. He said “that’s weird. It should have shipped. Let me check. Oh sorry. I forgot! Let me ship it now. I’ll throw in some stickers! Sorry dude!” No problem. Shit happens. 

Another month goes by, I hit him up again, and he says that something is “weird with transit.” And he will “ship another one.” Okay. Whatever. Another month and i ask again. No response. It’s now been 6 months and I’m starting to get pissed. I get a DM from a random user on IG asking if I had purchased art from this user, but not received it. I said yes. They informed me that they were also in the same boat, as well as 50+ people. I became furious, and contacted the artist and called him out. He began to call me a **liar** and say that I received the art, and that I just wanted free shit. I began an investigation and contacted the other people. After I took screen shots of the 30+ people I spoke with, confirming that he ripped them off for hundreds to thousands of dollars, I posted it on my IG, tagged him, and put him on blast. 

I follow him on a ghost account. He makes new posts advertising new art and says “COMMENT IF YOU WANT IT!” And I’ll personally message anyone who comments advising them not to buy. And if they have already purchased, I’ll advise them to get a refund. I’ve been doing this for the past month, and he has noticed. He sent me a message crying saying that he has lost so much revenue over the past few weeks that he can barely afford rent, bla bla bla. “Please stop. I’ll send you whatever you want.” Someone else told me I should just let it go. I’m sorry, but in my eyes he’s a fucking thief. Reap what you sow.

1746,no a--holes here,"So a little backstory: I'm really anti-smoking. This schoolyear a bunch of new students were put into my class because we were the smallest class in our grade, hence I made some new friends! 

Whilst I was waiting for the buss with 2 of my new friends one of them pulls out a cigarette. I was a bit surprised first since I didn't know he smoked and immediately asked him to put it out or, if he absolutely had to smoke, walk away from me and our other friend until he was done. 

He walked away and smoked his cigarretes, I couldn't tell if he seemed offended or not but our other friend seemed to be really uncomfortable with my reaction. 

I didn't go on a rant or anything about the fact that I absolutely HATE cigarettes, and there didn't come anything else out of it.

Am I the asshole?",26,41,0.87

1748,not the a-hole,"Every year they ask us what we/the kids want for Christmas. And every year we give them specific requests from the kids and every year they completely ignore the requests and send useless items. It’s gotten to the point where we just ask them not to send us anything because we travel instead of doing a big gift giving. Last year they insisted on a list from the kids. I told them that since we were doing a big trip to Disney World, Disney gift cards would be awesome as we can do something awesome with/for the girls. What did they send? Some left over fairground stuffed animals and a slushee maker. 

Now before I sound ungrateful, we would truly be fine if they didn’t send anything....the issue is 1) when we ask the kids to make Christmas lists, it creates an expectation that they will receive something and 2) when the In Laws say that they will get xx gift, we don’t get it. If we knew they weren’t getting it, we’d have gotten it from the kids instead. 

This is a several year long occurrence, on top of continuing to spell my oldest daughter’s name wrong...insisting we drive 12 hours to visit them with a toddler in tow...driving through our town for camping trips but calling us weeks later to mention that they happened to pass by our exit. Yet we live too far for a visit.

1750,not the a-hole,"My grandfather and his wife on my moms side have always ran the show when it comes to holidays and basically family get togethers in between. His wife (who is not my grandma to clear things up, but has been with him since I can remember) is probably one of the worst human beings I’ve ever met. It’s her way or nothing and she also likes to pick and start Family fights, but no one will stand up to her and my grandfather isn’t totally innocent, he jumps in with her and then you’re not allowed to disagree with him because he believes he runs the Family. 

They never really had anything to do with me as a kid, never came to any of my games or recitals but always expected me to be at their house on Thanksgiving & Christmas and whatever bs get together they could come up with in between. If you don’t go to these things they have a family fun fest of everyone jumping in and basically talking some mad shit about you and whoever else didn’t show up. 

On Labor Day Of 2015 my grandfathers wife started some family drama involving me and I stated my opinion on how it wasn’t very nice or adult like for them to act this way. (I’ve grown a spine since I’m married and moved out of my parents house) and so they belittled me even more and told me that if they wanted me to do something or started disapproving of my DH they’d tell me and I’d have to leave him because their word is law.  My dad also stood up for me and it basically turned into a screaming match in their kitchen and I just sort of snuck outside to cry and get out of there.


The next day after they started all this drama my grandfather called my mother and attacked her for not raising me right (because I stood up to him and apparently that makes me bad) and my mom just sort of brushed him off. He also asked my mom for my phone number so he could call me and “apologize,” which unsurprisingly never happened.

I didn’t attend thanksgiving with them because we usually go to my Dads Family then I go to my DH’s family’s, but my mom decided to go see them. 
It ended up just being her and them there and my grandfather and his wife spent the whole time telling her how awful me and my dad were and that he and I were so mean to them at my wedding. My grandfather’s wife told my mom that I told her to sit down that I wouldn’t be seen in pictures with her and was rude to her the whole, which was completely untrue.

Conveniently they forgot about  the day before DH and I got married they threw such a fit over having to sit on the same row as my grandma that I could hear my grandfather screaming at my mom over the phone from the other room and at the wedding they made their distaste known and even convinced my grandma not to even come to the wedding. Of course this was after we had okayed the seating plan with them months in advanced, but suddenly it was a problem.

Skip to Christmas Eve and I decided to give them one last chance, despite DH and my close friends who knew the situation trying to convince me other wise. 

We get to their house and I take two steps in the door and immediately they’re on my case. Insulting me for the way I had my hair done and the shoes I was wearing because. 
I just snuck to the other room and kinda stayed away from them and hung out with my cousins, even though my gut told me I should leave immediately I stayed.

They handed out presents, which could be a whole different AITA post, because I’m on the chubby side and they insist on getting me shirts in both small and 4X’s and then making jokes about it and it’s always free shirts that they’ve gotten too.

So everyone finishes opening their presents and there’s one last present left. My grandfather’s wife is like we’re going to play a game and I’m going to give this gift to someone and they’re not allowed to give it back to me it. They have to keep it and do whatever they want with it. And then she gives this big spill about how she searched every where for the perfect gift to do this with. Then she calls me out and hands me the Gift with the entire family watching as I open it. 

When I get it opened it’s this political doll that my mom gave my grandfather a long time ago and his wife regifted it to me. The way it was done had this awful feeling to it. Like I could tell and so could my parents that it was done with the intent to be rude but if I said anything about it they would turn around and say that I was ungrateful. 

So I left and cried the whole way home because it really sucks to be treated such a childish way by your only living grandfather. 

So I told my mom and Family that if they wanted to do something with me that involved those two that I would not be attending if it involved stepping foot into their house and they’ve been fine with that. 

And unsurprisingly they’ve been better to me in public than when we’re at their house, minus a few snide remarks.

So I hosted Christmas at my house the next year and everything went swimmingly. Everyone talked about how nice it was for a change and everyone got along. My grandfather came but his wife was “sick” and didn’t show up and everyone talked about starting the tradition of coming to my house instead. 

So this year when I asked if they wanted to do Christmas at my house, my grandfather’s wife shook her head and said “Absolutely not. We will be having it at our house like it should be, you can host someone else at your house.” 

So am I the asshole for refusing to spend Christmas with them or does it make me look like I’m throwing a fit because they won’t come to my house? ",27,59,0.88
1751,not the a-hole,"So around 2011- early 2017 I was in a very serious relationship with a guy. He started out great and then things went downward as he increasingly became more insecure, more controlling, more abusive, etc. Things got very dangerous a couple of times, but we had become so invested in each other that I didn't see a clear way out that wouldn't be horribly dangerous. Around our last yearly anniversary things picked up a bit and I thought it was going to get better for us. He even picked up a promise ring for me from a local jeweler.  
  As abusive cycles go, it got bad again. He would constantly use the ring against me as something to coerce me into doing what he wanted and giving up my position in arguments. Before I left for college I broke up with him.
  One of the last things he ever said to me was ""Please don't pawn the ring."" It's been about six months since we broke up and in order to get over the trauma I'm just trying to remove all signs of him from my house and, being a poor student, I could really use the 300+ dollars the ring is actually worth. Would I be an asshole if I sold this ring?",26,79,0.96

1753,asshole,"So a little back story first. Me and my ex-girlfriend had been broken up for around 2 months at this point, I wasn't dating anyone and she was with a self proclaimed rebound guy. Our original break up was quite bad and ended with us not talking at all until this all started.

So it's a Thursday and I was feeling a bit down so reached out to talk to my ex as she was the only one who understood why I was feeling down (Stuff which started during our relationship which was still happening at that point) and I chose to message her because she understood the situation and it had been 2 months since the break up so I personally felt like I could talk to her without it being a huge issue.

So she answered my message and we started talking, all Thursday we spoke about what was going on in my life and it was nothing weird, everything felt normal and there was no bad blood which was nice. Now the Friday and Saturday is where it started to get a bit different. On these days she started to say things to me like ""I miss you"" or ""I should have never left you"", now obviously I knew she was dating someone (even if she did say he was a rebound) so I would tell her she can't talk to me like that because it's wrong since it's unfair to the boyfriend.

Sunday, the day it started to become a mistake. I'll be honest I got lost in the idea of being with her again so I started to be a bit less considerate of the boyfriend. Now I wasn't saying things to her but I wouldn't protest when she would say them to me, instead I would just be like ""Oh you can't say that till you're single again"". Making it very clear that I assumed that would be quite soon. Monday is best summed up by her telling me she dumped her boyfriend and us arranging to meet up the next day.

Tuesday, we meet up. Everything was going great, she was happy, I was happy. It was like old times and because it was like old times we did it. Now I should have realised something was wrong on Monday but I didn't. During our day together she got a call off her now 'ex' boyfriend. He told he had been locked out of his place and she told him to got back to hers since her flatmates would let him in, not too weird if they ended on good terms, but she ended the call saying ""I love you too"". That should have been a huge red flag but instead she shrugged it off saying that he said if first and it was an reflex since she had literally broken up with him the day before(he didn't go to hers btw). So I didn't look into it and eventually she headed home and everything seemed fine.

Now Wednesday she didn't reply to me once on anything which seemed very suspicious but people need space so I let it slide. Then Thursday I called her and she denied the call instantly. I needed to talk to her because at this point I suspected she had cheated. So I called again, and then waited a few hours and called again.

The ""ex"" boyfriend picked up. For this I shall refer to him as bf, my ex as woman and myself as OP. So bf picked up the phone and this was the conversation.

""Hello?"" - bf

""Hi yeah is woman there?""- op

""What do you want with her?"" - bf

""So i assume that you're her boyfriend then mate?"" - op

""Yeah whats that got to do with you?""- bf

""Well woman has cheated on you, sorry"" - op

""And how do you know that?""- bf

""She cheated on you with me, sorry"" - op

""When did this happen?"" - bf

""Tuesday, we meet up in town and ended up going back to mine and doing it, she told me she had broken up with you though"" - op

(now at this point I realised I was on speaker phone)

""Why are you lying OP, I went into town alone on Tuesday OP, we've not spoke in months you liar"" - Woman

""Woman, why did you cheat and lie to me. I don't get why you did it"" - OP

""I didn't cheat you're just a liar and want to ruin what I have here with BF"" - Woman

""I mean I can prove you cheated on him you do realise that?"" - OP

After that she hung up on me. I decided to send the proof to BF so that he could come to his own conclusion. And now I feel this may have been a little assholeish of me, after sending him the evidence I sent him a message saying ""Welcome to the Woman screwed you over club, getting cheated on is a instant invite to the club my friend"". He blocked me.

So am I the asshole for helping her cheat and for that little comment at the end of it all?

Little did I know that moving in was going to have strings attached. I work nights. 10 hour shifts. I come home around 11AM and just want to sleep. My sister gets out of school around 1:30PM. So I currently have to wake up, drive to pick her up, bring her back, and try to get back to sleep.

1755,not the a-hole,"I married at 19. We've been married for a little more than a year and I am loathing it. I feel like I was rushed into something I am not totally cool with. 

Listen. I love my wife, but sometimes I feel like I am not in a situation I want to stay in. She gave me an ultimatum back when we were dating that I had to propose to her by December (mentioned this in October) or else we would break up. I felt like I was in the middle of a hostage situation. But of course I bought a ring and on one of the last days of November I proposed. 

We got hitched and now feel like I did it too soon. I want to travel without worrying about the dog that I didn't want but we got because she needed a buddy. I want to get kinky and do all kinds of weird shit. 

We have sex. Not regularly, maybe once or twice a month, and it is always vanilla missionary. Not what I would want but whatever, that's what she wants. 

Am I an asshole for wanting to have experienced more before settling down? I wanted to experience getting an apartment on my own or be able to go places without having to check in every hour. I don't know. I feel conflicted. I don't want to bring it up because obviously that would be a fight, but I don't want to live with this ""what if"" my whole life. 

Edit: I forgot one of the big things here. She wants kids. We were able to come to the agreement that we would start having kids in 5 years, but Jesus. I don't want to even think about kids. I'm 20. I feel like a kid myself. The other related thing is even though she says she isn't wanting to have kids at the moment, she won't use any type of birth control and condoms hurt her.

I don't particularly think either of us are being assholes in this situation, but I'm more asking if I was wrong not to accept lunch?

So I started working in this new place as an IT guy. I've been working closely with my boss, but he is very busy and often doesn't go out for lunch.

Well, the game got leaked a few weeks early and people were already playing it. I was looking at videos on youtube like normal when I looked at the thumbnail for a recommended video, and its got a plain spoiler for the game. I am on the group that is waiting to play the game myself and avoiding all spoilers, so I was annoyed. I then noticed that next to it was another recommended video with someone playing the game early, but the thumbnail was a big custom ""SPOILERS"" warning. So I checked the channel of the guy with the thumbnail that had spoiled me, and noticed that he had like 30 videos with all spoiler inducing thumbnails.

1758,no a--holes here,"My kid [12M] was playing with a group of kids at recess and one of them [12F] made some kind of reference to Santa Claus being real. My kid laughed and said, ""You're joking, right?"" The girl was not joking and got very upset when my kid (and his friends) were basically like, ""Uh, no, dude, Santa's definitely not real."" Apparently they also shattered the illusion about Elf on the Shelf too.

Well, I got an irate call from the girl's mom last night. She said my child has ruined Christmas and wants him to apologize and tell her daughter that he was lying about Santa because he didn't believe in the magic of Christmas anymore, but now sees the error of his ways.

When I asked if her daughter has any special needs, she angrily told me no, she's neurotypical, but that she's just a girl who loves Christmas and is now heartbroken. I told her that, respectfully, what she's positing is an insane idea and that it's unreasonable to expect 12 year olds to maintain the Santa story with other 12 year olds. She called me a Grinch (seriously) and hung up on me, right after insisting she's going to take it to the school administration.

When I talked to my son about it, he said he genuinely thought she was joking because all of his friends have known that Santa isn't real for years. He thinks it's ""super weird"" that she still believes/d. I told him that I'll stick up for him and that I agree his classmate is too old to continue the fantasy, especially if she is neurotypical. My son confirmed that she's in his class and extracurriculars, and seems to function like a completely average 12 year old.

But now I'm wondering if this isn't compassionate enough to other people's beliefs? I really do feel like 12 is way way way too old to sincerely believe in Santa unless there's some kind of cognitive development issues, and I think forcing my kid to say that he was wrong about Santa is absolutely ridiculous. My husband thinks he should at least apologize for not being sensitive, but I'm really stuck on how a 12 year old with normal thinking skills could possibly still believe in Santa and thinking that frankly it was about time unless her parents thought she'd ALWAYS believe. But I'm open to missing something here.

About a month ago I told my mom that I was looking for a job because I want to be able to have some money to play with (my parents don't give me any money except on birthdays or Christmas). She perked up and told me that her workplace was looking to hire for a super entry-level job and that she would ask them if I could apply.

So she comes home, gives me the application and I fill out all of the forms. She seems really excited because the job schedule fits perfectly with my school schedule. 

Fast forward to last night, she comes home and tells me that I have an interview next week for the job... But not the job I applied for. In fact, it's worse than the job I applied for. If I get the job, I'll basically be working as a ""replacement"", but not like a temporary job either where I work consistently for a month or two. A job where I ONLY work if someone calls in sick. My mom's workplace is also not big enough for that to be consistent or much at all. 

I told my mom that I'm not going to the interview and that I would rather not waste my time. My mom got really upset and told me that ""we all have to start somewhere so take the damn job."" and I told her that I wouldn't because I could go out and find a shitty retail job that at least gives me more than like 8 hours a month. 

So, AITA for not at least considering this job or wanting to go to an interview for it?

1767,not the a-hole,"Some probably necessary background.

I volunteered last year at a women's homeless shelter and while there I met a woman who at first seemed moderately normal compared to most of our other guests.

Well it turns out she's a **huge** manipulator, is genuinely mentally ill but can act like she's not if you don't spend much time with her but it's obvious simple things don't *click* for her like it would a regular person, and is most likely on drugs of some sort. (I'm not just accusing her of drug use here with no basis for it, after spending enough time with users you began to see through the bullshit and notice their drug seeking habits/ behaviour.) She won't seek help, and won't use medicine prescribed by Dr.s.

She will use people and is incredibly self centered and selfish for a homeless person. She also manages to hoard things and begs people to hold her stuff saying she'll pick it up in a month. Well. I've had 2 of her bags since this time last YEAR. They're taking up space in my house, and at one point she decided to drop off the face of the earth without telling anyone. Not another homeless friend, no one. I was incredibly worried because she could have been picked up and murdered. 

So I went through her bags, and found evidence she's even more unstable and crazy then I realised. Her own mother has a restraining order against her, and warrants for breaking the RO often. She's been mentally ill for years and years, and is getting worse with each passing year.

She got my number in the beginning of shelter season a year ago, and would send me 50+ text messages a day. She wouldn't stop, and would call all the time just rambling. It's like I don't exist in these conversations, and she'll say something to me, then later in a conversation act like I said it?

HW: wow, you sure must like the color red, bet it's your favourite color.
M: No, it's alright though.

HW: Hey look at this, it has your favourite color on it.


**PROBLEM**

She wants me to write her a character witness which she has convinced herself will convince a judge to let her see her mother for Thanksgiving this year. I 100% believe even with several character witness letters, this wouldn't happen. I would have to LIE in it anyways, and I'm not comfortable with this at all.

Just to kind of show you her disjointed thinking, here's a couple text messages she sent me after I told her I would have to think about writing the character witness letter.

Yo _____!Good 2 hear from u. 😃.It has been so long since I have seen u,&heard from u.I mean really.Hum. . ., I went to the town city councel meeting that was not to long ago for camp (*name of local homeless camp*). The camp wanting to still have a building 4 the winter.Most of the campers of camp _____ went to the council meeting,due 2 hoping that the camp would have a building soon.The city wanted nx 2 wait until the 15th of nov.,for the campers 2 have the building.So uhm, yeah whatever u want 2 do--be a monitor 4 this winter's shelter.  That b great. (*My name*), listen, I really need your. help.It would mean alot2me, if u, help me in writting down, how long u have known me &,the fact that we worked together in the shelter.A character witness statement.Once my lawyer has these letters, she will give the letter 2 the judge,so i can have visitation with my mom. Visitation rights.I really need my momma in my life ____. I can't make it without her.So it would mean alot 2me if u could help me out. *signed her name.*

**If you read this and noticed she said we worked together at the shelter, it's true. She appeared stable enough that they took a chance and let her be a monitor. She lost her position because she wandered into restricted parts of the building, stole, and then lied about it all even when confronted with the fact that she was seen on camera.**

Here's another text. Sent to me at 1am.

Hey _____,
     I want to see my momma come 4 thanksgiving. I got 2 do that . I really need 2 do that, _____. I love my momma. I need her in my life. My lawyer said I will be able 2 see my mom come 4 thanksgiving day. So well the only way to have this, is if I have character witnesses's statements--a letter written out by you saying who you are, your age, how long have you known me,how you know me as(I am your friend, boss. . .),have we worked together(at shelter, . . (it is 2 say that I am stable enough to work, you know . .),sign it. And there u have it.

* I am a white-collar professional; standard Monday-to-Friday 9-5, I make enough for everyone, and we are not in any way hurting for money;

* We have 2 boys ages 10 and 3

* None of the four of us have any heath problems, handicaps, physical limitations, psychological issues, or any other ""special needs""

* After the birth of son #2, my wife chose to quit her part-time teaching job to stay home full-time, a decision that I supported

* We live in the suburbs of a certain large Midwestern city, in an 1800 square foot house with 3 bedrooms and a yard

* Son #1 has karate lessons twice a week; my wife has to drive him to that

* Son #2 has play-school twice a week, for about an hour

* Her family (parents and sister) live 5 minutes away, and are happy to babysit the kids for free pretty much whenever

I am going to spend this weekend cleaning the house, AGAIN, because it's a damn mess. She does not stay on top of ANYTHING. The sink is constantly full of dirty dishes. Laundry piles up for weeks. There's always toys scattered everywhere, and piles of junk mail and miscellaneous other crap. She vacuums maybe once a month, cleans the bathrooms once every 3 months or so, and never dusts or washes windows or anything like that. 

I have confronted her about this MANY times. Here's how it goes:

Denial - excuses - anger - tears - she apologizes and promises to do better - about a week of actual effort - backsliding - right back to square one.

Am I The Asshole? I know she's ""not the maid"", as she's fond of saying, but... am I supposed to hire one? It seems like 2 hours a day would be enough to at least keep up with the dishes and laundry, and Son #2 takes 2 hour naps.

(before anyone asks. #1 no I am not an ""MRA"" or anything like that, #2 I am 100% sure she isn't cheating. pretty sure she's just sitting on her ass reading her phone all day.)

This, coupled with the stresses of my new job have severely disrupted my sleep schedule. So, I've been trying to take naps before dinner, from 6-7pm, but these are also disrupted by the sounds from upstairs. Things go quiet up there after 10pm.

He told me it doesn’t matter if I tell her because she won’t believe a person on narcotics. 

In the end he apologized and just said that he lashed out because he felt guilty that I got hurt and even ended up paying for my food, but I feel like I would be better off staying with my mom now.

I wasn't in any rush. I thanked her for the info and said I was fine waiting.

However, I noticed that her ""to do"" list was out of date and did not actually tell you who she was working on, it saying as much and saying that she keeps one on her desktop as it's easier to manage.

**So I moved into a big, old house a couple of months ago with two older dudes that I had never met before.** They're both from India, I'm from elsewhere in the U.S.. We're all on good terms, but not particularly close. We usually say hi to each other in passing, sometimes I give them rides to the grocery store. We're all graduate students at the nearby university, and rented rooms through a property company that owns houses in the area. It was one of the cheapest housing options , and for good reason – the house is pretty shitty. 

Even though there are a total of six bedrooms, **there are only two bathrooms – one on each floor**. They're pretty small as far as bathrooms go. **The two roommates got here a couple of months before me, and both took rooms upstairs. I took a room downstairs.** The bathroom was totally empty, so I quickly started filling it with my toiletries and towels. At the time, we weren't sure if there was going to be another person moving into the house, so I tried to take up minimal space in the cabinet and the small sink counter, in case I was going to have to share. Ultimately, we didn't get a 4th roommate, so I let my stuff expand. 

**We never actually had ""the conversation"" about bathrooms.** I kind of figured that it just sort of made sense that they would use the one upstairs and I would use the one downstairs. Presumably guests would also use mine. **I know it's not fair that they would have to share while I get one more or less all to myself, but I figured I lucked out with the arrangement.**

**Except, I've noticed in the last couple of months that I don't have it all to myself. My roommates frequently use my bathroom.** Sometimes just for a quick piss, sometimes for long shits >= 20 minutes, sometimes for the shower. One time in the morning when I was late for class, I went to use it and it was locked. I knocked on the door and no one answered. I asked ""Hello?"" and got nothing. I knocked again, and got a dazed reply of ""yeah?"". I guess he... fell asleep in there? They seem to wash their hands about half the time. When one of my roommates was sick, I noticed occasional phlegm piles in the sink and shower floor. Other than that, they leave it generally clean. And hell, I don't leave it particularly clean.

Clearly the best scenario would be to have a big open discussion about it, but none of us are big discussers, and I'd rather not bring it up if I'm not in the right. **Is it assholish of me to expect that I should get the bathroom to myself?**

1794,not the a-hole,"Hi everyone. I recently did something, and my conscience and some of my friends are bothering me about it.

I told an ex I wanted to stop seeing her. Now that in itself sounds pretty straightforward, but there are some specific circumstances to this.

You could say she's not really my ex, because we were only in a fwb situation for about ten months. I wanted to get serious pretty quickly, but she didn't. We started acting more and more like a couple, and when I asked her about being exclusive, she told me that she already assumed that we were exclusive. Even though she didn't want to call it a relationship. I know.

Eventually I told her we could not sleep together anymore as the situation was making me unhappy. When she asked me if we could still be friends, I said yes. I now think that was a big mistake on my part, but that was four years ago.

In those four years, we both grew up a bit. She apologised for the way she treated me. We also grew a bit closer, to the point of seeing each other more often than we did other friends. However, my feelings for her stayed, and we were both aware of this.

She has been dating some guys off and on the last year, which I found hard. I once told her that it might be a good idea to get a bit more of a healthy distance between us, but I backtracked when she started crying. Eventually, she started getting pretty serious with another guy. I decided that I didn't want to meet him, and that I could not honestly have a normal friendship with this girl as long as I felt this way about her. She had a boyfriend now, so it wasn't like I was leaving her all alone.

So I told her that about two months ago. I offered to talk about it if she wants to, but she doesn't. That's fine, it's up to her. I've heard from friends that she's still angry about it. Apparently it's pretty hard on her. Apparently the fact that I did it the moment when she got serious with someone else is also a problem for her and my friends (this one has me stumped, honestly).

I don't care about the anger. I don't care that my friends think I'm an asshole. What are they going to do to me? **I'm free.** What I do care about is the fact that I feel like I have abandoned someone very close to me, and I may have hurt her.

Am I the asshole?

So he’s a full on sociopath who hates my fiancé and I. Here’s a few examples. When she started coming around the house he would try to embarrass me or get me in trouble. Down the line he started stealing from us. He’d take our clothes or toothbrushes. We’re also pretty sure he was doing stuff to our toiletries since he’d go in my bathroom for like 10 seconds and then walk out without doing anything. He then started throwing our laundry on the floor for no reason. He would do super petty things like slam the door or stomp around upstairs (his room is right above mine). There’s been times when he didn’t know we were home and he would walk around normally. But when he found out we were in the house or if he knew we’d be home he’d start stomping and slamming doors. 

A couple more recent things he did was spit in our food. My parents did nothing about it. Then at my moms birthday dinner he just shut down and got all moody. He then ran off and his gf had to chase him down yelling his name. It really killed the night. He even told my dad it was a wasted night. He’s also told my dad some awful stuff. “I’m going to spit on your grave.” Was just one of the things he said to my dad. He’s also done some creepy stuff like take photos we have of our dogs and he steals them and posts them online and says he’s the one who took the dog to the park. Or that  he’s the one who took the dog to the beach. 

He also has a tendency to steal the spotlight due to his extreme narcissism. For example when he found out we got engaged he immediately started bragging about how close he was to buying a house. Even his gf admitted they weren’t even close but just looking. It really stole the spotlight. When he found I was transferring schools and that my fiancé has gotten a nice 9-5 job he went out and bought a car. My parents had plans to go to my fiancé’s college graduation but they had to change them because my brother needed a ride home. So they had to leave early and rushed us around and it again, killed the whole vibe for the day. 

There’s been numerous other things and issues regarding him that just make him an awful person. He talked his ex gf into getting an abortion because he was embarrassed to have a kid so young. Then he called a baby killer and other awful names at a party in front of all their friends. He’s kicked the family dogs. He never showed up to my dad’s birthday dinner. He told my fiancé and I to fuck off while we were working on the house. 

So, due to all this and the way he treats us and seemingly wants us apart and tries to get all the attention on him even by lying, we just don’t want him at our party. The only problem is I’m not sure if my dad would be pissed or offended or whatever. But we’re just afraid of having another important event ruined by him.

My gf is currently in the US while I'm overseas. She has a one day layover at SF. And she told me last week she'll be staying with her friend. At first I thought maybe it's a girl. But I distinctly remember an unrelated story about having a friend in SF and that he's a guy. Didn't think to ask at the time.

Turns out, yeah. Was a guy. When she arrived she wanted to check in with me if I was comfortable with them sleeping in the same room. She did assure me that he'll be sleeping on the floor, separate mattress or something. He actually has another place to stay at, also his place, but she said that it would be easier that way. Courtesy. So he doesn't have to keep driving around, I'm guessing (they had plans to go out to do something tonight, chill or hang). I asked if they had a history or something, I didn't do it with hostility. She only said there was an initial attraction when they first met but nothing now. I was a bit bothered. But she did tell me he had a girlfriend, if that helps. I told her I was off about it. She already asked her friend to stay at his other place. And I feel like I did something wrong.

Also, originally, she told me a week before that she had plans to go clubbing with her friend while she was there. Although, she's too tired to go clubbing now. It only hit me today that she was planning on going to a club with a guy friend. Just them it seems. I also told her I didn't know what to feel about that because honestly, I don't.

1803,not the a-hole,"Backstory:
This girl and I have been really hitting it off this semester. We have had 2 months as friends and a month as a couple. We are young but have matured in order for our relation to keep going forward.
When we go out together I feel like she is not there. She keeps conversations to herself and says it’s nothing. She has been telling me she has “deja vu’s” of her ex and it’s getting under my skin. She was in a psychological abusive relation and she calls herself “damaged goods.” She believes she is not good enough for me but she is the only girl I want to be with. 

Today was got annoyed by her not being able to vibe with me, she was just in her head while I tried to make interesting conversations. I asked what was keeping her from being herself and she said she wanted closure. Closure from her ex, as her and her ex didn’t tie their loose ends. The only way she could do this was in person. I’m my head, I feel like she has some feelings in her and I was not going to get hurt by being in the middle of it. I told her that I needed to let her go so she can truly decide what she wants, and that I’d wait till the end of the semester for her. She treats me real nice and I miss her, I made her cry. As of now I do not know if I dodged a bullet or lost the only person I care about.

Thank you, everyone, for your input. I don’t have many people who would genuinely care but you guys made me feel like you did. As of now, we agreed that she will try to tie all her loose ends and by the end of the week, she will have a serious answer. I will post an update on Sunday.",16,129,0.97
1804,not the a-hole,"So I went on three dates with a guy, we weren’t in an official relationship or anything we hadn’t even kissed. I got along with him really well but just decided I didn’t ‘fancy’ him. He was texting me about how on our next date we should have ‘cuddles’ etc so then I decided it was a good time to tell him that I actually didn’t want to continue dating but would love to still see him as a friend. 

He seemed really upset, which I was surprised at seeing as we had only seen each other 3 times and I said to him if he wants to meet up in person to talk about it that I would 100% be willing but he declined. But when I apologised he said he was actually glad I told him now rather than wait.

I felt slightly guilty about texting him this instead of face to face, but I don’t drive so he would have had to pick me up, just for me to tell him and then he would have to drive me home after which would just have been  inconvenient and awkward for both of us. 

The other day I told my friend about it and she made me feel really bad about it. She said I was horrible for texting him instead of telling him face to face. That I’m ‘usually such a nice girl’ and she couldn’t believe how disrespectful I had been. She went on for at least 15 minutes to the point where I felt like crying. 

I now feel extremely guilty. 

Am I an asshole?

1805,not the a-hole,"This happened last semester, but it's bugged me a bit ever since. I was at my college campus library to study a bit between classes. On this particular day, I was in the lobby area which usually is nice and quiet, but there was some sort of event being hosted and there was a reasonable amount of noise happening. Not enough to distract me with headphones on, but enough that you'd have trouble if you were trying to have a conversation. 

Eventually, I feel a brewing in my stomach. I have Crohn's disease, an intestinal issue which, important to this story, sometimes means I really can't ""hold it"" for more than a couple minutes. I go to what I believe is the only men's restroom on that floor to take care of business. 

When I arrive, the door creaks as it opens, and I see a man in a suit talking on the phone. He puts his finger to his lips in a ""shush"" motion at me and continues talking. Seems weird to me, but on the other hand, it was loud enough in the lobby that he might not have been able to hear. I shrug and take the furthest stall away from him to hopefully mitigate any...background noise. 

Time passes, probably 8-10 minutes, and I've finished up, but the guy is still talking on the phone. I hesitate to leave, because I know from experience these toilets are incredibly loud. I've experienced a lot of flushing in my day, and these are possibly the loudest toilets I know of. The guy is still on the phone, talking through what sounds like an important business discussion of some kind. I decide to pull out my phone and study there until his call ends or he leaves. However, I soon notice a full 20 minutes have passed, and my next class is fast approaching. 

I'm now stuck with a dilemma - flush and interrupt that guy's call, or leave a mess for whatever unlucky sap has to use that stall next. With time running out, I opt for the former. As expected, the flush is loud, seemingly louder than ever before. I can hear sounds of frustration from the guy on the phone. As I wash my hands, the guy is giving me a death glare while still talking, explaining the noise to the other person on the line. On my way out I try to mouth out ""sorry"" to him, but he keeps staring daggers at me.  

I have no idea if he was a student, teacher, unrelated employee, or what. I never saw him again after that day. Should I have just left without flushing, possibly returning after class to amend that? Should I have tried to warn him I needed to flush and that he might want to step out? Setting aside ways I could've alternately handled it... was I the asshole? ",15,33,0.89

I recently made a blouse, which I’d been working so hard on and felt a lot of pride in since I’d made it all by hand.

I was going to wear it to go buy groceries and my SO asked me if I was really going to wear it. When I said yes, he told me it looked weird. I asked him weird how, and he said the stitching looked obviously hand sewn. I got upset because literally last night, when I finished it, I wore it and asked him how it was and he said it was fine, but this morning he gave me his real (unasked) opinion and my confidence has been shot down.

1809,not the a-hole,"This happened around 2012, but it was brought up today at dinner while eating with my parents.

When I was in college, I would go home and visit as students do. Whenever I would drive back I would normally have to stop about an hour or so before I arrived to get gas, as the last hour stretch was very windy and there weren't any gas stations along the way. I always stopped at the same gas station.

On this instance, I did my normal routine. Started pumping gas, went in to use the bathroom and grab a drink. When I pulled in, there was normal traffic with nothing out of the ordinary. I finished gassing up, got in my truck, and went to pull out. As I'm pulling up to turn onto the road I need to, there's was this long ass line of car, all in the right lane of a 2 lane road (4 lane? 2 lanes going each direction). I'm talking probably around 80-100 cars. I didn't see any cops and had no clue what was going on. 

So, once there was a little break, I pulled out into the left lane and just started driving, not really paying attention to anybody in the right lane. I did, however, notice that there were about a dozen cars pulled into the shoulder of the traffic going in the opposite direction. On this stretch, there were 3 stop ~~signs~~ lights I had to get through before I hit the highway again, all of the lights were working as normal. I hit a red light at the second light and stopped. The line, however, kept going. I waited until the light turned green and then kept driving. I very quickly learned that there was a cemetery immediately after the 3rd light, where all of the cars were turning into. After I passed the cemetery I was quickly pulled over by a cop who was parked at the entrance and given a strong talking to and basically told not to come back to that town. 

So, am I an asshole for not stopping?

My neighbor is home 24/7/365. Her two yappy dogs don't seem to bother her (frankly, they don't bother me much, because it seems the wall in between us is decently thick). But any time I play guitar, she pounds incessantly on the wall to get me to stop. I selected this apartment (and am paying extra rent) to have a spare room to play music in. Since that room shares a wall with the neighbor, I have now completely sacrificed that room and retreated all my music into my bedroom (does not share a wall, has an entire other room between it and the neighbor's place). I've tried turning down so quietly that I can hardly hear myself. I've tried only playing acoustic. I've stopped playing after 8. Then I stopped playing after 7.

1817,not the a-hole,"a little back story,

just started uni, a friend of mine's roommate added me on snapchat and we were chatting back and forth for a few days, and we had then eventually made plans to go out to eat. 

Well, I ran into her on campus and saw she was taller than me. I'm already 6' so she was probably like 6'2. She was cute and all, but something about a taller girl just isn't attractive to me. I then proceeded to cancel plans saying I had a big test (which wasn't a lie) and I had to study for it. I've been trying to respectfully ease my way out of the situation and I think she got the hint, we are still friends though. AITA? 

Edit; Ok, clearly I am the asshole for my actions. Her and I are friends! We chat everyday, and i'll say hey if I pass by her on campus. I admit, cancelling plans over her height was stupid. But I didn't want to seem like an even bigger asshole by committing to plans, and then her thinking the light is green, and trying to get enveloped and then me just ditching her after dinner. 


And why are so many people on my ass about not finding tall girls attractive as apposed to a shorter girl. There's nothing wrong with tall girls, I just don't prefer them. 

edit again: A lot of you still are getting on my head about not liking girls taller than me. There's nothing wrong with that at all. But if you don't find height a problem, to each his own. & Some of you are also mentioning how i'm just some super asshole and I saved her from wasting her time. Which is not the case. I did an ass move, but that doesn't make me an asshole in general, just in that time. You can't just magically assume i'm some asshole now cause of one dick move I made. 

final edit: A lot of you have great points, and Ii think there is truth to almost all of your responses. I agree i made a dick move by cancelling plans, I agree I made a dick move by cancelling plans over a girls height, of all things. I agree. I was a dick in this situation.

Also, you can use this tag if you are anticipating a conflict in your own life based on current differences of opinion that are likely to come to a head.  Since the overwhelming majority in this sub object to the idea that a person's thoughts or feelings can make them the asshole, it is important that you anticipate what you or the other party is going to do about the problem, and allow judgement of the potential actions, not the ideas.

*Please be clear on whether the story is completely made up, or just something you are anticipating based on your actual life.*   See below for examples.


**Hypothetical Example:** 

>[WIBTA] Would I be the asshole if I call the cops and got my cheating wife arrested?

>My wife cheated on me with a string of dudes while I lived out of town working a construction project to help pay her way through college, among other things.  Now that she has graduated, I find out she has changed the locks and wants a divorce.  Since she already broke all trust in our relationship, would I be the asshole if I called the cops and told them one of these guys is selling drugs out of her house, which he is?  She'll probably get arrested and jailed, but I want to move back into the home I hold half the mortgage on (but have realistically paid 90% of), and don't think I'd be able to win free access to it if the drug issue never came to light.  

>(No, none of this has ever happened to me in real life.)


**Semi-Hypothetical Example:** 

>[WIBTA] Would I be the asshole if I cut my Dad off of Netflix?

> About four of five years ago, my father retired to another state and was trying to cut back on bills and live within a fixed income.  I suggest he try Netflix instead of cable, and gave him my password and blessing to set up his own profile and use my account.  (I actually checked with Netflix, [and they allow this](
http://fortune.com/2017/07/11/netflix-hulu-password-sharing/), even with users who don't share a household.)   He's been happily using my account ever since. 

>A few days ago, he called me to tell me how much a huge pain in the ass passwords and logins have become in his life and started rattling off current passwords he's using to describe how much he's had to complicate them to satisfy password rules.  Eventually I realize that somewhere between a quarter to a half of all the passwords he uses are exactly the same as or are based on my Netflix password!  He's even registered himself for some sites with a username I like to use and combined it with my password!!  I'm really pissed about this because while neither of us is a security expert, we both know it's a bad idea to use the same password on multiple sites.  I have broken this rule myself whenever possible, but I think that's my risk to take on my own account.  Him using my password makes me wonder how many crazy virus heavy places he's been on the web and how many unidentified e-mail attachments he has opened and been oblivious to.  But I don't want to upset my dad, and I only calmly say, ""Gee I never imagined that me giving you a password for TV would result in that password being used all over the web for stuff that I don't know is secure.   What if you get a virus with a keylogger, and it notes password combinations, and tries them with all the e-mails in your address book??  I don't think that's really likely, but why make me take the risk?""  He said he basically forgot whose information was whose, and got in the habit of using it as a base for new passwords.  ""It's no big deal.""  I let it drop and we talked about other topics.  Eventually, the topic of unanticipated risks and consequences re-emerged and I made a wry comment about how giving out my password had unintended consequences, and he said I am crazy and paranoid to think I will ever be hacked because of his use.  I really don't want to upset him, so I let it drop.  

> It is worrying me, though.  So today I reset all my passwords that relate to that root password, and changed my netflix password.  Would I be an asshole if I changed my Netflix password and told him to get his own account, if he still wants one (which he does)?

> **TL;DR** - My dad was trusted with some of my login info and has absent-mindedly used it for his own accounts all over the web.  I think this is thoughtlessly risky so I'm changing everything and not giving him back access to the account he was using.

1820,not the a-hole,"I struggled with writing this. I'm in the closet to everyone so throwaway account for obvious reasons.

My roommate is a straight man, let's call him Tom. We share a two bedroom and have been friends for like a year.  Anyway, he will sometimes walk around the apartment naked in the shared living areas (living room, kitchen, etc.). I will just say real quick that he has a great body all around.  He doesn't know I'm gay and I believe he likely wouldn't be doing this if he knew I was.

I have to say, I have never had this problem with a roommate before, EVER! And I would never walk around naked outside of my bedroom so I find the behavior very bizarre.  

Let me give an example of what he does. The other day I was watching football, he was in the shower. He got out and crossed through the living room, between the couch where I'm sitting and the tv to get to the kitchen to have a drink. I obviously saw everything. He then stood in the living room and watched the end of the game before going to his room to get dressed (the game was almost over).

I try really hard to avert my eyes in these scenarios.  If there wasn't a game on I probably would have just left the room and came back when he was dressed.  In order to be completely honest, while I do avert my eyes most of the time, there have been a couple of times when I've looked. (I'm a weak man).

I've confronted him about this and told him I'm uncomfortable with his nudity and asked that he stop.  He has one of those douchebag-y personalities where if he knows something bothers you he just does it more, for lolz, so that backfired on me.  He's really liberal and has a gay brother so I don't think he'd be homophobic if I came out but with his personality in mind I know that if I told him I'm gay and not to tell anyone he would tell everyone and laugh off my dismay.

So this is my dilemma. Some days I wake up and think I'm a huge asshole and a creep for not being upfront about my sexuality with this guy. He would never show his body off like that if he knew and I do get turned on by his behavior as much as I try to avoid it.  On other days I think what right does he have to know I'm gay.  My sexuality is my business, I haven't come out to anyone and I sure as hell don't want to come out to him. I've already told him to stop and he won't so it's not my fault. I should just sit back and enjoy the show.

1821,asshole,"So, as the story goes: I'm posting my content on reddit. I know that there are self-promotion restrictions and I trying hard to follow them as much as I can: if I feel like I did too much posting my own stuff I try to compensate posting and commenting  something valuable, interesting or entertaining for people to know. It's just that reddit is an amazing place for finding people that might actually care for what you do with passion. I value that much more then the fact that one of my videos once grabbed thousands of views on a hype wave as I know I was not able to do it both quick and efficiently - it never gained me the happiness or fun that I value in what I do. For me it is indeed about the community aspect and for some reason reddit is the only thing that I really like to share with - I generally suck with most of the other social networks because it always feels kinda awakward. Especially since being a bit bad with social skills I've only joined some of the major social networks recently. In fact Reddit might be the oldest social network I actually joined willingly (although it still took me roughly a year to become more active). 

The content I make is of independent filmmaking kind. Takes most of my time and money but is something I'm so passionate about that I feel totally worth it blowing most of my money on filming and then barely having money for food. Been filming the feature film since 2007 on no budget. One web-series since 2012. Despite it gained rather lacking views it is something I like too continue so I doing it anyway. So, closing in on the actual reason I was writing this - I've released a micro-episode for the afore-mentioned web-series today (won't give any links here as it's not the point). I've posted it to a couple of subs that liked the previous episode. It gained three upvotes. I was happy about it as if it's more then ""1"" (me myself) it means I was able to do something interesting for at least one human being.

Then I've got banned. I tried to contact the mods, apologizing, explaining myself and asking whether the reason why I was banned was self-promotion. I received the letter which, despite it was quite a pleasant day of filming the new stuff made me feel like shit. And made me write it just because I wanted to ask other people - do I really look like that?.. 

Here it is:
""as it was not my intention""
**Yeah, no.
Just looking at your profile and we knew what your intention are : self-promotion.**
""firstly, I'm rather terrible at math""
**that is no excuse**
""I post something of my creation I usually follow that with a whole string of other posts""
**First, this shouldn't supose to work that way. Reddit isn't for self-promotion, it's a community. The 10% rule is there so people can also post content, not the other way around.
We dont want you to shitpost and smam to meet the 10% required and be able to post your content.**
""Secondly, though, it is hard""
**Not my problem**
*Note: I've explained that I have a subreddit dedicated to my studio, where subscribers actually expect to receive latest stuff with me and/or made by me*
""because guys there kinda liked the previous episodes.""
**I dont care, you dont respect the rules.**
""but for small-time creators like me 3 or so upvotes actually matter""
**I know, that why there's this actual 10% rule : to keep spammer and self-promotion out of reddit. I'm sorry, but reddit isn't a tool for you to use. It's a community.
I'm going to have to ban you since you dont seem to want to follow our rules.**

Quotes and notes are mine, responses in bold are of one of the mods. Sorry for formatting - it went wrong somewhere. Don't judge his English, BTW - he's frankophone so English probably is not his native language (neither it is mine: I'm from Ukraine, a professional translator and yet some failures happen to me too so sorry if you noticed something is off). I should say though, that I went to his page to see whether he follows the rules himself (that is a bonus AITA - am I?). He did, but mostly because he seemingly comments on anything with insights like ""lol"", which are my definition of ""shitpost"" but I'm not here to judge him for that either. Because at the end of the day I am in bad need of knowing whether I look like a jerk and it has nothing to do with him. 

Sorry for a large text (bonus AITA yet again, hm). It's just that each thing I hear or read like that hurts me a bit and I remember every single one of them starting with my early childhood. At times I'm actually afraid to talk to people because I feel that I might somehow hurt their feelings. Each time I send an e-mail I'm a bit afraid that people will either not answer or answer with something like that mod wrote. And when the latter actually happens I remember every single wrongdoing, however slight or intentional, I did in my life.

1823,not the a-hole,"Back while we were still dating, my (long distance) ex [28M] and I [22F] made plans to travel together for a few days in November for an event that’s important to him. I broke up with him in the summer and when that happened, I assumed I wasn’t going anymore. However, when we talked more about it a few months ago, he said he assumed I was still going and that he still wanted me to go, because he wouldn’t go if I didn’t go. I told him okay, but I wanted to be clear that the trip didn’t mean we were getting back together or anything like that. He said he understood. His plan was to pay for everything, as I’m a student and he works full-time. 

About two weeks ago he moved to an area closer to where I live for work, so we decided to get lunch together as friends. Lunch itself was fine but in the days afterwards, he kept messaging me and I realized that he may have had different expectations regarding meeting up. I decided that I needed space from him.  

I called him and told him that I was sorry and that I needed space from him, but during the conversation, I did not explicitly say I wasn’t going on the trip (it didn’t come up at all). He texted me later and said “you’re still going, right?” So I called him again, told him I wasn’t going, and apologized. He was upset because he’d paid for a lot of the trips amenities in the interim (since I told him I was going a few months ago). He then found out he couldn’t get refunds for a least part of it, and he was pissed. I offered to pay him back, and he said he wouldn’t accept it because he knows I don’t have much money. He told me I was being cruel and inconsiderate for not going, and that most people would just suck it up and go. After about an hour of this, I told him I would think about it and let him know. 

I figure that I’m the asshole for not immediately going no-contact after breaking up with him, and probably also the asshole for agreeing to go a few months ago (and maybe also for getting lunch). But AITA if I don’t go now? I honestly don’t want to go, but I don’t want to be unfair to him either. 

**Edit:** Thanks everyone for the discussion here. It gave me a lot to think about. I've let him know that I'm definitively not going, so then he blocked me, so the situation is resolved. ",31,58,0.97
1824,not the a-hole,"So I'm driving to the gym at 2 in the morning, and of course it's pretty dark out. I'm slowing down to stop at an intersection so I can turn left, and a biker on the the sidewalk to my right flies by me. He/she was inches away from my car, and if I had been decelerating any slower they would've hit me. 

This infuriated me because not only were they on the sidewalk biking, they were on the wrong side of the road for the direction they were going. If this person hit me it could've done a ton of damage to my car, plus I would have to go through the hassle of filling out an accident report at the DMV.

 So after I turn left and I catch up with the person, I roll down my window and scream ""GET THE FUCK OFF THE SIDEWALK!"" in the loudest, scariest voice I can muster. The person turned and around and appeared to be really startled before I passed him/her.

Am I the asshole or was this justified?

Update: 
BF came home after getting our daughter last night and apologized for not considering what I'd want to do. He said he just got really excited talking to his buddies and wanted to do everything they wanted to do- consigning me in the process. He promised to carve out some us time and on Monday go do something in our own if I still wanted to. I think he's reeling it back in. Thanks guys ;) I didn't end up having to reiterate my side but nice to know I'm not an asshole ha!


So my boyfriend and I,  and a few of his friends from work and their spouses are going on vacation to New Orleans this coming week for Halloween. At first I thought the group would be 2 or 3 other people but I didn’t ask for a guest list either. He said “Bobby his wife, and maybe Joe are coming.” Then the next day “oh Jim is gonna have fun at XYZ place”  Now it’s 7/8 people. I have anxiety issues being around new people or even groups Of people I know. I wouldn’t say it’s debilitating but my stomach gets upset knowing I’m going to be around them. Headache, sweating, etc. We’ve dated for going on 8 years. This is nothing new. I thought this will be fun even though it’s more people than I liked. I’ll give it a good chance. 

It’s also worth mentioning I’ll miss taking my daughter trick or treating over this. So I’m already heart broken. 

Ok about the financing- My boyfriend paid for the hotel through his friend making a group reservation.  And while I originally paid for the flights he paid me back on his own.  He will probably pay 95% of our expenses there. 

I was under the impression that about 60% of the time would be with the group and the rest we could kinda of explore on our own. Well as he has been excited and talking about it I’ve pieced together that we will not being doing anything on our own and that any spur of the moment things we do will be with the group. I’m already getting a headache thinking about having to follow these people around all week. I have only met 2 of them on one or two occasions.  He asked if I wanted to go on a graveyard tour so he could coordinate it with Bobby. Well yes I’d love to but I don’t want to go with Bobby and his wife. I want to go with my boyfriend. And every single day is schedule for something to go to. A huge seafood festival- I don’t eat seafood. 

Then today he mentions how can’t wait to go on a bar crawl.. and I said to him “what about me screams bar crawl?” And he says well that’s what we’re doing most of the time going to different bars, etc.  while I’m not against drinking I don’t really like to, I can’t hold my alcohol and I get headaches easily. It just doesn’t sound enjoyable to me. 

So now I’m going with a huge group of people I don’t know and don’t particularly care for but have no problem with bc they are bfs work friends. And we’re going to do all these things with them. And they will be included in our plans. All of this I was willing to just go along for the ride- maybe feign a headache at some-point and play hooky at the hotel. And that would have been kind of disappointing for me but not the end of the world. 

Then,  I don’t quite remember the phrasing bf used but it was essentially if I don’t want to go to the bars I can go wait at the hotel. And I repeated back to him “so if I don’t want to go on a bar crawl 4 days straight my other option is to wait at the hotel?” And he started getting upset with me “No your’e an adult you can do whatever you want”. The conversation ended up getting heated while we were out to eat dinner. To the point where I was holding back tears. Bc I feel like this is just turned into “ you can come with us or not but if you don’t I’m gonna be pissy at you if you don’t” 

I feel like he’s missing the point. It’s not any one thing it’s that this “vacation” has turned into a huge long bar crawl with his work friends broken up by a seafood festival? I’m going to a new town! I want to explore and meander and try new things.. not follow a group around.  I would have been happy with any effort to do something with me, or even a “I didn’t realize you felt that way,  we’ll see how it goes and if on Monday you need space we will do that” 

But nope he dropped me off at home and told me to go inside so he could go get our daughter from his moms.  Now I’m super hurt and I don’t know if I’m being a jerk for not being more grateful or if he should be a little accommodating. Help me! Am I the asshole?

1827,not the a-hole,"This was this morning.

For about 2 weeks there has been a plan that some friends, my girlfriend and I would meet downtown today at 10:00am sharp to go out for my birthday. My girlfriend and I went to bed last night and set an alarm for 8:30. 10:00am sharp had been reiterated many times to all of us as we are in a group chat and hang out every day. I got up just before 8:30 and woke my girlfriend up with me. ""Let's get up! I'm gonna go inside and shower!""(we live in a camper on someone's property and must use their shower.) My girlfriend to wake her up when I got back. I asked if she was sure and if that's enough time for her. She assured me it was enough time and I reluctantly said okay. 
Unfortunately I suffer from IBS. Mornings aren't the best time for me and I spend a good amount of time on the toilet. After I had showered I came back to our camper and woke her up. She was difficult to motivate to say the least. It's pretty cold outside of our cozy, warm blankets.
She went in and showered, I went out and got us coffee and a breakfast sandwich, came back and she was getting ready. I asked ""still good for 10?"" And I was met with a very frustrated attitude. She said it was my fault that I woke her up so late and that she didn't have enough time to get ready. I said ""10:00am has been the plan the whole time. It shouldn't be my responsibility to wake you up and make sure you have enough time to get ready."" I explained to her how I was having one of my usual IBS mornings and that I can't really help it, it's out of my control. She's still aggravated because she had to rush.

1831,asshole,"Hey guys, 

I try to keep it as short as possible but I have to tell some background story. 

Basically, I know my sisters girlfriend since high school and we used to be cool with each other, like sitting next to each other in class and stuff. She was already in a relationship with her current boyfriend/fiancé back then (were talking high school graduation class of 2007).

Anyway, after high school our ways part and by chance I get to be in a relationship with her sister a couple years later, which makes us see each other more often again. 

Now, the thing with her sister and her boyfriend is that she is very career driven. Whenever they achieve something they’re like the proudest people and the whole word has to know. I already hated that about her in High School. They like to talk about themselves a lot. I get that I am not a real part of the family, but here is one thing that irks me. They never ask me how I‘m doing in life, what I‘m currently at. Never.

Further, her fiancé is like an old man in a young mans body. He’s been that way ever since high school. He grew up very poor and is therefore absolutely envious of everybody that has more than him, especially if its coming from their family (his family basically abandoned him). So, since I am from a more normal family background he dislikes me for that first and foremost. Second, he never asks me to partake in anything that just the men do at family gatherings. For instance, up until last year the third sister in the family had a boyfriend, and fiancé and little sisters boyfriend used to always go outside for I don’t know, checking out cars or just a walk without asking me. Plus, fiancé had to always crack a joke about me. F that guy. 

Now the sister, since she’s very career driven her work gave her the chance to travel to the UK for a conference. Since she’s not the smartest, she didn’t know which visa to get and what not. I actually work in the travel industry and helped her out a lot with what to file, where and so on. Like this went on for a couple of weeks and then her travels came. She even sent me a picture on Facebook of her in front of Big Ben. But what I find a little disappointing, she didn’t even ask me if she could bring me a souvenir or anything from back there. She brought a thing for everybody in her family. Except for me which I get because I’m not a real part of the family. But I don’t know that hurts, especially since I helped her a lot.

Another thing is, for two years straight they didn’t get me anything for my birthday. And that is definitely not normal since they’re all very big about birthdays in the family. Like early this year, my GF was out of town and I still attended both the sisters and the fiancés wedding and bought presents for them. They didn’t get me anything. 

There’s a million more stories of why I don’t want anything to do with them, but basically I now came to the conclusion that I’m gonna say hi and hello at family gatherings and maybe answer when they ask me something but I will ignore them from now on. My girlfriend says I’m acting like an asshole for that. Am I the asshole? ",11,31,0.83
1832,not the a-hole,"This literally just happened, and I have a feeling I am to blame to some extent.

For about a month my roommate at college let me and my other roommate know that his girlfriend was going to come to visit and stay for a few days. Everyone was okay with it. 

Flash-forward to today: she arrives in the afternoon, and they're together talking and stuff the whole time.  She's sitting in his lap, they're laughing together, all that stuff. Meanwhile, the other roommate is out,  and i'm sitting in bed watching the Astros game, waiting for it to finish. Then they get in his bunk together and lie together under the covers. I'll admit, it's kinda weird. 

My plan had been to leave to eat dinner after the game, so once it ended, I got up and said I was leaving. I put on my shoes and grabbed my keys, but then I figured I might put some condoms on his desk underneath the bunk, half as a joke and half jic. (maybe not the best joke.) I told him as I left the door ""I left you something useful under your ID card "" (where I put it) and he responded ""That's fucking disgusting"" as I walked out the door. Harsher than I expected, but sometimes he can get really annoyed so I chalked it up to that. He was high anyway. 

As I got my food at the restaurant i'm sitting at now,  he sends me a bunch of angry texts saying that I was fucking disrespectful, that I have no say in what they do in their relationship, and that I don't have the right to think that's funny. He added that it made him and his girlfriend very uncomfortable, but sometimes I don't know if he's exaggerating. I apologized but said that I didn't mean to suggest they do anything, and he said that I did. 

How much of an asshole am I?  I don't want to quote too many of the texts, but he was furious, and I didn't think it would be that bad. Just yesterday as the Dodgers got into the World Series, I commented that if the Astros get in, I'd root for them instead, and he got pissed and told others that I said I hoped that the Dodgers would get swept. (he added later that he's been stressed by the week)

Edit: Thanks for the response. I apologized to his girlfriend while he wasn't there, and she said it was okay. I mentioned that it seemed like my roommate got really pissed, and she laughed and agreed. I got the sense she wasn't as uncomfortable as my roommate said she was, if at all. ",42,51,0.96

1834,not the a-hole,"I'm an art teacher and as such I'm occasionally asked to make artwork for other teachers. Usually this is a one-time thing like a t-shirt design or poster and I almost always do it if it won't take too long or cut into the time I need to do my job.  
  
There's one teacher though that continuously asks me to make designs for him. Last year alone I did 3 posters and I think 2 different shirt designs, each one with multiple edits. Again at the time it wasn't too big a deal because it also benefited more than just his students.  
  
This year though it feels like he's come to just expect that I can do whatever he needs whenever he needs it. He's also not even bothering to say thank you to me any more. Usually he'll just throw a few random insincere complements at me, ask me for something, ask for edits, then nothing. For the amount of time I spend on his requests it seems reasonable that he would at least say thank you, even via email. At this point it kind of feels like he's using me.

1835,everyone sucks,"So, a bit of context. My ex-girlfriend and I had been dating for 3 years and about a week before the break up I confided in her in a really personal anecdote about my dad's abuse. I still live with my dad (mostly for my sibling's sake) and we don't have a really good relationship.

My ex lives with her sister for half of the year and her sister absolutely adores her. In her sister's mind she can do no wrong, but her sister is also very controlling and doesn't like me at all. Everyone my ex hangs out with (that isn't a mutual friend of ours) is her sister's friend and my ex often feels pressured to binge drink and do drugs when they are all out partying (even though she doesn't like it). 

When she told me she wanted to break up, I was obviously very hurt, but I didn't cling on to it because I had seen it coming for a while. She let me ask her a few questions and we talked for a bit about how to best handle giving our mutual friends the news and then it happened... 

We were wishing each other the best in our lives and then my ex said ""Yeah good luck to you. With a dad like that, you'll need it."" I felt like that was REALLY inappropriate of her to say, especially when I had only just confided in her about his abuse. It felt like she was holding it against me or something. I was obviously really angry and replied back ""Yeah, you too. Call me when your sister let's you be your own person."" She got REALLY pissed and left immediately and blocked me everywhere. We haven't talked since and I did send her an apology over FB, but have decided to leave her alone.

I feel like I could have been the bigger person and not have said anything, but I felt like what she said was really inappropriate given the conversation/context.",28,80,0.93

She had really bad bangs. I'm not going to post a picture for privacy's sake but just trust me, they were bad. I decided to have a little fun and say ""Fuck what you heard, you can't pull off bangs"". It was a minor roast that I thought was funny. So I took a screen shot and posted it in a private group chat among friends where people roast each other and make jokes all the time. Well nobody seemed to find it as funny as I did. They all said I was fucked, an asshole, a dick and that I might of made that girl depressed and what not. I didn't think what I did was that mean but the group chat seems to think so. So what does Reddit think?

EDIT :  So I think the consensus is pretty clear.  I’m an asshole.  I kinda already knew that.  Anyway I sent the girl a heartfelt apology,  and she did not respond and promptly unmatched with me.  So I guess the story ends here.

1839,not the a-hole,"Technically are WE the Assholes?

So my husband’s Grandma died and left him some money. Not that much but enough for us to put with our savings and buy a second property as an investment. We’ve just had an offer accepted. 

We plan to move into the new place which has a workshop attached for my husband, Jeff, to work on his motorbikes and rent out our existing place, which is bigger and likely to make more $ in rent.

He told his family and his brother is pissed! 

His brother, who we’ll call Brad, is about 10 years older and used to part-own our existing house. 

See, when Jeff was 15 he came to live with Brad for family reasons. Jeff, Brad and their Mum bought our existing house for Jeff and Brad to live in, but Brad moved away after about 4 years and has been traveling and working abroad since. 

I met Jeff just after Brad moved away and then moved in with him after a couple of years with Brad’s blessing. We started covering the mortgage ourselves and after we got engaged agreed to buy the house off of Brad and Mother-in-Law, seen as we wanted to get on the property ladder, already lived there, and Brad had no interest in moving back in. 

This didn’t happen for a couple of years, not for lack of us pushing. Brad is a hoarder (he’d admit this) and doesn’t like to get rid of anything.

During this time we were stuck in limbo, unable to move house or buy the existing one, all the while contributing to a mortgage which was only one third Jeff’s. 

We finally completed last year and are no longer financially tied to him. It still took him another 6 months to sort out the room full of stuff he had left with us, which is now in our attic.

So, back to present day and our situation has changed. We’re starting a family, and need somewhere with better vehicle access and a workshop for Jeff. It makes more financial and practical sense to move and rent the existing place, rather than buy somewhere else to rent out. We’d always wanted to do this at some point, but now we have the inheritance it’s possible now. 

We haven’t heard from Brad in ages as he’s away travelling, and hasn’t often replied to Jeff’s messages. Jeff can’t remember the last time they managed to speak on the phone. 

When we had the offer accepted Jeff text his family. Brad came back saying he would have liked to have been told we wouldn’t be living in [existing house], because he has an emotional attachment to the place and wouldn’t have sold it to us if he knew we wouldn’t be living there.

We thought he would have been happy for us. He’d never suggested buying Jeff out, or moving back, or any alternative to us buying it. We’d have owned it 3 years ago if it were up to us. If he’d seriously not wanted to sell it, we’d probably have bought somewhere else three years ago. 

We really get on with Brad, but I think he has some deep seated issues that Jeff owes him for letting him come and live with him. He’s told me that he’s sick of the special treatment Jeff gets off their Mum. 

I feel like he thinks we have to ask his permission to move? Are we the assholes for deciding to move and rent the place out? Are we assholes for not consulting him?

TLDR Bought house off brother-in-law. Moving out and renting it out after a year. B-I-L pissed he wasn’t consulted. AITA?",11,35,0.97

My dad invites me to sit with him and eventually everyone is asking me to play something, I try to protest as I am extremely shy and was not comfortable but the guitar gets passed to me anyway and I just half-ass the start of Stairway to Heaven.

So about 6 weeks ago, I was throwing a drive on a very short hole (172') at Wrighstville Beach. This hole (hole 7) has a straight line at the basket, and a window for a big hyzer.
I always throw the big hyzer. So I throw My bt hard harp but grip lock it in perfect WTF Richard fashion and it just sails into the woods, about parallel with the tee box. I was playing in league and decided to go back for it later, and since my name was on it I wasn't worried about someone finding it first. The course has a lost and found and they actually call most of the time.
So flash forward to yesterday (State Finals at Brewster Ridge/ Fox Run). We're all putting in between rounds and my harp lands at my feet. I instantly recognized it, but the guy who was (pathetically) putting with it was walking up to get it. I said, ""hey does that harp have a name on it?"" Dude picks it up, and reads my name to me. I snatch it out of his hand and say ""Thanks, why didn't you call?"" He says ""I thought I did"". I replied, ""Karma, dude."" Fuck him, right, I was angry and rather than elevate tensions, I related to him how I lost it. Then he says, ""Yeah my buddy found it way deep in there. I traded him my pro shark for it.""
What the fuck??
I just said, ""Well you better go get your shark back.""

1848,not the a-hole,"Edit: Thanks guys! I am feeling a lot better about this. It seems like the majority of people do not think that the act of complaining about the food I was served was an asshole move. Still, it's been pointed out multiple times, and I have to admit, that I overreacted to the whole thing. I have some personal issues when it comes to food and insults that have nothing to do with anybody else on this website. Sometimes people agree with me and sometimes people won't. But I don't need to get so stressed and upset, worrying that people don't like me.

I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/76h0tj/god_i_hate_weddings_literally_unseasoned_slabs_of/?st=J8U9MWD3&sh=b4fa7b5f) about an awful meal I had at a wedding. Admittedly the title is bitching about how I hate weddings because I can't eat what I'm served. From my perspective, I was posting anonymously so it would never hurt my cousins, I was clear in the comments (I can't write a summary and attach a pic) that this was a failing on the restaurants part and that I felt awful my cousins spent a ton of money and got crap out of it. 

The other perspective I'm getting is that I'm being really ungrateful for a free meal. I don't see it as a free meal. I see it as a meal my family paid for and didn't get what they were promised. 

I have some real issues around eating. Anorexia, but not nervosa. My body sends extremely strong signals not to eat in general but certain foods can be gag-inducing. It stems from some pretty awful medical abuse so I'm super sensitive about the whole thing. It is really embarrassing when I can't eat a food some gives to me out of love so I thought (right or wrong, you tell me!) that when I got an objectively bad plate, it would be okay to bitch. 

Because I'm so sensitive about it, I know I was cranky with a few commenters so I will completely accept that. But am I the asshole for complaining?",32,64,0.81

I noticed his eggs were still on low heat by accident making them take longer. I raise the temperature and to make it hurry, I fold the eggs inward to have the still runny parts pour onto the pan. He noticed and asked what I was doing. I just explained how i found that little thing on a vid as I wanted to learn different ways to cook eggs and little techniques.

""Thats sad,"" he tells me, ""You got to look up how to cook eggs.""

No, of course I already knew how to cook eggs. Our mother taught me. I just wanted to learn different styles of eggs to possibly make on the future.

Which i explained to him.

""But still thats just sad,"" he repeats.

I didn't think anything of it as it was purely coincidental that we had both made plans to go to the same restaurant at the same time.  I show up to the restaurant with no plans to interact with him or distract him in any way.

In another crazy swoop of coincidence, we ended up getting seated at the table directly adjacent to them.  We exchanged a quick glance and smile but didn't interact the rest of the night.

I didn't think anything of this until our third roommate, Colin, accused me of being an asshole for not suggesting that my family and I go to a different restaurant so as not to be a distraction to Ryan on his date.

I don't believe I am the asshole here as it was a pure coincidence that we ended up having plans to go to the same restaurant at the same time on the same night.  I don't feel that it would have been fair to the rest of my family to uproot their dinner plans that we had for a couple weeks because of my roommate that they barely even know.  

The only thing I feel I could have done differently was request that we move tables once we got seated, but I didn't want to create a scene which I thought might be a bigger distraction then if we had just sat down and gone about our business.

But the idea of going to be a distraction to his date never crossed my mind.

A few weeks ago the other three housemates told us that we were being inconsiderate because we were so often in the common space.
They assured us that it wasn't because we were doing anything particularly annoying in the common space, just that we were there so often. 

This really shocked me. I figured that the common space is always fair game, as long as you aren't being too loud, always taking up the whole couch so other people couldn't use it etc. I thought that if you want your alone time, you just stay in your room.

1857,not the a-hole,"My husband and I are at gentle odds about this. 


Background: He's been close friends with Jane since they were 13 years old. He and Jane bonded over shared difficult home lives (of varying degrees; her more than him) and spent many nights sneaking out of their respective homes to smoke, drink, and talking all night. My husband was the first person that Jane came out to and she considered my husband her platonic soul mate (he used to say the same thing until he met me; relevant to her dislike of me).


However, when my husband first started dating me, he quit smoking within a month because I hate cigarettes and he was honestly just pretty nuts about me. Jane kind of flipped out. She accused him of changing and me of being an uptight snob, blah dee blah early 20s kind of nonsense. They patched up their friendship to an extent, but she and I have never quite gotten past our initial dislike of each other. But we co-exist when we see each other once or twice a year because I respect her friendship is important to my husband. She still can't quite bring herself to call me his ""wife"" but has at least upgraded me from his ""friend"" to his ""lady."" So definitely still some animosity there on her side and my husband always corrects her when she goes too far. But overall I see her like any annoying in-law that you just have to put up with due to history and the ties that bind.


We're all in our 30s now and my husband and I have a new baby girl. We'll be heading back to my husband's hometown soon and certainly seeing Jane. This is where I'm getting nervous about yet another unnecessary tiff about the topic of goddamn smoking, but I also feel like my husband should have my back. He thinks I'm being too rigid.


Jane is still a very heavy smoker with a bit of a chip on her shoulder about it. She feels like hating on smokers is an accepted prejudice and that no one respects her right to put whatever she wants into her body. I don't disagree with this, actually--smokers can do what they want, but that doesn't mean I have to like smoke being blown in my face. To me, it's about basic courtesy. But she gets angry whenever someone says anything even remotely anti-smoking, saying that people should mind their own business. 


For example, the last time she and I briefly tussled over a cigarette related issue was a few years ago when I mentioned cigarette littering as one of my biggest pet peeves (in a big social group that Jane happened to be in...all our convos are not smoking related, I swear :p) I recalled an anecdote about when my puppy almost ate a full, still smoldering cigarette that someone had thrown on the ground. I said that I knew cities didn't always provide adequate places to dispose of cigarettes properly, but that I still thought the onus was on smokers to at least try. Jane became extremely agitated about how ""entitled"" I am, saying that I wanted to burn the whole city down (because of burning cigs in trash cans, I guess; straw man) and that I was being prejudiced against smokers. I basically ceded her point in order let it go because I didn't want to ruin the night.


But now, the reality is that our pediatrician told us that 3rd hand smoke is considered a burgeoning SIDS risk and overall is just not good for their little lungs. This means that if someone holds our baby and their clothes/hands/etc smell like smoke, the baby is inhaling the leftover smoke and carcinogens. She recommends that all smokers wash their hands and face, as well as put on a clean shirt prior to interacting with our daughter. The smokers in our families have happily obliged.

We know Jane will not. She absolutely smells like cigarettes all the time, but doesn't care. If asked to accommodate our girl, she will freak out and say that all of her nieces and nephews are ""fine"" and that we're being prejudiced (her favorite turn of phrase). This isn't in question and it isn't even worth asking her.

So my solution is to not let Jane hold our daughter, period. Say that daughter is fussy or going through a Mommy/Daddy only phase, that she prefers being in her carrier, whatever. Just don't let Jane hold her because it isn't worth the risk. She can still meet her and say hi to her, but if she's going to be so hard-headed about this issue, this is one of the consequences of that choice.


My husband thinks that Jane will see through that in seconds and that it isn't fair to deny her the opportunity to fully interact with our daughte. He thinks that the time our daughter will spend with Jane will be so brief anyway that the risk is essentially nil. And at the end of the day, he wants to share his joy with his oldest friend, even if she and I aren't on great terms. He also thinks that I'm looking for reasons not to let Jane get close to our daughter because I get so frustrated with her and dislike her in general. Which, yeah, in my pettiest moments, I do think that if Jane has such a problem with me, she doesn't get the privilege of a close relationship with my daughter. But I do try to overcome that because she really is a good friend to my husband, in the sense that their shit goes so deep that it transcends the issues she and I have with each other (and my husband is always in my corner, if she ever gets overly testy. Everyone knows that.)


So what's the verdict? Am I being overly petty or rigid by wanting to follow the pediatrician's recommendations to the letter here (by not letting someone who is unwilling to cooperate with the directives hold our daughter), knowing that it won't go well with my husband's oldest friend (who he recognizes is difficult, but still loves like family)? Or is my husband being overly lenient because he doesn't want to take a stand (even when his daughter's health is potentially at stake) and kowtowing too much his old friend (who has been consistently a bit of a bully)?",111,130,0.91

But some people want to ask if they'd be an asshole if they do something they're currently only contemplating.   Others think it would be interesting to start a discussion about what some fictional characters did in a book, or TV show, etc.  This isn't necessarily trolling; it could come from a genuine interest in seeing a  hypothetical conflict discussed...an attempt to learn what would be right or wrong if it ever came up.

So we thought we should ask you, the subscriber, if we should allow hypothetical posts?  We recognize that many dislike the idea, so I suggest we make the submitter mark this sort of submission as [HYPOTHETICAL], so anyone who doesn't want to waste time on these things can skip it, and look for [AITA] posts.

Examples:

1.  **[HYPOTHETICAL] My friend's GF gave us owners' box tickets to a baseball game at Yankee Stadium. Would I be the asshole if I wore my Orioles hat to the game and refused to take it off when asked by staff?** (Yes, this is a Seinfeld plot).


2. **[HYPOTHETICAL] My wife cheated on me with a string of dudes while I lived out of town working a construction project to help pay her way through college, among other things, and now that she has graduated, I find out she has changed the locks and wants a divorce.

1863,not the a-hole,"There are a lot of nuances to this situation - some that I may have to leave out if I don't want this to become a full essay - so please bear with me and feel free to ask questions if anything is unclear.

I'll call my two friends Joe and Bill. For about a year I was in a very dysfunctional, borderline-abusive relationship with Bill. 

I don't entirely want to get into all of the details as it'd take me probably a novel to list all of it, but Bill has accidentally-on-purpose sexually assaulted me on multiple occasions, is a grade-A clinger NiceGuy™, and manipulated me through extreme guilttripping into staying with him. 

I didn't even realize the extent of the abuse until I confided in our mutual friend, Joe, who was incredibly supportive and honestly really sweet to me. He was infuriated with Bill and stopped talking with him altogether as his abusive behavior distorted his view of him.

Joe helped me muster the strength to get out of my dysfunctional relationship with Bill, who I was able to distance myself from for a great while. He took the breakup surprisingly maturely and gave me the space I needed.

However, in fear of him stalking me or otherwise harassing me - we live unnervingly close - I didn't have the backbone to completely cut Bill out of my life. I decided to distance myself from him, but I wasn't ready to face whatever shitstorm of drama might've come if I tried to completely boot him from our friend group. Our other mutual friends still liked him, after all, it'd be so awkward to explain it all to them. Even still, this was probably a very poor decision on my part and I should've ghosted him, but after hearing stories of what abusers tend to do when their victims leave them, I'm very much on edge.

Bill indeed apologized for his behavior and seemed to grow out of most of his manipulation tactics, at least for the most part. I still didn't want to be very close to him because I have a feeling he may revert to the same toxic behaviors - and he's still not an individual I really want to be associated with - but all was well.

Welp, not in Joe's opinion.

Think about it - your best friend comes to you saying she's in a hideously abusive relationship with your mutual friend. She was *sexually assaulted by him.* Your friend addressed these issues with the perpetrator, but the point still stands - your friend was still taken advantage of quite spectacularly. Chances are you're gonna be pretty fucking infuriated, even long after the fact. 

Honestly, even I'm still livid with Bill for all the things he's done to me. Sometimes I want to lash out at him as well - how can he just be acting so *normal* after all that? 

But goodness gracious, Joe must have been letting his pent-up emotions fester for a *long* time. 

The three of us were playing an online game together, as we do now and again. The entire game, Joe had been completely dead-silent as Bill and I conversed and joked around. We had been so caught up in our conversation we hadn't even noticed Joe was being so quiet. 

And then out of absolute nowhere, Joe types -

""Hey, Bill.""

Expecting a question, or something otherwise lighthearted, Bill responds.

""Heeyyy""

Clearly he was not expecting Joe's response.

""How does it feel to know that you're a felon?""

Bill stays absolutely dead-silent. He has a terrible habit of going offline every time he's met with a conflict, and I could sense that was what was about to happen. 

After a few minutes passed with no response, Joe went on.

""And you don't bother to own up to it, either. It's ironic how much of a thinskin you are.""

Still no reply. I stayed completely dead-silent as well. I felt bad for silently agreeing with what Joe had to say (though he had worded it very harshly).

""I've only been pretending to be friendly with you because I wanted to let you know what a dirtbag you are. You're an abusive, manipulative person and honestly the most loathsome person I know.""

Bill then left the game entirely and proceeded to text me very angrily, going on about how he always knew Joe was something of a sociopath. He seemed to lapse into his old guilttrippy tendencies. He went on and on about how Joe should not be ""bringing up *old shit* knowing it'll *hurt him""* and how he's trying to ""tear apart our relationship"". He also got mad at me for staying silent and not defending him (even though he didn't try to defend himself anyway).

I lost my patience with Bill and told him that he shouldn't be trying to paint himself as a victim when it's clear that Joe and I have some underlying resentment and problems that need to be resolved. In the heat of the moment, I said that I agreed with some of what Joe said, and that he shouldn't have left the game when we clearly needed to talk about what was going on.

I immediately felt terrible because despite all he's done, I know that Bill is a person with feelings, and what Joe said to him had to have hurt like hell - he straight-up called him a dirtbag. Joe absolutely went overboard, but even still, he's kind of right in a few respects. Bill has sexually assaulted me and had me trapped in a relationship I wouldn't wish upon anyone. 

Bill never replied to what I said, but texted me the next day, completely changing the subject and refusing to address what has happened. Thus far he is acting as if everything is completely normal and nothing has happened at all.

1866,not the a-hole,"Small set-up. My wife and I went to a movie today. At this particular theater you buy your tickets and simultaneously select your seats via a map interface of the theater you'll be sitting in. This map shows which seats are taken and which are available and you MUST select an assigned seat.

Okay, set-up over. After buying food, we walk to our theater. Our assigned seats are right behind the handicapped seating as you walk into the room. We see a couple in our seats and we look at them for a moment. We talk quietly to ourselves, ""I'm positive these are our seats..."" We approach to the couple and they immediately tell us it's their seats.

 Okay, whatever, I'm not gonna fight over seats but here's the problem, now we go find seats a few seats over. I specifically remember these seats were taken on that seat map so now I'm telling my wife that we need to move. She goes back to the couple that stole our seats and she shows them the tickets with the assigned seating and shows them the seat numbers marked on the chairs. She tells them that we will only ask them to move if the other people come for the seats we are now currently in. I know, didn't make sense, but again, I'm not trying to fight over this. 

We sit for about 5 more minutes and ofcourse the people that are coming for the seats we are in are frail and barely can walk. I immediately rush out of the seats and we head to our actual assigned seats. We tell them we are going to take our actual seats and they grumble and stall getting up. One of them is an older man who barely can walk down the steps and that's where I feel like an asshole.

I was on a dating site looking for women (I'm a woman btw) and this woman messages me and long story short she asks if I want to have a threesome with her (23) and her boyfriend (35). Honestly, I was lonely and thought fuck it, what's wrong with having a new experience. 

The boyfriend messages me and says , ""hey, my girlfriend is at work, but I want a ""practice run"". It was sketchy, but like mentioned, I was willing. 

So I go there and have kinda shitty sex, but whatever. Later on I sleep with him again and her girlfriend. That was more fun. 

But then, I get a message from one of ""Samantha's"" friend. She says ""dude. He is a sex offender"" and gives me a link. And yup, he was. And let's just say it wasn't ""oh he peed in a park at the wrong time."" 

I was pretty upset, because I felt that is something that should be disclosed if I'm sleeping with someone. He's on the lifetime list. It was pretty messed up shit.  

I talk to him, and he said that is his own business and he didn't need to disclose that info. I felt he absolutely should have. It didn't help that he was over 10 years older than me. Yeah, I slept with him, but I wouldn't have if I knew this.

1868,not the a-hole,"About a week ago, my older sister and I were having a huge fight over who finished the pastrami in the fridge or some stupid shit like that. Later, after we had both dispersed to our respective rooms, she came banging on my door telling me she wanted to talk about the situation and ""resolve it"" and I better come downstairs now or she'll do something I wouldn't like. Naturally, I refused and told her where she could shove it. She then swept into my room like a fucking hurricane, grabbed my laptop where I was working on my medical school personal statement and smashed, and I mean absolutely obliterated, my beautiful 17.3 inch laptop against the wall. I was so shocked that I didn't say a word, just cried. 

Cue a few days later, we have a talk about what happened, and the underlying issues between that may have caused her anger (she's not crazy, I don't think she was actually mad just about the pastrami). During this talk, I apologized for not taking her feelings into account, and that I should have probably come to speak to her. All was well and fine, till I brought up the laptop she was obviously going to have to replace. Then she got this smug look on her face, and explained to me that no, she was not going to replace my laptop. Not now, nor ever. I was like ?? She explained that since I could have avoided the situation by just coming downstairs, that it's my fault my laptop was broken. I was like ?? Then she went upstairs and carried on with her day. Ok. Fine. Not a problem. 

Since then I've been thinking of a way I could get back at her: ""maybe break her brand new 50 inch TV? Nah, then I'll still have to replace my own laptop, and since she's my mom's favorite, I'll probably have to replace the TV anyways"" and so on till it hit me: I could just take her laptop, hide it, and ransom it for my laptop replacement money back. If she refuses, I'll just sell her laptop (it was worth way more than mine anyways) and replace my laptop + keep any profits.

Am I an asshole for this? Is there a better way I can get my laptop replacement money?

My daughter is attending school, and the school teacher put up a sign on the classroom door full of misused apostrophes and other grammar and punctuation errors. It it is kind of driving me mad that the person I am supposed to trust with my daughter's education, who is a native English speaker and is supposedly educated to degree standard at university, should either not know or not care about written English to this extent. I really want to speak up to get the sign fixed and prevent this sort of thing from happening again. Ideally, I would like this to happen without her thinking I am a complete dick, or even thinking that I am the problem parent she isn't looking forward to seeing.

In her defence:

* It could have been her assistant who made and put up the sign. The assistant will not have been to university and is likely to have come from a background with fewer opportunities to be educated about this sort of thing. Certainly she should have learned it at school, but I don't doubt that her school could have failed her in this way.

We got along and were close to inseparable (we also had all the same lessons), this was great and then a lot of shit happened that I won't go into because it's a really really long story but the important details of it are. A girl joined our little friendship, he liked her, she didn't want hip, he got really depressed which made her stop being friend with him but still with me, now it's just me and him.

So now it's kinda just back to what it was a year ago. Kinda, except now, he has a really bad alcohol addiction. I wouldn't really care, it's his life and he can do what he wants but whenever he's drunk he'd start acting weird or take some depression out on me. 

I initially started this departure by just distancing myself from him but as I did I realised how much happier I was when I was hanging out with other friends. One of these friends was the girl I'd mentioned before which I don't think helped that he probably knew we were still friends. 

So as I was distancing myself from him I started to realise that he didn't really ever contribute to the friendship, sure he showed up to stuff but whenever there was an issue or something it was always either me or that girl who'd try and fix it. He was always the one who'd started the problem. So last night be messaged me, saying he didn't care that I was distancing myself from him but asked why.

This was last night so I'm just sort of sat here in bed wondering if I'm in the wrong.

I wouldn't feel bad if I knew he had other friends but he doesn't really whereas I do and most of our mutual friends have already picked me over him. I don't have any ill will towards the guy just that that friendship really wasn't healthy for me compared to others. Honestly this is working as a means to vent but any opinions on who's right or what I should do would be appreciated dearly. Thanks.

Update for anyone who cares: I sent him a message telling him why it all happened and he just replied with ""sure"" which is what I was expecting and one of the reasons I didn't feel like telling him in the first place.",26,44,0.95

1878,asshole,"BACKGROUND: I work in shifts, with most of my shifts starting at 7am and finishing at 330pm. Once or twice a week I do late shifts which generally finish at 8pm (often later) and I get home after 845pm. I have a lot of dietary restrictions, which my partner knows about, and I often do the shopping to make sure I'm catered to.

STORY: I was on a late shift and was running late home from work. My partner offered to cook dinner and have it ready for me when I came home. I said thank you and asked him to use my low allergen packet mix. When I got home (at 850pm) he had not used the one I asked him to use and I couldn't eat the meal he'd prepared because of all the stuff in it that hurts my tummy. I was annoyed because at 9pm I was in the kitchen cooking dinner because he chose not to listen to what I said.

Yesterday I was on an hour long drive with my wife and I decided to track how often she touches her phone while driving.

In an hour and 8 minutes she touched her phone 37 times

Most times where just her checking a text message that came, some times she responded to the text message, and a few times she was just getting some bonus to a slot machine game that popped up with a notification 

At the end of the day, i showed my wife the spreedsheet I had on my phone of all the times she touched her phone while driving and she went nuclear on me.

She yelled and screamed at me about how I betrayed her trust and treated her like a child and that I don't respect her

My issue is that she is the one that takes our son to and from school most days, how many times is she using her phone while driving our son around?

1881,not the a-hole,"Throwaway because I don’t want this coming back to me.

I work in a retail job as a key holder. There’s a coworker (we’ll call her Sally) that I don’t particularly care for, not personally but professionally. She’s lazy, she never pulls her own weight and she always has a medical excuse as to why she can’t lift more than 2 pounds. The rest of us are left to pick up her slack because she’s too busy popping pills and eating yogurt in the back office to work.

Recently our store manager sent our department manager( I’ll call him Bill) an email that anyone with access to email could read regarding Sally not clocking out for her lunch breaks. Over the course of a month, she didn’t clock out for her break once. That’s 30 “Free” minutes a day for a month. The email instructed Bill to talk to Sally about this.

From what I know of the situation, this is technically considered time theft. She knowingly took a lunch and made it obvious she was taking one. Our LP manager is the last person I want to get sideways with and I’m worried that by our manager having sent the email to a “public” place, I could be held accountable for knowing about it and not saying anything. 

But I also don’t want to be petty about things. I don’t like the lady but I also don’t want to just screw her over for no reason. But I am worried about keeping myself clean.

AITA for thinking of reporting this?

TLDR; Coworker is stealing time, undecided about reporting her.

Update 5 Oct 2017- Our LP manager got wind of what was going on during an audit we had yesterday and everyone with access to the store email got written up and coached for being complacent even though we knew about what was going on.

1882,jerk,"I live in a moderately large city and take the train two and from work. About a week ago i was standing at my stop waiting for the train and i made a popping sound with the gum in my mouth. Immediately after, a lady about 20 feet away stared me down. She looked so mad it was like I personally offended her.

I thought to myself ""Would smacking my gum really offend someone that much in a city where homeless people yell at traffic, train wheels squeal against metal rails, horns from traffic cause a subtle background to consistent engine rumble?""

So I devised an experiment to test if she was really angry at the noise. Every day I would walk up to the stop and smack my gum to see if I would get a reaction and i got nothing for 3 days. Then today I did it again and she yelled at the person she was talking to on the phone ""EVERY DAY THIS FUCKING ASSWIPE DOES IT"" as she stormed away and right now I'm feeling a little accomplished.

Granted I know that smacking gum is considered a rude behavior like picking your nose, but I personally feel that the amount of ambient noise means I am not interrupting her quiet office or classroom.  It's a city there is plenty of noise. Right?",36,58,0.92
1883,no a--holes here,"I'm a service writer at a car dealership and I also take calls to schedule the appointments. The other day I took a call from a guy looking to schedule an oil change appointment. I asked, like I always do, ""Have we seen your vehicle here before?"" so I know whether I can look them up or I need to add them into our system.

Now I've gotten unsolicited stories following that question before because, for whatever reason, people interpret it as an invitation to regale me with the tale of their entire life. This guy responded with, ""No, I live down in (some other state) but I'm up here because my brother is dying of cancer.""

Now don't get me wrong, it's horrible that his brother has been dealing with cancer for who-knows-how-long, and this guy took time away from work and his home life to come here to see his brother one last time. I get that, and I certainly feel very bad. Plus the guy doesn't sound all that old, which makes that whole matter even worse. But come on man, we're scheduling an oil change and I don't know you and this has no effect on the situation. You didn't need to bring it up at all, nevermind word it that way.

So I obviously offered my condolences as respectfully as I could and moved on with the conversation as smoothly as possible, got his appointment scheduled, and we hung up.

Fast-forward to today and he came in for the appointment. As I had suspected, he's in his mid-to-late-forties. I greeted him, recognized him from the appointment (he didn't seem to recognize me, as most people don't expect that I'm also the guy on the phone), and asked, like I always do, ""Is there anything else we need to look at while the vehicle is in the shop?"" I ask this because a lot of people forget to mention little issues until we tell them everything is done and that's when they remember and want you to pull the car back in and look at it. Well guess how he responded? ""No thanks, the oil change is all I need. I need to get going quickly because my brother is dying of cancer.""

Dude. Stop. Stop doing that. You don't need to lay such an abruptly heavy burden on every stranger you talk to at every given opportunity. But again, I responded as respectfully as I could, we got his car in, changed the oil, and I walked him up to the cashier. I thanked him for his business, walked away as the cashier began her usual ""Hello, how was your service, pay me $XX"", and what do you think I heard him do? Go ahead and guess.

The guy told the cashier that his brother is, that's right, dying of cancer. I didn't hear the context because I wasn't paying attention, but I happened to hear that phrase cut through the normal buzz of the day. Am I an asshole for thinking this guy is kind of an asshole? Like I feel less sorry for him at this point because it almost seems like he's enjoying the attention he's getting from telling people. But who just brings that up in every single conversation they have with every single person they meet? Especially wording it like that, we aren't in a soap opera man, you don't need to say that. Am I the asshole??

I'd like to note that I've gone through the ""My (family member) is dying/dead"" conversation in this business before, especially with older customers. The car is still under her dead husband's name, he can't do waiting appointments because his dying wife needs constant care, etc. But with this guy it just seemed like he wanted to say it for the sake of saying it.

Edit: I meant to mention that this guy didn't speak in a way that indicated he was angry or upset, he just said it, almost in passing.",39,135,0.96

1887,no a--holes here,"Recently, my wife and I had planned to go to a museum with our son. Leading up to the day, she and I talked about it, talked about lunch out, talked about whether we would go to other attractions while we were out. She asked repeatedly ""what time does the museum open? 9? Good, we'll be there for that time."" And I said I would make pancakes that morning ""Yeah, cool""


On Saturday, while she took our son to the library, I had tried to get groceries, and was overwhelmed by a very strange sense that I wasn't going to get anything right, that my wife wasn't going to like these beans, or this spinach, or these avocados. It took me over, and I had to leave the store. My wife HAS pointed out problems with what I've purchased in the past, but I would admit that her comments have been fair, and I need to know what ""right"" looks like before I can do it right. It's never been ""What are you, an idiot? of course I want 2 green and 2 yellow bananas."" Like, of course beans shouldn't have brown spots all over them. I discussed this with my wife after lunch, and she responded with ""That sounds intense, but I don't feel that I've made any of these comments recently"", and I agree, and we talked it out. She ended up getting groceries. Cool, thanks.


Sunday morning, I slept in until 6:45 because son wasn't awake. Wife got up and played with son while I had a quick shower, then I went downstairs and started pancakes. At some point, I realised my son was calling for help. My wife had gone into the shower. That's fine, she wanted a shower, and son can play on his own, no problem. Son came downstairs with me, I finished making pancakes, wife appeared around 8:00, we ate tasty pancakes.
Around 8:30, my wife says she needs to re-pack the diaper bag. I tell her ""Okay"" and she starts stress-bouncing around the house looking for a new bag, looking for new sub-bags for the things in the bag, etc. I got playing with my son while she buzzed around. Eventually, she finished up, and asks to speak with me in the kitchen. She tells me that her frustration this morning is the exact same as the frustration I felt at the grocery store, that she's just worried about everything going perfect, and wants to make sure that she has everything. I respond that I didn't understand how it was exactly the same, as I hadn't ever pushed the idea that the trip would or should be perfect, and never complain when we don't have anything. I am flexible. She responds ""Why can't you just say you're sorry to hear that I feel this stress?"", insists that I don't understand what she's complaining about. She then expresses that she's frustrated that we are leaving late, and not getting there when they open.


We end up going to the museum, and having a lovely time. We use some of the things from the bag, but everything we used was in the original bag, so my original plan of taking that bag would have worked out fine, except it wasn't the bag she wanted to take. There's a small miscommunication about our destination for lunch, but we push past it, and move on with our day.


THE NEXT DAY
Monday morning rolls around, and I get out of bed. My wife rolls over and says ""I'm gonna take a half day."" I make a mistake, and ask her why?. She explains that she feels exhausted from the weekend, that it was all so stressful, and she just needs to take care of herself. Again, I make a mistake by asking for clarification, and pointing out that all of the successes we ended up having, the great time we had at the museum, the way that he thanked us for it later that night, all of that should empower us and make us stronger. I was attempting to be her cheerleader, and get her pumped for her day, instead of just being a victim of it. She grumbles about it, and then says okay, I will get ready. I take her to the subway and son to school.


Monday night, she gets home, we go through the normal dinner and then bath routine, son goes to bed, wife buzzes around cleaning some things, and eventually sits down with me. She had a TERRIBLE day at work, partly because her work sucks, but mostly because she is lingering mad at me about not just saying ""I'm sorry to hear that you feel exhausted, take a day."" in the morning. I suggest that what I did was try to be her cheerleader, and I didn't force her to do anything, she made the choice to go to work. She expresses how stressed out she was today, and she should have taken the half day, and it's all frustrating. I express that ""I'm sorry to hear you had a bad day."" She says ""Well, maybe I should go to bed early."" I agree, and she gets frustrated, because if I'm willing to get behind her having some rest now, why not the half-day she was asking for. I have no words. It's probably safest that way.


Tuesday morning, usual routine, up early, shave, shower, breakfast prep, son awake and dressed. Wife appears, I say good morning, she seems frustrated. She expresses that it was frustrating having me not apologize for what I said yesterday morning. She tried to express her non-wellbeing, and I, the person who is supposed to love her, completely ignored it, and she had a bad day because of it.

We both have had things to do (of course is school life) and so we see each other when we can. When we do hang out though, we  talk for a little bit--maybe 15-20 minutes--and then she pulls out her phone and starts doing other stuff. Most of the time when she does this, she just talks to this one dude, we'll call him Isaac. I really don't care if she talks to other people, it's not my place to care because she has free-will and I really couldn't care less. The thing is what really gets me is that she also hangs out with Isaac a lot too and it sometimes feels like she'd rather be talking to him than me. It makes it uncomfortable that he invites her to parties and to go places as just the two of them. I totally understand having opposite gender friends, I really don't care at all, but I've met Issac before, and the only interactions we've had have been generally unlikable.

I told him about it and almost broke up with him over it. He acted like he didn't know what happened. I told him and he said ""what? In no way were we flirting we were just talking"". They both claim there wasn't flirting but they talked and laughed for like 3 hours together right in front of me.

1891,not the a-hole,"My wife recently attended a party with her friends, where they hired a psychic medium. Almost immediately after entering her friend's home, the psychic knew my wife's name and starting talking about her grandmother, to whom my wife was very close, and had sussed out her grandmother's nationality, my nationality (I'm Canadian), and the nickname her grandmother called her. She mentioned my sister-in-law's last name, and brought up a rocking chair that is in our living room. She also mentioned a hole in our kitchen wall (we're doing renovations)

My wife was flabbergasted and was also very emotional about all the things the psychic said about her grandmother.

Here's the thing...I'm a MASSIVE skeptic and consider psychics and mediums to be parasitic scumbags that prey on the grief of innocent people. I have very deeply-held beliefs that there is a line that should be drawn between entertainment and using deception for financial gain, and psychics disgust me.

As my wife was telling my sister-in-law about the experience (both were very emotional about it), I went on her friend's Instagram, where my wife and her friends are prominently featured in photos. Through that I got to my wife's account, where there were pictures of our home renovations and a picture of our living room...where the rocking chair can be seen. There are also many pictures of my wife and her sister, since they are very close and we live in the same city. One of the pictures is of them at my sister-in-law's wedding shower. Both standing in front of a banner that has my sister-in-law's married last name on it. There are also many pictures of us, our recent vacation (that the psychic also mentioned) and pictures of us visiting my family in Canada.

All of this deception bullshit is right out there for anyone to see, if they're willing to look. I'm furious that my wife's grief was exploited in this way, but she was very affected by the encounter and it's very clear that this has brought her some closure.

She also gets A LOT of money in disabilities services from the state - which she uses pretty liberally.  I work six jobs, and I don't make as much as she does - plus I'm in college.

It's about a $10 round trip to get to her house when I see her, and add to that when we do get together, we have to drive a ways to get somewhere to eat or hang out so I'm easily spending $15 a day to see her - not counting food for myself, etc.

1893,not the a-hole,"TL;DR: My brother is an asshole. Do I have to hang out with him?

My brother and I have always had a strained relationship. We're both in our 30's now. I just don't want to have anything to do with him. He's very odd - bi-polar, narcissistic, pathological liar, a little on the spectrum, generally an asshole to people, etc., but also very creative, which has gotten him a somewhat celebrity status. Lots of people who don't know him well love him and think he's just awesome. In the past he's said my parents/grandparents don't love me, called my wife fat, told people I work with that I'm dangerous and shouldn't be around children, (I work with kids). He once pushed my mom down. We have gotten in many physical altercations throughout the years, but these waned as we matured. 
He got sick a couple years ago and has been in an out of the hospital. His sickness was due to his own shitty life choices. He's not an addict, but his condition was absolutely avoidable - I don't want to get in to too many specifics. But he doesn't seem to want to get better. 
So this complicates things, because I'm even more obligated now than before. He doesn't work now, and hardly worked before. Our parents who retired essentially had to come out of retirement and start another business to give him a job. Now he can't work and my parents are stuck with the business. He lives in a house parents gave him, drives the car parents gave him. This is a guy who is nearly 40. He essentially mooches off my parents, even though he inexplicably has money to take lavish vacations several times a year. He will randomly do gofundmes to pay ""medical bills"", and has raised a lot of money that way. 
My parents are in complete denial about him, and desperately want us to have a good relationship. We were both raised the same, well-educated, had the same opportunities. My parents worked their asses off to make sure we had a better life than they did. I turned out successful in life, and he didn't. When he was little he got sick and had brain inflammation. My parents essentially blame all his shitty behavior on this one thing. That and his wife who came into the picture about 10 years ago, (who btw, is also college educated and for some reason only works part time at a menial job -- they don't have kids, thank god). Parents think he got worse when she came around, but he's just the same as he's always been. Actually better since he's actually seeing a psychiatrist and on meds, something my parents don't support because they're old and don't understand mental illness. They're very resentful of the wife since she hardly came to the hospital when he was sick. But really they're looking for any scapegoat besides my brother for everything that's happened. My parents know about my feelings on him, but they just don't understand.
He's difficult to be around. These days I only see him at big family events, and it's unbearable. He dominates conversations, and all family activities. My parents pamper him and wait on him hand and foot. He's often moody and picks fights. He's loud, and has poor social skills. Everyone just smiles and goes along with it. Just your typical dysfunctional WASP family, I guess
There's more but I think I hit the big points. Sorry for the long rant. It's a complex situation. 
So, do I have to have a relationship with this guy just because we happen to have the same parents? Am I the asshole here? How do I approach this situation? Even after everything, I don't want to hurt his feelings. And I know my parents will be hurt by this. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you, people of Reddit!",12,81,0.96

But he said this in a very low voice so I just assumed that he wanted his coffee because that is his daily routine. While I was preparing his coffee my voworker who was at the moment talking with the boss asked me if I heard, I said yes with ""humming"" in the beginning. Anyways I brought the coffee to my boss and out of blue he starts saying I should not ""humm"", it sounds like ""I am not going to do what he has asked for"" according to him.

For reference, I'm 24. My mom married my step dad when I was 14 and while I consider him my Dad, he was never around before I hit puberty. 

The issue is, my mom wants to switch to a hotel in one of the hotels with two beds instead of having us stay in both hotels. The other hotel room is free, so it's just a convenience thing.

My daughter-in-law and I have never really gotten along. She has always been cold with me and I don't know why. She's hard to get to know. But she is good to my older son and I love her for that.

I was surprised when my daughter-in-law got pregnant that she did not want either myself or her own mother present at the birth. That is not how I did things and I wanted all the support I could get from people I know and trust. Instead she hired a doula to coach her through. She said it was because a stranger would be less pressure. I didn't understand really but I accepted it. But I still wanted to support her and my son somehow.

When she was in labor, they asked me to feed their dog and cat. I was given a key. When I was in their home, I decided to deep clean the entire apartment. I scrubbed and organized. I changed their sheets. I put away all their clean clothes on the floor and washed, dried, folded, and put away the dirty clothes I found strewn about. I made sure there was no dog or cat hair on the floor. I vacuumed. The apartment was sparkling when I was done.

When they came home, they thanked me but I noticed my DIL was distant. She kept pulling away more and more over the next few weeks, even leaving the room when I would visit. She said that it was so she could get a break but I could tell she was upset or angry. I kept asking my son (her husband) and finally he told me that she thought it was ""presumptuous and controlling"" that I cleaned their house. He said he understood that I had good intentions, but he also feels like I made her feel bad. 

I am flabbergasted! I just wanted to help. I didn't want a new mother to have to clean her whole house when she came home from the hospital. I thought she would be grateful. I am very hurt by her response.

1898,asshole,"Hey, so I was pretty hot headed when I said what I said and I know it's an asshole thing to say, but am I the asshole when the context is added?

I've been living with my dad for 2 years. I've been to college, been unemployed and now i'm working full time while he's working half of full time (week on week off). He's a heavy cigerette smoker. 

He smokes everywhere and the smell of his strong cigarette smoke is passed onto me. To stop this, I told my dad I appreciated him helping me out, but I also told him to stop washing my clothes, stop ironing my clothes and I want to dry my clothes in a room where he isn't smoking (he would wash and iron my clothes if they are in with his).

Before I had a job, I would do my own and it would be fine, but now that I have a job, I don't really have the time to iron all my clothes so I iron what I need when I need it. I'd accidentally leave my clothes drying too long and my dad would put them in the ironing basket. 

After a few weeks of him putting clothes into the ironing basket, they stocked up and today, he started ironing them himself. I saw him ironing my stuff and I said calmly, 
""Ah dad, sure leave my stuff, I don't need them ironed"".

He then starts shouting at me telling me he's been up for hours doing my clothes, that they're just left there and I don't have the time so he wants to help (when really he just wants to get the out of the way). 
I said ""just do your stuff, separate mine and leave them for me to put in my room so they're not in your way"".
He said he's not doing that because he can't live in a house where things are just left there (again very OCD and anxious) and he asked why I don't want him to help.

Out of frustration of telling him for months not to touch my clothes, I said ""because you smell"".
obviously he was very offended, put my shirt back into the basked and said ""Well this is the thanks I get for doing your shit, you tell me I smell""
I clarified that I meant he smells like smoke and he's aware of my issues with his smoking. 

He storms off aaaaaand SCENE. 

Am I the asshole? I feel like an asshole but I did tell him not to and he did it anyway.

TLDR; Living with dad. Dad is a heavy smoker and the smell passes onto me and my clothes. I get sick of people asking if I smoke and leaving bad impressions with people so I ask my dad to stop ironing. I leave my clothes drying for too long and my dad puts clothes in the ironing basket. After leaving the clothes for too long, my dad irons them and I tell him to leave my stuff in my room because he smells of smoke. He's extremely offended yada yada yada am I a dick?

1899,not the a-hole,"On vacation. Went to GameStop Tuesday.  We don't have one in our town, and I usually just use eBay or Amazon. This store is pretty small, and there's two or three groups of high schoolers and middle schoolers scattered around.

I walk in. A dude my age (~19, maybe 20, kinda cute, colored streak in his hair, I'm female) walks up, ""can I help you find anything?""

 ""Sure, used 3ds games?"" 

He walks me over. 

""Thanks.""

Aaaand then he stands there. ""So, what are you into? RPGs?""

Ummm... ""Just... Looking for something for the ride back to our home state, thanks.""

He's still there. ""Okay, there's also used DS games over here, want me to unlock the case for you?"" 

""I'm good, thanks, just wanna look.""

""...oh. Okay."" He shuffles his feet a bit. ""Oh, hey, if you're a Nintendo fan, there's a bunch of collector stuff up front too, take a look!""

""Thank you. Appreciate it. I'll let you know if you need help.""

He kind of stares a few seconds, and then wanders off to help some kids ring up Five Nights at Freddy's. (They're super excited.)

I browse for what feels like 30 seconds and another dude, same age, dark hair, wanders up. ""Hey, can I help you find anything?"" 

""No, thanks, I'm good.""

""Oh, okay. Let me know."" Wanders off.

I find ACNL and take it to the counter, and the first boy comes to ring me up. ""So, you find everything okay?""

""Yup, thanks.""

""You a GameStop member?""

""No, thanks.""

""Oh, you mean, not, like, at all?  Well, you totally should be! There's all sorts of premium benefits like-""

""No, thank you.""

1903,not the a-hole,"This is an update to my [post made almost two years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/41rsv7/aita_am_i_the_asshole_for_not_wanting_my/) and a request for a reassessment of my assholishness based on what's happened since.


Tldr of the previous post was that my new neighbours were driving over and parking on my walkway and driveway. I wanted it to stop because they had never asked if it was okay and their truck was too big for their lot which meant they'd overhang on my walkway. They also don't have a legal driveway.


So for over a year I put up with it. I'd tell them to move their truck if the overhang was excessive and they'd tell me they'd do it later. It wouldn't happen. 


The summer wasn't so bad and I put up with it but last winter was a doozy and there was so much snow. They'd drive over the fresh snow on my driveway throughout the day while I was at work and by the time I was home to shovel it'd be compacted and icy so I had to spend hours clearing it or else I'd risk being fined by the city and not have my mail delivered to me. Light uncompacted snow could be cleared within an hour but when compacted it'd take me well over 2-3 hours and a tonne of salt (which puts my plants at risk.) I was getting pissed. 


Then in the spring I noticed that my walkway was sinking and flooding so I couldn't go in or out of my house without getting soaked. The sinking stones was in perfect alignment with their tires. So I asked my landlord if they had an easement. He said that they didn't and they shouldn't be driving over it. 


I was on good terms with their landlord so I told him my grievances and that my landlord confirmed there was no easement. He responded by saying that his tenants will be more careful of the overhang. 

It continued for a few more months so I told my landlord I wanted the problem solved as I had already reached out to the neighbours and their landlord. I mentioned in my previous post that my landlord is hotheaded and sure enough he went nuclear. Instead of talking to the neighbours he installed a barrier without notifying them. Just suddenly one day they didn't have access to a driveway.


Now here is where I need help determining if/where I am the asshole. The neighbours' landlord reached out to me asking why there was a permanent barrier and that his tenants have two toddlers and they need the driveway. I told him to contact my landlord. My landlord ended up telling him he only did it to make me happy and he will remove the barrier if I say to. Thing is, my problem is resolved so now I don't want it removed. But everyone else is unhappy with the barrier. The other tenants in my house think I'm being callous because the neighbours now have to park on the street and it's unfair as they have two small children. The barrier is also really hideous.

So how much of an asshole am I that I don't want to negotiate this any more? I don't want the ugly barrier gone (but I wouldn't mind a more attractive fence.)  My problem is solved and I really don't feel I should be more considerate of them just because of the inconvenience it created. ",48,82,0.97

The post got around 1000 likes but I got some comments telling me to be careful about posting secret/hidden spots in the page as it may draw too much attention and too many people will visit them. Am I I the wrong for posting these?

So with this in mind I also work a lot of freelance jobs and stay very busy. I decided considering all of this, to hire people to apply for jobs for me in a few cities just to see who I hear back from, and *maybe* take a couple of interviews. I feel like I should mention this involves writing a custom cover letter for each application. So to be more descriptive, I have written a general cover letter, and the people I hire change a few details to make it relevant to the specific job posting.

I was discussing this with my Aunt who says this is unethical and I am an asshole for doing that. Her claim is that it is essentially lying because it is implied that I am the author of the cover letter, and that it is wasting companies time to apply for jobs that I am not seriously considering.

1919,asshole,"For backstory, my apartment cannot handle its capacity. Internet, hot water, parking, you name it, when the apartment fills up, nobody gets enough of any of those. Parking is an especially big issue for me, since even though the apartment has a nice garage, they sold more parking passes than they have spaces. They also have a visitor lot, which tows aggressively if you don't pay. Needless to say, it's very important to me that I can get a parking space.

Well one night, this wasn't an option. It was 3am, I had just driven back and wanted to go the fuck to sleep. Circled the garage, all 3 and a half floors, completely occupied. But one occupant stood out above the rest. A nice silver generic sedan in two whole spaces. 

Now there's no way for me to get in contact with the owner, nobody gets their own assigned space, and since I wasn't gonna call a tow truck at 3am just to avoid paying for a few hours of parking, I did what any other disgruntled prick would do.

I parked my car in the visitor lot, paid, went home, grabbed a full bottle of maple syrup, went back to the garage, and went to town. It wasn't the whole car, mostly the door handles to make their hands sticky for the whole drive, and the windshield wipers, just so it'd take extra long for their windshield to clean up, but boy was it satisfying. To this day, there are still dark spots on the concrete where my art was previously parked.

TL;DR someone took up two spaces in a full lot, had to pay for extra parking despite my parking pass, so I syruped the fuck out of their car.",59,69,0.92
1920,everyone sucks,"Me and my brother live in an apartment together to save my parents some money. The apartment is about a 20 minute walk from campus but that is not a problem for me because every day I drive to work in the morning then to campus for classes. My brother however, got tired of walking for so long and went shopping on craigslist to find a bike at the end of last semester when all the college kids were moving away. This is the best time to find a bike for cheap, and he got a steal, I don't remember the brand exactly but it was like $400 street bike for $50 or something like that. He asked me for the money because he doesn't have a job so I gave it to him and told him to pay me back when ever he starts working again.

So some time passes and I quit my job to focus more on classes, and my brother gets a job because he has an easier course load the following semester. I ask him for my $50 and he laughs in my face, and he tells me that its a shitting thing to do to give money to family and expect them to pay it back. What ever, we argue, and I ask him two more times a few weeks apart. Finally I get tired of it, and sell his bike on craigslist while he isn't home. I paid for it, as far as I am concerned I was letting him borrow my bike for several months. It sold for $250, and he furious and wanted all of the cash from the sale. I refused to give him a dime, and told him that this is what happens in the real world when you don't pay your debts. 

My parents, my brother, and a few other people think I'm the asshole. 

Edit: 
Thank you for the comments everyone. I have definitely recognized the fact that I am AN asshole in this situation if maybe not THE asshole. To everyone commenting about cutting my brother out of my life or vice versa, its just a bike and $50 that's not going to happen. To the people commenting about legality and contract law, thank you, it was really interesting and it looks like you put a lot of effort into those replies but also nothing is going to happen with that either. 
I think I'll buy him a big thing of beer and give him $60 so he can buy a different bike, we can call it an asshole tax... I am keeping the rest of the money. 

As to anyone concerned about my family dynamic, me and my brother are close, we have done stuff similar to this to each other in the past, its just regular macho brother B.S. so ill probably still lend him money in the future, and he might sell some of my shit, its what ever, we are both stoics and I wouldn't ever do this to anyone other than him, that's all totally different. - Peace",170,272,0.97

1922,not the a-hole,"I am 24. She is either 32 or 34, I can't remember. We work in a small retail environment, and I am manager. I don't really boss people around, so a lot of times it's more of a seniority thing than an actual position. But technically I am her boss, and it's kind of awkward when she's almost ten years older than me. 

Anyway, she has worked for the business for a few months. My first impression of her was positive, but it quickly went south. Numerous times she touched me, such that if the genders were reversed it would probably be considered mild sexual harassment. She doesn't seem to understand the concept of personal space either. She is also just really socially awkward. Think Michael Scott, but with less charm and lovability. When I have her do something she doesn't want to do, she says ""Ugh you're such a butt!"" (1996 insults, anyone?) She also makes jokes like ""I bet you missed me a lot, didn't you"" and ""I'm going to hit you"" which also make me feel uncomfortable. I don't respond positively to these jokes, yet she keeps making them. 

It's gotten to the point where even being around her is stressful. Like really stressful.  I normally try to be friendly with all my coworkers, but when I'm friendly to her, she starts these endless nonsensical conversations with me that I really, really, don't want to have, and with her personal space issues, I feel like I'm backed into a corner. My workspace is a desk with only one opening, so sometimes it's literal. 

If she has any work related questions or comments, then I answer them normally. However, if she asks me questions about my personal life (""Do anything fun this weekend?"") I answer evasively to make the conversation over as quickly as possible. I feel like a dick for not being nice to her, and I've made an effort to not be explicitly *mean* to her. I believe that all people should be treated with love and respect, and I'm having a hard time doing that with her.  I'm trying to act the absolute bare minimum of respect/civility. I just really don't want to socialize with her or be her friend. I've worked at this business for a few years now, and I've loved all of my coworkers before her. So I'm thinking it's not just me.

As kids we never really bonded. This is probably because my brother is aroundish 8 years older than me and we don't have many correlating interests. I'm a movie snob and like to chill and play videogames, and he... I really don't know what he likes to do. He moved out at 20, when I was like 12. We barely ever talked after that. All I really remember from our childhood was him being a violent prick towards me whenever he didn't get his own way, and telling me to go away when i wanted to play playstation with him.

Nowadays I am 22. Recently the entire family went on vacation with my brothers girlfriend attending. During this vacation he popped the question. Yay! Smiles all around.

The next day we're exploring the city we're vacationing in. I'm getting increasingly tired of my brother constantly interrupting me and I just say I'm going off on my own to look around and just start walking off when he does it again. He gets angry, following after me, blocking my way to force a conversation. We go back and forth, him demanding that I follow with the group, and I saying that I just wanna be by myself for a bit. He then pulls the ""loving brother"" act, saying he's my bro, etc etc, we gotta stick together and come back I was only kidding hahaha. I call him out on his bullshit, and asked him if he could name one single positive memory we've ever had together, because all I remember is him kicking the shit out of it. He just stood there with a slack jaw, before shoving me away and saying ""fine fuck off then, and don't come to dinner either"" and walking off. Relieved, I go off by myself to check out what I wanted to. This is the final time we have ever spoken, in person or otherwise.

We avoid each other for the final few days of the vacation, I mostly hang out at a friends place that's in the area.

At this point I was really dreading seeing him again, let alone going to this fucking wedding half away around the world. About a week later my parents inform me that my brother doesn't want me at his wedding, to which I reply an extremely enthusiastic ""good!"" since I won't need to pay for flights or go to a wedding for someone I don't like surrounded by people I don't know or want to know. Finally something we see eye to eye on! My mothers is suitably unimpressed and flies off the rail, and my father feigns the same emotion.

I was at a party and things were disappointing for the host (He decided not to invite people till the last minute, so a few close friends went to a different party). So in his best attempt to liven things up, his roommate (lets call him Bill) brought out ""Secret Hitler"" and started explaining the game to everyone while playing it. 
At one point Bill said, ""You don't want to give the chancellorship to the player that is hitler, because after a certain point he wins if you do."" At which point I jokingly stated, ""Yeah, so don't give it to me, because I'm Hitler.""  Everyone chuckled, except my friend who replied ""come on man, this is their first game don't confuse them.""
 As the game goes on I jokingly say it more times, each when someone suggests that I'm Hitler. ""Yeah, I'm Hitler."" Then Bill starts to get mad, and tells me to stop it. At this point I don't want to piss him off any more so i just play the game. 
Some how, after the third fail I get elected chancellor, and as it turns out, I actually was the secret Hitler. So I won the game.
Bill throws a tantrum, and goes to his room. In the midst of this confusion the host disappears from his own party to join the party his friends went to instead. All of a sudden everyone at the party was asking where the people who lived there were.

During the party, someone spilled a bucket of blue wall paint. A 21 year old girl slipped and fell on the paint. She got a decent amount of paint on her leg as well as a mild bruise.


The line to the ground floor bathroom is always very long at parties (maybe 8 people), so she decided to just go upstairs to use the private bathroom. I was upstairs at the time and I noticed her using the bathroom to wash her feet in my sink.


I didn't want my sink (i.e. where I brush my teeth) to be used for someone to wash their feet, so I asked if she could just wait in line downstairs. She became upset and sarcastically said ""Oh, I see how it is, fine, be the way.""


At this point I was ticked off because I thought my request was very reasonable, so I said ""Just get the fuck out of my house.""

Guess what, a week later pictures are being posted of her and a new guy together, flirtatious comments left on each other's pictures, she has moved on. Fast forward a few months and I meet a girl. Beautiful, smart, ambitious. She made me believe in love again. After my ex found out she confronted me saying how hurt she was knowing I had moved on and did acknowledge what she did was a little sketchy. The thing is, after 6 years of getting to know my ex, loving her, caring for her, in that moment all I was thinking was ""i don't care how you feel"". After being emotionally drained for some time I just could not muster any sympathy or remorse for her, I genuinely do not care how she feels or how my relationship effects her. 

Please help me figure out what I should be feeling !",22,66,0.95
1933,not the a-hole,"So my younger brother (We'll call him Dave) goes to a ""Christian"" summer camp, and there is a counselor that had only been there for a small while. He got a small group of kids together before the parents came by to pick them up, and apparently told them that he wanted to organize a little get-together a few days after camp was over.

This is where the red flags start. He never told the parents anything. He never said a *word* to any adult about this event. He gave the kids a vague outline of the details, only giving a date, and what he supposedly planned to do: Go to a church (which he also didn't name) and have a short Bible study, which we do at our church anyway. No last name, no phone number, nothing. So Dave doesn't say much about it on the way back, and we go up to our father's house for the weekend. Dave asks him, and gets an immediate ""no"", due to how dangerous the situation could be. He gets a short lecture about it, and at the end of the weekend, we are picked up by our mother to go back home. I explain the situation to my mother, and she says that he can. I warn her that he could potentially (note that word) be a paedophile, and she immediately begins yelling at me for being ""judgmental"". She says that I shouldn't assume the worst (which I didn't, I only pointed out the possibility), and that it is unfair to the man to assume that he *is* a paedophile. I tell her that I am not assuming anything, and that I am just saying that there is a possibility. Eventually I convince her (after a lot of repetition) that he shouldn't go to the event.

Am I an asshole for warning her that she *could* lose her son forever?

1935,not the a-hole,"Roommate and I lived together for four years prior to this.  We were casual friends.  We had different hobbies and interests, but would try to do something together about once a month (get dinner, see a movie, etc.)

Roomie is unlucky in love.  In the four years we've been together, he's broken off two engagements.  For one of these girls, I went pretty out of my way to get them together - think lending large amounts of money and agreeing to vacate the premises a few nights.  Anyway, it didn't work out.  He paid me back all the money with the exception of about 60 bucks which I shrugged off as water under the bridge. 

Finally, he gets his last girlfriend.  I'm happy for him, everything is great. 

Then he moves her in.

He tells me that he's having a 'friend' over for dinner one day and I happily agree and then she never goes home.  It's fine, they're in their honeymoon period.  Except two weeks go by and she's still here.  At this point I sit him down and say she can't live here.  It's annoying and also violates our lease.  He says that her apartment is old and not as clean and that he 'needs to take care of her'.  I say, sucks to be her, that's the apartment she decided to rent.  He says fine.  So starting from that talk, she still lives here, except she goes home at midnight and shows up at 8 in the morning.  Weekends, she stays over.

I hate this.  She monopolizes the bathroom in the morning, her hair clogs the shower drain, they're using the kitchen and the shared living spaces all the time, including the TV, and every time I try to use any of these spaces they stop cuddling/talking/whatever and stare at me until I leave.  I get so uncomfortable that I become a hermit in my room.  One day I come home and she has five suitcases in our living room.

Finally, after over two months of this, I tell him that I'm going to report them to our landlord.  His response is to move out, and find a subletter, which is also not allowed.  I could report this, but I decide I don't care, as long as his share of the rent keeps coming in.  He also tries to take half my furniture on the way out, which I wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't come home early and found his friends carting off my table.

Fast forward to today, who could have possibly seen this coming? this girl breaks up with him and now he wants to be friends again.  I send him a text saying that he's a shit friend for fucking me over for two months, and we're through unless he apologizes.  He responds saying that I'm immature, that adults understand that couples have different needs, that threatening to report him was way out of line and I was being a dick about it the whole time.  He says I basically forced him to move out.  He references my mother, who is chronically ill and whom I sometimes drop everything to care for when she needs a hospital stay, saying that if I needed to move her in to take care of her, he wouldn't have complained.  (This is a complete hypothetical; I have literally never mentioned moving her in.)  And it was the same for his girlfriend, because he needed to take care of her.

I say 'fuck you' and that's the last time we've spoken.

1941,not the a-hole,"TL;DR: My roommate sets alarms early and doesn't get up to them, so I make sure he's always late to class. 

(Update st bottom.)

My roommate and I have been good friends for about 15 years--it's why we're roommates. Being that we go to a university, we share a room, and we share an apartment with two other friends. That's really all the background you need; if you'd like more, ask in the comments, please. 

My roommate--we'll call him Joe--is not a morning person. At all. I am, on the other hand. Regardless, he sets alarms at 5:45 that are incredibly loud, which is fine with me. The thing is, the guy doesn't wake up to them, no matter how much I call his name. So, I get up because I can't sleep with his alarm going off. Now, to be fair, my alarm goes off at 6:00, but I give myself a 20-minute buffer to lie in bed and relax before I actually get up. With his alarm, I can't, so I've been getting up at 5:45 each day. 

Now, I've been getting pretty pissed off at this, so I've stopped trying to wake him up because I know nothing will come of it. 

Here's the part that I'm struggling with: Joe has class at 8:00, and he sets his alarms so early _just so he can wake up at 8:00_. I wish I were exaggerating, and a lot of you may think I am, but I hope you guys can believe me. What I've been doing is just not waking him up and putting my headphones in so I'm not distracted by his alarm. He's been waking up closer to 8:15 and missing his class, which has been my petty revenge to him. 

Also, for those of you wondering, when I get up, I take care to be quiet. At first it was to be respectful of everyone else's sleep (ironic because my roommate obviously doesn't feel the same), but now it's to ensure that he sleeps in late. 

Am I the asshole?

Update: Thanks for all of the responses! I've talked to my roommate, and we've come up with a solution. As I mentioned, he's pretty hard-headed in his ways, as are his parents, so when I mentioned that he should see a sleep specialist or start tracking his sleep, he refused. We eventually agreed that I would wake him up on his schedule, so that I'd not have to worry about his alarms. Yes, this will fuck him over by prolonging his dependence, but I'm done with dealing with that shit. (You're probably going to think I'm an asshole, but this solution fits both of our lifestyles. If my roommate doesn't have foresight and doesn't wan to improve himself, I've decided I'm not going to be the one to change him.) Thanks again!",78,240,0.98
1942,asshole,"1.5-2 years ago we rescued a Greyhound. She was super cheap ($300) as they’re putting these dogs down regularly when they’ve stopped racing.

We also fostered a 2nd dog while they waited for their full-time home. He was a confident, funny, cool, calm dog. Our full-time is quiet, depressed, anxious, shy, timid.

She’s started to cost money. She’s always had shit teeth, and gums. She’s going in for her 3rd scale and clean in 2 years. The first two the adoption agency covered, but that’s no longer an option.

The vet is talking $700 scale and clean, and potential extractions, plus $80-$120 a month for antibiodics and steroids, along with daily cleans. The steroids are likely to cause liver damage in a few years.

I’ve told my wife that this is the last scale and clean she gets, and if the steroids are required full time, the expense is too high for us.
Potential $700 a year plus potential $1440 in meds, and daily cleans.



“So what?! We put her down?!”


“I mean... yeah?.... They’re killing Greyhounds daily. We tried to save this one, but she’s fucked. Depressed, separation anxiety, and fucked teeth. We tried, it didn’t work, we can try save another one with a better disposition.”

1943,not the a-hole,"In the past year throughout college I've made a new friend from my old high school who I've gotten pretty close with. It was great to have someone to talk to who I already knew for that first year. The issue was, we get along really well and had the same lessons so whenever it came to the time to work we'd get nothing done. 

This had a really negative affect on my grades and coming around to the second year I don't want this to happen again. I've made this clear to my friend but he still tries to distract me when I'm working. The way I've decided to deal with this problem is to just get on with what I'm doing, put in some headphones and just nod or smile whenever he says something to me. 

I'd attempt to make a genuine response to what he's saying but I know I have zero self control and I'll end up chatting to him all day plus I get so much more work done when I do this. He doesn't care about his grades but I really do and don't want to sacrifice them. Am I a dick for doing this or is it just what's right?

The other day I was in a meeting with a bunch of teacher in the area, we meet once a month and I’m relatively new to the group. I’m the only guy at the meeting and was starting up a conversation with another woman and I was talking about two other teachers we mutually know. 

Right off we talk about the guy and then I say “oh yeah and what is the the girl’s name?” Right then she stops and sits up tall and looks at me. She says“ya know once women reach a certain age they should be addressed as women.”  Made me feel like an asshole to say the least. It didn’t come from a place of degradation towards women. 

Made sure to call everyone a woman. 

Fast forward to today. I post on another sub talking about the importance to teach coding and how as a teacher I just started a group: “girls who code(my group is a chapter of a larger organization). I explain I decided to run this to get more girls into coding and because when I was in coding classes in college there was only one girl in my computer science classes. 

I get a PM from a moderator that my  comment of calling a university classmate a girl is actively discouraging women from STEM careers. “It’s infantizing language like this (and I believe with you it’s unintentional) that puts women off from partaking in these sectors. I’m a STEM postgrad in probably the most male dominated field and it’s extremely hard to navigate these spaces as a  woman. When men take actions to treat us like individuals in both actions and language it makes a huge difference. Other than that I am glad you are mentoring kids to navigate this world. “
I was pretty stunned by this coming out of the blue. Realized that she was pretty stuck on the fact I called a woman in college a girl and if I tried to defend it I would catch more, So I said thanks and that she was right. 

She acknowledged that it’s unintentional but am I an asshole?

1945,not the a-hole,"Background
I live with my SO and his mother, his sister in the past has said some very rude comments to me and saying things like ""you don't count"" ""you aren't allowed to have an opinion you aren't a mother"" and ""you don't have a choice, you have to have kids"".  She has never said a positive thing in the nearly 19 years I've been with my SO to me or him.  She has 3 kids, the youngest (13) has always been a problem when she visits (like smear shit all over the walls, use our toothbrushes to wash something who knows what just know there was soap in the bristles, picking the dog up by her ears, playing in the clothes dryer, putting food in the dryer, just holding the water open from the fridge without a cup there so it goes on the floor, stealing anything she can including her grandmothers very sentimental cross necklace) so she cannot be left unsupervised.

Today is his mother's birthday and the sister calls and says I'll be there in 15 min for the cake (ignoring that we arent quite ready for them since SO was still at the office and wouldn't be home for 2 hours.) I go quick hid the toothbrushes (i wish i was kidding) and try to get the laundry out of the machines (was too wet) 
They arrive and she goes straight for the water dispenser but i had locked that, then she starts going into the cabinets saying she wants chips, i tell her no and hold the door closed.  Then for the dog, i should just let the dog bite her but im afraid the dog will get punished not the kid so i get between her and the dog.  eventually she is occupied by the cupcakes and i had grabbed a plastic cup and put it with the glass ones for her so she doesnt break her grandmother's glasses so she is content for a bit.  but of course that didnt last.

she starts saying she wants soda (we werent expecting them so there wasnt any in the fridge) i say no have water, she wont stop and starts going through the fridge. i hold that closed.  she goes to the bathroom, our water makes alot of noise so i know she didnt flush or wash her hands.  I tell her to go back in and flush and wash.  she washes up giggling (never flushed).  now this whole time she has been making this really high pitch screeching noise that she was told numerous times by her grandmother to stop since it was making the dog crazy.  

eventually she is told to just sit on the couch next to her sister while her mother is getting loud about politics, i leave the room cause i was raised never talk religion or politics and went down the hallway to message my SO that his mother was getting pissed about the conversation.  I come back down a few minutes later cause my laundry was still in the dryer and I dont trust the brat and I see her fingers down her pants digging in her ass and she wiped her hand on the fridge when before i can even react.  I yell to go wash her hands again.  she does and after i clean up the water that she left all over the sink, walk back to other end of the house and see her in the backyard garden with a stick hitting the plants.  I go tell her to get out of the garden.

Here's where the real issue starts.

Her mother says 
Her: ""would you like me to take her home since you have been yelling at her since we got here""  

Me: the only time i yelled was to wash her hands when she was digging in her ass.

Her: well she's going through puberty and hair is growing so she's itchy

Me: she still shouldnt be digging in her ass

Her: what do you know youre not a mother


and i admit here i lost my temper

Me: always back to that, thats your answer for everything, im not a mother

Her: yes that is everything and if you dont like it you can leave and go to your room

here my memory gets a little fuzzy so no direct quotes anymore, i was just pissed
Me: called her a bitch

her: yes i am a bitch

me: always negative you never say anything positive

i think i said a few more things but that was the gist of it
eventually i see my SO's mother making hand motions so i left the room went to mine where i found the dog shaking under the desk.

After they finally left i tried to apologize to his mother but im not sure she understood me cause i was crying so much (i cry when im really angry) and then ran bleach wipes over every surface i think the kid touched.
So while i didnt mean to lose it and possibly ruin a birthday, am i the asshole?

1947,not the a-hole,"My friend, let's call him Jim, is the worst of us when we all get together to drink. Every time we get together he's thrown up, which I can't really get mad at him for, it happens but it's still annoying. When we drink, we get drunk. And when he gets drunk, he loses his filter, and becomes inconsiderate.

 Example 1: We have this friend, Pam, who we all had the same class together in high school. We rarely met outside that class and rarely met after high school, but I invited her to drink with us one time. Some of the ""funnier"" guys in our group referred to her as Big Titty Pam (Which I'll confess to being an asshole for that) but we would never say that to her face, she's a sweet girl. But Jim calls her Big Titty Bitch at the party then later tries to convince her to make out with him. I pulled him aside after he called her that and told him what he did. His response was, ""I'm perfectly aware of what I just said."" It's one of the first times we hang out with this girl outside of school and he pulls this shit. 

Example 2: I'm house sitting with a friend (It's a NICE house) We get to basically live there for a week, all we have to do is water plants and take care of their beloved, spoiled dog. We're gonna drink there.(Another asshole thing I'll admit to) We drink, the night goes fine, no absurd name calling. But the morning after, 6am-ish he walks around in the driveway yelling ""COLE, COME PICK ME UP!"" Cole was apparently his ride home and was on his way. When he left, he left the door wide open for the dog to later escape, and threw up as he was leaving.

So would it be an asshole move to exclude him from the next drinking get together? I get he's drunk, but we all are and nobody else is doing this shit.

1948,not the a-hole,"In college, I lived in a series of short-term sublets rather than signing leases. I lived for two months with this guy John who was renting a house (I moved in around November). I then moved out to a one-bedroom (in January) and my boyfriend, who also needed a new apartment around that time, moved in with John. After 5 months my boyfriend and I decided to move in together to save money. We asked John if this was okay that I could move back in. He initially said that was fine but before I moved in said we had to pay like $60 extra a month (we had already agreed to split utilities three ways). He also told us his girlfriend might be staying over with her children aged 2 and 4. We felt uncomfortable with this but said that we were okay with that situation as long as he gave us at least a 48 hour heads up that they were visiting (so that we could arrange to be elsewhere, although we didn’t make this explicit). We were both college students and wanted nothing to do with children. 

When we each had our own apartments, we would alternate between staying at my place and my boyfriend’s place (where John lived). We probably stayed at my place more often since we had free heat so John would get the whole place to himself. I moved back in with John and my boyfriend around May. Sometime in May John told us one night that her children were coming over. We quickly cleaned up the living room and holed ourselves upstairs. The children were screaming until like 10pm because they were super tired while John, his girlfriend and some random dude hung out in the living room. After this, the kids were out of the picture for a while because they were going to live with their father for the entire summer. 

The first few weeks living together were great. John would leave on the weekends to visit his girlfriend (who lived in another town) and we would have the place to ourselves. For next few weekends we went out of town each time, so John had the place to himself with his girlfriend. John asked my boyfriend around this time if it was okay that she was there alone while he worked at his part-time job. We agreed that it was fine, as we were never at the apartment when she was. 

Finally we reached a weekend where we were both there. She stayed there for four days straight. We had no clue when she was leaving and didn’t want to ask because he was with her all the time and we were trying to be polite. We also got woken up 3 days in a row by their sex noises at like 7am. Between the sex noises and the fact that she could have her kids back in at any time, we were really wary of her. John also told us stories about her personal life that made us extremely uncomfortable. Eventually she lost her job so she was ONLY able to get a job in our town rather than the town she lived in 40 minutes away and that we would be seeing more of her. So we told him we didn't want a non rent paying girlfriend there when john wasn't there since we also paid rent on the apartment and have a right to the space. We also didn't want her staying over more than 4 days in a row or even 4 day in a week if he didn't leave equal amounts of time just to be fair. He said that he didn't want to place any more restrictions on her and he wouldn't pay more for her to be there. It definitely felt like he was trying to move her in and we only knew it was a few weeks away and she would have custody of her children and we for sure didn't want them there all the time. 

Am I the asshole in this situation? We didn't want to set any kind of precedent of her being there and we were just standing our ground on an apartment that we all paid rent on but she didn’t.  

edit: john was renting from the landlord. I was never on the lease nor did we ever meet the landlord. He claimed he was allowed to sublet. however we actually paid more in rent than him fwiw. I originally paid $450 and he paid $300 (the room was larger but not large enough to justify that much more). When my boyfriend moved in he renegotiated to $430 and then when I moved back in we went up to $455 (we negotiated down from the $60). my boyfriend did sign a sort of sublease. I don't know how binding it would have been in court but it was just a paper that they both signed saying how they would split rent, utilities and just stuff kind of copied from a normal roommate agreement and it had dates from may to august. also my move in also had an end date. I signed a lease like a year in advance so I knew I was moving out in august and had only moved in temporarily. 

Also, this all happened 2 years ago. we did move out which sucked ass cuz the rent was so good and we wanted the place for ourselves. thank god we did though because I see him around town now and it's suuper awkward. 

also i'm aware that yeah what he says goes since he had the lease with the landlord but I still think he's an asshole for enforcing this shit when I told him directly how uncomfortable I am with her around, especially when she's there alone and when she was there too much. we had one bathroom!!

It isn't a money thing, I flat out told him he could put the money he would've put into a motorcycle into his dream car (which I'm basically fine with.

1951,not the a-hole,"I live in an apartment style college residence. There are 4 of us living in this unit, three of us lived together last year. 

Last year, 1 of the girls and I had gotten into a full blown screaming match with each other, with dirty dishes being the straw that broke the camel's back. 

The fight stemmed from the fact that I could never get my dishes clean because no one else ever did theirs. I would do everyone's dishes just to have a clean kitchen. I would load up the dishwasher, run it, flip the sign I made to let them know clean dishes were in there. Then they'd sit until I unloaded it. Repeat for about 3 months. 

Dishes that can't go in the dishwasher would pile up until I washed them and they'd sit in the drying rack until I put them all away. Repeat for 3 months. 

The roomies would tornado through the kitchen and fuck it up, I'd scrub the stovetop and pick the food out of the burners, clean the microwave weekly because no one covered their food. Wipe the counters down etc. Repeat for 3 months.

Eventually I said fuck it, and stopped. After we got back from break I said that I wasn't cleaning up after everyone, and they seemed thrown off but agreed. 

About a month later, I had a severe allergic reaction and was rushed to the hospital nearly in anaphylactic shock. Thankfully we literally live across the street from a hospital so I was treated immediately and it didn't get that bad. 

I was a little fucked up for the next few days, I'm super sensitive to most drugs and I had a bunch of stuff I've never taken before injected straight into my veins. 

So the day after I started living again, I went downstairs and found a super passive aggressive note that basically said ""we'd appreciate it if you did your dishes. You know how it feels to have others push their mess on you, please don't do it to us"" 

I had left my crockpot out, I had made soup for everyone and by the time I was done cleaning up I literally didn't have the strength to wash it. A part of me thought that they might have even washed it, as a thanks for making them dinner and because they knew how bad I felt. 

I lost it. I had just recovered from having a scary health experience, to this day I have no idea what I'm so severely allergic to. I was behind on assignments, some of my profs were being fucks about me missing 3 days (first day was reaction, second day was me being weak and pukey, third day was me giving myself a day to try to catch up and feel closer to 100%) of school. I'm in an engineering program, we have an attendance mandate and can't miss more than a certain amount of hours. Government standards.

Anyway, we were all super stressed, after we vented some of our stress and frustration we felt better and super dumb. I apologized for blowing up, she apologized for being a dick. 

After that though, dishes were a weird subject and we were all pretty diligent about getting them done, which was honestly really nice and the best possible outcome from the fight. 

Now this new room mate lives here, and she doesn't give a fuck. She leaves soggy food in the sink drains, her dishes are piled up in the sink, beside the sink, she throws dirty dishes in the dishwasher with the clean. The other 2 girls are starting to not give a fuck again. 

I look at the sink and counters, and I go through the same feelings everytime. Me thinking, just clean up this once, if only so you can get your shit clean. Then I remember how that works out. Then I get angry because I've already been through this with the 2 girls. We warned the new girl that dishes are a thing in this house. 

I can't help myself, I've done a few passive aggressive things with the dishes. Like moved them all over to the other counter, walked into the kitchen when they were all sitting there, looked at the sink and sigh dramatically and walk back out. No one's gotten the hint, instead they've gotten passive aggressive back, which had only pissed me off more. 

I know I need to calmly sit down and talk to them about it, but anytime I try, I go back to last year and all those feelings rush back and I get way too angry to have an adult conversation. I give myself some time to cool down, tell myself to try again tomorrow. Repeat. It's gotten to be a daily thing now. And the dishes are all still sitting there and now we have fruit flies and I'm almost out of clean dishes and thisclose to blowing up again. 

Am I completely over reacting? Am I an asshole for getting this worked up over dishes? I know it's just dishes but it doesn't seem like a small issue to me.",17,33,0.93
1952,asshole,"Hi all! A good friend of mine recently took a roadtrip to see his long distance girlfriend in a different city. Its about a four drive to a city that is widely considered a popular tourist destination. 

Me and a mutual friend offered to pay for gas and snacks for him to give us a ride as well (we said we leave on his schedule). AND we said we would uber to/from his final destination (his gf's house) to an airbnb by the beach, so as to not inconvenience him by forcing him to drop us off across town. Pretty good deal right? 

He declined it, and refused to give an actual reason as to why he didn't want to. Which seemed weird to me considering we were offering him a solution that would in no way inconvenience him, and eliminate his costs for the road trip. At the time I assumed that maybe he just wanted the solitude of the drive (which I was totally fine with), and forgot about it.

Two weeks pass and he is attempting to leave for the trip, when I get home from class to find a woman Ive never seen before waiting in his car. It turns out that he was giving that girl a ride to/from this city, AND he was going 25 mins out of his way to drop her off at her friends house. When I asked him what was going on he was visibly flustered, obviously embarrassed that I caught him with this girl, doing the exact thing he told his two best friends wouldn't work for him.

Am I right to be mad at him for doing this? Its one thing for him to want to drive alone, but to tell us he doesn't want the ""inconvenience and free trip"" only to give some side-chick a ride ON A TRIP TO SEE HIS GIRLFRIEND kind of rubs me the wrong way. 

Edit: For what it is worth I just found out they split gas. Which essentially means he paid to give this girl a ride, in my opinion solely motivated by a desire to cheat on his girlfriend for what would be the third time.",26,32,0.75

1956,not the a-hole,"Back story: When my nephew was a baby (he is now 4) my sister would force me to babysit by guilting me while I was also working 60+ hours a week as a nanny. I put that to a stop after about a year of her controlling every hour of my free time (I wish I were kidding) and have been VERY reluctant to babysit a much since because she is manipulative and rude to me when I can't and doesn't want to spend time with me unless I'm doing something for her.

Since her recent divorce she has been getting forced over a lot at work, she works 2-11pm, so she would be getting forced over 11pm-7am. I have told her multiple times that I cannot be the only person available to watch my nephew bc I still work 50+ hours a week as a nanny on top going to school full time and simply just need my time off/need her to have someone reliable that isn't me. She can afford a sitter but has just never tried to find someone who can be available to her because 'she just doesn't trust anyone' and she claims she doesn't want to pay slot of money since the person would be sleeping anyways bc it's at night. This is not only straining our already difficult relationship but it's stressing me out because I work with kids SO much as it is and want to live my own life and have free time... 

Right now she is blowing my phone up bc she wants me to come over immediately after work today to watch him so she can work.

My bf and I have moviepass, a $10/month subscription that allows you to see one movie a day. It's not free but it's super cheap. He offered to let a friend and the friend's daughter use mine and his to go see a movie.  These people are poor and homeless, but the guy has a job. He didn't ask me if this was ok. I've got issues with people using my stuff or volunteering my stuff without asking, I find it disrespectful. But instead of articulating this like a person who is quick on their feet, I said that I work hard for stuff like this, if they want moviepass they can afford it themselves, it's cheap. I was definitely an asshole at that moment.

If I had been asked in advance if they could use it, I'd have said yes. I need to be asked because I do work hard for everything I have, not respecting that really upsets me. Bf, on the other hand, gives people money and offers to help with things so much that his friends joke about it. And he's not exactly rich.

1965,not the a-hole,"so this is a throwaway. background - we're a group of high school girls, all 16/17 and most are seniors. i changed the names.

so last year i was best friends with amanda. like, up each other's ass best friends to the point where we were planning to have a joint graduation party this year. then, this summer i went to an academic summer program and while i was gone, everyone got closer without me. apparently everyone was also annoyed with me talking about my summer program, i really loved the place and the people there and i was excited to share. but no one had told me something was brewing until the day i got back. i was talking to amanda and she was giving me short, one-word responses like ""ok"" to everything. i was so frustrated because i felt like something had been off just like this for the past few weeks, so i went off and asked her what was really up and we got into a huge argument. she then ignored me for days without an answer as to why she was acting this way. 

i went out with our mutual friend, brittany, the day after, and brittany was surprised to know that i had no idea what was going on for the past few weeks. brittany told me that our other friend, sarah, and amanda are now best friends and tell each other everything. including some problems that me and amanda both had with sarah that i had intended to bring up with sarah personally when they happened. 

back in the spring of last year, sarah would talk behind our backs/not tell us things that were going on. one of those things being something really direct and personally harmful to me. i was fed up. i put in the notes app of my phone the things she had done recently that pissed me and amanda off, and i wanted to meet with her about those things and see if we could actually get anything resolved instead of harboring these pissed off feelings behind sarah's back. however, each time we would try to make the plans, something would happen and me and amanda just figured it was a sign and we should let it go. we swore to never talk about it again if we weren't gonna do anything about it, i deleted the notes, and i thought it was over. this was all back in the very end of the last schoolyear. 

amanda told sarah about all of this while i was away at my summer program. she said later that she told sarah this because ""her and sarah were like sisters now and it didn't feel right for sarah not to know how amanda felt last year."" sarah absolutely hated me for wanting to call her out, and i had no idea. sarah literally made plans with me to get ice cream with her later that same day brittany told me all of this. i pulled up to the ice cream shop crying because of everything brittany had told me, sarah called me a psychotic bitch, and i tried explaining that i just didn't want to deal with the dishonesty and pent up anger and apologized for handling things the wrong way but i had long forgotten about all of that, but it didn't help. i later texted her out a longer apology than what i could get out coherently in person, and she responded a few days later that ""we can get past this"" and that was supposed to be the end of that.

i talked to amanda again a few days after meeting with sarah. i had to beg amanda to even speak to me and tell me what happened. we talked at her house, and she said that she would rather be closer friends with sarah now, and she wanted distance. i was like okay, fine, sure, i just want things to be as normal as possible. i still wasn't sure what i did for this to happen, but i know she had the right to make her own choices about who she wanted to be around. 

this was all at the beginning of august, and even though things are ""resolved,"" i feel bullied and excluded by everyone in this group on a daily basis with passive aggressive comments and being intentionally left out of plans. they will all make plans in front of me, with me being the only person left out. amanda is generally just mean to me now, mostly with mock pity - like they all have 5 different guys they're talking to and I don't and whenever it gets brought up, i get the ""aw :("" that i really just feel the superiority through. amanda kept bringing up how my labor day weekend was boring because i didn't have a beach house to go off to like she did.  amanda constantly brags about the places she's going, things she's doing, and boys she's leading on. i feel so so so inferior all the time and i'm tired of hearing about it when i couldn't even talk about my summer program without my friends getting sick of me. today, i was trying to act casual when talking about colleges with this guy she knows i think is cute in our student council group and she made sure to interrupt and ""expose"" me for saying i wanted a chill environment when ""actually Elise (me) is applying to an ivy league."" i got my hair cut around the same time as amanda because everyone gets their hair cut at the beginning of a school year and i changed my hair part because i honestly just wanted to change something about myself, and amanda keeps mocking that ""i just wanna be like her."" amanda will openly bring up the fact that our other friends will talk about me to her, and it seems to always be snide and negative. i don't trust any of my friends and i don't know what to do. i feel sick of it every day. the weirder part is, when me and amanda text a lot, we seem fine and normal, but at school it's completely different and i feel like she's judging me with everything i say and do. i seriously can't make new friends, because it's senior year and it's basically ""established"" that this is my friend group - plus they're in EVERY part of my life, from my classes to my extracurriculars, both of which i'm really involved in. i don't know what to do and i'm scared to stick up for myself because if i start another fight it'll just be an excuse for me to be cut off entirely, and i don't want to go through senior year with no friends at all when i have so many things i want to do - football games, homecoming (i have to go for student council anyway and not having a group bc they all drop me would be hell), halloween stuff, etc. honestly, what did i do? how can i fix this? am i the asshole? 

edit: also should be noted that it seems like sarah still doesn't want to be around me at all, ever, and i don't think that'll ever change - i understand why she would hate me, but i was really hurt by her in the spring when i had planned to confront her. ",11,38,0.9
1966,not the a-hole,"I'm a new grad student. Today one of my deskmates brought her emotional support dog into our studio workspace. I asked her about it and she told me it was an anxiety dog, which is a little ironic because dogs give me major anxiety, although I can work with it if it's a well-trained service dog and stays away from me.

This dog was not well trained. It whined loudly the entire time it was there, wouldn't sit still, and barked whenever anybody entered the room. It was distracting and the barking really freaked me out. I wound up needing to move to a table across the room, which helped a bit but isn't typically an option.

From my understanding, emotional support animals are not permitted in classrooms (I have an emotional support cat that I would never bring anywhere public), although from googling a bit I found that there are exceptions to this. I emailed my professor asking for clarification and he told me he would find out for me.

I would be really relieved to have this dog out of the workspace, but otoh I feel bad being so afraid of and distracted by this girl's anxiety support dog, which obviously she must feel she needs or she wouldn't bring it with her.

1967,too close to call,"I caused a motor accident, in which I was the party at fault. To explain the situation simply, I drove into someone while trying to evade an emergency vehicle. 

There was only minor damage to both vehicles, but the other driver did not have insurance, which complicates things a little.

My insurance company approved my claim and repaired my vehicle, but they seems to have found a legal loophole to decline the other driver's claim (the involvement of an emergency vehicle; this is not in the USA, if you're wondering). The other driver is therefore left with a damaged car and no payment, unless she can muster up legal fees to take on my insurance company (which I suspect she can't).

I have not spoken to lawyer, other than the one that represents my insurance company (and me) against the other driver.

Anyway, I moved a bit and forgot to hang on to the pole. Again, the train started and I went back one small step, not touching the lady.

My friend then exits the train and while I walk to a seat, the lady mumbles ""Yeah, sit down."", to which I respond ""What did you say?"" and proceeded to take a seat. The lady looked at me and turned around.

1977,not the a-hole,"Okay, so this happened yesterday evening at my local pub. It was a public holiday here in the U.K. and a lot of people were out for the evening, more than usual on a Monday night. One of those was an old schoolfriend whom I haven't seen for a good 4 years. We'll call him James. We were never especially close, but got on pretty well. It was nice to see him and catch up, and since leaving school and going off to uni has come out openly as gay.

We were chatting about a variety of things, and he was talking about the gay scene at his uni and how he came to terms with his homosexuality and stuff, and it was really great to talk to him about relationships and stuff and most importantly to see how happy he was - in his last year at school he went through some personal issues, and while I'm not absolutely sure if it was anything to do with his sexuality, a lot of people even at the time suspected that was the case.

Both of us had had a few drinks, although he didn't seem openly drunk or anything. At one point he made a remark that it was a shame that I'm not gay because he gives really great head and thought I would enjoy it. I kind of laughed it off, it was fairly innocuous, plus I'd been talking to him about my girlfriend so he knew that I wasn't gay, though he may have wondered if I was bi. Evidently he was wondering, because he asked if I had ever considered experimenting with guys. My reply was that I had never given it any *serious* thought, mainly because the thought of actually being sexual with another guy makes me feel uncomfortable.

His response was, ""Wow, that's pretty homophobic."" To which I explained that, to my knowledge of the term, I'm not homophobic, merely that I myself would almost certainly find no enjoyment or pleasure from experimenting with a guy. After, I could tell he had gone a bit cold towards me, and after a minute or so he made his excuses and went to join his friends. About ten minutes later, a girl whom I've never met before - let's call her Katie - came over to me and started berating me in the middle of the pub for being, in her own words, ""violently homophobic"" towards James. After effectively being shouted at for a good five minutes by Katie, with me trying to get a word in edgeways to explain why I didn't feel I'd been homophobic, the landlord of the pub came over and said that if the shouting didn't stop we'd both be thrown out. In the end, I finished my drink and a friend and I went somewhere down the road to get away from the glowering stares we were getting.

This morning, I sent James a message via Facebook and apologised for any confusion or offence caused, but he saw it and hasn't replied. Normally something like this wouldn't get to me so much, but I consider myself to be a very open, inclusive and accepting person of all sexualities, genders, orientations and the like. Hell, I pride myself on it. I don't feel like what I said was wrong, but from both James and Katie's reactions it's obvious that they took offence.

Am I the asshole here?

**EDIT:** it's been two days since the incident and over a day since I messaged James, to which he still hasn't replied. After reading through the comments on the post, I've decided it's more than likely that I wasn't being an asshole, and, for whatever their separate reasons, both James and Katie overreacted a little.

In our class there's this girl called Georgia who doesn't get invited to hangout often, so one of the girls in my friend group, Ursula, said we should invite her to one of our hangouts. I said I didn't for the following reasons:

* Almost every day she has something to complain about. 

* She speaks badly about me and my friends behind their backs. This includes saying that my best friends sister was faking her injury (even though their mom is a nurse and would know if the injury was faked) and that their family always faked injuries for attention. 

* Our class has to do fundraising for our senior trip, and because we are a small class, I have taken a position of leadership in organizing our fundraiser events. Any time I propose something or make a decision, she opposes it and proposed the complete opposite, even if her proposal will make us lose money. 

* She was dating one of my friends, but then would never talk to him. Eventually she broke up with him cuz she said he was a jerk who never did anything for her or talked to her. He gave her a hundred dollar necklace for Christmas just a month earlier. 

* She always wants to do things her way. At *my* birthday party, everyone wanted to watch a movie. Since it was my birthday they let me decide, except for Georgia. She wanted us to play fishbowl. So we played for a few minutes. Her team was winning by *a lot* of points, but she still cheated and wrote down more points than they had gotten. (She was keeping track of the score for her team)

Edit the second: One of the kids chewed on the straw so much it is flat on top. :'(

I have this cup. It's an awesome cup. I got it at a thrift store over a year ago now for a dollar. It fits three cans of pop, has a straw and a lid (think huge purple sippy cup). I used this cup often, and even marked a line with sharpie where the PERFECT amount of vodka was for a screw driver.

My boyfriend James and I moved a few weeks ago, back into our family's places for various reasons. Unbeknownst to me, my cup wound up at his family's place. I didn't realize it was there.

I thought it was in storage, which is crammed full of stuff, and assumed I'd get the cup when we emptied the storage locker out.

His niece and nephew fell in love with the cup.

I noticed them using it, and immediately got a bit annoyed, but didn't mention it. I asked my boyfriend's sister if I could have it back.

She looked at me like I was insane! ""But, the kids love it.""

So I don't have my cup back....

My problem was: It is irreplaceable. I bought it a year ago from a thrift store and I've never seen another one like it. I also had no idea it was there. It's also, well, MY cup! (And I went through a lot of trial and error for that sharpie line....)

Am I the asshole for still wanting it back?

Extraneous information: I don't like his sister much because she constantly 'borrows' money and never gives it back, expects my boyfriend and I to do shit for her, yells at kids and dogs alike. So, if I am the asshole, I'm more than fine with being an asshole to her. I'd probably care less about my cup being taken if it wasn't being taken by her.

1982,dysfunction,"My wife just gave birth to our first child. When we learned she was pregnant I let me father know because he sent me a 'checking in' text. Afterwards my wife told me she didn't want to go around announcing it. I let my dad know we were keeping it quiet and we'd let the rest of the family know in our own time. I also told my mother (divorced from dad) we were expecting but that my wife didn't want anyone to know, because mom would be angry if my dad knew while she didn't.

To explain a little bit, my wife is selectively mute and English is not her first language. She avoids people and social situations. She doesn't like to go anywhere without me so I can do all the talking for her. When we got married we didn't have a wedding because we feel they're pointless, costly, and tedious - it was never a consideration. Similarly, we don't understand why people have baby showers or gender reveal nonsense. My wife absolutely did not want to have to discuss her pregnancy, listen to any advice, or have to turn down any offers for support. Around the same time, her father passed away, and she didn't want to talk about that with my family either.

So I figured we'd print some announcement cards, mail them out, let everyone get used to it without having to have any conversations about it, then have everyone over for Thanksgiving.

So here's why I'm asking if I'm an asshole - my mother just recently let people know and they're upset I didn't say anything. I have announcement cards sitting on my desk, and I get a call from my sister, asking if I had a kid, and expressing hurt that I didn't mention anything, and that it's been like 9 months since we spoke (that's a normal length of time for us to not speak.) She said new additions were things families share with each other. I really don't understand those feelings though - it wouldn't bother me if the situation were reversed and it's none of my business if my siblings have kids. I wouldn't want to be involved in their pregnancy and birth.

Separately, my mom called feeling sad I haven't visited. Last month we moved 30 miles from where I work to the town mom lives in for cheaper housing. She's feeling cut out and ignored, but it's been 1 month, we're busy with a newborn, and she isn't up to date on her vaccinations so she can't see the baby anyway.

So my announcement plan is undercut, they think I'm weird for not saying anything sooner, and I'm wondering am I the asshole? Am I allowed to be super private? Are my sister and mother feeling baby related emotions I don't understand?",46,53,0.88

1987,not the a-hole,"Today I was trying to find a spot to park at a National Park near the trails I was going to hike. It was very crowded. I went into a lot, and as I drove past this woman, she kindly told me she would be leaving her spot and that I could have it. I turned around and pulled to the side (there was room for others to pass me) so I could get back the 5 feet or so to the passed spot. 

When I turned around I put my blinker on to ""secure"" the spot. Across the spot, facing me was an old man who soon after put his blinker on. He wagged a finger at me while shaking his head, as if to say ""no no no."" I tried to motion to the lady that gave me the spot and convey that she specifically offered it to me (otherwise I wouldn't be doing this). I felt like he was contesting something that was clearly mine.

She pulled out in a way that blocked him so I pulled in before he could and then the old man lowered his window and said ""You can't do that, this is a one way street and we've been looking for a spot for a very long time"" and I just replied that the woman gave me the spot. 

I turned off the car but he kept sitting there, and I saw him talking to another driver and pointing at me and the other driver shaking his head. Part of me felt bad for cutting this guy off, even though I was there first and she offered me the spot. Part of me was worried he'd do something to the car (my mom was kind enough to lend me her Mercedes, and I suspect that car was part of man's reaction). So I relented, pulled out and immediately felt like a wimp who didn't stand up for myself. Am I the asshole?

1988,not the a-hole,"My husband and I are going away this weekend to visit my dad and step mother. I packed today as I like to get ready early to give myself time in case I forget something (I ALWAYS do). He hasn't asked me yet, but everytime we go on an overnight trip he expects me to pack for him and it's always a huge fight and I wanted some opinions before the subject comes up again. 

Previously, when I have packed for him, I either forgot something important (see above) or over packed and he complained or got really mad at me when he couldn't find something. Since then I've refused to pack for him and that enrages him. 

The thing is, I already have myself and our 2 small children (almost 3 and 8 months) and that's a huge job in and of itself. I shouldn't be expected to pack for a grown man should I? His mother said last time this situation came up that I should do it because ""if you care about someone you wouldn't mind doing these things for them"" which is total a bullshit guilt trip. I don't do it because it's either a fight here that I'm not doing it, or a fight when we are there. I am not his mother and he is not a little boy. AITA for expecting a perfectly capable adult to pack for themselves? 

Update: we talked about it last night. He is going to pack himself tonight. He has some items of clothing he needs washed and I told him I would do that if he got it together. He did that, he even brought it down to the main level from our bedroom on the third floor so I didn't have to carry it all the way down. ",36,61,0.97
1989,everyone sucks,"It's a long story and more complicated than I'd like. About a year ago, my husband (married 4 years) posted a raunchy (anonymous) photo of me to one of the gonewild (or tributeme?) subs. I was unsure about it, but he raved about the positive attention it'd get (he's also been into this whole cuckhold thing for a while now...). I was happy about the feedback, and a few months later, after feeling down about myself, I posted a few of my own from my own account. I sent him the links, but it was a solo operation.  

He got into it. I enjoyed it. Win win, right? Apparently, he started getting jealous, so he'd occasionally tell me he wasn't super thrilled about it, but then he'd bring it up in a positive way anytime we were intimate. He'd frequently ask me to read him the messages I would receive.  

When I rarely responded to messages, I'd generally just say Thank you. One night, I had a few drinks, took some pictures, and made the mistake of having a conversation with someone after he responded to my post. I uploaded a few more specific pictures that he requested. Never exchanged names, locations, pictures of my face, etc. Husband saw the pictures and ripped me a new one for having gotten personal at all. He says I cheated. I apologized for having taken it to a point that could be considered too far. I stopped posting photos.  

He keeps bringing this up in every argument, though. He asked me how I would feel if he did the same thing. I told him I honestly wouldn't care if it were still in the vein of anonymity. That's part of the process I like. I encouraged him to make his own account for that sort of thing if he wanted to.  

All he's done since then is talk shit about reddit, regardless of me not using it for anything past the usual reddit nonsense with my regular PG account. Then, I found out he's still using his account that he had never given me the name of. Then, I found out he's been using it on sexual subs, including commenting on other women's photos, telling them what he'd like to do to them, how he'd like to sleep with them, and so forth. That was surprising, but I figured I could let it slide. I felt like that went further than I had, with the exception of my drunken stupidity. But, then, I found out he was subscribed to r4r, dirtykik, and various other adult interaction subs, and that he had, about a month and a half ago, responded to a woman requesting, basically, a kik relationship. She apparently lives in our state, and he was asking where she lived.  

I really feel like this is way beyond anything I did asshole-wise. I made him aware of my actions. This was completely in secret. I was totally anonymous. This was requesting personal information.  

We don't have a good relationship at this time. When he started accusing me of cheating, I repeatedly denied it and brought it up that it seemed suspicious that he was so obsessed with the idea. I have never as much as touched another man. I have no male friends. I have no conversations via phone or text with anyone other than my immediate family. His phone is constantly dinging with messages and alerts. He recently put a new password on his phone, another on his computer, and has a new email address that I've never seen before.  

Am I the asshole for doing what I did and this is just repercussions of it? Or does it seem like he's the one who is being a piece of shit?  

P.S. Yes, I snooped, and yes, that does make me an asshole. But once I saw comments saying ""Yes!!!"" to wouldyoufuckmywife posts and how he'd leave work to eat a pictured pussy, I felt the need.",14,32,0.88
1990,not the a-hole,"Yesterday I came into work after being off all weekend. I was starting to feel a bit under the weather, but I knew if it didn't get any worse I could still work.

Well, it got worse.

Woke up this morning being like garbage. It was an hour an a half before my shift started when I called my boss that I wasn't coming in. She was not happy.

Here' the thing. I don't like calling off, I'd rather tell her I'm sick and let her decide just like every other job I've had. But with this job, I have to make the call. So I did. If it was a less strenuous job I wouldn't went in for a bit. Or, and this is the real kicker in my opinion, of my job wasn't in childcare I wouldn't have called off. I don't want to get any of the kids sick. That shit spreads like wildfire.

We've been so over-staffed lately that at least one person's been getting sent home early every day anyways. I understand that we're on high alert right now (inspection season) and need to make sure we have enough staff for the amount of kids, but how would an inspector feel if an employee was clearly sick?

I don't know. I don't want my boss to think I'm purposely trying to dick them over, but I've just never found it ok to go into work sick in any profession. Hell, a few years ago I was working fast food and had a cold. My boss refused to let me call off, and my nose was running so bad that snot was dripping all over the food line. Sorry.

I just realized I'm sitting here heavily trying to defend my point. To defend my boss's, her and one of the co-owners were planning on going shopping for food for the kids today, so she wouldn't be in until later. If we had a full staff, that's no issue. But being short one person means they can't do their shopping.

What do you guys think?

UPDATE: I just found out via Facebook that my boss's dad is recovering from surgery and not doing as well as expected. I feel like I just added on to the stress of all that. I feel terrible.",17,35,0.84
1991,not the a-hole,"My wife and I had a talk last night about my relationship with her family. She let me know that she accepts that I am dealing with it in my way but wishes I would change my behavior and thinks I am being an asshole. 

 I had a difficult relationship with my in laws for years. About 3 years ago I cut off most contact with them. I did attend my wife's grandfather's funeral. I always liked him and my wife and kids asked me to go. My inlaws are invited to everything, birthdays, weddings, graduations, etc. I leave this stuff completely up to my wife. If they engage me in conversation I am polite but I do not linger and I never approach them. I do not involve myself with anything my wife or children do with my in laws but I encourage them to participate in everything they can. I always tell them that just because I don't get along with them doesn't mean they can't go have a good time. 

A little background. My wife's parents divorced forever ago and her father remarried a woman with two boys. I get along fine with her father and his wife, as well as his adult step kids and their families. We don't see them much because they live far away but I enjoy visiting them. 

My wife's mother never remarried and she raised my wife and her two sisters on her own. Because of this the family is very close. My mother in law is like a God to them. They do basically everything together so spending time with them involves all of them or nothing. They all live within a few miles of each other and spend a ton of time together. We live about 15 minutes away so it is easy to find the time to visit with them. 

The main problems we had over the years are few but in my opinion enough to warant my decision to severely limit contact. 

 The first problem we ran into was food. Your probably asking yourself how is food a problem. My wife's family loves onions. I am allergic to onions. They put onions in just about everything. The family get togethers usually last all day and we eat several times. I made the mistake of asking if they could make a small portion without onions for me(they always insist on hosting). This deeply offended them and caused many fights. Then I decided to bring my own food. This was also offensive and caused problems because I was not gracious enough of their hospitality. Because they had never heard of anyone being allergic to onions they said it was all in my head and I could eat onions if I just got used to them. This became an ongoing problem for years that was never resolved. I would eat a big meal before we attended but after 6 to 8 hours I was hungry again with little to nothing available. Not eating the food they prepared was also offensive and caused fights. 

The next thing was kids. My mother inlaw is a therapist and believes she is the only one that knows how to raise a child. Her daughters take her side on all things and raising kids is no exception. She tried somewhat successfully to control how we raised our kids. My wife followed lots of her mothers advice when it came to raising my step son. My wife was raised with a mostly hands off, let a kid do whatever approach. Some of my in laws favorite arguments against my parenting style are things like this. Time outs are bad for a child's development because they feel left out. Childhood is a time to be a child, not a time for rules, discipline, or chores. You should never raise your voice at a child, it teaches them to be violent and makes them feel bad leading to low self asteem. You should never take things away from a child or ground them. They will end up with PTSD from the loss and separation. 

I was raised in an extremely controlling and abusive environment. My mother and step father believed beatings and hours worth or chores a day raised a good kid. I knew I had little to no tools to raise a child. I took classes in high school, and at our local college after high school, in early to middle childhood development. I think I have a fairly good idea on how to raise a child.

The fight over raising kids never stopped and every get together I heard about how bad of a parent I was. Sometimes it was rude, sometimes it was their version of constructive criticism but it was always present.

My pastimes. I love hunting, fishing, and target/trap shooting. 

My inlaws thought guns were evil. I say though, because a few of them changed their minds over the years. I took the same approach with my kids (not my step kid) as my father (not step dad) did with me. I started them young and made sure they understood how dangerous a gun is. I showed the everything I knew about how to safely use them. I took them on mentor hunts and   made sure they took safety classes when they were old enough. My inlaws accused me of raising serial killers. They told me that my kids would shoot up their school. They threatened to report me to CPS. They mocked and criticized me about it every chance they got. 

As the years went by some of them backed off. Some of course were never a problem. In fact some felt similar to myself about some of the issues with the family. The main problem was with my mother in law and one sister in law. They all stopped the criticism when we were together. It was common to hear from them after by phone or text. Lots of ass chewing about how terrible I was and about how they wished I would just stay home when they got together. On top of this we had stopped getting invited to all but one or two get togethers a year. My wife and kids were missing out on some big family events. 

 So after 15 years of this stuff I decided to go with what I have been asked to do. I let them know that I was done dealing with the shit and would stay away. I have not attended any get together they have thrown since(except a funeral).

So my question is this. Does my wife have a point about how I am handling the situation? I don't have a problem with most of the family but I can't get together without all of them being there. The few that treat me poorly will be there and history has shown that they will treat me poorly and let me know how much I am hated. Also there is the issue with not being invited to things. Obviously I don't care anymore if I am invited but I don't want my wife and kids to be excluded just because I might come with. Am I the asshole my wife says I am?

1992,not the a-hole,"Backstory: I lost my wallet a few weeks ago with my ID, bank card, health card and my children's health cards. It's been a nightmare. Added on to that is that my daughters health card was expired (didn't realize this) and I need her birth certificate to renew it. Now in order to get their birth certificates I had to get a prepaid visa as no one in my household has a credit card and the system would not do online Interac from my bank (completely stupid).

 Today finally I got the last peice if my ID and the birth certificates. My daughter has a doctors appointment Monday (today is Friday so I can't do this over the weekend) so I want to get her health card asap. When my MIL came home (we all live together) I asked her if she could watch the kids while I zipped over to get this taken care of. No one in my house drives so I have to take the bus, not a bug deal but my while point is I didn't want to lug the stroller with me plus it's probably going to rain. She then proceeds to tell me to take the baby with me. I got mad and said ""fine I won't go, I'll wait for hubby to get home"" in a sharp tone as I was upset.

 The reason I was upset is they both tell me that when I need help all I have to do is ask, but when I ask I get told no. She has done this to me several times now so I refuse to ask her for help unless I'm desperate. Am I the asshole?

Edit: when I originally asked her she said yes. She then said something along the lines of ""you should take the baby with you"". I have a tendency to take her suggestions as orders, which is a problem I have to work on. As I said before, I really didn't want to lug the stroller on the bus then have him scream while waiting in line. ",16,44,0.98

Figured I'd let me boss know in case it gets any worse so I sent her a text saying ""Hey A, I just threw up and I'm sure I'll feel better once I have to come into work, I'll let you know if anything else happens.""

A couple of hours later I wake up again at 8 and 9 a.m. to throw up some more so I decided to text her telling her that I have thrown up more and wouldn't be coming into work today. (My shift starts at 11)

1995,asshole,"So a while back in December my cousins, except for me, all staged a secret santa. I found out about this from a cousin I talk to, Alex, and that it was planned from a cousin I don't talk to, named Tracy. Tracy said that she didn't know how to contact me, which I know wasn't true, since my sister was invited, who I live with. We also have each other's phone numbers. 

She gave me a Starbucks gift card with the same amount as their price limit (I don't drink coffee, but she couldn't have known that). I didn't want to just sit there and watch them all have fun, so I left the room, leaving the gift card on the floor. No one really said anything to me after and just sort of moved on.
