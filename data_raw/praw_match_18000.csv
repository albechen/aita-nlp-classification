0,No A-holes here,"throwaway as this includes my brother. 
me 17f brother 15m 

2 months ago my grandfather moved in with us, it's been a real change but I'm enjoying the company. 
sadly my grandfather suffers from PTSD, he is a war veteran and loud noises can cause him to panic. 

we live in a pretty secluded neighborhood that does not get much noise from fireworks so I assumed my grandfather would be fine. 
I then learnt that my parents bought fireworks and where planning on lighting them. 

all I could think of was my grandfather and his ptsd so me and my brother ""stole"" them from mums car and they are currently under my bed in a box. 

mum thinks that someone stole them and is obviously mad. 

I'm now wondering if we are the assholes.

grandfather hates fireworks btw
and mum never listens to us",55,199,0.91
1,Asshole,"A 'friend' (B) of mine (F20) is having a small going away party before she moves states. I (M20) have not talked to her in three years, but recently my girlfriend (F19) has encouraged me to rekindle friendships with people who I used to be close to after I expressed that I felt lonely at times. 

G and my GF have been friends for two years. They're not close, but they have mutual best friends and used to see each other quite frequently. Recently, my GF had a falling out with one of those mutual best friends (W) but she is still friends with G. W ghosted my GF with no explanation despite being best friends for three years because my GF (who can be a pushover at times) had posted on her spam account on instagram (a private account for close friends)  that she appreciated her friendship with a list of people, including W's ex who W herself is still friends with. GF found this out through mutual friends.

Subsequently, GF is not invited to B's small going away party (10 people who were close to GF until recently) . I, however, am invited, despite not actively communicating with B in years. B also used to have a crush on me, and she would joke about us getting married up until last year. I will be the only guy at her party. In all honesty, I don't really care if I go, and I'm letting my GF decide for me.

GF has said she's conflicted, and that it's up to me. She wants me to go because she encouraged me to reach out to my old friends, but at the same time, she's said she feels a little disrespected about not getting invited while I have(despite not really knowing the host anymore). She said it's usually courteous to invite someone's SO to a party too when it's with mutual friends, and she says she feels kinda sad about her BF hanging out with people who actively treat her like garbage (tbh they do). WIBTA if I choose to go? If I would be, I won't go because I don't want to hurt my GF.

Edit: After reading all these responses, I'm definitely the asshole if I go. Thank you for all your input and advice, you guys were incredibly kind. Now that that's figured out, I'm gonna go give my girlfriend a hug.",31,32,0.88
2,No A-holes here,"My best friend is a great person, but she could really use some work with picking good partners for herself because the past countless relationships of hers (including this one she's in now) are always the same: she meets a guy she barely knows, starts dating him shortly after, gets into problems with the guy, vents to me about it and vows to end the relationship when really the cycle just continues until the relationship miraculously ends and she gets with another guy in the same manner. 
     
To be fair, almost all of the situations she gets into aren't her fault, as the dudes she dates always screw her over, but after seeing this happen every single time with every single guy she dates, I'm starting to think that this really is all her fault for not learning from her past experiences and not sticking to her preferences (or just not date anyone crazy). I've become mentally exhausted from hearing her vent about the same relationship problems all the time, but she comes to me because she wants my opinion on what she has to say, and she's my close friend, so I feel obligated to hear her out. I've also been tired of giving her advice only for her to do nothing with what I've told her. I don't expect my advice to be followed or anything, but it's frustrating when she's always asking for it and following up with ""you're so right"" and promising that something will be done when really nothing does happen.

This dilemma has made me wonder about the purpose of advice giving, and it makes me feel bad for being tired of listening to the same thing all over again when it's my best friend. AITA for not wanting to hear anything about this from my friend anymore? We're in our early twenties if that's needed context.",13,37,0.95
3,Asshole,"I’m getting married in 2 months and one of my bridesmaids has an arm full of tattoos. She has previously covered all of them with makeup for work events when it was absolutely essential. 

I asked her if she would cover them up for my wedding just to not draw attention to her and for pictures etc. She said she wouldn’t feel comfortable with that as it’s part of her identity and she doesn’t want to just for my ‘aesthetic’ wedding. 

I talked to my photographer and she said she could cover them in the photos in the editing process and give me some edited and unedited photos etc. I decided to do it. I mentioned to her that that was what I was going to do (I thought her problem was just not wanting to change herself for my wedding, I thought it would be fine to fix the photos).

4,No A-holes here,"I [19M] don't really have any friends. My ones at school were shitty people who I have nothing to do with any more. I also don't have anything to do with my family because they're uber conservative and uber religious and they cut my gay ass off as soon as they legally could. I currently don't have a job. I do live with my boyfriend [26M] but I'm sure you lot understand wanting to have friends outside of the relationship, plus he has a habit of giving me the silent treatment if he's in a mood with me. All this to say, I don't really have anyone to talk to, and I have a habit of getting really chatty with anyone who's willing to strike up a conversation. 

Well, this is exactly what happened with this girl [20F]. We'll call her Catherine. My uni has this sort of study area which I prefer to use over the library because it tends to have more available plug sockets and it's upstairs the on campus coffee shop. It's not a quiet area, and is in fact open for group studies so is expected to be a little nosier. Catherine and I met because she sat across from me one day and we started chatting. She seemed super nice, and when she saw me in the same spot a few days later she joined me and we talked again. This went on for a few weeks and I started to feel like we were becoming friends. I knew her coffee shop order because they write it on the cups, so I started picking her up a drink whenever I went up there. We talked about music a lot, so I also started making her playlists of stuff I thought she'd like. It was around that she started showing up less. After I asked her if she wanted to hang out some time over summer since uni was coming to an end for the year, she stopped showing up completely. 

I was kinda upset she didn't seem to want to be my friend any more but I told myself I was being silly and she was just busy or something as she'd given no indication of being upset with me. We were friends on Facebook and, while I never commented on anything of hers, I'd like her posts and tag her in memes she'd told me she found funny. She never responded. I got drunk and sad one night and messaged her saying ""hey, did I do something? We're still friends, right?"" She reacted by blocking me and her friend sent me a very long message telling me to leave Catherine alone and saying that I was a creep and needed to learn to respect social boundaries. I was confused because Catherine had never asked me to leave her alone, and said as much. Her friend told me that's because men do horrible things to women when they get rejected, which I know is true and it's awful, but she didn't even try to tell me she didn't want to be friends. I'm utterly devastated that I made her feel unsafe, but that wasn't my intention and I didn't even realise I was doing it. Am I still an asshole even if it was accidental and I was oblivious?

Edit: Just wanted to add something I said in the comments since a lot of people have picked up on the same thing: 
> On the coffee order thing, I think people are thinking that's a lot weirder than it is lmao. Our coffee shop uses plain white paper cups, so the barista who takes the order writes whatever the order is on the cup in black sharpie and passes it along to the barista making the drinks so they know what's going in each cup and they don't get confused. Like for example mine would say ""AMERICANO, BLACK, 2xGINGBREAD SYRUP"". She drinks chai lattes, and I had also commented in the past that I could never get on board with the whole tea latte thing so I didn't learn her order out of the blue.

8,Not the A-hole,"My brother's 13 and Minecraft has been his whole life since two-three years ago. He's made many friends through the game, and he normally tells me (16f) about them because we're close and I play with him too.

He's been playing with this dude from the US (we're from France) for about half a year. They met through one of the survival servers where I'm banned because I used cheats. I can't see their conversations directly unless I'm watching my brother play on his laptop, but he mentions the guy occasionally.

I'm suspicious because this person's 28 years old and added my brother in Kik too. It's one thing to play together on Minecraft, different age groups do it all the time, but chatting on an app? Why would you want to do that with a 13-year-old kid.

Then, the thing that made me most worried is this guy recently gifting my brother a *really* expensive rank from the server. Like, one of the highest ranks. My brother was really excited, but when I asked him ""why did he buy you that, you guys aren't that close"" my brother said he doesn't know either, the dude's probably just being nice because they play together.

I've played with plenty of people, both in Minecraft and other games, and none of them ever bought me an almost 100 euros rank for no reason.

Reddit, I'm considering telling my parents about this person. I think he has suspicious motives by his behavior. Do you think I would be the asshole, since my parents might prevent my brother from playing? Maybe I'm paranoid and have seen too many crime documentaries?!

I think you'll be more objective.",84,262,0.96
9,Asshole,"A few months ago a while eating lunch a friend came over who knew my other friends. I had only known him from one class. He stayed with us a few lunches but one day he brought up something unexpected. He stated that his dad was on stage four of cancer.

Here’s where I fucked up. Me and my friend group tend to act edgy and never take each seriously. Edgy being that we always tell stupid jokes that would get us in trouble, you get the point. After the other friend mentioned his father’s situation, I asked, “he’s so close to the last level and beating the game?”

After that he decided to leave. I hadn’t realized the gravity of the situation until that and even though I apologized with responding to me that I wasn’t the one who made him want to leave. 

Here’s where it is really fucked up. Today I learned via social media that his father has passed away and I feel that I’ve definitely fucked up and have a looming feeling that he’s come to hate me and I feel guilty. He never acted as if I was the asshole though but I secretly feel as if he just doesn’t want to deal with me.

12,Asshole,"I will admit, I was never the best father to my oldest son, Josh. When he was little, I was an alcoholic and fought with his mother constantly. Never anything physical, but he grew up with a lot of yelling and arguing and unfortunately finding me passed out in a drunken stupor many times. When he was about 5, I had an affair with another woman which eventually lead to a child being born. I ended up leaving my wife and starting a family with her and the child I had with her, Ben. It was then when I found god and got sober. Got a good job opportunity and moved a few states over. I tried to see Josh as much as I could, usually a few times a year and some holiday’s. My ex-wife was nothing but supportive about him visiting me, I just wish I could have done it more. My ex remarried a few years later to a nice man, and I know he and Josh got very close over the years.

For Christmas when Josh was 15, he came to visit me, my wife and his brother. It was then he had came out to me as gay – and I did not react the way I should have. At that point in my life, I had found Christianity and it was tethered to keeping me sober – and unfortunately I bought into a lot of the anti-gay sentiments my local church used to preach. I don’t visit that church anymore. For about two years we cut contact but I came to realization that I was wrong and I begged my son for forgiveness. He forgave me and we tried to regain the father/son relationship, although the distance being a few hours away didn’t help. We still would only see each other a couple times a year.

My son is now 21 and for this last Father’s Day, he surprised his step dad with a legal name change, changing his last name to match his step father’s. When I heard this, my feelings were crushed. He had not even contacted me for Father's Day. I knew that he and his step dad were close but I didn't think he would ever change his name. The next time I saw him, I asked him about it – why he didn’t at least give me a heads up. He told me that while he does forgive me for my past actions; he does not see me as a father figure and that his step father was always there for him. When I mentioned that he now didn’t have the same last name as his brother, he said he didn’t really care about that as he and his brother admittedly are not close.

I was crushed and angry. I contacted my ex and told he how upset I was with this and how I would have appreciated a heads up from her. She said she had nothing to do with his decision and that he came to her having already decided to change his name. I feel really bitter and resentful; I don’t even know where my relationship with my son will go from here now. I know I wasn’t the best father but I don’t know if I really deserve this? I feel like I should have had a heads up he was changing his name, instead of hearing about it after the fact. AITA here?

&#x200B;

**EDIT**: Reading the replies has really opened my eyes. My anger and resentment is misplaced and is coming from a place of complete guilt. I'm not angry or resentful of my son, I'm angry at myself for my past actions but my ego is making it feel otherwise. I'm currently writing a letter to my son's step father thanking him for being there for my son. I'm also going to apologize to my ex for blaming her for this because that was not right. I never brought any of this up to my son - after he gave me his explanation I stayed quiet. I know I've been a terrible father for most of his life - I hope even if he doesn't see me as a father figure, we can have a good relationship as an adult. He is a very thoughtful and forgiving person and I'm lucky he has given me multiple chances after many many screw-ups to still be apart of his life. I'm not going to mess it up again.

13,Not the A-hole," 

My dad's dog, Dennis, passed away around four months ago. Our family was grief stricken as we loved him deeply. Dennis was like my dad's third child, besides my step brother and I.

A few days ago, my dad and step mom adopted a puppy from the local shelter. I was ecstatic when I found out and went over to their place with lots of presents for the little guy (chew toys, balls, a puppy pen and a puppy bed). My step brother and his wife were also there with their 18 month old son. You may remember my SIL from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChoosingBeggars/comments/bk6gg3/my_step_sister_in_law_wanted_me_to_leave/) post.

She saw all of the puppy's gifts and gave me a really annoyed look. I asked if she was OK. To which she replied ""well, I just think it's a bit cruel to my child that you're parading all these toys in front of him and haven't even gotten anything for him.""

Keep in mind that it wasn't my nephew's birthday, or any other special occasion. I reminded her of this fact and she seemed shocked and said something like, ""So what? He's your nephew! Doesn't he deserve better treatment than a pet? You could've gotten a few toys for him.""

So I told her ""First of all, your kid is 18 months old and is incapable of realizing that the puppy has been given a few toys. And second of all, just because I'm being nice to the puppy, doesn't automatically mean that I'm treating your son badly.""

Before she could reply, I just got up, said good bye to my dad, kissed the puppy and left.

14,No A-holes here,"Using a burner account for reasons. I recently proposed to my fiance and plan to get married by early next year after going out for the past 3 years.

&#x200B;

Now on top of organising a wedding, she wants to buy a 4 bedroom house for our future family. I've currently got a investment 2BR house on my own and used it to buy a business recently (in the last 1.5 years). Meanwhile she also has a 2 BR unit. She want me to maximise my borrowing potential so we can buy a house together, but her parents will be giving us 50-60% of the cost of the house and she wants the house to be in her name (without me, in case my business goes bankrupt we won't lose the house). I've told her if she wants to buy a house with her parents money too and wanting it all in her name that she does it alone, and that I will probably contribute in a years time once business picks up and I don't have to save up for (my half of) the wedding.

&#x200B;

We both have 2BR properties which can support a small family for the time being, but she stills wants to buy a bigger house right 'now'.

&#x200B;

AITA for not wanting to invest in a house with my fiance who only wants it in her name on the title (as asset protection) and her parents?

&#x200B;

NOTE: I'm also thinking long term (aka: when she has kids and won't be working) that I will be able to pay for her part of the mortgage AS WELL as my part if I do invest with her. Also if I do invest by getting another mortgage loan, it will cover around 15-20% of the house cost. **So I can't contribute much anyway.**

16,Not enough info,"Obligatory throwaway, I’m on mobile, ya da, ya da...

Last year I was suddenly thrown into a very high stress scenario where I thought I was going to lose my job. I am the only one working as my wife stays at home.

To relieve some of the stress, a coworker suggested I vape. I took his advice and for a few weeks would occasionally vape when things got really stressful. I never brought it home, and quit when I realized how dumb I was. 

I later on found a new job and apparently I packed the vape in one of my boxes and put it in our shed. I completely forgot about it until my son found it today and took it to my wife. She completely freaked out, saying is betrayed her trust, threatened to expose me to her family, threatened divorce, and just drove off.

Earlier today, my husband and I were on the porch smoking. Across the street, I hear the neighbors screaming pretty loudly. I listened for about 5 min. but couldn't make out what they were arguing about. Then, I hear ""get off me!"" several times. We agreed we should call the police, so I did. 

They arrived, we were still on the porch, and the lady screamed across at me saying she knew I called and yadda yadda. We went inside. Cops left. Nothing came of it. I felt bad, but I was concerned at the time. If I needed help I would hope someone would hear me, you know? 

Fast forward to 12am. We are out smoking again before bed. An older man (he lives there, it was his son and daughter in law arguing) comes across to my porch and sits with no invitation. He was talking about his guns and asked if we heard the commotion. Basically making it clear he ""goes to the shooting range a lot"" and asking if we knew who called. I lied and said no. It was super uncomfortable.  I am still uncomfortable. 

Did I make the wrong choice? It was none of my business, but he has no right to come over like that either.. I am just anxious now that he's acting that way.  AITA here? I sure do feel like it.",56,118,0.95

22,Not the A-hole,"My friend Brad has been overweight almost all of his life. Last month, for the first time, he decided to do something about it and set a goal of losing 100 lbs. Since then he has religiously gone to the gym and followed a diet. Our friend group was very happy for him and we all encouraged him to keep it up. 

Last weekend our friend group met up with all of us present for the first time since Brad started going to the gym. Our friends all told Brad that he looks thinner now, and he was so happy with the attention. Personally, I didn’t think he looked thinner. I’m not saying that he’s not getting results, just that for me the results aren’t obvious yet. He is 5’4 and 280 pounds (50% visceral fat according to him) so for me it’s not unbelievable for him to lose 10 pounds without it showing. 

Of course, I didn’t say that to him. I just smiled when my friends were saying he looked thinner. But I said that his dedication is amazing, asked questions about his training, and told him that we know he can reach his goal.

When I got home, Brad messaged me. He said he misses hanging out with us because he has to go to the gym daily now. I assured him that we understand and that we are still his friends even if he can’t hang out with us as often as before. He said thanks then asked if I thought he looked thinner now. 

I would like to include this part to explain where I am coming from. A few years ago, Brad asked me out but I declined because I am not attracted to him. We didn’t talk for a while but got over it and became friends again. He talks to me a lot, more than our other friends, and I try to be there for him as his friend because I know he is an introvert and finds it difficult to open up to people. But I try to manage our relationship in a way that he would know I’m still not interested in him romantically so he doesn’t think that I’m leading him on. For example, I can go to lunch with any of the other guys in our group, but when Brad texts me that he is in a restaurant near my house and asks if I already had lunch, I tell him I already ate or I’m running some errands so I can’t go. Yes, I don’t know if his intention is romantic or platonic, but I just decline politely to be safe. 

When he asked me if I thought he looked thinner, my guard went up. Six people told him that he looks thinner just a few hours ago, why is he asking this to me now? Does he care more about what I think, does he want me to complement him? So I honestly told him “Not really, but it’s just been a month, and I’m sure the results will be amazing when you reach your goal.”

He got angry and told me that I’m trivializing his efforts, and the least I could do was tell him yes to encourage him to continue. I didn’t know what else to tell him so I didn’t reply. We haven’t talked since, when he used message me daily.

23,Not the A-hole,"Over the last few months, I've been diagnosed with cancer. I've had a few out of pocket medical bills that I've made payment plans for. I openly complained about being low on money, as I don't make much but I still get by on paying my bills. Which is always a priority before anything else. My husband makes a bit more than I do. 

Out of the blue last week, he handed me a 100 dollar bill and said to put it toward one of the bills. It caught me off guard, but I was extremely grateful and took it. And I did keep my word, and put it toward a bill.

A couple days later, a friend and I were gabbing about makeup, and a specific product came up. I contemplated purchasing it, but wasn't sure. Then I decided why not? I needed something nice for myself so I bought it. It was a 50 dollar product. 

Tonight's the 4th and went to my mom's, my husband still at home because he has to work nights. He texted me and said he saw that I bought 50 dollar makeup and was annoyed that he gave me money for bills. I told him I did pay my bill with the money he gave me, but he says that instead of being 150 dollars poorer, I'm 50 dollars richer because of him... It doesn't matter that I paid for it with my own money, if I didn't actually need help with my bill I shouldn't have accepted the money.

I told him that I didn't take the money whilst knowingly going to purchase something days later. What is the idea here? That if he ever offered me money that I wouldn't be allowed to make a self purchase during that pay period? The month? If that in the future I should decline the money because I might make a purchase? I understand his point that if I needed the money I wouldn't have made a 50 dinner purchase as well. But regardless of he had given me money or not, I still would have paid my bill AND bought myself that one thing. I complain on being low on money because of these extra bills, not not that I can't manage our don't have enough. I didn't ask for help. He says I'm an asshole for not apologizing and for taking advantage of him.

So help me out Reddit, AITA??

EDIT* So we talked it out this morning and it basically boiled down to a miscommunication. I guess I made some comments about ""I don't know how I'm supposed to do all these random little bills"" or something of the like and he heard ""I don't know how I'm supposed to get by with these extra bills"" and that's why he felt decieved by me buying makeup after being given money to help alleviate some of the stress of the medical bill. I apologized for being unclear and he accepted and said that if he had known, he would have paid the bill and bought me the makeup too. He's happy to do so. 

There's absolutely no ""financial abuse"" in our relationship. There never has been. We've always divided out the shared bills and pay those specific bills. Even when we weren't married I paid a medical bill for him because he was short for the pay period. I understand and appreciate everyone's perspective but I think it's weird that everyone thinks it's weird that we do it that way... Pretty normal honestly lol. It's just worked for us for the entirety of our relationship. But we always help one another out if we need to. So yah, all is well. Just a misunderstanding.

24,Not the A-hole,"Recently due to a request from my girlfriend, I have started growing in a goatee ( can't grow a full beard unfortunately).  She loves it, I like it (makes me look older), and I have had a lot of people comment positively on it stating that I look a lot more mature with it.

Now everyone can have their own opinions, but my friend (F from here on out) hates it, and does t hesitate to let everyone know. I just went to break, and a coworker commented on how it was growing in and said he was a big fan. Well F immediately mentions how she doesnt like it. I, like I always do, said ""well good thing I can style myself however I like"". 

F wasn't a fan of this and went on about how some people can pull it off but I'm not one of those people and need to get rid of it. And mentions how a lot of people have apparently told her that I don't look good with it. 

This is in front of about 10 coworkers, most of whom I consider to be my friends. I was sick and tired of hearing her negatively comment on it all the time. And basically told her that I dont care how she falls about it, and that if she didnt stop trying to convince me to get rid of it and telling me she hates it  (Especially in front of our friends), that I would drop being friends with her. 

She started crying and left the group, and while no one said anything, I feel as tho some of the group disapproved and will be cold to me in the future.

25,Not the A-hole,"It’s school holidays here in Australia. I live on a hill with a steep road, right next to a corner where cars tend to drive quite fast around. 

The local neighbourhood kids find it thrilling to ride a skateboard down the hill road (without helmets) for 6-7 hours at a time.  Between the devilish screams once every few minutes, my family and I now constantly hear cars screeching to a halt and beeping because they come round the corner to see the kids playing in the middle of the street.

After letting it slide for a few days, I decided to go out and say something about how dangerous it is to be playing on such a road, especially without any helmets, and you’ll most likely cause an accident. 

I of course look like the sad old grouch not letting kids play. Don’t get me wrong, happy they’re playing outside but I don’t think it should be in such a dangerous place.",34,33,0.85

28,Not the A-hole,"Yesterday, July 3, I (21F) went out with a group of friends (21F) to a brewery which happened to be in an area with a family friendly firework show going on. Me and 2 of my girl friends had to pee so we hopped into the very long line for the women's restroom. As we got to the front, a group of pretty drunk women got in line behind us. When we reach the front of the line (\~15 minutes later) a mom and her young daughter come up to us and the mother politely asks if her daughter can use the restroom before us. The mom and daughter obviously came from outside watching the fireworks. The mom said she tried to make her daughter use the portapotty outside but she refused. Well, the women behind us had a big problem with this. They made multiple snarky comments like ""your daughter can wait in line like everyone else"" and eventually one of the women targeted us saying ""you ladies have a lot to learn"" ??? Seeing that the young girl literally had her hand over herself to stop herself from peeing, we still ended up letting the mom and her daughter go before us. She literally took less than 2 minutes to pee and then my friends and I went in together to make the line move a little quicker for everyone else. Eventually we got back to the rest of our group and one of our friends was on the other ladies' side. She claims that the little girl probably has the ""strongest bladder out of all of us"" and that she should've used the portapotty when she had the chance.

So for context my husband and I are moving to a different state in a couple of weeks. It was a little unexpected as we knew we were going to move but didn’t realize it was going to be so soon (like two weeks soon).

My husband didn’t know for sure when we were moving until the day before yesterday (Tuesday) and so we talked about and agreed it’d be the best option for us. 

Anyways yesterday we told my family as they live like 2 blocks from us and they didn’t take it well. 

My mom started saying things like “good I’m glad you hated us anyways” “good thing cause you were a terrible person” “now you really don’t have a reason to visit us other than you don’t like us” 

Keep in mind that I am an introvert and I try to socialize with them once a week but that’s not enough for them. 

So by the end of the night I was crying from there constant insults and just general dislike they had towards me. That I just got up and let mid conversation.

So fast forward to today, I was at work and I knew my husband was going to spend time with his family and tell them the news of us moving. Well I got off early and he invited me to go celebrate with them. 

I said I didn’t really feel like it cause I didn’t want to be reminded of family since mines really had me down. 

I just went home after work and watch shows. Then he comes home with his family to try and convince me to go out (he didn’t give me warning mind you) and try to make me feel bad since it would be the last time we see them. (It wouldn’t be, we’re moving an hour an a half away). But again I said no that I don’t want to be reminded of family because I’m still hurt from mine and that seeing how family is suppose to be made me sad. 

He got upset with me and said I was being an asshole for not coming out with his family. But I think my reason is justified.

So Reddit, am I the asshole?",15,35,0.86
30,Not the A-hole,"Using a throwaway.

So, I [29M] founded a startup in 2014, and after some venture capital, it's really taken off in the past two years, making me pretty wealthy. My strategy (I'm keeping it vague for obvious reasons) is to corner a smaller niche/market and then slowly expand into related markets, corner them, so on and so forth. Amazon had the same strategy: first it cornered the online books market, then I believe it moved into CDs and other forms of media, since they're kind of related to books. 

My business has put some other companies in our initial niche out of business, and our expansion has started to cause profits to dwindle for the markets we're expanding into. 

Now, my sister Amy [23F] is very critical of my business practices. She thinks it's 'unethical' of me to deliberately undercut other companies. She always talks about how I'm making people 'lose their jobs' and how I'm being 'unfairly aggressive'. The fact of the matter, imo, is that it's just business. When you're selling something similar to other companies, competition is bound to happen, and everyone tries to undercut each other. If I were to play nice, it would be my company out of business and my employees now out of a job.

Secondly, it is ironic how she criticizes me given the fact she (and the rest of the family) live off my income: I pay the tuition for her college (she's doing her masters), I pay for apartment, I bought her car, so on and so forth. So if she finds my practices so wrong, why is she still using my money?

Being July 4th, we were supposed to have a family dinner. Both Amy and I were annoyed, since we would prefer to be going out with our friends, but it's a family tradition. Amy kept swiping at me over business, so I calmly asked her why she's driving a car I bought, from an apartment I paid for, and so on and so forth, because it's hypocritical to dislike my business practices and still accept money that comes from them. She got incredibly mad.

32,Not the A-hole,"My nephew is challenging. He is 10 years old about to turn 11 and acts more like a three year old. My sister in law lets him stay up all night and play what I would consider inappropriate video games, even during the school year. He is on his laptop all the time., even during holiday meals and church. 
The last three visits with him at my house have forced me to ban him from our home. My sister in law dumps him on her parents, my in laws all the time and treats her parents like crap. A couple of weeks ago they came over for dinner and had unexpectedly had to pick him up so they brought him along. They made him get off his laptop and try to eat something and he was so angry he just spit the food on the floor and told me it was gross. That night only got worse because when they told him to put the computer away because they were leaving he told them no and struck his 74 year old grandfather across the face. The only way we got him off the game was to actually turn off the WiFi. 
Then next to last time he came over I asked him what he thought of his new cousin, my daughter who was 6 months old. He told me he liked her about as much as Stalin liked Jews. I was so shocked I wasn’t sure what to say and my poor mother in law just apologized and took him home.
Yesterday he came over and threw a tantrum in the floor because his game was buffering. I explained the internet was hooked to our tv and if there was a problem with the internet the tv would buffer so it must be his game. I asked him to pause it for a second so we could talk to him about a season pass we were planning on buying him to a local water park. My mother in law is going through her second round of chemo and is exhausted so I told her I could take him to the water park when she watched him. He screamed in my face and then stormed around my house screaming bloody murder until his game stopped buffering. Here’s the thing, my husband doesn’t even get to yell at me. I come from an abusive family and we make it a point to never yell in our house so this triggered me and I was a mess for the rest of the day.
I had had enough so when my sister in law called today enquiring about his pass we were suppose to get him I told her we won’t be taking him and he’s not coming back over until he can control himself better. She uses the excuse that a couple of weeks ago he was diagnosed with high functioning autism, but I don’t buy it. I’ve worked with kids with autism and he doesn’t quite hit the mark. I was also raised with a sibling who is autistic and went to a special school who didn’t ever exhibit this behavior. This sibling will never live away from parents, be able to drive, or have a normal life but still doesn’t throw down like my nephew. He gets therapy at public school twice a week and will be able to drive and is just no where in the same ballpark, yet is so disrespectful.

33,Not the A-hole,"I am a butch lesbian and for the past 12 years I have had a short, men's style haircut. I'm not talking about a pixie cut that requires a lot of styling and time. My sides are buzzed fairly short with the top a bit longer. It usually only takes about 10- 15 minutes for me to get a haircut. During that time every salon I've gone to has charged me for a full price women's cut. This has always annoyed me and I don't enjoy paying almost double what men with the exact same haircut as me pay.

Recently I moved and yesterday I went to a new shop for my monthly trim and I decided to try something new. I asked if I could be charged the $22 for a men's cut rather than $40 for a woman's cut. The woman at the counter looked like I slapped her. She called a manager and the stylist over and they seemed shocked by the suggestion. They talked about it among themselves and then told me it wasn't possible. I pushed back and explained my reasoning and all they would say was they don't charge by style. 12 years of frustration boiled over and I ended up leaving. I was never rude or mean, but I still feel bad that I wasted a stylist's appointment.

AITA for asking? Leaving? Being annoyed at what I see as a double standard?

35,Not enough info,"I am caucasian and male and my girlfriend is Latina. She is very sweet but sometimes has a bit of a strange sense of humour. She is fluent in spanish and english (I am trying to learn spanish for her a bit). At school today she called me a term that is used in her ethnic patois (not spanish but a slang that some American-Latino people use).  I was not familiar with the term and didn't have my phone on me at the time so I asked her what it means and she said it meant ""beautiful"" and ""gentle"".  I was quite flattered by this. However, I noticed some other Latino girls found it funny. 

Out of curiosity I  looked it up later and was disappointed to find out it didn't mean any of those things she said. Instead it was a racial slur for white people and meant something like ""bitch"" or ""ho"". I messaged her saying I was upset at her not because of the term itself but because she lied to me. She said she had used it in a 'loving' way.  I said I would never call her a racial slur and then I said I had work to do so switched off my phone and haven't looked at the messages since. 

Am I right to be annoyed at her. I don't see how she could be using those terms 'lovingly' at all. I never make racial jokes about her. In fact I defended her when someone at school made an ICE joke about her. I also stopped her getting kicked out of the house by her mom (she was using drugs and treating her mom badly and I promised her mom I would make sure she didn't do drugs anymore, which I have done successfully).",42,41,0.78
36,Not the A-hole,"As the title says. About two weeks ago my friend J mentioned in one of our chats that his puppy seemed sad, was not moving a lot and has darker stool. I told him to bring the puppy to his vet because it might be sick with ehrlichia, I know that disease because our dogs have had it in the past. He said he will try to find time to bring his dog to the vet.

J comes from a rich family and works for his dad in their family business. Money is no object and it should be easy to just ask his dad for half a day off to bring his puppy to the vet. But for some reason he did not.

Yesterday he started posting on Facebook that his dog is seriously sick and is confined in an animal hospital for treatment, with pictures of the dog lying down hooked to an IV. Our friends comforted him and he replied with thanks, then talked about how much he loves his dog and hopes he will get better soon. I was irritated because I think that if you really love your pet, and money and time aren't a problem, you would bring them to your vet within days of noticing that they are not well and not wait for them to get seriously sick. I also thought he was using his dog's sickness for attention, but I didn't say anything.

Then J messaged me personally and asked if I'd seen his Facebook post. I said yes. He said he is really depressed and doesn't think he can handle losing his dog. At this point I snapped. I told him how could he say that he can't handle losing his dog if he didn't do anything for weeks after noticing that it was not well? I reminded him that I said he should bring his dog to the vet immediately, yet he didn't do anything for weeks. Is that how you treat something that you can't handle losing?

He was surprised at my reaction and became defensive. He said that if I was in his situation he would be comforting me and not scolding me. I didn't reply anymore but in my head I was thinking, no, I will never be in your situation because I bring my dogs to the vet when I see that they're not well. I would've understood if he was broke or had a job he couldn't get time off from. I would even have understood if he said he didn't think the sickness would be serious.

38,Not the A-hole,"When I was a young man I fathered a child. The mother and I both agreed to abortion and I gave her the money for it. We parted company and I assumed she had the abortion. A year later she came to me and said she'd had the baby. I told her nothing had changed, I still didn't want a relationship but I would gladly provide financial security. I was born into a well-off family and my parents activated one of my trusts. I signed the entire thing over to the child, Carmen, and went to court to give up my rights, agreeing to child support. I was assigned one amount but I paid double that, increasing as the years went on to reflect my growing financial status.

&#x200B;

In the years after Carmen's birth I graduated with a phd, entered a career field that has made me a very wealthy man, married and fathered two amazing girls. Through all this I promptly paid my child support and made sure the trust I signed over was growing healthily. Carmen's mother harassed me for several years to have a relationship with Carmen but I always declined. Several times she harassed my wife and daughters in an attempt to ""reason"" with me. I. never wavered in my mindset, I never met Carmen.

&#x200B;

In 2016 Carmen started attempting to contact me. She wrote a letter to which I replied politely and kindly with firm rejection. I wasn't cruel but I was frank. She's leave it but pop up again every few months and I'd gently decline her attempts. My parents and my daughters have all also declined to have a relationship with her despite having always had my blessing to have a relationship.

&#x200B;

When her attempts started escalating I made some financial threats. The trust I set up for her had some stipulations. She could have just enough to pay for college and the remainder would be released to her when she turned 30, which will be very soon. She started harassing us with phone calls and letters and emails, she found my daughters' various social medias and harassed them despite their declinations of her attempts. I told her I'd take her trust away if she didn't stop.

&#x200B;

Recently she showed up at my father's family reunion and introduced herself as my daughter. I was stressed after three years of her behavior and snapped. I yelled at her, told her the trust was as good as gone, and that she was the worst mistake I ever made. She left in tears. I called my money manager and took away the trust, which I still control.

&#x200B;

As time has passed I regret how I spoke to her but not taking away her trust fund. My family feels that it was too harsh and I should give it back. I wrote Carmen a letter apologizing for my behavior. Her mother wrote back and said that I was a dead-beat father and a horrible person and they both feel entitled to some of my amassed wealth. I told her that as far as Carmen is concerned I'm done, she'll never see a penny from me again.

&#x200B;

I'm conflicted, AITA?

&#x200B;

ETA: the consensus is ESH, and I agree wholeheartedly. I'll make strides.

&#x200B;

ETA: I was 20 years old when Carmen was born. The mother made the choice to abort, took my money, and didn't speak to me or contact me for a year until Carmen was a newborn. I literally had a newborn sprung on me. The mom at least had nine months to get used to the idea. What if she had been adopted out after birth and she was coming looking for biological family? Her mother made the choice to have her after telling me one thing and I'm supposed to just jump on board. I DID NOT WANT A CHILD. And why is not wanting a relationship with a stranger so terrible. I never lied about my intentions. I was always up front from the beginning that I would never be involved. How is it my fault that Carmen's mother got her expectations up? I had nothing to do with this girl beyond conception and my legal obligation to pay for her living. I did a hell of a lot more than most absentee parents do; at least I cared enough to provide for her.

&#x200B;

ETA: I just realized something I never mentioned: Carmen and her mother lived across the country from my family and I. My family and I live in Connecticut, she and her mother live in Washington State. Carmen moved to CT in 2016. Before that move across country the only time I ever met her or spoke to her was when she was about two months old. So between roughly March of 1990 and July of 2016 I never met the child or spoke to the child. The mother, however, would occasionally call my house and make demands, going so far as to call and scream at my wife. So maybe I am somewhat biased against Carmen for her mother's attitude but what needs to be understood is I relinquished my rights, I never had any rights to Carmen after her birth, not that I ever wanted them. And considering her mother took her all the way across the country from where I was would have made having a proper relationship very difficult. Sure you can try as a parent (which I am not) to make it work, people do it everyday, but the point is, I did not want to. I wish this sub-reddit didn't have a word limit, there's so much of the story I had to leave out to hit the 3000 word limit. I can't possibly explain a 30 year history in 3000 words. I respect those who say that IATA or ESH but try and remember, this is not the entire story, but just what I could fit in this box. Oh, I've decided to give the trust back but I'm turning the control of it over to someone else. I have also spoken to Carmen and have agreed to one meeting, a single meeting. I will answer any questions she may have but that is it. That is all I'm willing to give. Frankly, my family isn't comfortable having her around nor am I. My daughters, the ones she's been harassing, are 14 and 13. Carmen has been harassing actual children. Getting on the social media pages of two pre-teen girls. When she started harassing them my girls were 10 and 9. Yes, I allowed my children that young to have social media, protected by my wife and I of course. So to the people who are sending me death and violence threats against myself and my family, please remember you're getting 3000 words vs 30 years of history.

During that meeting, which we’re paid for,(with no supervision from anyone over 25) my coworkers complain about the most hellish kids they’ve encountered, dick around on Snapchat, and then go get Taco Bell. A VERY loose iteanrry is produced.

It is summer so it’s not like she needs to be asleep by a certain time and on the weekends especially she doesn’t have to worry about work, but I don’t want her staying out past 10.

Backstory details: 
My girlfriend is Mexican. Spanish is her first language. She moved from mexico to the United States at age five. We are both twenty two now, so she’s been in the US for 17 years. 

My girlfriend and I only speak English with each other. I’ve asked her to teach me Spanish, but she finds it difficult because she’s a native speaker so she just knows things and can’t explain them to me, which I understand. I am learning Arabic for my graduate degree so I can’t study Spanish on my own time right now, but plan to in the future once I finish my degree. 

We have lived together for over a year. She works full time while I’m in school. We split the chores/daily responsibilities and one of mine is the grocery shopping. 

Okay so that’s the backstory. 

The issue is this: 

In the area where my girlfriend is from, she (and her family and friends, I checked) call the green citrus fruit (what i would call a lime) and the yellow fruit (what i would call a lemon) “limones” which translates to lemon in english. So they call both of them by the same name, to be clear. 

At first I didn’t know this. So whenever she asked me to buy lemons, I bought the yellow fruit. Then one day we went to the store together and she called the limes lemons and I was like ???? and the discrepancy was revealed. 

Now, whenever we are cooking or I am going to the store, she says lemons (but she means limes). I said, well what if you want the yellow lemons? And she said “I would never use a yellow lemon” so. But for some reason it really bothers me! Like, is it /that/ hard to call it a lime a lime, even if you learned it differently? But her counter is, I should just always assume she means “lime” when she says “lemon”, but for some reason this drives me crazy!!

So, solve this discussion for us.

He wants to buy the smaller shop (mainly because a friend is selling it) at the same time that he buys the shop that makes money.

47,No A-holes here,"My daughter went through something awful at 14 and ended up pregnant. She wanted to keep the baby and I tried to be as supportive as possible, but it was difficult. I have a younger son with special needs, was going through a tumultuous divorce from their father and my company had downsized so while I hadn’t been fired, I had been working long hours. My daughter had her son and social services stepped in. Because my daughter legally could not work, they gave me guardianship until she could. I was legally and financially responsible for this child. My daughter did her best to help, but she was still a kid herself. My ex gave money for the baby on top of child support but didn’t want the baby at his house.

After about 3 months, I spoke with the social worker and said that I could not handle this. I was drowning between work, my son that needed a lot of help, the baby and everything else. They reminded me that if I didn’t do it, he’d end up in care or would need to be adopted out. I chose to have him adopted out, through a closed adoption. It was hard, but it was the best choice for the baby. My daughter, at the time, seemed to understand, though she was sad. She was already in therapy and I thought that would help her through it.

It’s been 10 years since then and my daughter recently confronted me. She’s now married and they’re trying for their first baby together. She says that it wasn’t fair what I did and that I should’ve at least gone with foster care, because then she could’ve gotten him back. She said her choice was ripped away from her. I told her that she was a victim in all of it, but it wasn’t my fault either. I asked why this took so long to come out and she said it’s because her husband is an adoptee and she’s seen how different his experience was. After talking with him, I am starting to feel guilt.

I also think they just don’t want me to leave because they’re sentimental and they love me and I’m their only child... I love them too, but our town just doesn’t have any perspectives, and I need to live me life and be who I am and I can’t do that here.

The tuition at said university is free and I could work half time to support my own living costs. 

I’m thinking of just ignoring their opinion and going there in case I’m accepted. Of course that’s a very selfish thing to do. I feel sorry for them.

51,Not the A-hole,"I (24f) met up with an old friend from school I haven’t seen in about 2 and a half years. I’ve always been pudgy but after a bad back injury I ballooned to my highest weight of 330lbs-ish, this would have been the last time she saw me. I lost around 190lbs since then. She has gained some weight since having a baby but not a massive amount or something I would have even thought about.

We went for coffee and she asked me a ton of questions about it; how i had done it, how long it took me, etc. I thought we had a pretty pleasant time but when I got back her boyfriend messaged me and said I had really upset her. I made a comment in passing that I never wanted to be above 165 again - this was the weight where I felt as comfortable as I do now and she got upset because she’s above this.

I called her straight away to apologize and said I didn’t mean to upset her but that I meant I wouldn’t want to be more then that but if she’s comfortable that’s what matters and that at around that weight I wasn’t comfortable anymore. She said I was super patronizing and that I should understand after being the fat friend all through school then she hung up on me. 

My sister says I’m TA for trying to explain it away and I should have just apologized. I was only trying to make it better but I guess I can kind of see her point.

52,Not the A-hole,"My partner has been writing a novel since I've known him. It has been a way for him to relax and I fully support this. 

He often asks me if it is good. 

I feel so horribly guilty about it but I don'think that it is. He uses names and traits that are literally identical to famous literary characters and scenarios that are action 101. He is aware of this and thinks it is fine. The book isn't a 'oh that reminds me of....' it is flat out 'oh this is from that movie...'. If someone sued him for copyright, I'd think 'that's fair', in fact if I was them, I would. He sets it in a different country which he says makes it not fan fic and that it is 'inspired' by the original. 

 I cannot criticise the book in any way because although he says he wants an 'honest opinion' constantly, if I even suggest a word change, I get a half an hour on why that word was chosen and he brings it up subsequently when he mentions it eg: 'I know you hate the (word) in chapter 5 but...' even months later. He is snarky and catty about even if he feels like I haven't listened to the latest part with enough enthusiasm. 

His father always made him feel worthless and so he is sensitive. 

He will talk to me for ages about a plot twist or the latest situation and I listen and he feels great afterwards and thanks me profusely for being 'so supportive' when I've just agreed with him the entire time.

I think he could write a fictional pov about his real life (which is interesting) and people would lap that up. He disagrees. 

He has decided to try to get this novel published now with plans of sequels and has informed me that he would be furious if I lied to him about it and that he wouldn't be able to EVER trust me again. That this book will take money and time and that he doesn't want to waste it on a pipe dream no one wants to read anyway. 

I've been justifying not telling him my truth as I see it, by saying things like 'well you know fifty shades sold a lot', that it isn't a genre that I read, 'not every book is for everyone' and skirting the issue because I don't want to hurt him and I am not the decider of which books sell.

I have offered solutions of self publish or a third neutral party or a friend to read the book.

Let me preface this with saying my best friend (G) and I have always had a weird relationship. G is 20F and I’m 21M. We go periods of time without seeing each other but we always meet right where we left off. We go through bouts of dating, being fwb and then dating again. There’s never been any resentment, there’s actually lots of love there, but I do feel like she’s invested more emotionally than I am. 

One day right after I dropped her off G messaged me that she needed to talk to me, this made me really anxious. When we met up G told me she miscarried what would have been our child. G said she was sorry for springing this on me and had no one else she could talk to about it, her family is very strict, her religious mother still believes she’s a virgin. G said she was gathering the courage to tell me about the pregnancy and then she ended up miscarrying. 

I’m going to admit I’m not the the most emotional person, G moved away after high school, I had a whole different relationship for about a year and a half, broke it off around the same time G decided to move back. I didn’t really feel upset. I just thought what’s done is done. I went through a similar reaction, told her I was glad she told me, that I hope she’s okay mentally, physically etc. G told me she hopes this doesn’t change anything between us and I told her not to worry. Left it at that, I dropped her off at home. 
I replayed our conversation in my head and started to freak myself out, I decided to focus on my work and in doing so weeks went by without us speaking. I figured if G wanted to talk to me she would. A couple more weeks go by, I was at work and received a text from G our convo went like this

G: Hey, I know you said I have nothing to be sorry about but i am, like I really can’t help but feel like all I did was add stress to you and logically I know that’s the part of me that overthinks and idk I’m just really afraid of losing you and I know that I needed you to know this but I was really scared this would be the turning point of you never wanting to talk to me or see me again

Me: listen if you’re good, I’m good. Don’t be sorry

G: I really don’t think you understood what I was saying or only half of it at least

I was over it, didn’t respond, it’s been a few more weeks and after attending one of my shows she texted me saying about how talented I am. I didn’t respond, I believe she needs time away from me. Our mutual friend has been wondering why we haven’t been hanging out, I explained the situation and he stared in disbelief afterwards, called me an “emotionally constipated dickhead” and said I should reach out to her to reassure her. I care about her but we handle our emotions so differently I don’t think I’d be any help.

TLDR; got my friend pregnant, she miscarried. I tried to comfort her but her constant worrying pushed me further into my work and now my friends are calling me a dick for not reaching out.

54,Not the A-hole,"Today I took my dog to the dog park to quickly excercise him before we left on a road trip.  The dog park is 2 levels of fields about 10ft in elevation difference. I noticed a group of dogs that are generally a bit less obedient on the lower side so I went up to the unoccupied upper field. I am 50 ft away from the lip of the transition to the lower field and out of sight of the other dogs and owners.

After a few throws another dog came over and took the ball when my dog dropped it. This dog proceeded to return to their owner. No big deal, I have treats, I figure I can negotiate.

I walk over and before I can say anything the owner says ""he wont give the ball back."" I try to offer the treat and the dog is indifferent, hes just avoiding me.

I ask the lady to help and she says she cant do anything. I ask if I can take my ball and she says that the dog will bite. She offers to have me follow her through the trail network to her car, 30 mins away, to get another ball. Normally I would have been fine with it, but we were leaving soon so I didnt have time. I tell her that I dont have time and she just says 'oh well, see you next week.'

I say that's not ok, I need my ball. At this point she's calling me unreasonable. She asks what I expect her to do,  and I suggest either getting me my ball or buying a new one. At this point she starts on a tirade of how I'm the worst person shes ever met and how I'm not welcome at this public dog park.

I tell her I'll accept 5 dollars for the ball (turns out my wife paid $24 for 3 balls), and she begrudgingly starts to count out change as she continues to berate me. I made a few comments about her **four** dogs being untrained and how she should be a better dog owner and then left.

Over the years though, I've been getting progressive and hold progressive views including matters on lgbtq+ that other Christians probably don't. My girlfriend of 1 year also holds these progressive views. Last week, she asked if she could come to church with me and my family. I said sure, and we all went this sunday.

We didn't go to the main sermon, but the side one held for teens/young adults and the topic was on gay people. Long story short, there were tones of disappointment and looking down on gays from the pastor and people listening to the sermon and after we got home, my gf was pretty pissed. Said church members were trash and cursing them out and told me to never go there again. I told her I was sorry but I still believed in god and wanted to go and she got angry.

57,Not the A-hole,"I started having issues with my oldest daughter around the time she turned 15 and we had to move from our home state, for my husband’s job. We tried to make the transition as easy as possible (moved at the end of the school year, had a big party for all her friends, got her a cell phone so she could keep in contact with them, etc.). When we moved to our new area, she seemed to fall into a bad crowd. She began drinking, doing drugs and staying out well into the early hours of the morning. The first time she ran away, she was gone for 2 weeks, we had no clue where she was. We got her a therapist and it seemed to work for a while, but then she refused to go and we were back at square one. She didn’t want to talk to us at all. She’d run away, come back several times.

A little before her senior year, she came to us and told us that she was pregnant. Given her mental state, on top of her drinking and drug use, we were very worried about how this would go. We tried to persuade her to either abort or give the baby up for adoption, but she insisted on having the baby. She had a very tiny baby girl. We thought maybe this would wake her up. She stayed sober throughout her pregnancy and had started therapy again and we were very supportive. However, it didn’t take long for her to start going out and not caring. We started taking care of the baby, because we knew that someone had to and she couldn’t suffer because of her mom.

A little after her 18th birthday, she took off again. My husband and I got full custody of our granddaughter. She came back about 6 months later, sober and promising to be better. We talked it over and had conditions. We told her she had to get a job or enroll in community college, she had to keep attending A.A meetings and parenting classes. We said we didn’t expect her to care for her daughter, but we could work on her being more of a parent and her daughter getting to know her more. She was all for it…for about 6 months. We found out through one of our younger kids that she had dropped out of school and was spending her days with our granddaughter’s father, a bad influence who’s a drug dealer and isn’t going to help her sobriety. A fight broke out and she left. A year and half passed and we didn’t hear from her.

She (now 20 years old) recently came back, sober once again and pregnant. She has a job (confirmed) and just wants to live with us, saving up until she can turn her life around. We’ve heard this story before. Our granddaughter is now 3.5 years old and will remember her mother walking away again. We’re already suspecting this baby will end up in our care too. We have 4 other children (15, 13, 10 and 8) to think of as well. We told her we can’t take her back in this time, though if her baby ends up needing a place to say, we will take them.

First off, my girlfriend is amazing. She's loving, kind, and deserves the best. I feel like I reciprocate atleast pretty well and I know she agrees. I love to love and I love being mushy all over my girlfriend when it's just the two of us. She also loves to, but always pushes it when we're in public. Im a very private person, I hate to commit PDA and I especially hate seeing PDA when I'm in public. I've explained this and she understands.

It's going well, but my girlfriend keeps giving me the occasional kiss on the cheek. I think whatever, as long as it's not too much I won't stop her. Then she keeps forcing my head to turn to her so she can give me a deep kiss. I let her do this twice, but on the third time I kinda give her a nudge and a look.

60,Everyone Sucks,"I was on a Flight from the UK to Dubai where I was joining a ship - Merchant Navy. 

I got on the flight and had an emergency exit seat - front row of economy cabin on a window seat.  Due to the seat designation I was amongst the first to board. Placed my hand baggage in the forward most over head locker - closest to my seat and sat down.

Around 30 minutes before landing the cabin crew handed out the landing cards. I went to fetch a pen from my bag and I found my bag was gone and the overhead locker is full of other bags. I went into a panic - my document folder containing all of my certification and documentation for work were in the bag, if I lost that I would be unable to join the ship, it may not be possible to get new copies of it all and my seaman's discharge book is a fairly sacred thing, if I were to lose these documents I would not be able to work for a month at the very least while I get new copies of everything, I would also lose massive amounts of face with my company. 

The woman in the row behind me (aisle seat) notices my look of dismay and tells me she moved it further aft into another locker. I ask her where and she vaguely directs me to around middle of cabin. After some panic I find it and confirm everything is in good order - nothing missing. When I return to my seat still flustered she declares in an unapologetic tone that my bag was in her space or words to that effect as justification for her moving it. 

I snapped at this and just blew my lid: Used words to the effect of Asking her who the fuck she thinks she is touching other people's bags and what the fuck right to the overhead locker she thought she had. I didn't make any threats I just offloaded on her. At the end of my tirade the woman and her daughter (around 12) were in tears and the son (15) had gone pretty pale. The rest of the cabin was just a sea of disapproving disgusted faces glaring at me. 

This situation is bugging me now and I keep playing it in my head.

So AITA here? I sure as fuck felt like it at the time but at the same time I feel I was justified to an extent? 

I feel I should add - I used naughty language but nothing worse than I heard from the Mother earlier in the flight.

Edit: Just want to clarify something that may or may not be a factor here. But once I found all was in order I proceeded back to my chair angry but not wanting a confrontation about it. It was her that engaged the discussion by straight up blaming me for using ""her"" space - that is why I lost my cool and had a go at her.

Edit 2: As I was in the front row emergency exit seat I couldn't place the bag under my seat for landing.

Edit 3: For reference my document folder is fairly hefty: a clunky A4 Binder with some additional file spaces. It contains all of my certification required for being onboard.

I explained to her I had it because sometimes I want to jerk off and I don’t want to bother her or she’s just not around. She got very upset and deleted the album for me and told me to call her next time I want to have some inspiration but also specified that next time might be a little while.

We were at a family gathering. My sister has two kids, one 13 year old boy (Tom) and a 15 year old girl(Emma). The TV was on, and something was mentioned on it about the fur industry, and how animals are abused and killed in it. Tom and Emma were both talking about how that's horrible, and that they would never want to anything fur related to support that industry. Emma specifically said that she wish she'd have known sooner (she already owns a fur coat). 

At this moment, I brought up the meat/dairy/egg industry and said the cruelty and death there can be as bad if not worse than the fur industry, and suggested that both of them have a look at the philosophy behind veganism. They both were surprised that I mentioned dairy and eggs, since that comes out of the animal, rather than meat which is the animal. Tom asked me to show them a video example, since he was doubting me. I warned him it's quite graphic, but he insisted, so I showed a youtube video of male chicks being sent into a blender as part of the egg industry. 

Needless to say, they were both quite shaken by these videos, and when they got home with their mother (my sister), she texted me saying I was out of order to push my vegan agenda on these kids, and that showing them those videos was basically child abuse which could scar them for life. She claimed they were refusing to eat the dinner she was giving them because it contained eggs. I replied back saying that they asked me, and that if it's so bad that they can't be allowed to see it, why should they be allowed to eat it.

I ordered three items mid-May from the same online shop during a sale. All three items were marked ""Made to Order"" which according to the website takes up to 15 days of processing time. I chatted with customer service to confirm, and they clarified it would be 15-20 days due to the high volume of orders during the sale. No big deal. 

After 20ish business days (a Monday), I chat with customer service to get the status of my order. They tell me my order is in the final stages and will ship out by Friday. Cool. Friday I recieve an email with tracking information for one item. I figure that the rest will ship out shortly. 

The following Wednesday, I inquire again about the rest of my order. They apologize, tell me the rest of my order is in the final stages and will ship out by Friday. I even get them to clarify that means both of the remaining items. Monday I recieve an email with tracking information for only one of the remaining items.

Wednesday I contact customer service again. I explain that were now at double the quoted processing time, and I'm getting frustrated. The agent apologizes and explains she doesn't know what the hold up is, but she'll do what she can to get it sent out ASAP. I decide to give it another week. 

A week later, I contact customer service about the status of my order and get the same story. I ask them to please cancel the remaining item as I'm tired of waiting. There are nearly identical products in stock at other shops that I can buy without having to wait excessively. They apologize, say they understand and refund me immediately. 

I arrive home to find a package, which happens to be the final item. I didn't receive a shipping notification for it, and clearly they don't have a record of sending it to me. 

For the record, the item is ~$500, significantly more than the other two items in my order. This is a luxury item for me, but by no means expensive compared to other items they sale. 

This also isn't a tiny boutique or Etsy shop. I don't think that eating the cost of one item will make a difference in their bottom line. 

Basically, I feel at least a little bit justified keeping it. I've spent about 1.5 hours with customer service up to this point just trying to get updated on my order. I waited double the quoted time before requesting a refund and was told multiple times that my order would arrive when I didn't. It was also their job to know when my item has shipped and keep track of that, which they failed to do. My time isn't worthless, and I didn't do anything deceptive to get myself in this situation up to this point.

We always poke fun at each other but recently there have been times where he takes it too far. For example, making comments about my appearance/weight. And as soon as I’m like okay that was too far, he’s like “come on it’s just a joke! please don’t be upset” And expects me to be over it in 2 seconds. But if I say anything to him, it’s a whole ass fight and he gives me the silent treatment.  (My jokes never have to do with his appearance/weight/personality. They’re more along the lines of me being better at something than him or stupid stuff like that) Which I think is so ridiculous but like I said two wrongs don’t make a right.

When they are together it is constant fighting. My wife can’t spend 30 min alone with her without WW3. My wife is just a worse person around her mom. 

I know there is a lot more people then just her mom back home. All of our friends and other family. We have missed out on some holidays and big family moments. So am I the asshole for letting my MIL be the only reason not to move back?",21,71,0.92
72,Not the A-hole,"So, to give some background, I hired a hair and makeup artist because my cousin was getting married, and I wanted to look my best for the photos. I found a makeup artist that does hair + makeup for only $120, and by the looks of her page, I thought she did a great job.

So I get to her studio, and she does my makeup, and everything looks great. Then, I noticed that she added eyelashes, but I didn’t ask for any (also I didn’t get to pick the style - they were way too long and dramatic for me). I assumed that they were included in the $120 so I didn’t say anything. Afterwards, when she was starting on my hair, she kept telling me how thick it was, which I took as a compliment. Mid-way through curling my hair, though, she tells me that because my hair is so thick, and will probably take more than 1 hour to do, she is charging an extra $20. I told her that I didn’t bring that much cash, and that I would’ve just done my own hair if I knew that she was going to charge an extra $20. She stayed quiet and I didn’t say anything more either. At the end of the session, she told me that my total was $165 because of the extra hair cost (which did not even take an hour) and the eyelashes, which I hated on me. I told her again that I didn’t bring that much cash, and she told me to etransfer the rest to her. I got angry and I told her that she is overcharging me, and how it was unfair because she didn’t disclose the hidden prices to me beforehand. She told me that the extra costs are my fault, because I didn’t ask if the price was included while she put the eyelashes on. I was so upset, so I just put the $120 on her counter and she started crying and telling me that the lashes will come out of her pocket. She kept messaging me about how she has a kid to feed and I feel like a dick right now. Am I the asshole here? Should I just pay her the rest?",55,125,0.93

I spent majority of my life sharing a room with two sisters (both younger). They would repeatedly tell me to get out of their room even though we share it. Recently they remodeled the attic for me to sleep there and I've never been happier. I still allowed my sisters to come in every now and then since I didnt want to be mean. That's when it started again. 

They would repeatedly tell me to get out of my room so they could take selfies since the attic has windows on every wall. Or would go through my closet to see if they can find anything of theirs in there but they never did and sometimes stole my clothes. I finally got tired of it and put a lock on my door. The next day I went to work I got a call asking why the door was locked and where was the key since they ""think they left something in there"" 

They told our mom and she scolded me but at the same time knew there was nothing she could do about it. Now my sisters get pissed whenever they cant get into my room and call me an ass for it.",33,113,0.93
74,Asshole,"Where to begin with this...

I guess I need to say up front I'm not an outdoors type person. But I was sort of excited to go on a hike yesterday. We are in San Diego for the fourth of July and my cousin said it would be really fun if me and my friends went on a hike while she (cousin) had to work. We went to a place called Cowles mountain which I guess is about 45 minutes away from the hotel downtown. 

When we got there it was pretty crowded and we saw a group of guys coming down who were just blasting rap music. I was like wow that would be an awesome way to not get bored on the hike so I went back to my car and got my blue tooth speaker from my pack and hit my favorite spotify list. 

Most people didn't seem to mind but I did notice that we started to get occasional dirty looks. But finally one person stopped me and told me it was incredibly rude to play music outloud and that I should be using headphones. I told her that I was playing music for our group. And she basically that it's still very rude and against the rules but she kept walking. 

We decided we just weren't going to make it to the top so we stopped at a kind of flat spot and sat down for a while and this is when things actually got kind of scary. This guy and his girlfriend came up to us and said again that I should be using headphones. I told her that we were in a group. She said that it didn't matter most people were trying to enjoy quiet nature. I told her that that its public land. She said ""if you weren't such an ignorant fat bitch you would have noticed the sign at the bottom that said no speakers."" I basically shut down because I'm not good at confrontation but my friend asked her if she wanted to repeat herself. So the girlfriend called her a fat bitch as well and her boyfriend had to drag her away she was so upset. I didn't want any more hassle so I turned off the speaker and they walked away but the girl was just glaring at us and I was actually scared that they would slash my tires or something at the bottom. 

I have been reliving the confrontation over and over again and didn't sleep last night. I admit to being fully ignorant because I don't do a lot of outdoor stuff but was that really a big deal? I mean at least one other group we saw was doing it so I can't be that out of touch? All I was trying to do was make it a little more enjoyable and really meant no offense. 

I posted this on another sub and was referenced here so i'm a little scared just because of the title but please be honest with me.

76,No A-holes here,"I (25F) live in Canada and my family lives in India. We see each other maybe once a year. There's nothing I really want/need for my birthday but my parents like to make a little occasion of it anyway.

They usually ask me a month in advance if there's anything I'd like and I usually say maybe flowers or cake or a toy for my cat would be nice but totally not necessary and they can send whatever they feel like. 

Recently my mother has started buying saris for me, saris which I'm unlikely to see (since she buys them in India and tells me to pick them up when I go back home once a year) and even more unlikely to wear (I don't know how to drape a sari myself and go to the temple/cultural celebration maybe once a year in Canada where wearing a sari would not look out of place). My mother has a collection of easily hundreds of saris and she keeps adding more every year, some for herself, some ostensibly for me (but which will most likely be worn by her).

Obviously what she chooses to buy doesn't matter to me, but she expects me to eventually take possession of all ""her"" and ""my"" saris since I'm the only daughter. I cannot ever see myself wearing more than maybe 1% of her collection and I don't even know how I would eventually store all her saris either. Sadly, most of them will probably be donated, thrown away or turned into sofa covers/wall hangings (she hates the idea of that, she wants me to wear saris on more occasions which is highly impractical).

She put a lot of thought into her latest birthday gift to me, a handloom sari woven by a tribal family in India. But again, this is something I'm extremely unlikely to ever wear and I feel bad about the idea of her kind gift eventually being thrown away.

82,Not the A-hole,"I graduated from high school last year and am currently home from college for summer break.

I'm gay but didn't want to come out in high school. I live in Texas and played football and basketball. I really didn't want my teammates to know but once I was feeling bad about myself, I decided to come out to my parents and siblings. It went well. Better than expected. Once I started senior year I decided to come out to 3 of my closest friends. They all were very accepting and said they didn't care.

This was during football season and one of the guys was my teammate. He decided to out me to the rest of the football team so they could protect themselves. I'm gay, not a fucking sexual predator. I was pissed at him and he refused to apologize, insisting that he was doing the right thing because they had a right to know who was sharing a locker room with them. The rest of football season and the majority of basketball season sucked. It wasn't miserable and I wasn't assaulted or anything, but people acted like I had the plague. No one would change near me. We did a team bonding activity for football where everyone gives each other gag gifts and roast each other. For example, one guy got a whip and a ball and chain because he's super attached to his girlfriend. Another guy got a bottle and binky because he cries after every loss. I got a package of dildos. Basketball season involved a fee gay slurs written on my locker and more people avoiding me.

It's been over a year now. I got into my dream college in a much more liberal state and haven't had any problems. I'm not flamboyant but I am openly gay. I told my roommate before we moved in and he was completely cool with it. I play club sports and intramural sports. No one cares that I am gay so I don't buy the ""I was just protecting people"" excuse my former friend gave.

Anyway, tonight some of my friends are going to a fourth of July celebration. I know the former friend who outed me is going to be there. I told my friends that I don't want to go because I don't want to be around him. They told me that's water under the bridge and that he was just doing what he thought was right. What he thought was right could have gotten me assaulted or worse. I can't accept that he didn't know what he was doing but maybe if he apologised I could put it behind me. He hasn't and refuses to.

I have a friend who recently got pregnant and was looking at buying this swing. I mentioned to her that I have the same exact one and I would sell it to her for $150 if she just took it off my hand. She agreed but it would be months from now. 

Last week, unfortunately she miscarried. I don’t want to bring it up to her and who knows if she even wants to have kids anymore. It took her 7 years to get pregnant, so IVF might be the next step if she wants to have another baby.

So I listed the item up for sale on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, etc. to get rid of this thing. Keep in mind I already had this item listed for sale but took it down after she said she would take it off my hands.

86,Asshole,"I broke up with my ex girlfriend 2 weeks ago because my best friend caught her cheating on me at a bar near his university. I did however leave a military watch that was custom made for my grandfather 6 generations ago at her house the last time i was over. It was one of the first wristwatches ever made and has been a family heirloom, probably worth tens of thousands of dollars. This of course is an important family heirloom which has been passed down to the oldest male of the family. I'll be dammed to be the one to end this chain and ffs it even has my family's surname on it.

My ex girlfriend has been really bitter about the break up blaming me for her cheating saying its my fault she cheated on me because i couldn't support her emotionally and give her attention (i was in a rural village in Armenia teaching kids english for a month). Before that she said tried to deny the  cheating saying some drunk dude at a bar took advantage of her and she thought he was me. Anyways she's a lying shitbag. I was stupid and broke up with her while i was still in Armenia so she dumped all of my shit out of her place and my friend came to pick it up but she kept some of the valuables for herself including the watch. She refuses to give it back saying she needs financial compensation for emotional toll i put on her by being gone for a month and some other bullshit. I tried going to the police about it and they don't seem to give a shit as it's a minor issue to them and the police in my country generally have much larger issues to deal with.

My country has  very conservative and traditional values when it comes to relationships and cheaters are hated. I could basically ruin her life by exposing her for cheating on me (we both live in a small city where most people know each other) and severe all ties with her family by telling them she cheated one me. She told her family we just didn't think we were a right fit and mutually ended the relationship on good terms. I wasn't a dick and i just ended the relationship i wasn't petty about it but now since she won't give me back the family heirloom as well as a my hunting knife i left at her house. I told her i would send her evidence of her cheating on me such as pics of her at the bar and screenshots of our conversation on text. Her family would hate her for being a slut but also lying to them about the situation. I also have her nudes which i will expose if she doesn't give me back my stuff. I told her i am going to expose her unless she gives me my shit so she eventually conceded and gave it back.

For reference, HD is a genetic condition without cure, which results in the progressive death of brain cells in adulthood. It's a horrible and slow deterioration which ultimately leads to death.

My sister and I still haven't gotten tested to determine whether we carry the faulty gene or not. A few years ago, we made a ""pact"" that when we were ready, we would go together and would *never* have children before knowing the results. Both of us grew up witnessing the horrors our grandma, who was also affected by the disease, had to go through until her last day. We agreed that we couldn't ethically justify putting children through that suffering.

Or at least I thought we were on the same page until my sister, who's been studying abroad for the past 3 years, recently announced that she's pregnant with her boyfriend and that they're keeping the baby. The pregnancy was unexpected and she hasn't been genetically tested yet (neither have I).

Upon hearing that, I was hurt and furious. We argued for hours over video-call, and the insults got ugly. Both of us cried. At one point, my sister simply hung up on me because ""I was acting toxic and selfish and not considering her feelings"".

93,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I have been together for about ten years, and as most married people do, I have a couple of minor pet peeves with him. I’m a bit of a germaphobe and in particular I hate being touched with wet hands. Unless we’re in a pool or shower, him touching me with wet hands is because he just rinsed off in the sink or was doing dishes and didn’t bother to dry. I find it extremely unpleasant and dirty feeling. When he does it, i usually remind him “hey your hands are wet!” which will make him stop. But he still continues to do it constantly, knowing how much I hate it. He usually just laughs at me and says I’m weird for being so picky about it.

Well today I’m going through a laundry basket and I wasn’t wearing pants. He comes up to me and slaps my butt and pulls my panties down a little with his wet hands. And it really set me off. It’s one thing to feel icky when he just touches my arm or over my shirt. But he took it further by putting his wet hands which already really gross me out *underneath* my clothes onto an intimate area. (FYI normally him touching me this way with dry hands is a totally welcome advance.) I yelled at him to not fucking touch me with wet hands. He replied by trying to argue that I was over reacting because they’re just wet from washing after going to the bathroom and he doesn’t understand why I’m freaking out. I told him I don’t fucking care why they’re wet, I don’t like it so he’s not allowed to do it. 

I have to admit I was pretty mean about it. He ended up leaving and is now giving me the silent treatment. On one hand, I understand that the core belief I have about this situation is false. As dirty as wet hands *feel* to me, I know they’re not actually that dirty in any way that would cause harm. From my point of view though, it’s really weird to constantly not dry your hands off, potentially picking up more dirt from the next things you touch or dripping everywhere. Especially when I provide clean towels at every sink in our home. And it’s also just uncomfortable and I’ve reminded him a thousand times so he should have learned by now not to do it to me.

EDIT: Commenters have pointed out that I may be using the term germaphobe incorrectly. I just don’t like being touched with wet hands in general because it’s an uncomfortable feeling, and on top of that it feels dirty. I’m not literally worried I am going to become sick or hurt from it.",340,890,0.92
94,Asshole,"So about a week ago I matched with this woman on tinder, let's call her S. So we were texting and snapchatting back and forth as you do, and eventually we decided to go for a casual hookup. 

Anyway, the day comes and I finish work. Popped to the pub for a quick social and some Dutch courage, and leave at seven as I'd previously arranged with her. I ubered over, and saw her at the doorstep and she said hey. Now the first big thing was that her housemate was also there - a very awkward hey and a handshake and he plodded upstairs, but the second big thing was that she had been somewhat deceptive with her tinder pics. Now I'm not going to blame her for this - I mean we all do it to some extent - but it was I'd say to a bigger degree than the usual flattering angles and sc filters. Any we go In, chat, do the deed and it was not good sex. I'd been toying with the idea of spending the whole night there beforehand as she'd offered, but I decided to cut my losses and left to uber back to the pub. 

Next day (today) I don't message her and she doesn't message me, until an hour ago. Just popping out for lunch and the receptionist calls me back saying an 'S' is on the line. Of course I fly into panic mode - Jesus I've shagged a stalker. I message her saying ""did you just ring my work"" and she says yes. Panic mode ensues, I say please do NOT do that again it's stalker af and she apologises saying she rang to tell me I left my charger and she thought my phone might've died. She did not message or try to call my mobile at all. 

Anyway get back from lunch afterwards and the receptionist says she rang back again so I confront her and she denies it, so I block her number and tell her very politely that we should just leave it at this and not contact each other again and she seemed really apologetic. Did I go too hard here chaps?

TL:DR a tinder hookup rang my work because I left my charger there and I blocked her number and cut ties

95,No A-holes here,"So we’ve been friends with B for almost 10 years. We went to the same uni and remained close when we got jobs, talking in our group chat almost every day and meeting up for dinner/movies at least once a month. Last year he decided to go back to school for a second degree and he is a full time student again while everyone else is working. 

We try to be supportive of his situation. When we go out, we never split the bill equally/according to what each person ordered. The rest of us chip in so he’d pay just a fraction of his bill, because we noticed that he’d order less food or he’d tell us that he already had dinner or sometimes he’d straight up tell us that he’s broke. When one of us has money to spare, he/she pays for B’s share in full so he doesn’t have to spend anything.

In our group we have a tradition that the birthday celebrant treats the group out to dinner. Some of those who get paid well treat the group to nice restaurants while some foot the bill for pizza and ice cream while we’re hanging out in someone’s house. It’s up to the celebrant to decide and we enjoy the dinner all the same.

B celebrated his birthday last month, and no one said anything when he didn’t mention treating us because we were thinking maybe he doesn’t have cash to spare for pizza and ice cream. And that’s alright. But last week for some reason he told one of our friends J that he treated his current school friends (8 people?) to a restaurant where he could easily have spent $300. 

No one has talked to B about this, but the rest of us in our friend group (5 people) are feeling somewhat annoyed at him for treating his current school friends but not our group. It’s like someone we care a lot about told us that he doesn’t care about us as much as we care about him. Is our friendship and birthday tradition really not worth $50 for 2 pizzas and ice cream? I don't even know why he thought about telling J that he treated his schoolmates to dinner at that restaurant, knowing that he did not treat us for his birthday at all. One of our friends said that the next time we go out maybe we should start splitting the bill equally, and if B can’t go because he’s broke then tough luck to him. 

I’ve been thinking if I should ask him why he didn’t treat our group while he treated his current school friends. But I’m not sure if that would clear the air about the issue or if it will just make me look like an asshole who brought up an ‘unspoken’ issue to his face.

96,Not the A-hole,"I'm 7 months pregnant. I am carrying really large in front, none of my maternity clothes fit, and it's hot outside. I'm uncomfortable, self concious and miserable.

Everywhere I go, I am approached by women who either gawk at me, touch my belly, ask if I'm days away from giving birth, and when that answer is no, ask if I'm having twins. I can't go a single day without hearing some kind of comment about it and it's starting to wear me down.

There is a group of 3 older women who sit outside my apartment building in the smoking hut. I see them every day. I see them when I leave for school, I see them when I return from school, I see them when I go to work and I see them when I go shopping. Each time they stare. They just sit there, smoking and staring. When I wave at them, they wave back but continue to watch me walk into the building. It makes me so uncomfortable.

I can understand the comments I get from strangers because strangers don't usually see pregnant women every day, but these women see me every single day. They stare like I'm some sort of spectacle and I hate it. 

A couple of days ago, I was following behind as my boyfriend hauled our new carseat to the car and I was so hot and upset that none of my expensive maternity clothes were fitting me and there they were, staring.

So I walked up to them and said something along the lines of, ""Can you please stop staring at me every time I leave and come home?""

One of them replied with, ""Oh it's just that you're so big and cute and you seem to get bigger every day!""

So I replied, ""Yup and I'm going to continue to get bigger and it's not going to stop until I have the baby and I deserve to be able to come home without feeling uncomfortable by a group of women who stare at me every single day. Knock it off. I don't like it. You're making me uncomfortable.""

I didn't wait around for a response. My boyfriend told me it was the best thing to do, but my dad said it was rude and I could have handled it better. The apartment manager said the ladies have told him I made them uncomfortable and should consider apologizing. I said N.O.

AITA?

TL;DR: 7 months pregnant and 3 ladies continually watch me at our apartment building. I basically told them to stop being creeps. Dad and building manager said it was uncalled for.

Edit: The smoking hut is so close to the sidewalk on the way to the building that saying ""Hello, how are you doing today?"" while I'm walking by would be better than just STARING. They wouldn't even have to raise their voices, that's how close I get to them. I've even said hello loads of times and all I've gotten back are small smiles or waves. A few times I've looked back once I've reached the front door and they're still looking at me! It makes no sense.

Also - when I am touched and tugged on by strangers, and asked inappropriate questions, I grab their hands and say, ""Stop."" ""Please don't."" ""That's really none of your business."" with a smile. I can't do much else because this happens while I'm working or at school.

Edit 2: From the comments, I'll start letting random people touch me and tug on me and adjust my clothes all they want because it's rude of me to want otherwise. I'll ignore their stares every day. I won't even bother saying hi anymore since I'm just entertainment for these ladies (who are not old, btw. I'd say mid 30s to 40s. I said older as in older than me. Sorry for the unclarity.) and each time I see a pregnant woman I'm going to do the same because I've learned it's not creepy and pregnant women should let strangers do whatever they please with them.

She also 'accidentally' locked me in the garage for 2 hours once when she left the house - (it wasn't an accident, she was getting back at me for taking the wrong bins out on bin night, again no apology) It got to a point where I would have panic attacks about coming home, and would wait on the street for hours at night until I could tell from the lights in the house that she had gone to bed so I would avoid seeing her and be berated by her for anything small I had done. At this point our relationship was completely ruined, our lease came to and end and I thankfully was able to move out with my boyfriend and she moved back home. Shortly after this, I heard from our other friends that she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I did some research and the symptoms matched her behaviour, and my friends have been heavily pressuring me to rekindle our relationship because of this. They all witnessed her rude and horrible behaviour, but not to the extent I experienced it as we were living together. Our friendship group has been split apart because of this and the blame has shifted to me as I refuse to have anything to do with this girl anymore, yet they think she should be forgiven because of her diagnoses. She apologised to all of us in a group chat for her behaviour (even though she was by far the worst to me) - I was the only one who did not forgive her. My friends think I should. AITA?",454,884,0.95

Ok so I got a house and it came with a hot tub. Awesome. Last owners didn't winterize it before moving out, less awesome. It leaks.

Call a repair company. Repair guy comes out a couple times, checks the things, fixes one thing, still leaks, comes back finds a cracked pipe. Still I'm 100% fine with this. Normal repair stuff.

The repair company then says, to fix the pipe we need to get underneath it and you'll have to get a bunch of guys to come over and stand it up on its side (these things are very heavy). Also, the room it's in might not be big enough to stand it up on its side so you might have to cut and replace a board to do this. Call us when it's done and we will come back and work on the tub again.

If I went to a car repair shop to get my brakes fixed, it would be unheard of for them to tell me that they can fix my car but only if I can get it up in the air first.

I am operating under the assumption that hot tub repair people as a group have run into the problem of ""hot tubs are heavy"" and a good company would have the tools, manpower, and equipment to handle this foreseeable repair obstacle. I've never in my life had a repair company try to get me so involved in the actual repair work of my job. I give them the money, they fix my hot tub. I'm not understanding why I need to be more involved than that.

So the question I have is, am I the asshole?",19,53,0.9
100,Not the A-hole,"So this is a currently unfolding situation.

Background: My entire family is poor and lives paycheck to paycheck. I earned a scholarship to college and then started a career so I am the only member of our family that is not living in poverty. My husband and I are solidly middle class. For the past decade or so, we have been hosting family get-togethers about once a month, inviting my whole family (3 siblings and spouses plus my parents) and paying for everything (food, drink, etc).

Current situation: My husband was laid off about a year ago and has been unemployed or underemployed ever since. He is currently working at about 50% of his old salary. Things are financially difficult. We are just covering our bills with our combined income and if anything extra comes up, we have to take it out of savings. One area that we are trying to save money with is hosting these family get-together. We haven’t stopped completely (we hosted Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter, Mother’s Day, and some birthdays) but we have stopped hosting lesser holidays (skipped Super Bowl Sunday and Memorial Day). Today is Independence Day. We normally have a get together but we told everyone we would just be spending a quiet holiday alone with our children.

Yesterday, my mom called upset that we weren’t hosting anything. I told her we were just going to spend the day swimming (we belong to a swim club). Immediately she got excited and wanted to come, along with my youngest sister who lives at home. I eventually agreed but said it would only be for a few hours. Later in the day, all of my siblings started calling me and asking when they could come over to use the pool and what were we doing for dinner. Now, I have to pay to get them into the swim club and I have no interest in paying for them all to eat and drink all day long. So after talking it over with my husband, we decided to call them all and tell them that we could not host a meal, but if they each wanted to bring a dish to share and anything they wanted to drink, we would host a potluck meal so we could all eat together. Well they didn’t like that well. One said that they don’t get paid until Friday and had no food in the house so it was like us telling them that they couldn’t come. One said that it wasn’t fair. They want to see the family. Making them bring food takes money they would use to buy groceries and is like taking food out of their family’s mouth.

We didn’t give in. I wasn’t planning to host. If they want to come, then they can contribute. But from their perspective, I have money that they don’t and it’s selfish to ask them to bring anything. So Reddit, AITA?

Edit: Responded to a comment and thought it was worth sharing here so you could all understand why they think ITA.

Yes, technically I could pull money from savings to pay for this. They have never had savings so having money in the bank feels like wealth to them. But the way I worked my way out of poverty is to not spend more than I make each month and build up an emergency fund.  I am using that emergency fund to get through this difficult financial time. I have no idea how much longer my husband will be under employed and I want to make my savings last as long as possible. So I’m just not willing to spend my savings on extravagances. But to them, I have money I could use and am choosing not to while they don’t have much money at all so ITA for asking them to contribute. Which is why my original plan was just to each do our own thing for the holiday rather than getting together and creating this issue.

Update: So it worked out okay. Not everyone came. I did end up paying for those who did at the swim club. But one sibling and his family brought a lot of food (meats, bread, side, and condiments) which basically doubled what we had to offer. They were kind about it. They had some food in their freezer they brought and had picked up a little bit more on their way over. Another family member brought a small side, some soda, and a dessert. There was enough to eat for everyone and we split up all the leftovers so everyone had some food to take home. It ended up being a nice day.",608,5057,0.94

Last night both of us sat down to eat dinner. Maybe five minutes after we started eating, my brother just farts right there at the dinner table. He knows by now that when I’m in charge the rule about farting is he needs to go to the bathroom and sit on the toilet to fart, and then flush it down.

But no, he decided he could just fart all over our dinner that I had just spent over an hour making. After he did that, I told him how disgusting he was and I grabbed his plate and dumped the rest of his food in the trash and told him to go to bed.

This is a huge boost to our family income on top of our day jobs. I told her that she could go on vacation April-October. Since it’s most likely not gonna snow. She scheduled a vacation in February and I made her cancel it. Blamed me for everything. And won’t let it go. Said I was controlling. I feel it’s not a lot to ask. We are a team right? Also we have three children. Finding a babysitter at 2am would be extremely difficult. Since then she has taken multiple vacations in the months that I said was cool to take vacation.

105,Asshole,"Context: My boyfriend have been together 7 years. We met in college and when we met we were both pretty much broke. 

My boyfriend started getting into investing and trading soon after he met me and made a significant amount of money during the recovery. Honestly most of it is likely luck. He would put all of his spare money into his trading account to play with and it is now approaching 3m USD.

I recently asked him when we were going to get married and he brought up the topic of a prenup. He thinks that since I have little to no savings and he is worth a lot now, that he needs to protect himself “just in case.” Putting aside how insulting this was that he doesn’t think our marriage would last, I also think it’s completely unreasonable. 

Prenups are supposed to protect wealth that pre-exists a relationship. All of this money was made during our relationship - including years of us living together. While it’s true he pays for his share of the bills etc I don’t think that matters. It wouldn’t matter if we were married during this time so why should it matter if we weren’t? In my opinion money made by either of us during the course of our relationship should be shared.

So there is this girl in the group, let's call her CH. She isn't very good at spelling and she's kinda lazy so I just assumed that she didn't feel like correcting her typos in chat. So I made fun of her spelling a lot because it seemed crazy to write things so incorrectly, and it was funny to me. When I made fun of her for it, she laughed at my jokes so I thought that all was well.
But today I was talking about her spelling with two of my friends. One of them, DE, said while listening to us, ""dude ur an asshole. Your making fun of somebody's disability."" And I instantly felt like shit. I didn't know. She then told me that CH confided in her that, she has a ""spelling disability"" (not sure what it's called properly). I was a little bit sceptical about the truth of it, because CH is known to make up dumb shit to fuck with her friends minds. But I believe it to be true because she provided details and such.

My sister (14F) had been complaining to me for a while that our parents refused to buy her new clothes. She wears mostly ratty t-shirts that she got for free from math competitions and camps and jeans that I’m pretty sure are from the kids’ section at Walmart. The fact that she didn’t have nicer clothes wasn’t really an issue for her before high school, but she’s been having kind of a hard time socially in high school, and I think the clothes are part of it. I (23F) have tried explaining to my parents that in high school, clothes are important and can effect a kid’s self-esteem and the way other kids see them, but they accuse my sister of “wanting to follow trends” and “having expensive taste.”
Last weekend I went home and took my sister to the mall and got her some nicer things to wear, and when we got back, I basically broke down and told my parents that I don’t think they have my sister’s best interests at heart and that their refusal to try to even try understand what she was going through socially was selfish.

110,Not the A-hole,"My (36m) wife (30) has a younger brother who recently moved to the city where we live to go to university. He rents a place with some friends, lives fairly close to us, and we see each other often. I've known him since he was 13 (he's 19 now) and we get along very well.

My wife and I went on holiday last month and we were gone for about a month. Since we knew he had finals and would probably appreciate some peace and quiet, we asked him to look after our place while we were gone. My wife said he can use whatever he wants, and she left him some extra money for food and whatnot.

While we were gone, they talked on the phone and he asked if his boyfriend can come over a couple of times a week, and my wife said of course. When they hung up, I asked her if he was coming over for dinner or a study date or to sleep over. She said she didn't ask, but what does it matter, any one of those things is fine. I said I wasn't fine with all of it, in particular the sleeping-over option, because my BIL was sleeping in our bed and I didn't want him to have sex in it. She laughed at me and said that she's sure her brother doesn't mind sleeping in the bed we had sex in so what's the problem. We had a huge fight, I wanted to call him to check, but she told me that he's doing us a favor and to leave him alone.

When we got back, and I was left alone with my BIL, I asked him how his study dates with his boyfriend were going, and he said fine. So I asked if that was all they did. He asked me what I mean, and I said 'well, you know'... So he said 'well, he IS my boyfriend, so yeah, you know'. I was getting pretty angry at this point and I just asked 'in my bed?' I guess he could see I was getting mad, so he said he was uncomfortable talking about it. At this point I lost it - HE was the one that's uncomfortable?? It's my fucking bed covered in his and his boyfriend's ass sweat and semen.

113,Not the A-hole,"Basically my(M29) GF(F27) likes to do things.... without order to say the least. We've been together 3 years now.

We've had *multiple* conversations about it but it always leads to ""my time my choice"" sort of thing, which would be fine if it was only *her* time on the clock. She's one of those ""take a shower then take a poop"" kind of people and it has always boggled my mind. This was never an issue until we moved in together.

Examples of what I'm talking about: We went shopping for groceries the other day. We made multiple stops to Walmart, Costco, Petsmart and Bulkbarn for multiple things. Walmart and costco are near us but on the opposite side of the road not on the way there but on the way back, petsmart and bulkbarn are equally separated between us but in a circle. Logic would dictate you go to petsmart and bulkbarn but hit up walmart and costco on the way back right? She disagrees. She just goes wherever she wants whenever she wants regardless of where we have to be later. In fact she went to walmart, then petsmart, then costco and then bulkbarn and came back. This has caused us to be late MULTIPLE times to places afterwards because she doesn't care to think of time scaling or traffic. This trip should have been *at most* 1 hour which then turned into 3.5 hours because she went all willy nilly to different places at different times and not caring for traffic at all which led us to be late for a party at my friends house by over an hour.

Another example is when we had to tackle some yardwork and we started on it which should have taken 2 hours at the most turned into 4 hours because she decided halfway through to take a shower for some reason and then get all sweaty again afterwords and had to take another shower.

These types of things make me do that thing that Terry Crews does in Brooklyn 99 and go ""WHYYYYY?"". I've explained to her we need to respect timings but she doesn't seem to give a shit. My last straw was when we had to go somewhere but I needed my clothes clean and she offered to do them. She decided cleaning ALL THE OTHER CLOTHES before mine(about 3 loads) knowing full well I needed them in 2 hours was okay. My time in the military may have made me overzealous of timings but I feel she's being overly uncaring of other people's time.


I finally asked her why she doesn't care about other people's time and why she doesn't think about the most logical solution to how you attack a problem when it comes to times and she got upset and said I was being controlling. Not once did I tell her WHAT to do only told her she needs to respect that other people have constrictions that need to be adhered to if she tells them she's going to adhere to them. People's time isn't fluid it's to be respected and she seems to disagree.

The girl she was helping is from Nigeria, an illegal immigrant, in the process of applying for citizenship, whose parents were killed. She was staying with her sister but for some reason that was a bad situation (I haven’t been told why nor have I asked) so my parents offered her a place to stay. 

They do this a lot, and often don’t give me warning. Many times I’ve come home and found suitcases by the door and found out that some strangers were staying with us for a few weeks. That doesn’t bother me. 

My mom asked me if it was okay for her to move in for a bit (that’s fine, we had a cousin live with us for over two years). A little bit after my mom basically said that she and my dad were taking her on as a foster child and asked whether or not I was ok with it as an afterthought, probably after they had already started the paperwork. Of course I said it was fine. What else could I have said? My parents know that I have trouble with saying no, especially to my mom, and we have had family therapy where this has come up (not the situation specifically, but the fact that it’s tough for me to say no to her). She just doesn’t listen to me. If I tell her not to do something small (like take my picture), she’ll do it anyway and not see why she should have backed off.

She also has a full ride (with everything included) to a good school to become a neurosurgeon (which my parents don’t bring up to me) when I’m going to a state school to study engineering and spanish. 

Before anyone judges me based on how you think I’m taking out my frustration on her, I’m not. If she needs something, I’ll help her. I’ve driven her and a friend around for an afternoon.

My wife and I (both women) started dating when she was 19 and I was 24. We are now 25 and 30, respectively. When I first met my wife (we’ll call her Andrea), she told me that while she’d always dreamed of children that she wanted to wait until she was a bit older.     
          
When we decided we were ready for children, we went to her doctor to discuss her concerns for the pregnancy. From the time we met, we had agreed she would carry any children we had because we both found it weird for me to do so (I play the more masculine role for lack of a better word). Andrea was concerned about her mental health due to years of various medications and her struggle to cope with her major depression. She has been in therapy for 10 years and only recently found a medication that has improved her mood.       
          
I expressed little excitement in my wife carrying our baby, and let her know my concerns. She and her doctor suggested that perhaps I carry our baby, which I was not okay with. I let Andrea know that she could either carry the baby or we could have a surrogate do so, but I was completely off the table.            
        
She was pissed and said that I was selfish for going to have someone else carry our baby with two capable women able to. She decided she would carry our baby.

Not only is she caring for the girls very well but she also had to quit her job because she is so mentally unwell plus we have no one to watch the girls daily, and so now I have to suffer financially (we are comfortable without her income but it still was helpful) and I have a lot more responsibility with the girls due to her being locked away in the bedroom.                 
             
She screamed at me that if anyone is selfish, that it’s me and that I am making her feel “less than” as a mother. I told her that I will never have a child with her again unless a surrogate carries it, and that alone set her off. She took the girls and is staying at her dads. Her brother messaged me letting me know that I need to leave Andrea alone until I know how to be a good partner.       
       
Am I really the asshole here? She knowingly carried our daughters with the possibility of her condition worsening and now I have to pay the price.             
      
TLDR: wife carried our daughters despite concerns for her mental health, is now angry because I believe she is selfish for making that decision. She is upset that I won’t have more kids with her unless we do it via surrogate.",644,1535,0.89
122,No A-holes here,"So my little sister is 11, I'm 25. Our mom is almost completely blind and therefore is disabled and stays home with my sister. Dad has recently had congestive heart failure and a few other issues. My sister has had a pretty good life. They dont have allot of money but when she was 4 they bought a house and she has her own room and gets stuff when she asks most of the time. She spends insane amounts of money on games on our moms phone. Mom has tried hiding it, locking it, I mean she sleeps with it under her pillow but my sister always seems to sneak into her room and get it. Mom has bought a pad lock and had to locked the prongs to the computer. She has stolen money from moms purse repeatedly, she throws these fits where she screams at our parents, hits walls and breaks things. Her favorite thing to do is throw eggs at the wall behind the couch in their living room and wait for it to start smelling. She is also a pathological liar. She just lies about the stupidest things. You ask her what color her socks are and she will say green knowing they are blue. She also one time pushed our mom, I was visiting (we live in different states) and seen it. Then proceeded to spank her. Now this is what I did when my mom called crying saying she couldn't handle her while dad was in the hospital. My husband and I took temporary custody of her. We enrolled her in school here, she started going to therapy every week, we took her to church (it was strictly for her because she asked to go), and did everything we could. She was an angel. My point is, I thought I truly helped her. So when  dad got better roughly six months later we sent her home. She is now just as bad as she was before we took her if not worse. 

So every single time I talk to her it's just me asking why she does what she does and telling her how bad  I think she is being and how she is causing unnecessary stress to our parents who already have so much to worry about and medical conditions related to stress. And how I think she will be alone when our parents go because other than me the rest of the family hates her for how she treats people. Even my husband says that it's useless for us to take her again because it wont help anything in the long run. Now this is all our relationship consist of anymore, just me telling  her she is being shitty an her crying but not changing and it just keeps repeating. I cant remember the last time we had a decent conversation and I've tried but every time I call (video) she has just done something wrong or is in the process. 

I mean AITA straight up or AITA she needs? Because it's 2019 and everyone else is afraid to hurt her feelings.

Edit: So spanking her is what I did when she was staying with me, she lives 1,300 miles away now and our parents dont believe in spanking. Also she acted like this well before dad got sick and mom has always been disabled. Yes I've tried to help them with therapy but Florida fucking sucks as far as community resources go.",22,34,0.84

124,Not the A-hole,"So for some background, my older sister had an illness that eventually caused her to be unable to walk. My now ex boyfriend and I took her to DisneyWorld on a day where she was feeling really good, and was even able to briefly stand for a picture.

It’s been four years since that day. My sister has since unfortunately passed away, and I’m dating another man, whom I love with all my heart. However, we have recently had a problem come up. 

About a month ago, he moved into my apartment with me. I have the picture of my sister, my ex &amp; I hanging up on the wall of my room. My boyfriend really wants me to take it down because my ex is in it. While I understand that, it’s the only picture I have where my sister doesn’t look miserable as I didn’t get to see her often, and it’s the only one of her standing.

My ex and I are not romantic in the picture. We are both standing on opposite sides of my sister. With the way we are positioned, I can’t crop him out without it being off center and just strange looking. 

Unfortunately I don’t have any from that day with just me and her as I obviously didn’t have the foresight that I now have.  I haven’t spoken to my ex in nearly 2 years and have absolutely no remaining feelings for him. With that said, that day was so special to me and I don’t think it’s fair to make me take it down.

For the first 10 or so years of my life I was emotionally, verbally, and rarely physically abused by my parents. They had some major problems in their relationship and took it out on me. It was really bad for me though elementary school, but got significantly better once my younger siblings were born. 

Today my parents are relatively normal. My younger brother and sister adore them and the rest of my family has no clue what I went through. Only the mental health professionals I've talked to and my close friends know the details of how I was brought up. 

The dilemma is, my parents have obviously taken steps to better themselves but I haven't been able to look past how I was treated as a child. Sometimes my lack of forgiveness feels completely justified, but sometimes I feel like im an unappreciative bitch.

My son and his wife moved into their new apartment last year and have tried inviting us for dinner a few times since then to have us come and see their new place. Every time unfortunately I’ve had work or some other commitment come up due to which I haven’t been able to make it. They seem to mind it a lot because apparently I’ve visited my daughter and her husband’s place a few times even though they live twice as far away, though I’ve explained to them clearly I have never turned down their offers willingly and it’s always been an unfortunate incident getting in the way, while my daughter’s invites have worked out because nothing ever got in the way.

So coming to the point, I invited them last week over at our place for dinner. They quickly jumped on us and said if we’re inviting them for dinner, that means we’re free, so we should go over for dinner at their place instead. I turned it down because it’s too hot and I didn’t want to be inside an apartment on a hot day. They’ve been completely ignoring my texts since then and didn’t show up at the dinner I invited them to. Later I heard from other family members that they’re really hurt and they’ve decided they’ll never invite me ever again. I don’t know why this blew up so much. I just didn’t want to be at their place on a hot day is all, but I did want to see them and hang out with them.

I feel exactly the same way about him and could care less who he boinks. I'm not really that emotional or expressive and I feel neutral about the fact that my son is gay so that's what I expressed. My wife thinks I should've done hugging and told my son how much I loved him and stuff but I think that would have been a disservice as I'm pretty sure my son would've seen through the acting.

131,Not the A-hole,"Long time lurker first time poster. I apologize for any formatting errors throughout this post. 

I have a while to consider this, but I wanted some outside opinions. I met the man of my dreams 7 years ago and in roughly 7 months we’ll be tying the knot. Exciting, right?! Until I really started to think of some details. I’ll try to limit this to important details only. 

My parents split on my father’s terms two weeks after I started my freshman year of college (4 ish years ago). I knew their marriage wasn’t perfect, but I believe what he did was inexcusable. He left my mom in the middle of the night after she received a workplace injury and was bedridden, he wouldn’t even visit her in the hospital, all he did was text her. My mom did not want a divorce, she wanted to try counseling, she wanted to try anything and he walked away. I immediately accused him of seeing someone else, which he denied. 

A month later, I update my MacBook and somehow his texts are being sent to my laptop (you can imagine the horror), and lo and behold he was seeing someone else and after looking at phone bills he had been seeing them for a while. Mom and family were notified, life was rough after the divorce as you can assume. I maybe talked to my father a handful of times for the remainder of my time in college because I was so upset and betrayed and saw the pain he caused my family. Our relationship isn’t perfect now either, still awkward, maybe talk once a month, it ain’t great. 

So, another detail of mine which you will think is LAME is that I’m not a little stitious, I’m superstitious. I do not like the idea of someone who turned away from their marriage, cheated, and wouldn’t try to fix things walking me down to a marriage and relationship that I have worked SO HARD on to not be like theirs. I just don’t want that bad juju being front and center at our wedding. And honestly thinking of photos I don’t know if I can look at them without hurting.

Next detail, I also am pained with guilt and a conscious. I’m his only daughter, this is the only time in his life he’d ever do this, I know it would mean the WORLD him, and I am an absolute people pleaser, but I just don’t know if I can do it.

So my friend group hangs out a lot and in order to save gas/time/money, we end up carpooling a lot. Today my friend, Carly, wanted to take her younger sister, Annie, to see animals at a farm. This seemed like a spur of the moment thing since they called me to tell me to get ready about 10 minutes before they showed up at my apartment. My friend, Stan, was already in the front passenger seat and Carly was driving with her younger sister Annie in the backseat, so I got in the seat across from her.

&#x200B;

We end up at the farm, but we don't stay long due to the lack of animals and just things to do in general. Afterwards, we hang out some more at a park and we get food. Along the way, we end up picking up another friend, John, but we all decide to go home. Stan, John, and I all live relatively close so Carly was going to drop us off at home in the order of me, Stan, and John. 

&#x200B;

She pulls into my apartment complex and stops a few feet before my building. I ask her to pull up closer so I wouldn't have to walk as far and she would have to move up anyways in order to turn around and leave. She refuses. So I put my foot down and refuse to get out because she was being difficult. This stalemate lasts a few minutes before Carly decides to leave... with me still in the car. She ultimately decided that I ""had my chance"" and that she was going to drop off Stan and John then she was going to go home. She said that I could get out at one of their houses and find a way home from there. But due to unrelated reasons, I wouldn't be able to get home if I did, so I stayed in the car and watched them leave one by one until it's just me Carly and Annie left in the car.

Carly drives back to her house like she said she would, with me still in her backseat. She asks me how I plan to get home. I ask her to just drive me back home and offer her gas money. She says that she was serious when she told me that she was not going to drive back to my neighborhood. I remind her that every time that I have given her a ride, I have made sure that she actually makes it home safely. So she says that she'll order an uber for me, I offer to pay but she eventually decides that she doesn't want to accept it. 5 minutes later, the uber arrives and takes me home but since then, the whole situation has been running through my mind.

Then the demands started coming out. They wanted this, they wanted that, they wanted this person to come, these colors, dresses can't do this, this person has to be flower girl, this person HAS to be a groomsman, etc etc. Suddenly it didn't feel like our wedding, but an excuse for our families to have a family reunion.

We put our foot down and said:

>Thank you all for your kindness and generosity when it comes to our wedding. Unfortunately, it looks like we may not have been on the same page as the rest of you. When we were offered money for this wedding, we did not realize it came with strings attached.

I schedule appointments in advance each time, and I'm usually in the chair getting my hair cut within 15-20 minutes. 

The past few appointments have been long waits, though, from half hour to close to an hour. It ends up taking up my entire morning and it runs into other errands and plans, and I really only have Saturdays to get them done.

I have 3 friends, all girls, who I met last school semester. We had planned on taking  6 week road trip basically doing a rectangle around the CONUS with some stops in between. We are about 6 days in. 

I don't consider myself a prude at all but on the first day one of the other girls said she was ""addicted"" to this show that's on satellite radio. I don't want to advertise it but it's one of these utterly vulgar shows that brags about being ""not PC."" It's hosted by two reprehensible men and they talk about getting prostitutes, how great a certain elected official is (or I should say how he isn't the worst ever and people should be ""reasonable""), they are totally for ""free speech"" even if its offensive and sexist, racist, anti-gay and on and on. And to top it off they have a long list of the most reprehensible ""comedians"" I've ever hard and they spent almost an entire day talking about how everyone is ""overreacting"" to Louis CK. I honestly thought that after one day the other two girls would agree how awful it is but now they also think its funny and they can't wait to listen every day. 

I tried to have a rational discussion about this and was pretty much blown off saying that ""we aren't in the car every day, even when we are it's only 3 hours, can you just put in your airpods while we enjoy the show."" I explained that we are in such incredibly close quarters and I can't not hear it  and maybe they should be the ones to use airpods. I was given the ""well it's totally 3 to 1...sorry...not sorry!"" 

I called my mom and asked if she would send me the money to fly home because to me this is intolerable. After I explained why she said she absolutely would. 

Here's where I might be the asshole and screwing them, the main issue is they are had to really save and budget for this trip. And for them this trip might not happen if I'm not here to add my gas money and my share for the airbnbs. I mean they legitimately might have to cancel or seriously curtail the rest of the trip just to make it home. 

I don't want to screw them but at the same time I feel like my concerns have been completely invalidated but 3 people on multiple occasions.

She had me (19F) out of wedlock and my biological father is a POS, but since then, she hasn't really taught me anything about sex except for that I shouldn't do it until I'm married (I was homeschooled so had no way to really learn). When I was 10 and curious, she handed me an Amish book to try and explain it and it was extremely vague, so she HAD to give me the talk. 

Like I said, my mom taught me nothing except that it's meant for marriage. I didn't know what a condom was until I was 15.

My sister (14) has a LDR, and since I've moved out, every now and then when I'm alone with her, I talk to her about safe sex, birth control, and that if she does choose to have sex before marriage, it is her choice, not my mom's. I have told her that she definitely should wait until she's a lot older, but that if she does choose to make her own choices, she can always come to me for anything of the sort and that she doesn't always have to live by my mom's standards. 

My mom does know that I talk to her about this stuff, and she always gets upset when it's brought up, saying that it's not my place and that my sister should be coming to her for that stuff as well as reiterating that sex isn't supposed to happen outside of marriage. My sister has spoken up and said ""well, you don't really talk to me about that stuff,"" to which she always replies with ""well you can."" The thing is though, my mom is never educating my siblings on safe sex and expects all 4 of my siblings to wait until marriage. I have told her it's extremely unrealistic and they're going to make their own choices regarding their sex lives in the future. She just doesn't listen, which is why I talk to my sister about this stuff. 

So am I the asshole for pulling my sister aside occasionally to educate her on safe sex?",113,483,0.92

149,Not the A-hole,"Long story short, this guy has been stalking me for the past year. Recently he's been coming to the place I work (I work in retail) but he hasn't directly approached me. He usually stands in the line behind me. I told my supervisor about this and she's agreed to call security if he ever does approach me and stands next to me whenever she sees the guy in line to discourage him from coming near me. My supervisor has also told all the other supervisors about this and they've agreed to all do the same. Additionally, if he ever does approach me, he will be banned from the store permanently.

&#x200B;

Recently, I told someone who knows both me and stalker about all this. She informed me that he actually comes to the store I work at on nearly a daily basis but also called me an asshole because ""he's doing it because he loves you"" and that he could legitimately just be buying things. It's a big and popular store after all and we all work in the same outlet. Personally, I guess he could just be shopping. He's known to blow all his money on stuff so it wouldn't surprise me to find out that he does go shopping on a daily basis.

&#x200B;

Before anyone asks, I have talked to a police officer in the past about this. They've essentially said they can't arrest him since it is essentially my word against his and he's only happened been around me in public places, never directly approaching me or following me into private places, so there's no evidence it wasn't all coincidental. The person who has admitted that he comes into the store on a daily basis doesn't want to testify because she doesn't want to get involved, and I won't force her. I'm currently gathering evidence and building a case since talking to that officer. To make things VERY clear, I don't need legal advice or to be told to go to the police.

&#x200B;

AITA for essentially having store security on high alert with him when he very well could just be shopping?

&#x200B;

Regardless of the answer, I'm not telling security and my supervisor ""nevermind, let stalker do whatever he wants and pay no attention to him"", but I'm curious if that girl was right in calling me an asshole. I have a horrible inability to tell when I'm being a dick.

&#x200B;

Edit: People have asked for more info and I've replied in comments. I'll add it here too to make things easier.

 We used to work together. He's an incel and everyone saw that he had an infatuation with me, so yes we have history. I've told him to leave me alone and stay away from me since he's a giant creep.

He's basically admitted to other ex co workers (the ones that are his friends) that he likes following me so he can see me without me knowing. Of fucking course I know though. Another ex co worker overheard it and admitted it to me

He's literally been in places where I was when I was several states away, several times, so I'm pretty sure the ex co worker told me the truth and he's not coincidentally ending up there.

I thought it had died down in the past few months though since I stopped seeing him around me so often, which is why I'm potentially accepting the idea of ""maybe he's just shopping there""

And I'm fairly sure he's physically harmless since he's just a neckbeard with some sort of sick fantasy about wanting me as his asian waifu. I have no qualms about defending myself physically if necessary.",45,136,0.89
150,Everyone Sucks,"From around 14.9 years to 22, I've spent virtually every weekend babysitting. As in, Saturdays, Sundays, 8ish AM to 11ish PM. From their infancy until now. Being cooped up on weekends I believe contributed to my social anxiety. Most weekends of my adolescence were pretty much about babysitting (and internet surfing/TV watching). 

I brought it up to my mom (who works weekends) and she's done nothing but talked about how it's normal for older siblings to watch younger siblings, how she did it as a kid, how her boss did it, etc. She would bring up examples of older siblings caring for younger siblings in an almost parental manner that I never did and never will have any interest in. It came to a point some weeks ago where she sarcastically said that since I didn't want to babysit as a teen, I should've gotten a job to replace the weekend job she used and supported the household and supported the household instead. (imagine a 15-year-old supporting two adults and the adults' kids).

So--eventually I got fed up. I grew increasingly resentful and am still resentful about wasting pieces of my adolescence babysitting. Then there was also a thing where her spouse was absolutely abusive to me, and she would deny, dismiss, and believe his dishonesty/attempts to kind of spoil my character to her. She's still with him and I don't care at this point.

I got a job recently. I'm supposed to be working weekends. Her response? I need to give her 40% of my check to cover household utilities (which she's not getting). She's pretty much indignant and actually feels like *I'm* oppressing *her* because me not wanting to be available to babysit *her* children interferes with her weekend job.",53,36,0.93
151,Not the A-hole,"Definitely not a shitpost, but if the mods require I remove it I’m happy to. I’m just looking to gain a little perspective here. 

I’m a black woman, and have been queer my whole life it seems. My girlfriend, about to be my fiancée (hopefully) and I have been together for 4 years. 

She’s my best friend, my woman, my ride or die, my fucking everything. She’s also not a native of London like I am, and came to the city VERY sheltered, not just in terms of sexuality, but her views on blacks, Muslims, fuck it, even had an opinion on how flying the St. George’s flag isn’t racist etc.

We were both lifeguards at a leisure centre which is how we met, and we both just bonded so hard and fast. Long shitty hours + dry reccing is boring, and we just hit it off and I fell in love HARD. 

Anyway, she’s the love of my life. I’m proud of her for how far she’s come, I’m proud of her for fighting the good fight and opening her eyes to so many injustices that I never thought she’d be capable of understanding opinions on. 

However, nowadays social justice is....100% all she talks about. We come home from work, I’m trying to cuddle and rock her world, and she’s waving around her MacBook telling me we have 3 petitions we need to sign and how she told off a white girl for wearing her hair in braids today. I’m like... okay. Babe. This isn’t something you should need to police. 

Like I said, I’m proud of her, im stupid in love, but it seems that this is almost like a personality change and I just want my chill girl back who wants to show me bunny videos and ask me if we can get a fuck sized meat loaded pizza from dominoes instead of constantly telling me we should order from calabash which is our local Caribbean mom n pop place.

There’s no real way of me asking her to chill on this, and even if I did- how the hell do I go about it. WIBTA if I gently steered the convo away from the topics that she gets heated up on from now on and told her to chill a little?",496,1351,0.91
152,Not the A-hole,"So to set up the incident, my fiancé and I had been living across the country from our home state and she got pregnant. We were both very excited but she wanted to move back home. Her mom offered for us to stay with her until we could get on our feet back in our home state. I pay her mother rent and everything so it’s not a straight hand out (I’d prefer to pay because we’re not trying to free load). The baby was born in February and he is our pride and joy. My fiancé and I are a good team and we split the night in half for responsibilities and any other time we try to split directly in half as well. 

Recently, so we could have more income and eventually be set to move out, I changed jobs so I could work the second shift, freeing up my fiancé to then get a part time first shift job. Now, important to note, my FMIL has worked a full time first shift job for 5 years. She comes home about 6 and is in bed by 9. Kindly, when I was also working first shift, she would hold the baby while My fiancé and I ate dinner. I don’t think speed eating is something to be proud of, but I never made her hold him more than 10 minutes so I could scarf my food down. 

So now that I’ve started my new job, I’m not around for the 3 hours a day that she’s there with the baby and my fiancé. So my first night off seeing the three of them in the 3 hour window, she says to the baby “look it’s your uncle lukeonice”. I immediately was taken aback by this and took the baby off to change him to avoid being confrontational. She said as I was leaving and as she’s realizing I’m offended that “the baby has been a holy terror in the evening and she  didn’t mean to upset me”. I just decided to try to put the baby down for an evening nap and avoid her for a little while. 

When I see her later in the evening she tells me that she meant it to be an “endearing term” and wasn’t trying to offend me while simultaneously acting very obviously that she doesn’t understand why I’m so bothered by it. I obviously didn’t  buy that because she tried to explain herself out of it initially by saying that the baby was being difficult at night while I wasn’t there. I also found out today from my fiancé that she tried to explain to her mother how offensive her comment is. She tried to ask about even if she meant it “endearingly”, does she see how it might be offensive if it wasn’t meant that way, and her mother said “no, and I don’t understand why he’s upset, I think he’s being sensitive.” So I’ve been avoiding her like the plague because I don’t want to have a confrontation and I’m still very offended and it’s only grown as I’ve heard her excuses and lack of remorse. 

I think what bothers me most of all is that I am trying my hardest to be a very active father and watch him at least 12 hours of every single day. 

So AITA for being offended that my FMIL called me uncle to my baby because I’m not there for her small window of being around the baby?",19,55,0.9

154,Not the A-hole,"Ok, so hear me out. This is a little complicated. In general, I like to think of bedbugs as house herpes- and informed consent applies to anyone who is visiting or may have issues as a result of contact. 

First, backstory. On Sunday night, I saw a bedbug. Trapped it. Looked around- no other evidence, so I guessed it hitchhiked back from a very recent vacation. In the morning, first thing, I called the exterminator who came out immediately. He confirmed it was a bedbug, checked, and said it’s not an infestation. Still, though, I opted for full treatment because I don’t want to take any chances. They are coming today to use several layers of chemicals. Then, they are going to come back every week for a month, then every month for a year. I’m taking this very seriously. 

Background on the ex: so you know how I’ve said I’ve told everyone? Well, that is almost true. I haven’t told my ex. He is a super mentally abusive guy who has my kids right now for one of his summer weeks. He actively tells them horrible lies about me (that I’m a liar, that I don’t love them, that I do drugs/smoke behind their backs, that I am a criminal, etc.) NO he does not have 50/50. But the guy uses EVERYTHING to hurt me and the kids.

So here’s the thing. I don’t want to tell him. He already makes the kids strip at the door and shower right away when they get there because he doesn’t want any evidence of their lives here (his words). He doesn’t give them back their clothes until right before we pick up. Anything that comes with them is put into quarantine,. We are clean people. No pets. Decent housekeeping. We even hire a house cleaner to get the deep cleaning/disinfecting done regularly. It’s not like we are dropping them off covered in scabies. Also, he holds onto stuff for YEARS and this will NEVER die. I predict based on past behavior (which is the best predictor of future behavior) that he is going to use this as “evidence” that we are neglecting or abusing them. Not evidence in court- just in his constant attempts to alienate me from the kids. 

Also, about court. If he tries to make me liable for any infestation, I don’t think he would win. However, the costs of defending this claim, and presumably winning, is about equal to the cost of treatment for their house so either way I am out $2000-5000. Lose-lose

So, in this very specific case, am I the asshole if I just treat, am responsible with sending the kids in “safe” clothes and just staying mum?

TLDR: I don’t want to tell an emotionally abusive ex about potential bed bug exposure because I am afraid it will incite more abuse and expense.

Edited to ask the question: does your verdict change if the exterminator either finds a previously-missed infestation or if the treatments don’t work to prevent one?

Update: we told them just to cover our asses and it turns out that my ex-MIL has them. So... likely source. As often as they are over there I wouldn’t be surprised if ex has them too.",34,39,0.85

157,Not the A-hole,"We are all college students, who have all lived in rented houses before, and know how rent works. We all split it evenly (the five of us), but I write the central check. I don't have that much cash, so if someone doesn't pay on time, I at least have to know otherwise I may not have enough cash to buy basic needs.

So rent is due July 1st, I asked everyone to pay a few days in advance, because it takes a while to transfer into my account, and I want my account to be good in case the landlord immediately cashes the check. Everyone pays by June 27th, except for my fifth housemate (FH).

I message FH in the following ways from June 28th to today; Facebook DM, Group chats (which he shows as read, but no answer), text, phone call (with voice mails), email, and in person before FH left for a trip on the 28th (which is why I cannot talk to him in person again until the 9th of July). FH has responded to NONE of these, not told me why I don't have rent yet, left me on read for some of these, and has done NOTHING to rectify the problem.

Today, I am at my wits end, I need the money. I cannot sustain being down the fairly large amount of money FH owes me for much longer. So I sent FH the following text in anger:
""I am getting fucking tired of being ghosted on this rent, you are legally obligated to pay. 

At 11:59 PM today, I am contacting your parents if I don't get the $XXXX (you don't need the exact number). No ifs ands or buts. I need someone to be an adult and pay me, and if that won't be you... then fuck it.""

The issue is, FH's parents handle conflict poorly, but I also know they actually will handle it. FH always avoids dealing with fuck ups appropriately, and if the issue is FH doesn't have the money, I won't know about that until it's July 30th and I am stuck on this cycle again. 
Reasonable next steps for maintaining a functional relationship with FH aside, was my message an asshole move? Am I being out of line with this?",32,132,0.95

Her birthday is not until the end of the month, so I left the pair of shoes in my room. Later that week, I looked inside the Nike bag, and the shoes were missing, and went into panic trying to find my gift. 

I texted my mom if she had seen them, and she said she has them. I asked her where, and she had placed the shoes in a package that she was gonna send to our cousins back home. 

When I arrive home, I grab the box cutter and take the shoes out, this included ruining the arrangement because the shoes were at the bottom. My mom said it wasn’t a big deal, and said she could use it, she jokingly tried to wear the shoes. She didn’t even apologize, and if I hadn’t ask her where the shoes were, she would’ve shipped the package. 

I snap and tell her she’s inconsiderate and now she’s mad at me. She’s saying I don’t consider my poor cousins back home and that I should leave the house.

160,Not the A-hole,"We adopted my son from foster care when he was 4 years old. We also adopted his biological younger brother at the same time, and 2 years later added 2 unrelated little sisters, also from foster care. So 4 adopted children. Oldest son was arrested, removed from the home, and sent to live in a residential treatment facility when he was 13. While in the program there, he had multiple serious behavior issues that resulted in new charges, and broke any rule he wanted to. Throughout all these years, he showed absolutely no remorse, and blamed everyone around him for literally everything.  It was always some other kid's fault, or it's the guy who ratted him out's fault for being a snitch. No accountability, and the worst part was how ENRAGED he would get if anyone ever brought up one of these incidents after the fact. ""IT'S IN THE PAST, ASSHOLES! YOU NEED TO LEARN HOW TO LET THINGS GO!! WHY DON'T YOU TRUST ME????"" This would be, like, 1 week post- discovery.

When he was 16, after having been in the program for 3+ years, he decided he was sick of us not ""ever trusting him"" because we told the judge we weren't seeing much evidence of change. He stopped speaking to us. Refused phone calls, never reached out, ignored us at court and team meetings. He asked his caseworker how to get us out of his life, and was furious when she told him his chances as a 16 year old repeat offender of finding a new adoptive home were slim. Keep in mind, we always spoke to him calmly and with humor. We did call him on his crap, but gently and frankly, with a therapist present. In my opinion, he wanted us out of his life because he didn't want to go through the process of apologizing and owning his mistakes. He felt it would be easier to ""start fresh"" with a new family that didn't know what he'd done in the past.

My son is now 18 and wants to attend college when he's released from custody. I haven't spoken to him directly in over 2 years. He's done his best to pretend we don't exist. But apparently he is applying for financial aid, and because of our income he doesn't qualify for grants. He contacted me this morning, saying that we are required to pay for his college, since the government assumes parents will help with tuition and has denied him free money. Keep in mind, he does qualify for student loans. The fact that he's cut me out of his life for 2+ years has become another one of those things he screams that I ""can't let go of"" and ""need to learn how to move on."" No apology from him though, of course.

I don't want to give this kid a dime. I think he made his bed and can sleep in it. I also know that he wouldn't have ever spoken to me again except that he wants to use me for something. However, we are still his parents, and I guess responsible for him. So if I refuse to give him money, AITA?",130,217,0.92

At first, everything was going well my daughter (18 at the time) didn’t mind since they got along but she eventually got tired and moved out. Once she moved, we only talked every once in a blue moon and I was upset. 

A couple months ago, we went to dinner and I mentioned I’m upset that she doesn’t speak to me and it turned into a big argument about how (I’m summarizing what she said here) “I never cared about her as much as I do her cousin.

162,Asshole,"Hi there,

I had a surprise kid with an ex and he is now 8 years old.  He was her first and my only child.  Since then, she married another man and ever since then she has been popping out kids like a movie theater pops out popcorn.  She even admitted she is addicted to having babies.  She NEEDS to feel needed.

The more kids she has, the less money she has, the less time, the less energy.  His basic hygiene is not being met (not brushing his teeth, no haircut, dirty clothes, long fingernails).  She puts him in no sports.  He sits around and is getting chubbier - justl like her.  He even said ""I'm getting fat"".

She has custody because I've always lived in a different city and I fly in every 3 weeks to spend time with him.  We are out, we are active, we socialize, etc.  I'm a great influence on him and wish I could spend more time (I cannot move there for many reasons).

She said she was done with kids, but she just couldn't help herself and is now expecting a 6th.

It makes me furious that she is continually popping out children and neglecting them all.Am I overstepping my boundaries if I text her and tell her that her addiction to having babies is causing her to neglect them all?  If she doesn't have the time to brush 7 mouths twice a day, WHY is she still having babies?She needs to get her act together because I wouldn't be surprised if she had a 7th.

163,Not the A-hole,"I’m 34 years old and have a 6 year old son. He loves to  visit his great grandma so I took him to visit. 

I’m not vegan, my son isn’t vegan, and nor is my grandma. However, my cousin who had dropped her kids off at my grandmas IS vegan, and so are her 3 kids, 13,12, and 5. 

My cousin usually drops her kids off at my Grams place so she can go to yoga, and normally (I think from what my grandma has mentioned) she’ll leave cash so my grandma can order them some vegan food. However today she didn’t leave any money because I’m assuming she saw me there and figured I’d take care of the bill. She’s always done stuff like that since we were young, because I have always been a saver and she’s never missed trying to take advantage of that. 

After maybe 2 hours, I decide it’s time for lunch and so ask my grams if she’s hungry cuz I’m happy to cook. She insisted I leave the cooking and order in but I’m not letting an old lady cook or waste money when there’s food in the house so I make some awesome vegan tacos (it was vegan ground beef on lettuce leaves with diced onion and sriracha mayo so really nothing fancy but pretty tasty). 

My kid ate it yelling ‘daddy this is AWESOME’, my grandma ate it and was pleasantly surprised that it was good, I ate it and even the dog was sniffing around at the ground meat. Two of her kids however sat there with their noses turned right the way up and kept saying ‘ew, I just want to order something in’ whilst the youngest chomped it down shaking his butt doing the little kid happy food dance. 

I just told the older two they could eat this or go get fruit from the kitchen. They sat there scowling until their mom came back. When she did they went running to her and told her how hungry they were, at which point she asked why I hadn’t ordered them food when ‘there’s just literally a vegan sushi bar a block away’  I told my cousin that I had cooked vegan food, and I didn’t feel the need to order in when there was already food available. 

She called me a complete asshole (in front of my son as he had wondered in by this point) and told me that if I was such a tightwad she would have squared the cash with me right from the start so her kids didn’t need to go hungry.

165,Asshole,"I made an old woman cry before 8:30 AM...AITA

I (26f) have a co-worker (60ishf) who recently started working in our office. She is great. She is kind, resourceful, knowledgeable, and overall just a considerate person. I like her. Here is the catch...she refuses to look at client activity logs. An activity log will show you everything done in a clients account. Its like their diary of sorts. If you want to know whats going on in a clients account, the activity log is where you go to find it. We have reminded her multiple times that the best way to handle an account is to read the activity log first.

&#x200B;

Now its around 8:15AM and I hear her make a phone call to a client I have been working with daily for the last 2 weeks. Im immediately concerned as this client is an ASSHOLE and will not be happy that he is getting a call from our office before 9AM. Right away I can hear that he is being a jerk to her and I tell her to put him on hold. She does so, but at this point im fired up at what I consider to be her laziness in reading the activity log. Ive been dealing with this douche canoe on a daily basis and she is about to fuck up all my work. I admittedly raised my voice (I DID NOT YELL) and said ""Get off the phone with him right now, you have no reason to be calling him, that is my client, I've worked with him daily. Did you even look at the activity log?"" She says ""No..."" At this point, douche canoe client has hung up on her and Im now pissed. I raised my voice and said ""All you have to do is read the activity log to know that you didn't need to make that call, or piss off a client that I now have to deal with later!"".

I realized I was short with her and said ""Im sorry, that was not a kind reaction from me."" She then starts to silently cry. She gets up and goes to the bathroom. My other coworkers are saying im an asshole. I dont think so. Not only has she been told before to read activity logs first, but I also immediately and publicly apologized. She didn't do her job right and as a result I will have to deal with it. Am I the Asshole?

With that being said this is a reoccurring issue that had been discussed with her multiple times by myself and our manager. I did speak with her later one on one and apologized again.

166,Not the A-hole,"I'm black. My husband is white. He has a sister, who has a 3-year-old daughter who LOVES me, and who I think isn't too bad herself. My niece is equal parts terror and lovely, but mostly with me lovely. We hang out a lot to give my SIL a break, and my husband doesn't really ""get kids"" so it's often 1x1. 

I was out with my niece at a kid's playplace/mall for kids, and she was more terror than lovely. She was defiant, and I'm all about consequences after two warnings. She kept running from me laughing her butt off, so I told her it was time to go. Normally she'll go quietly but this time, filled with vim, vigor and grape juice, she pitched a GIGANTIC fit so I had to carry her. She wasn't screaming in a ""WHO IS THIS HELP ME"" way but in a clearly understandable ""NO, I WANT TO STAY AND PLAY. AUNTIE(ME), NO"" way. But also she's 3, so maybe if you're not used to her it's not clear. 

As we're leaving, a lady stops us asking if everything's okay. I smiled at her, and told her yes, that we just had to get home for a nap. She then got in my face like ""Do you KNOW this child."" I'm wrangling a screaming toddler, so I just said yes and tried to step around her. She then said, ""you're not leaving until you prove you know that child."" I told her, it's fine, we're related (my niece now was calm and holding me), she's just acting b-r-a-t-t-y and she said like, ""No mother would EVER say that about her kid"". Yeah, maybe. But she can't spell so. She then demanded I give her my niece, or call someone to confirm my identity.

The cops showed, and they asked my niece who I am ""AUNTIE (ME)!"" and I showed them some pictures of us together in clearly different settings, they apologized, reprimanded her. It's done. 

She  works somewhere in the complex, but not where we were. I want to report it. She'd been watching us and saw my niece and I hanging for at LEAST 30 minutes familiarly. So while I could have showed her the pictures, I didn't feel like I needed to. It's not her job and in fact the person whose job it was apologized to me as we left. Now, I have had this happen before, and someone is a little sketched. I'm polite, it becomes obvious that she knows me, and they drop it. I just had flashforwards to a time when my niece might pull the ""THIS ISN'T MY MOM"" card. And then I really WOULD need the cops to be called because I'd kill her. 

I get she was concerned. And that unlikely I'd adopted a white baby. But also, 100% fuck off, lady. AITA? Would I be if I complained to the facility?",2015,18357,0.92
167,Not the A-hole,"So me and my family love having people over for meals. I really enjoy cooking and showing hospitality to my guests. Except now for one member of my family, my cousin.

Earlier this year I had a family BBQ over at my place. I had about 40 people over. Now let me preface this by saying I realize that some of my friends and family have various food allergies and preferences. I am more than happy to cater to their needs because I want them to enjoy. But my cousin is just a notorious picky eater. Even then I try to make things she would usually eat. Well that particularly day I was making lamb chops, sausage, a bit of beef tenderloin, grilled portobello mushrooms, and corn. I also got some hotdogs because I know that's one of the foods she eats. Just as we start to eat some guy from Uber Eats pulls up. It turns out that my cousin ordered McDonald's and sat there eating chicken nuggets and fries in front of all of us.

I took a great deal of offense over this. I invite you over for a meal, and you insult me by ordering food to be delivered because you want to eat something else. I was embarrassed and angry over it. Other people noticed this and there were a few awkward looks,  but none of us said anything because we didn't want to make a scene. I vowed afterwards never to invite her or her family over again.

Jump to this weekend, I'm having another BBQ and invited some of the family over, I ended up inviting her younger brother over because he has been away for school and is now back for the summer. He asked if his sister and her family was coming too (I assume so he could get a ride) and i said no. At first I didn't explain why but because he kept pushing I explained the situation. Well of course word spreads and news gets back to my cousin and she and her husband are upset at me. This whole thing blew up and while I regret ever mentioning the reason why I banned her I do not want her or her family at my home. Now it's all my family is talking about, most agree with me, but some are calling me an asshole for it. So AITA?

Oh, for the record she is a 27 year old woman with 2 kids, and no, she did not order the McDonald's for them, they and their father were eating the food I prepared. She ordered two 10 packs of nuggets, a large fries, and a coke and ate it all herself in front of my and the rest of my guests.

Edit: because several have asked, I did contact her ahead of time, told her about what I was planning to serve, and she told me she preferred Costco hotdogs l, which I went out and made. It wasn't the picky eating that bothered me, if she asked if she could bring her own food that would have been fine (I wouldn't have liked it, but at least it would have been better) it was the ordering food even after I catered to her wants that implied I am a bad host that I took offense to. And I can see I may be an asshole for excluding her family, but I can't see how inviting her husband and 2 kids but not her wouldn't be extremely rude.",622,2274,0.96
168,Not the A-hole,"My cousin is like a brother to me. He wanted to advance his education and career in the US so I offered to pay for his education and helped my cousin with his transition to his new life here by recommending him a job in the company I work in and let him stay in my property.

&#x200B;

My cousin is the studious type, very academically inclined but socially awkward. Before coming to the US he never had a girlfriend before or many friends. He spends a lot of time on the computer and just studying preferring not to go out.

&#x200B;

Then he met a girl. Fall in love and got married. He's in his late 20s and this was his first relationship

&#x200B;

He calls me one day. His wife wants to open up the relationship saying she is still young and wants to “explore her sexuality” before ""truly"" settling down. He was CRUSHED. He calls me crying and it absolutely breaks my heart to hear him crying like that.

&#x200B;

We talked bit more. This is a ongoing problem. Wife was insistent on her way and refused consulting or other professional help. In my opinion, when a woman wants to open up a relationship it means she is having an emotional affair wants her husband’s permission to sleep with so that she is not a bad person.

&#x200B;

As his boss I can how this hurt him. He was unable to perform at work. I couldn’t stand looking at him like that so I talk to him.

&#x200B;

\- Look, its clear that this is affecting you very badly. Have you consider taking up on her offer? Since she wants to open up?

&#x200B;

He agrees to try.

&#x200B;

The problem is he absolutely had no game at all. So I decided to help him out. Me and my wife spend a lot of time on his image. He's not poor as he is making 250k (I know as his boss). He just doesn’t know how to present himself. We set up his social media accounts to make him more appealing. We went to meet girls together and we acted as his “wing-buddies”. I let him drive my car, (he was driving a Camry so he needs a much better ride) and one of my properties which is for investment purposes so he doesn’t have to go back to his home.

&#x200B;

And guess what. It worked. He started getting laid. A LOT. We made sure to add all his hook ups in his social media so that his wife can see.

&#x200B;

His wife was not happy at all! She thought he would not be that “wild” and wanted their open relationship close. Once she knew it was me and my wife who helped him she called and scolded me. She was screaming and i couldn't be bothered hearing her screeching harpy voice so i just off the phone on her. This happened yesterday. Today I have been getting calls from her friends scolding me for being an asshole ruining their relationship. I basically just retort “She ruined their relationship. I am just helping my cousin”

&#x200B;

I don't get it.She wants to open up the relationship, He got more successful than her and now she wants to close it, and its my fault that I'm ruining their relationship? So reddit users let me have it. AITA?

&#x200B;

Just want to say I agree with that most people here that their relationship is doom and should just cut it off. But he is an idiot with a set idea of how a relationship should work out. He does not want to divorce unless necessary, his wife doesn't want to consider  counseling. Me, I just personally wants him to be happy so I don't want to force the idea of a divorce to him. But i am working hard to lead him into that mindset.

&#x200B;

To answer many of the pm i am getting English is indeed not my first language but honestly it has never affect my ability to do my job.  I also have 2 masters so my English can't be that bad.  But i do apologize if i cause some of you guys to get cancer from reading my post.  As for my job I am a director in one of the MNC (Engineering field).

&#x200B;

My cousin is just a very hard-working,  simple ,  thrifty man with simple needs who just happens to get a good job that pays well.  He don't spend unnecessarily. He invest well,  spend wisely and overall have a good head on his shoulder.  This I think have to do with the fact that his family is not well off.  And for Asian one of the way to elevate your economic status is to study hard,  which he excels in, Then get a good job. This habit stays with him into adulthood.",554,5870,0.89
169,Not the A-hole,"So my friend posted a picture of a US flag and a story of how his great grandfather got it in 1904 and flew it every day because he was a proud American.  He then goes on a very political rant against illegal immigration.  I did not comment on the political side of it.  
The picture of the flag is a 50 star flag, which wasn’t created until 1959.  A 1904 flag should have 45.  
I asked him if he had another flag in storage and told him why.  I told him I’m glad his great grandfather was proud to be an American but his flag wasn’t from 1904.  I actually feel bad that I may have ruined his image of this prized family heirloom with a great story (though a tired political rant accompanied it). 
I told him I hope it’s just that his family replaced a tattered one or that it is indeed still in storage.

172,Not the A-hole,"So basically a friend of mine asked to use my Netflix to watch something. No problem. I give him the info and figured that’s that. Later that day my girlfriend texts me while I’m at work and asks if I changed the profile pictures for Netflix. Nope. Then she sends me this picture. 

https://imgur.com/gallery/wqQxHxB

It’s a picture of a fat female garden gnome in a swimsuit. He also changed the profile pictures for me and my mom, but these ones aren’t insulting.

For context, my girlfriend is on the heavy side. So am I. I don’t mind this at all and I do everything to build up her self-esteem. She had a very severe eating disorder as a teen that almost killed her and also messed up her metabolism to a point that it is almost impossible for her to lose weight. She is now happy and healthy but still struggles with anxiety about her weight. This experience has really impacted her and she’s been depressed for days.

I confronted my friend about this and he claims it was completely innocent and it’s “just a garden gnome”. I chewed him out pretty hard but now he won’t respond to my messages and refuses to apologize. 

I don’t have a lot of friends as is and I don’t want to lose any more, but I feel like he’s creating a situation in which it’s impossible to be his friend without betraying her. Am I the asshole?

TLDR: my friend posted a picture of a fat gnome on my girlfriends Netflix profile and refuses to apologize so I cut him out of my life.

Edit: I should also add, since some people are asking, that my friend was not aware of her history with eating disorders.

Edit 2: thank you all so much for all the replies. I will take everything into serious consideration. I didn’t expect this thread to be as big as it got, but I am happy for all the feedback. That being said, I am NOT looking for weight loss advice. I don’t consider being fat to be a negative thing for either of us. We are both very happy, and we also both happen to be fat. Please limit any further discussions to who is an asshole here, and please refrain from discussing weight-loss tips or techniques.",302,855,0.94
173,Not the A-hole,"This happened just over a week ago, and my parents and girlfriend said that I took things a bit over the top. I(24M) was out for dinner with my girlfriend and parents at a higher  restaurant in the east coast. After we finished our dinner, we were making a short walk to my car a few hundred feet away. As this was in a downtown area, its fairly common for folks to set up stalls for charities, girls scout cookies, etc. There was a stall for an anti-drug abuse organization (rhymes with stare) that focused on keeping school kids away from drugs/substance abuse.  With this being a high traffic area of rather affluent individuals ( high end shops, restaurants, etc.), there was a decent amount of people donating, and feeling charitable, I stood in line to donate as well. I typically only carry around a money-clip with cash and leave my wallet in my car. My turn came up, and I told them I wanted to donate $250(A big amount imo that was still in my affordable limits). For some reason, I decided that I wanted to actually put it on my credit card ( for a record in addition to the receipt they provide) instead. My car was parked diagonal to the stall, and I went and grabbed my wallet real quick. Now, I went back and handed my credit card, and cue them complimenting me on such a nice car. Then, they asked me if $250 was the best I could do, and that with a car like that I should be able to ""add a grand or two to that amount"". I was honestly taken aback, but brushed it off as being a joke and politely said nah. Then they started negotiating the damn amount. First insisting on me to atleast double it to $500, etc. I was livid to say the least. I was in no way obligated to donate, and now they were acting so entitled and basically attempting to extort donations. I raised my voice  told them to give me my card back and that I would not be donating to their organization through them. The folks in line to donate after me were also surprised by this display of entitlement, and acknowledged my reaction as being appropriate. A good 4-5 people walked away. At this point, I was stopped for further asking to speak with their higher ups to raise a complaint by my girlfriend and parents, but was I actually the asshole in this situation? While they agree that the Stare folks were acting a bit entitled, they're saying that I should have just simply donated the $250 and walked away, and that now I had caused the loss of not just my donation, but a few others as well.",76,202,0.91
174,Not the A-hole,"Just to start, I have a mild stutter. Not so bad that it's every word.but bad enough to notice it.

I got a new job a few months ago and met this guy in the training group. He was friends with my brother so would hang about with him after work. Usually in conversations, if I had issues with saying a word, he would say ""t-t-t-t-today junior"" and then laugh. (I think he got it from waterboy). It really pissed me off but I didn't say anything about it as we weren't in a formal work setting so I let slide. 

Anyway, he left and I didn't see him for a few months. I met up with him recently when I was in a cafe in town. We were talking and it was fine, but then my stutter started happening when we were talking about work. I can't remember exactly what we were talking about. He proceeded to do the ""today junior"" thing again and I told him to piss off.

F: what did I do?

M: it wasn't funny then, it's not funny now. Stop making fun of my stutter.

F: well you never said so how would I know? And you know what I'm like with my humour, it's not my fault.

M: just don't do it please. It's stressful enough that I can't finish a sentence properly, I don't need you making me feel worse.

F: oh grow up. It's just a joke. If you don't like it then piss off

M: fine. I'm not talking about this anymore. You're being a prick and you know you are

F: get a grip would you? You're making it into a bigger deal than it is.

I haven't talked to him in a while now so I don't know what else to do about it. I've had people make fun of it before, but they stop when I ask. He hasn't tried to message me or anything.

I know that it could be worse, but talking to people is already hard for me and having a stutter on top doesnt help.

175,Not the A-hole,"Hi all. I (25f) am currently 5 months pregnant with my second son. My husband (28M) is a religious man, this is only relevant for the baby names. My husband picked the name for our first child. Its a religious prophets name but it isnt bad and its has grown on me now that our first is almost 3. This wasn't the plan though, I wanted both of us to pick a name together, but after all of my names being shot down, I got tired of waiting for him to pick a name and said yes to the first name he picked. 

The issue I'm having is I was hoping I'd have more leeway naming our second child but that doesnt seem to be the case. I should've talked to him about this beforehand, but I have brought it up now that we're expecting again. He seems to have a unspoken list of rules about names that I've taken to writing down to help me find a name that I like. 

The biggest one is the fact he doesn't like Old timey names. I really wanted Sebastian, Theodore, Maxwell, any name like that but he hates them and says no every time. I can't pick a name of anyone he knows that he's had beef with, I cant pick an overly unique name like Orion. No fictional names unless it's from something he likes ( he'd probably be ecstatic if i asked about naming it Goku or Piccolo)

Anyways. I've been getting increasingly frustrated and want to know if I'm being an asshole about this. Is this how it is for everyone naming a child?",103,147,0.93

177,Not the A-hole,"I apologize in advance if this post seems convoluted. This happened a few hours ago and my emotions are still roiling.

TL;DR My bf came home at 3:30 in the morning saying he got in an accident. I opened the front door to talk to the police against his wishes.

Around 10 pm yesterday my bf went grocery shopping. He went to more than one store and lost his phone while there. He went back to the stores and had no luck in finding it an hourish later. 

I asked if he maybe he left it in a grocery basket. He seized on the idea and thought that was probably what happened so he left again. By this point it was around 12:30 am. I have work today so I went to bed.

I woke up at about 2 am and realized he wasn’t home still. I got really worried considering the stores are only a couple minutes away and he really should have been home by then even if he couldn’t find it. I drove around looking for him. I did not see his car in the store parking lots.

I didn’t know what else to do so I went home to wait for him. At about 3:30 he came in completely panicked. He jumped in the shower for about 60 seconds and came hurrying out again. He told me he got in a bad wreck and I had to help him. I asked him how he got home and he said he called a coworker (apparently found his phone?) to drive him here. He was extremely anxious, punching walls, and yelling. I asked him if he called the police. He said no. I told him to get dressed and we would have to go back.  He refused.

At this point I hear knocking on our door. I know it must be the police. At first he started pleading with me not to answer it and started to turn off all of the lights. This felt ridiculous to me. I’ve also never had any run ins with the police before and I legitimately thought they would kick the door in if I didn’t answer it.

I’m telling him to hurry up and get dressed so I can answer the door. He stops pleading and goes back to angry. I opened the door

I told the police all I knew was my bf just got home and was really upset because he had been in a wreck. They asked to talk to him. I went to get him. He was angrier than I have ever seen him before. He said I betrayed him. He argued with the police and it ended in them telling him that he would be getting a charge for a hit and run. 

After they left he absolutely went off on me. How could I do this to him? I’ve ruined him etc. Some heated words were exchanged back and forth. He told me to pack up and leave. Then he would change his mind, say sorry, only to start all over again. At one point he actually threw my bag out the door and physically pushed me out. I’m putting stuff in the car and he comes out to tell me not to leave.

This morning he walked to his parents house so they can help him with the car and I went to work. I feel that his parents will take his side on this issue.

I feel so confused. There are details I have left out but this is already kind of long. I’ll answer questions in the comments. 

AITA for talking to the police?

Edit: Thank you everyone who took the time to respond to this post. I did find it insightful and helpful. We talked after I got home from work, but to be honest I don’t feel that much was resolved.

I still don’t understand his mindset for leaving the scene. Essentially he states he panicked. He again told me he felt betrayed that I opened the door when he pleaded with me not to. In his words he felt I “threw him under the bus” and was “maliciously trying to get him arrested”. I do feel somewhat bad for answering the door. As naive as it sounds, I really didn’t know that not talking to the police is an option. 

I also did not receive a good answer for this 3 hour window he was looking for his phone. When I pressed for more info on this he became defensive and offended I didn’t believe him. 

My situation is not so easy that I can pick up and leave immediately. I will take a redditor’s advice however and pack a to go bag in case of an emergency. I don’t feel in any sort of immediate danger. I feel I owe it to myself to really find the truth before abandoning what has otherwise been a very fulfilling and loving relationship. 

I do have both eyes open now. Thank you for the wake up calls, truly. As this unfolds and I find more information I may post an update. Thank you everyone for your genuine concern.",125,122,0.92
178,No A-holes here,"This is such a painfully first world problem that I appreciate you clicked on my post at all! Thank you. 

So I get facial services pretty regularly and have been a regular at this salon for over a year now. They often give me new employees because I never ask for anybody specific and I’m friendly and forgiving of any newbie mistakes. 

However their newest employee - I had a bad experience with. She was perfectly lovely, made a few mistakes that’s no issue for me I completely understand the plight of the newbies. The issue I had was that her hands reeked of cigarette smoke. As you may or may not know, facial services involve the technicians hands all over your face for an hour or more. I could tell she did her best to get rid of the smell but honestly the strong perfume on her hands coupled with the cigarette smell just made it worse. The last time I was in I could hardly stand it and suffered for the entire hour under her care. 

I want to call in to request to not have her service me again and they will ask why and I’ll have to tell them. But at the same time I don’t want to get this poor new girl in trouble when she’s just trying to learn new skills and make money.

179,Everyone Sucks,"I (25f) work at a big tech company. I got hired a level above entry level. I bonus every quarter and received a promotion in my first year. 

My half sister (same dad, 30f) currently works at her moms sides family business as a secretary (filing and answering phones). She claims she is also responsible for picking up the slack of her fellow co workers, which you know, I think everyone feels that way at their job. This family business pays for her iPhone 7. We’re also roommates and I watch her cats while she’s gone so I know within the first 5 months of this year she’s already taken more than a month off work and has other vacays planed. What I’m saying is she has it good here. 

She doesn’t like working with her mom/boss. Basically says she doesn’t like how she treats her and feels she should be making more (like $5 more an hour). Every once in awhile she’ll get sick of it and say she’s going to leave. 

This time she actually applied for a job. But at my company. She said his job is three times her salary. And not just that but 10 levels above me, a director level job. She states she has all the qualifications except a bachelors degree (she never graduated). She has sense asked me endless questions about vacation time here, benefits, pone numbers and emails of people she can harass to get the job. Tbh it all feels a little insulting to me, but I’ve been trying to let it go. 

I can’t give her emails and phone numbers because I would be fired for giving that out, so I compromised and offered to submit her resume to my company for her, that way they see someone here is backing her up.

She sends me her resume, and she is hilariously unqualified for this job. Every job she’s had except her family business has been a year or less. One job listed was three months. She said she was a manager at one of the stores she worked at (she was a sales associate and was fired for being a no show). One of the requirements for this job is 10+ years of operations experience (all the people who do this job are older obviously), and she’s only been in the work force for 12 years. 

What really got to me though was the other night when she was bragging about committing time theft from her current job. She was saying she deserves a higher level job and ‘I can’t do entry level like you’. It really hurt my feelings she thinks I’m entry level. That and other comments make me feel like she’s putting me down to make herself feel superior. 

WIBTA if I never submit her resume?
WIBTA if I gave her a reality check? 
WIBTA if I tell her she has no idea how good she has it?

Okay guys one edit, she already applied on a job searching site, me submitting her resume would be saying an employee here knows her and backs her up, just a little extra help to get the job.",32,59,0.87

Recently, my father contact me with a letter. (Though a mutual).  Surprisingly, it was pretty heartfelt. It seemed completely genuine. I meet with him and my father seemed like a new person. He was so different I 100% thought he was just putting on a show or something. 

For whatever reason I kept seeing him and his behavior didn’t change. He’d act so hopeful and excited for a new opportunity to see me. Which isn’t like him at all. (To be honest I’m still hesitant to what I believe..if he is acting real or not) 

So here is the main point- I am pregnant. I became convinced he was only acting this way because he somehow knew this. I figured he believed I was his last shot at grandchildren (my siblings apparently don’t want them(?)). 

So I told him very harshly he can‘t see his grandchildren. In fact he can never see them. I don’t want them to know him. If he wants a relationship with me that’s fine but seeing them  is completely out of the question. So if that’s what he wants, he can just leave now and we don’t ever have to talk again. 

He seemed incredibly hurt but he said “okay” anyway. It felt justified in the moment. But now, coming home and cleaning my head. I feel like I acted like a huge asshole towards him.I am not proud of my actions. My husband takes my side but I feel like I acted too harsh.

My dad says ""Dawson wants to be a builder so I gave him a hammer"". Dawson was non-verbal at this point. I said - this was not okay.

Last Night - Twin's 2nd Birthday 

1) My Mom: She was extremely nice and offered to pay and pick up dinner at PF Changs for everyone (she has an issue not picking up everything for an order but said she could do it) . Because of my blood pressure I choose a low sodium choice and was only going to have half.  From the  road she called and said - I checked 3 times we have EVERYTHING. She got to the door - FOOD is here I checked it all. She sets down the bag of food - and boosts again her checking skills. Guess what... my order was not there ( it was a 5 entree order) and three of the other orders were missing ( rice and sauce). What most likely happened is that she completely forgot a bag there - she said she checked the order when we got in the car so stuff would already be missing. I asked her - how did this happen if she checked it. She admitted she never checked it. I was a bit annoyed and plainly said - this would have been okay ( missing items) if you did not say you checked it so many times. My mom ends up sobbing in our bathroom for 20 minutes.

2) My Dad: My parents were nice and bought items for the new baby and brought them in a 9 pound Amazon box. My parents arrive - My husband was in the garage. The twins ran to the door like always and  I was making my way to the door. My mom held the door open my dad fumbled with the box - he had a bad hold on it but would not put it down. The box slide out of his hand right into my daughter's head knocking her against the wall to the floor. She cried. My dad's first words - he blamed my husband for not helping him. I asked if he asked my husband for help - he said no. Next blamed my mom for not holding the door ( she was). Then he blamed me for not helping - I told him I would have if he asked. Then he blamed my daughter for running up to him - a habit they created over the last year. Once he was out of excuses he started yelling at me like never before - f bombs ( at least 10) right in front of my kids.

186,Asshole,"Before I start this story, I just want to make clear that I still have time to change and book my sons ticket, depending on everybody’s thoughts. 

My husbands family are from Bruges, and every few years we go over to spend some time with family. They are all amazing people and we love going, my husbands mom spoils the heck out of all her 
grandkids and it’s just an amazing time. We get some really good bonding in and we all love it. 

We have 5 kids, an 18 year old son, 16 year old son, and then a 14 year old son and finally our twin girls aged 11. 

The kids are usually well behaved and well adjusted, they love sports, have active social lives, etc. Our 16 year old son James has lately fallen into a crowd that I wouldn’t call ‘wrong’ but are definitely living a different lifestyle. The kids all smoke weed and live on their skateboards and my son has seemingly fallen in with this crowd like it’s his long lost home. He’s never home, we don’t see him, he’s become secretive, all normal teenage things. I must stress that he’s still respectful to his family and he’s still a sweet kid. 

I don’t really care or mind if my son smokes weed with his friends, I equally don’t care if his entire life is his skateboard. The ONLY thing I and his dad care about are his grades which have severely slacked.

We told him if he didn’t tighten up he wouldn’t be coming with us on vacation. He absolutely loves his grandparents and they love him, and he’s also incredibly close with all his siblings. We hadn’t seen him cry in years but he cried that he’d do better and we assumed he’d make steps to fix his previously amazing schoolmarks. 

Sadly however, that didn’t happen and his grades never improved. We told him last night and he absolutely broke down. My heart is breaking for him and his dad is on the verge of just booking the ticket anyway. 

We leave next week, but my only thing is I don’t want our parenting to look weak if we go back on our word. 

Would we be the assholes if we didn’t bring him along?",156,91,0.87
187,Not the A-hole,"I’m using a throwaway because a couple of them use reddit and know my main account.

I love my friends. We hang out a lot of the time, but almost every time we do, they always bring up the fact that I used to bully some of them in the past.

At the time, I didn’t realise it was bullying. I used to say mean things to people a lot as I thought it was just a joke. I didn’t realise until a few years later on how this effected people, so I apologised to everyone I could have hurt in the past and started being more careful about what I say to people and the “jokes” I make are never at the expense of other people anymore.

I understand that I made them feel like shit years ago, but I don’t think I should be made to feel like shit for the rest of my life.

I am 21 now, but this was when I was 11 or 12. I have been apologising ever since and every time they bring it up, it honestly puts a damper on my mood and makes me want to leave.

The breaking point was when I was talking to a girl who was at a party and my group decided to start having “banter” and talked about me being a bully. The girl was polite, but pretty much ran away as soon as possible after that interaction.

They think they’re just joking around, but I feel like they still haven’t let it go.

TL;DR: I used to bully some of the people I hang out with today. I have apologised for the past 10 years and changed the way I act towards people.

So, WIBTA if I tell them to shut up about it now because this was 10 years ago or do I deserve it?

———————

EDIT: I have spoke to my friends individually and then messaged the group chat as a whole afterwards. I explained how it made me feel when they brought up the past. I also again, reiterated how sorry I am for the past.

They have said that they didn’t mean anything by bringing it up. They were just having playful banter. They said that we all are different people from when we were 11 and that they forgiven me ages ago.

Going forward, they have said that they won’t mention it. We’re all going for drinks as we usually do at the weekend, so nothing has changed and I am really glad that I can talk to them about anything.

I love my friends and they have assured me that there is no bad blood between any of us.

Just wanted to say that I’m really grateful to hear all of your experiences and opinions. I really appreciate all the advice given.

I understand that a lot of you have been hurt by bullying and I am extremely sorry for playing a part in that group.

To go in a MRI machine you have to take your shoes off, so I did and when I came out I realised she was actually taller than me when we both weren't wearing shoes. I was honestly shocked and said something like ""fucking hell you're taller than me, so nice talking to a girl I don't look down on, how tall are you?"". She responded with ""6'6"" (lie cause I'm that)"", said something like ""wow very impressive"" which she smiled at somewhat awkwardly before walking off to get the machine ready. About 5 minutes later her supervisor came round and said to keep things related to the study, I thought yeah she's probs just a bitch without really thinking about it and went on like normal. Study finishes, come out to see my scan, supervisor wasn't there so started chatting to the phd again. She seemed sort of awkward/unrelaxed which is when I realised she probably said something to her supervisor which was why supervisor seemed like such a bitch.

So I have a friend who I am quite close with we talk about most thing, however they are currently just going through what I consider (personal opinion) a pretty reckless time. Sleeping around, putting themselves in dangerous situations and complaining about being treat badly by men and generally stuff I wouldn’t do. Smoking weed whilst in training for a medical position. I listen try and support and don’t judge if you being safe have at it, but if your upset you have caught a STI you probably need to make different choices.
 
I call in Tuesday night and they announce that they had spiked a “dates” coffee at their house with Viagra. They had crushed up 2 pills and then when that didn’t work added 2 further to an different drink. I said it was terrible, that you have basically drugged some one. They laughed and said I was over reacting did I want some.
 
I realised this story to my other half and brother one said the same as much that it was horrific and it is no different to a man spiking a woman’s drink and my brother said it was funny. Since had that friend reach out to me basically complaining that I am not a good friend for judging and I basically made them feel bad when it was not big deal.
 
I want to know if I should have just said nothing as it didn’t effect my life or if I was right to say it was a dick move. I basically accused her of date rape. 

Brother and friend was like no man is going to complain about sex plus it’s not like it was cocoon or some thing bad. But I think it’s sick. She’s now not talking to her and telling our friends I called her a rapist (which I didn’t)

There are a lot of vehicles where I am and I found it but it was smashed and can’t be used anymore.

195,No A-holes here,"I need to start this with some context about myself (22m). I am, essentially, a barely functioning wreck of a man. By which I mean I suffer pretty hard with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, as well as chronic back pain from a childhood injury and a little clinical depression sprinkled on top to make it extra fun. Make no mistakes: this isn't a pity party and I don't expect sympathy, I just want to be fully transparent on the fact that day to day life is pretty challenging for me sometimes, as this is very relevant to the story.

Now, the other person involved here is my brother's (28m) girlfriend (34f). She has no inclination whatsoever towards doing housework or cooking or really much of anything around the house. It's fine when my brother is home because he does it all and enjoys it, but his job requires him to work away a lot, sometimes for up to a week, and when he is away things just don't get done. If I go round to visit my niece (3f) and nephews (9m and 11m) while my brother isn't there, I often end up doing a lot of it because the level of mess that house reaches is unreal. Now, historically I've tried not to judge her bc I didn't know if she maybe had some kind of invisible disability, and lord knows I of all people can't stand being judged for not being able to do things because of my conditions. 

However, I recently found out that she *doesn't* have anything that would prevent her from doing stuff, and that she just opts out of doing most of it, bar dishes and laundry. My brother is currently away and I went over yesterday and did a bit of cleaning because the house was a pigsty and cooked lunch for the kids bc they've been living on Pot Noodles and takeout for a week. I kinda gently asked if everything was okay and why she hadn't done much today and she started talking about how she finds cleaning tiring and how she wishes they could afford a maid (note: brother makes ""partner can be a SAHM"" money but not ""hired help"" money). I, in what I thought was an encouraging way, said I understand it's tiring but it's so satisfying to get done and that if my broken ass can manage it, anyone can. She didn't say anything at the time, but later last night my brother rang me and said that his wife had called and said I'd been rude and condescending and she felt spoken down to by me. I feel really bad. That wasn't my intention at all, I truly meant to be encouraging. AITA here? Could I have worded it better?

Edit: put my brother's age wrong originally he's 28 not 25. Not that it changes anything, but that's why it's different from the copy in the comments.

Edit 2: my nephews are 9 and 11 YEARS old guys, not months. By 9m and 11m I meant 9, male and 11, male.

Edit 3: since it's apparently pertinent to this, yes I've spoken to my brother and no nothing has changed. CPS have been called on her before and she cleaned the house fully for them coming over.",72,77,0.88

My husband is John Michael Smith III. His sister had a daughter 2 years ago and she was talking about how difficult it was to name their child. My husband mentioned that it would be easy if we had a boy. I asked what he meant and he said, ""Well he'll just be John Michael Smith IV."" I told him I wasn't on board with that because kids deserve their own identity and he told me I was being ridiculous. We agreed to end the discussion because it didn't matter in that moment. 

Fast forward to now. We just found out that I'm expecting a baby boy and my husband wants to use John Michael Smith IV. I'm not comfortable with this. Both John Michael Smith Sr. and John Michael Smith Jr. go by ""John."" My husband is known as ""Johnny"" and he says our son can be called ""Jack"", since Jack used to be a common nickname for John before becoming more popular as a given name. I said if we are just going to call him Jack then we might as well name him Jack. My husband didn't like that idea because then his son wouldn't be ""the fourth."" 

I honestly don't even like the name John. I think it's old, boring, and wouldn't want it for my child regardless but the fact that he would be sharing the same name as his great grandfather, grandfather, and dad makes it worse for me. I think everyone should at least have their name to themselves and I think it's somewhat egotistical to name your child after yourself but haven't said that to my husband. I am fine with using similar names, like Jack or Jonathan. They aren't my favorites but still honor John without making him ""the fourth."" I would also be okay with John and/or Michael as a middle name. I am Latina while my husband is white and I suggested something like Juan Miguel Smith instead. It's basically the same name but Spanish. 

My husband loves my favorite name and wants to use it for a future son, but wants his first son to be John Michael Smith IV. He wants to save my favorite (Julian Diego) but we may never get to even use it.

Edit: To make it less confusing, I need to let everyone know that John Michael Smith isn't the actual name. I thought my first sentence was enough but people think I am making a joke about the name so I want to make sure no one is confused. John is actually the middle name but my husband goes by his middle name to avoid confusion with his dad and grandpa. That's why he suggested using the nickname Jack for John even though it's the middle name.

The first name is something along the lines of Andrew/Andres, Edward/Eduardo, Stephen/Esteban, Philip/Felipe, Matthew/Mateo, Michael/Miguel, Thomas/Tomas. There is a direct Spanish equivilant.

Mark did not qualify for government disability because as I understand it the treatment was not serious enough to merit the person not work.

A parent relocated to take care of Mark during treatment. A friend donated a house for them to live in rent free. His current landlord did not charge him rent during treatment either, under the impression he would need a place to live once his treatment was finished.

The families donated time and property to clean and furnish the house. The families then set up a meal system to provide dinner for Mark and his mom every night through treatment. The employer paid their Hulu subscription at the highest possible level. Coworkers donated their sick time.

The families created a go fund me to help with additional living expenses. His employer and coworkers sold sweatshirts and organized a fund raising event. Everything combined over $18,000 was raised.

The hospital covered the cost of treatment.

Mark went through six months of Chemotherapy, and after his twelfth treatment he was declared cancer free. Through all this he did not work but proceeded to snowboard, hike, and travel.

Mark decides not to move back into his old house and gives no advanced notice to his land lord or the other tenants. He plans to buy jet ski.

He clearly built a bank roll from peoples donations while everything was already being paid for. And is now deciding to buy a jet ski.

I think Mark is an asshole for keeping the excess money, and especially for even considering buying a jet ski, the pinnacle of luxury items. I know others that feel this way, but none of us feel we can openly talk about it since he survived cancer.

Am I the asshole?

Edit: For additional info a number of employees that donated either money or sick time are minimum wage, and if they’re not they majority still make less than he does and none have jet skis. 

Edit: For additional clarity on my stance, I think to say he’s milking it isn’t accurate. I just feel if you have excess money from donations in a situation like this you should either keep it and be low key about it or pay it forward and donate it. Buying a luxury item like this seems very inappropriate.",188,233,0.94
213,Asshole,"So there’s a cupcake place in town called Sprinkles. Amazing. Delicious. Expensive. Anyway... during the Game of Thrones finale a few weeks back, they did special GoT cupcakes. It happened to be a day when we were in the area (approx an hour away from our house) so we decided to stop in and get some cupcakes, NOT the special GoT ones, just their regular flavors.

So these special GoT cupcakes ended up selling out online. When we got there, there was a literal line curving around building of people waiting on standby. We stepped in line, and waited about 15 mins, barely moving. An employee came outside and made an announcement that anyone waiting for GoT cupcakes would be at least a half wait.

Literally everyone ahead of us were waiting for these special cupcakes and I can hear them all chatting about it and moaning about the wait. My wife says she’s going to go in and ask if we aren’t waiting for those specific ones, can we just cut ahead and order their regular flavors. She enters and a minute later texts me to come inside. As I’m entering through the doors, the lady who’s first in line starts bad talking shit about me and my wife cutting the line and how far we and we need to wait and blah blah blah. 

I try to explain to her my wife asked the employees and we didn’t want the GoT cakes and she starts yelling at me that no she didn’t ask and it didn’t matter. So I start getting a little louder and telling her mind her own business and wait for her cupcakes and end up pulling the door shut in her face from the inside and calling her something like a “fucking maniac.” 

Inside, there’s at least a dozen people either waiting to pay or waiting to be served their cupcakes. My wife is just staring at me, along with everyone else either laughing or staring. Turns out wife didn’t ask, she just went inside and stood in line. She was embarrassed that I, being a man, would raise my voice at a woman, especially a stranger. She’s definitely not wrong, but I was trying to defend her honor, lol. AITA?

TLDR: Cut a half hour wait in line to order the regular cupcakes and yelled at a lady for talking shit about my wife.

*EDIT* So just to make it clear, yes we cut in line, but these people were going to be waiting 30 minutes either way. Me getting my cupcakes and leaving didn’t make them having any longer or shorter wait in line.",140,285,0.9

Now, elementary school teachers do not make much. I feel like this is a horrible financial decision.

Everything about our relationship is fine...except for the fact that she started wearing pretty revealing clothes a few months ago. First it started off with a few pairs of some pretty short fitting shorts. I overlooked this because I know that it’s not too out of the ordinary nowadays and it didn’t bother me at all. I hate the idea of being a controlling boyfriend that dictates what she wears and I’m doing my hardest to stay away from that. Next she buys more of those really short shorts, then a dress that shows a lot of cleavage, to the point where nip slips aren’t uncommon. I pointed it out to her gently and jokingly at that point and she just nods and I didn’t push her further. After that, my mom pointed out to me in private about how short her shorts are, and I agree with her. Same thing goes on, but today when I pointed out how much cleavage she’s showing she gets super defensive and tells me how it pisses her off when I point it out. I understand that it might seem out of my place to tell her what she can and can’t wear but I feel like there’s a point where too much is enough. AITA for pointing it out to her?",182,177,0.89
218,Not the A-hole,"So I just got off the phone with my girlfriend(Belle), what started as a casual talk became hostile when I mentioned she'd be meeting me at a friends ""wedding"" reception because I would be leaving early to get ready with wedding party. 

To give some background;

My best friend got married a few months back and asked me to be co-best man with his brother.

Despite the fact that I (and everyone else under the sun) hate the bride. She's a lazy self centered abusive bitch. The wedding was in a tourist trap and pretty trashy but we obviously went and I was co-best man. 

Since they went into credit card debt paying for Stu's wedding from the first Hangover, they had to have the reception at a later date. They finally picked next weekend. Cool. They went into more debt booking the venue. 

I call the groom today for an unrelated issue, he then informs that he'll pick me up early to get ready and go to the venue so the wedding party can come out together. Makes sense no big deal. 

I'm talking to my girlfriend tonight on the phone while she's at work. We're just shooting the shit when my conversation with the groom pops into my head. I mention the game plan and Belle just freaks out. 

""Absolutely fucking not"" ""Then I won't go"" ""I'm not going by myself""

I tall her that I will be with her all night. I tell her my mom and dad are going and she can go with them. 

""Nope"" ""I would never make you go alone"" and the big one ""I have social anxiety"" 

I tell her she's over reacting a bit. That if she was in her best friends bridal party I wouldn't expect her not to get ready with them or to tag me along with her. She deflected. 

I also think pulling out the anxiety card is bullshit. In the many years we've been together she's never used that as an excuse before. I'm not saying she doesn't have it, I know she does. Its just that it's never stopped her before ? And we've been to plenty of events. Yes, usually together, but plenty separately. I have social anxiety as well and I know she'd tell me to suck it up if I pulled that card. Did I say any of that to her ? No I'm not that dumb. Obviously anxieties are serious and I'm not gonna question nor openly judge someone for having them. I'm guilty of letting my anxieties get the best of me too. I just feel pulling this card now is kinda convenient. But I'm willing to accept that this fact alone may make me the asshole. 

Belle used my dislike of the bride and the marriage as a reason why it's not important that I go be with the wedding party. I argued that my feelings on the bride and the wedding are irrelevant. What matters is my best friend and being there for him. 

We're both trying to get a word in, she harshly says ""Fine. Don't worry about. I'll go with your parents"" my next words my have been a mistake but its what came out. I said ""don't do me any favors"" 

She hangs up. Fuck.

228,Not the A-hole,"This happened on father's day but it still irks me to all hell.

So we went to visit my grandfather's grave-- me, my mom, grandma, and aunt. Beside his grave is the grave of a close family friend, so we asked the daughter of his family to come with us. She brought her eldest daughter.

So we were all paying our respects and greeting each other (especially with our family friend's daughter, since we haven't seen her in a while). Let's call her E.

E and my aunt started to have their own conversation because E mentioned that she's going to divorce her husband-- he's abusive and he instigates fights in front of E's two daughters, and naturally they're affected by it.

Now, in our family, only my parents got divorced. They did the same thing-- fight in front of me. They finalized the divorce when I was 6. It still bothers me and it used to be a real sore spot growing up, but I've grown to accept it when I became an adult. I'm almost 20, for reference.

So, of course, my aunt knows this. She started to make comments to E and in front of E's daughter, knowing I was in the vicinity, that were backhanded jabs towards the effects of divorce on *me.* She was saying things like, ""look how vulfreim turned out!"" ""see what happened to vulfreim!"" ""children who see fighting and go through divorce tend to have behavioral problems as they grow up!"" ""vulfreim always acts hateful towards family because of it."" Stuff like that.

I know my aunt has issues with my 'attitude problem,' but I simply just do not like my mother's side of the family because they're judgy, nitpicky, pretentious people that I would avoid if they weren't related. It really rubbed me the wrong way that, in front of E and her daughter, my aunt was making comments about this and trying to tie it into the upcoming divorce.

Eventually I honestly had enough of it. I was at a distance with my mom, at least a yard away from the others. But I approached my aunt and pulled her aside, and asked her to knock it the fuck off and to not use me as an example, as it's disrespectful to assume the effects of divorce. She didn't go through it and she never bothered to connect with me in such a way, so she has zero right to make all these comments. She scoffed and didn't say anything, though she did drop the subject.

Hours later my aunt called my mom to say what happened, and my mom got upset with me for ""making a scene at a cemetery, especially since someone was upset,"" even though I explained that I was just defending myself and didn't appreciate what my aunt was saying.

So for my mom’s birthday my brother and I took her out to the movies. This was in the middle of the day as my brother and I are off from uni for the summer and she took the day off of work. Because of this the theatre was essentially empty. Except for a group of girls sitting directly behind us. 

So during the previews they talked very loudly, and constantly. I let it go because they were obviously out as friends and who doesn’t talk a bit during the previews. However once the movie began they continued. Full outdoor voice, no whispering chatting while the movie was playing. It wasn’t just a few offhand comments either, they talked CONSTANTLY. About cooking, other friends, different movies, etc. I tried shushing them a couple times hoping they’d get the hint, but obviously they didn’t care. After about 20 minutes of this I turned around and said, “Can y’all shut up, you’re in a goddamn movie theatre for fucks sake”. They didn’t respond or let out another peep for the remainder of the movie. I was deeply satisfied, but worried my mother wouldn’t approve (she’s against confrontation).

And boy does she let you know about it. Every conversation with her results in her referring to it. You couldn't sleep last night? Neither could my sister, because she has this really bad insomnia. You were stressed at work? Not as stressed as my sister, who had to deal with people and their drama all day. Having a bad day? My sister's day was much worse, because of insomnia and anxiety.

Every fucking conversation results in her talking about her health issues. It honestly almost feels like a competition with her. Sort of a ""who has it worse in life"" competition. Additionally, she's used her issues as a weird social crutch. She'd absolutely love to help me prep dinner, but she's so tired because she didn't sleep well due to her insomnia, and she really needs to rest.  Never mind that she then spends that resting period scrolling through Instagram instead of actually, y'know, sleeping, which is what she said she was going to do. I finally got sick of it, and told her that everyone knows she's struggling, but that she needs to stop fucking guilt tripping everyone in a conversation about her issues, and either needs to get help or suck it up.

237,Not the A-hole,"Hello. I am a 24F engaged to be married. My fiance is my age. I'm white, he's black.

His family doesnt like me and I'm positive its because I'm white. They've made enough degenerative comments about white people for me to be sure. They also exclusively refer to me as ""the white girl"" or ""that white girl my son is living with"". They like to make jokes about me that circle back to my color. For example: my fiance has been dieting and has lost weight. His mom said she thought he was too skinny. His aunt said ""it's because that white girl he shacks up with cant cook"" and his other aunt said ""show me a white person who can cook"".

My fiance called them out and redirected the conversation to the wedding. I said that I was sad my grandmothers had passed away and couldn't be there. I told a story my dad's mom always said she was going to tell at my wedding. I got a little teary-eyed.

His mom said, ""you'll never catch me crying over two dead old white ladies. That's the best kind of old white lady"".

That hurt and I snapped. I called her a racist bitch and stormed out. My fiance came out and as we drove home he told me he understood why i said it but that i went too far but so did his mom. He wants us both to sit down and apologize. I said I wasnt doing that and I didnt want her apology.

He said I'm being childish and that both his mom and I are being assholes.

I'd appreciate some opinions. Thanks!


ETA: the responses have been overwhelmingly helpful and insightful. Thanks so much. Just wanted to address a few things brought up: my fiance has been very defensive on my behalf. He always calls them out when the situation warrants it. This is the first time his mom has well and truly crossed a line. Before it was usually just small comments that I was able to mostly ignore. But he always calls her out. I've never felt unsupported by him. He told me he gave her a very stern what-for after I left the house and his father has called me to apologize, just spoke with him a little while ago. He agrees with the suggestion that we should go to counseling while our relationship is still good.

ETA: MIL will not be apologizing. She called me shortly after FIL called and told me that my fiancé said she needed to apologize but she would not be. She does not regret her actions and she stands by them, as a matter of fact. She demanded I apologize to her, which I refused to do, however, if she had shown even the slightest bit of remorse or even just concession I might have given a little in return. The conversation didn't go well, she had me on speaker and every time I tried to speak her sisters would yell and screech over me. Oh, she called me ""Little Miz Miracle Whip"", which was...interesting. I would hope if I were any kind of egg/gelatin spread I'd at least be Duke's.

ETA: Fiance and I have been discussing this all day since it happened (yesterday) and we've been reviewing all of the answers. My fiancé has decided to go low-to-no contact with his family on a trial basis. He's going to call his mom in the morning and explain to her that she needs to understand that he loves her but he loves me too and I'm going to be a part of his life and family and that if they can't accept me or at least treat me with a common decency that he will be gone. He's very upset, he's actually somewhat inconsolable because of how much he loves her, but he wants me to understand that he loves me just as much. I've told him if it's too hard for him to stay away from them then he need not do it. I don't want him to hurt unnecessarily. But he's insisting he at least try. I'll update as stuff happens. Gonna go rub his back and see if the cat will let him play with her favorite toys.

ETA: I'm going to bed. V.V Sleepy. Good Night, Moon.

ETA: Nothing like a good controversial post to bring out the nutcases and trolls. Thank God I'm made of tougher stuff than that. Oh, to the guy who called me a race betrayer: you're just saying that because no one of any race would ever love you.

ETA: so fiance went over to talk to his family and told them that until they learn to respect me and us and our relationship that he wont be speaking to them. He said if there was an emergency he'd obviously be there but as it stands he is not having anything to do with them. He told them of they want to attend the wedding that they need to sit down with me and him and have a very long conversation. Fiance told his mother I was willing to apologize for how I confronted her but not what I said or the emotion behind it. His father has been receptive and he called me and apologized for his own behavior and said that at the end of the day his son's happiness is what matters. He said that he would do what he could to encourage his wife to have a sit-down with me but he couldn't promise me anything. So we have that at least.

238,Not the A-hole,"I am male 33, a teacher at a High School. Last month I had a problem with one of my female students Tina 15-16 yo (not her real name). She had been texting me very inappropriate messages in the most sexually explicit language one can imagine a girl her age can come up with. At first I did not know it was her. But after weeks of chain of dirty messages, I decided to get a new private number and dialed the mysterious sender of the texts. 

She picked it up and I instantly recognized her voice. I was beyond shocked. I went ""Tina?  Is this you? What do you think you're doing?"". She hanged up on me immediately. The next day she did not show up at school so I talked about it with fellow teachers and school principals. Some of the male teachers revealed that she had once acted sort of flirtatious towards them as well. But they just brushed it off as her being playful and they never got any texts from her. I was the only idiot who gave my students my private number just in case they wanted to ask about something but too shy in class.

Tina didn't show up in class until the following week. I asked her to follow me into the principal office where the other teachers were waiting and then I asked her why she sent me those inappropriate messages. At first, naturally she denied ever sending them. But after I lied to her by telling her that I was going to call the cops, she finally confessed that she got a crush on me and that those text messages were only pranks. I recorded her confession on my phone. 

She then begged me not to tell her parents because her stepfather would 'beat her up and kill her'. Considering the tricky and sensitive nature of this subject matter that might damage my reputation as a teacher, I did what I thought was the right thing to do. I called her parents the following day and as you may have guessed, her mother did not believe me and accused me of 'probably having acted inappropriately around her daughter first'. I told them that is a serious accusation for which I could sue them. Besides I have the video of her confession as a proof. Seeing how badly they reacted, I then privately asked the school principal to expel Tina, which was granted, for fear of rumors that might start circulating if this incident ever got out in public. Because I think nobody would look at our teacher-student relationship the same way ever again, no matter what the truth really was. 

Could I have handled this situation any better without having to have her expelled? Am I an asshole of a teacher?

TL;DR I got my student expelled because she sent me inappropriate text messages and for fear that it might damage my reputation as a teacher.

EDIT : I am from Indonesia. And a healthy teacher-student relationship outside of school is encouraged. There is no specific rule against giving your phone number to your students. But I decided it was for the best since we're dealing with different types of students with different issues which may or may not hinder their learning proccess in class. I even created a WA group for my class for after school discussions about certain school-related subjects like tests, etc etc.

EDIT 2 : The reason why I created the Whatsapp group was because I wanted to encourage my students to practice their English more. One of the biggest problem every English Teacher in non English-Speaking Countries is dealing with is the fact that their students can only practice English in class. They do not speak it outside of school, which is hindering their progress. The school principal know about this and have no problem with it. 
Now come to think of it, I should have got a new number to give them. In my 5 years as a teacher never have I experienced such incidents like this. Well I guess I've learnt my lessons now.",119,68,0.72

My sister in-law heard that they got an opening and she asked me to put in a good word for her, since she wants to work at a place like the one I've talked about. My boss saw that she had applied and sent me a message saying he wanted to talk to me about her application when I had a moment (wanting me to be a reference, I'm guessing). 

I don't like my SIL and I don't want her to work there. She's possibly the most arrogant, self-centered and hateful person I've met. The way she's talked about her previous work places makes me think she's unprofessional (laughs about calling in sick to go shopping, goes into detail on things she shouldn't tell anyone else, etc). I generally don't dislike anyone, but I usually choose to, as tactfully as I can, avoid the ""non-mandatory"" family gatherings she attends. She thinks we're friends, but I'm struggling to just stay civil with her, and that's only because my wife's relationship with her sister is strained as it is and she's really trying to be close with her sister. 

The thing is that SIL really needs the job, though. She's just past 25, still living with her mother (who can't really afford having her there mooching all the time) and plans to move out as soon as she gets a job. My wife thinks it would be good for her to work for a serious company and says she'll probably change. 

I'm torn because my reasons for wanting to tell them she sucks are mostly selfish. I dont know for sure she'd do it poorly, and maybe she'd be fine. I can easily tell my boss that she's qualified for the position, which is true. Where do I put my loyalty? My wife's family? Where I work? My own selfish reasons?

I heard about a grandparent class from a similarly pregnant coworker, and the link she sent me for the class looked very informative. The class focuses on childcare practices that might've changed in the past decades since the grandparents had kids. 

Hoping to cut down the amount of misconceptions and battles we'd have to fight against outdated advice after the kiddo is born, we signed both sets of parents up. Cost of the class is $50/set of parents.

We told them about the class in our respective family group chat - telling them the date and giving them the course description. Both sets of parents had similar negative reaction, mainly saying the class is a waste of money and unnecessary, trying to get us to cancel to save the money. Now all 3 families aren't in that tight of financial situation where $100 would break the bank, and we definitely didn't expect them to fork over $50 for the class.

After being insistent that they attend, I think we've finally settled the matter, but they still maintain that we should've asked them for their opinion first. 

Given how unexpectedly negative the whole experience was, it got me and the wife wondering if we were assholes for not consulting them first, or are our parents just playing the part of the frugal first generation immigrants well?

My parents are currently separated and might be getting a divorce. My mom is letting my dad keep our house as well as everything with it. The car, furniture, TVs. Everything. I've decided I want to stay with my dad only because I don't want to leave home and I fear my moms new (possible)  boyfriend is homophobic (I'm openly gay).

My dad is always crying for my mom to come back, but he doesn't realize why she left him. She left because he isn't a very good husband to her (her words not mine) and he keeps asking me to call her and try and get her to come back home, but honestly I don't really care. I only call my mom to come and hang out with me or bring food, not to bring up her and my dads business. She left because she wasn't happy and I don't want her to come back if she isn't happy with him.

I'm beginning to want to leave my dad too because he's always yelling at me to do things like cleaning the house or picking up after the dogs, but I feel he should get off his ass and help out too instead of yelling at me to do everything. I'm always cleaning so I feel tired all the time. 

This morning my dad got me up and yelled at me to get ready to go somewhere with my mom. This was the last straw for me and I blew up when I was getting into the shower. I told him ""FYI mom was gonna leave you when I turn 18 anyways."" This pissed him off and I just ignored him all morning. My mom told me I was TA for saying that but I feel he deserved it for treating me and her so bad.

249,Asshole,"So I had to go shopping with my sister yesterday for flip-flops at Old Navy. It was *supposed* to only take 5 minutes, so I agreed to come. It turned out they didn’t have her size, so we had to make a 30 minute detour to DSW. 

I was standing next to her in line, and out of boredom I asked “Why do you need new flip-flops if you already have a pair that fit?” She got upset with me and said “Well why do you need to buy new video games if you already have ones that you like?” 

I was trying to tell her that one of those things is an article of clothing and the other is a form of entertainment, which makes her comparison make no sense. She said “Shoes are a necessity. Video games are not.” So I said “Shoes *are* a necessity, but buying new shoes when you already have ones the fit *isn’t* necessary.”

She just continued to be upset with me for the rest of the day, and I really can’t tell who’s at fault here. I know it’s probably me.",49,67,0.77

A- girl with bad hygiene 

A is in my class and she constantly complains to me about people don't want to be next to her. One of the major reasons for this is, to put it bluntly her hygiene is absolutely terrible. Her hair is extremely greasy, she smells very bad, she has a lot of gunk under her fingernails etc.

So there is this app called tellonym where people can send anonymous messages to other people. On this app someone sent a message telling her (gently) to perhaps wash her hair more often. However, A has a massive 'I'm not like other girls' complex and responded to this message by saying that she's 'not like all the other girls' who put effort into their appearance and how she didn't have to 'conform to society' etc. 

The problem is that she keeps asking me why nobody wants to be near her and I just want to know if I wbta if I told her (nicely of course) that it's because she needs have better hygiene. I know that if I tell her she will probably listen to me, but I don't want to be rude and upset her.

My name is very unique and exotic, I knew that some kids were slightly racist in the neighborhood where this happened, so I did not want to be a target of bullying. I was too insecure to own myself \[nowadays I love my name so don't worry!\]

So this guy asks me what's my name, I tell him my real name, he said he didn't hear it, so for some reason I come up with ""Julien""

I asked her how she felt about it and she admitted that she didn’t like the idea at all, which I get, so I decided to try a medication again that I know makes me sick (desmopressin for anyone with similar problems) I gave up after a week of waking up feeling sick and was honest that it wasn’t going well and I’m choosing to go back to the disposable products until something better comes up; she then ignores me and skirts around the conversation until she said that she likes me and understands it’s not my fault but still doesn’t like the idea of me wearing products.

258,Not the A-hole,"My friend, let’s call her Trisha, and I have been really close since we were both five years old. We're in our late twenties now. We have gone through many life stages together, and even lived with each other during college. We haven’t always seen eye to eye but generally have a great time and really love each other.

Since graduation, Trisha has traveled all over the world, first supporting herself by teaching English and then eventually starting an online business. I don’t want to give too many details away, but think “boss babe” type business, lots of emojis on social media, etc. It’s not an MLM but her posts have the feel of that. I have had to unfollow her posts because I do find their frequency excessive and their tone grating, but I have tried to be a supportive friend and applaud her on how committed she is and how hard she’s been working.

Trisha has come back to our home country after being abroad for a year, and she has been talking about visiting me soon. I have told her that I am really looking forward to seeing her, but I do need to know well in advance when to expect a houseguest. She has never given me a straight answer regarding when she plans to visit. This is annoying. I have a full-time job and other pursuits and like to plan in advance as much as possible.

I’ve been talking with some friends who live in the city that Trisha is currently in, and they’re all very frustrated with her. The friend who she is currently staying with has expressed anger and frustration that, despite her wishes, her home has appeared in Instagram videos of Trisha’s for her business. Another friend, Sally, is very upset that Trisha has been in town for a week and has not made any mention of it to her.

I feel like if Trisha wants to come visit me for a few days, I am expecting her to step away from her work and focus on catching up. I would be taking time off work and expecting her to do the same. I am also thinking of asking her to get a hotel or an Airbnb when she comes to see me, because I don’t want her filming in my apartment or sprawling out and making it into a home office. The idea of that stresses me out and makes me feel angry, I think because I resent her from being a really unresponsive friend all year (taking days to respond to messages then responding with one word, talking endlessly about “the biz” and how much money she’s making when we finally do get to talking, etc).

Anyway, WIBTA if I confronted her about how I think she is a workaholic and is being a terrible friend, and if I tell her that she needs to either take time away from her work or rent an apartment or hotel she can use as her own personal office space?

My older brother has a 9 year old son Tim who is really into baseball. My brother is divorced and the mom isn’t around much. 

Tim has a game coming up this weekend and I over heard my brother telling Tim that he won’t be able to make it to his game because he has to work.

Afterwards I walked over to my brother and told him that I was willing to drive Tim to his game and stay at his game. 

My brother told me that he wasn’t comfortable with me driving Tim because of my “history”. (My brother has never really said much about my DUI except when we were both drunk and he said that it really worried him and he was scared for me.)

I got upset and I told him that that was a year ago and I regret it and I would never put Tim in harm’s way but he wouldn’t listen to me and told me to calm down. Tim walked in at the point so I just shut up and walked away.

260,Not the A-hole,"I work in an office building with a rather well-paying job that took several years of education to get (pay is in the low 6-figures). It's a great job that makes me feel like I'm doing more than just paperwork. Bottom-line is, I really love this job and probably won't be able to find anything else like it.

I'm eating lunch with some co-workers, and this girl from a neighboring department joins us. After a while, when other people are breaking up into their own little conversation bubbles, she turns to me and says she likes how I look. I say 'Thanks' and then go back to eating. She touches my shoulder and says ""You alright?"" I nod 'Yeah' and go back to eating and listening to other people talk.

On another day, she says, 'Wow you keep in shape. You must work out' (which I do). I say 'Thanks' and go back to lunch. She gets closer and says, 'So how do you do it?' I just keep giving short, direct answers. Point is, I don't have any interest in dating co-workers. There's a saying **Don't shit where you eat**. I've heard of people getting fired when workplace relationships turn sour and things get awkward or hostile. I love this job, and I don't wanna do anything to compromise it.

Third time this happens (on another day), she asks me when I get off work (schedule is publicly posted so she could find out if she really wanted to). I say 'Probably when I feel like shooting myself'. That was a baaaaaad joke but she laughed anyways and said I was funny. Then she put her hand on my knee. I gave out this awkward laugh and shifted away. She asked me if everything was alright and I looked at her and said 'Maybe you shouldn't do that again' We just stared at each other for a while before she got up and left.

Later I heard she was telling people I couldn't take a compliment and that I made her feel 'uncomfortable'. Some of my co-workers didn't believe it, mostly because they were there, but the others weren't so they just believed what they heard first. I went to her to talk about it but she said I made it clear that I didn't want anything to do with her and to leave her alone otherwise I was 'harassing' her.

The moment she said that word, that set off red alarms in my head, and I headed to HR. I gave them my side of the story, and I heard later on that they interviewed co-workers that I said was there at each incident. Afterwards, they said the investigation was closed and that no further action will be taken but they will keep a record of this for future incidents.

When the girl heard about this, she was *pissed*. She said I was trying to destroy her career, that I was taking advantage of her (she never explained how), and how hard she worked to get here. She started breaking down and crying, everyone was looking at me. I just sat there, eyes wide, until she and another co-worker left the room together. I understand the irony of the situation.

We were at a bar this weekend with my old Army buddies and she was sipping on a ginger beer (non-alcoholic, like a fancy gingerale) and we were all having a good time.

She did it. He expected one of the guys to do it, so he was really impressed and gave us $200 he had in his wallet.

I went to a big blue box store for a few things with my teenagers. I brought my own bags and used the self checkouts. I also used mobile pay so I don’t have to deal with paper receipts. (That’s basically the only reason I use it, though it is convenient to not have to carry a wallet.) The self checkout station is fairly enclosed, and they have an employee overseeing the customers. They also have cameras at each checkout. Both of these things are for loss prevention, I assume. I purchased a couple of things that didn’t fit in the bags, but I had brought my own bags anyway. As I was leaving, another employee walked up to me and didn’t even say a word, just started looking in my cart and holding out her hand. I knew my rights, so I said, “I don’t need to show you anything. Have a good day.” She tried to stand in front of me and said that it was store policy that people show receipts for unbagged merchandise. (Technically, I guess all of my merchandise was unbagged since I didn’t use their plastic bags.) I pointed to the self checkout I’d used and told her I don’t have a paper receipt since I used their specifically branded mobile pay app. I then told her store policy was not law and walked out to my vehicle. She looked like she wanted to escalate it, but I left without further incident. 

It would be a pain for me to have to pull out my phone, open and wait for the app to load, then pull up the e-receipt.

So i walked down to the bus, picked up the can, and knocked on her door.

My sister has a friend, whom I got into a huge fight with because I called her out for being racist trash. Well yesterday was this lady’s birthday and she spent all day with her. 

Well yesterday was an incredibly hard day for me. I’ve been extremely depressed due to intense loneliness, I only have one friend other than my sister and I don’t see her very often because she’s busy with her kids. I’ve really been feeling like I have nobody and it’s absolutely soul crushing. 

So cut to this morning. I figured that, since my sister spent all day with her friend yesterday and I didn’t bother her at all, I’d go over and hang with her today. Maybe buy some lunch and just talk. But I asked my sister and she said no because her friend and their mutual friend who came from out of town are going to be there today. I asked if I could join and just not say anything but just be there so I’m not alone and she said no.

I started crying and told her what’s been going on and how I thought about doing something stupid all day yesterday, and she said she’s really sorry I’m feeling like this but this friend said no more having me around when they’re together. I told my sister that’s wrong to choose this friend over me, especially since I do all of her shopping and anything else that requires getting out of the car since she’s handicapped and is a fall risk. She said she’s not the bad guy and she’s sorry but no. I support my sister emotionally more than anyone else in our family. I need her today. 

So I told her fuck it, I’m going. I’m not saying anything about anything to this lady. I just need to not be alone and I have nobody else. I feel bad inviting myself but I cannot go through another day like yesterday again. AITA? Do we all suck? I’m ashamed of my behavior. I just need someone, and she’s really all I have. :/

EDIT for repeated sentence

UPDATE sorry this was so quick but she just called me. She said she’s sorry and will come and pick me up so I don’t have to walk there. I think the thing for me here was that I give all of myself every time to my sister whenever she needs me. The ONE time I ask my sister to be there for me in return she did this.

I was caught off guard, she didn't look the part, and my friend hadn't mentioned any age gap when I asked stuff about her. So for the next hour or so I sort of drifted to the other side of the bed, doing my best to keep her away while she tried approaching me.

I was so done when I dropped her off that I didn't bother talking or saying goodbye. I removed her on Snap immediately, only for my friend to tell me she had texted her telling my friend I was ""weird"". I met up with said friend and the rest of the group, and explained in detail what she was like. 

One friend didn't believe me and thought I was an asshole for talking shit about a girl like that. Was that friend right? I still tell the uncensored version above if I'm asked, but is this defined as shit talking and am I an asshole here?",20,30,0.79

286,Not the A-hole,"Okay a little bit of a back story. I started moving in with my boyfriend when he was living alone in this house. The house is from his parents but they don't live there. 4 months into the relationship and living there his sisters moves back in (without our consent, parents just decided that it was okay for us, it was not). First it was fine but she didn't have a job so she would be in her room, eat from our groceries and doesn't pay rent. She just opens our bedroom door while we were having sex. 

Her parents pay everything for her but for my fiance they pay nothing. I was getting annoyed but I could still handle it. Last saterday they came over and were furious. They said that all the animals in the house needed to leave (one Chihuahua and one pup and a cat who you never see). Next day he got a text saying the animals need to leave and if that doesn't happen your fiancé need to leave too. I was pissed. Next day we got a text saying we should put them on the market. Excuse me wtf is wrong with you. I have my cat for 9 years and my dog for 7 I'm not leaving them. Same day his mom said to him I won't speak to you till you have your diploma. THE SAME DAY they ask if his sister can borrow his car which I pumped full with fuel and he gets his dad's car (minivan which I can't drive and I'm using the car the most!)

His parents are and have always been shit to him and his sister is the best they can have and she is perfect. She lies to my face and talks behind my back.

So my payback will be that we will leave this house shortly but everything in the house is ours. For example the couch, TV, internet, table, every single thing in the kitchen. So when we leave they have nothing, just an empty house. I think they deserve that after everything they did to him.

What I described are just the last couple of days. I can go on and on.

My fiancé says I'm evil. WIBTA if we just left in one day without telling them?

As such we've had raccoons and skunks wander through the property many times. 

My MIL and SIL decided (without asking us) that they'd join us and found the condo right next door on Airbnb. My MIL drives the only auto driving Tesla I've ever seen so I about fell over when I saw what had to be her car in the parking lot. Yesterday was thier first day and my MIL spent the entire day reminding us how we don't make enough money to have kids and live in a ""proper"" neighborhood and that I was selfish for not taking the job my wife's step dad had offered. Then she berated my wife all day for her food choices. And to top it off she wanted to argue about current affairs. We had wanted to hike but my wife got sick so we were completely stuck.

At like 8pm, MIL finally decided she was going to her Airbnb. I had just come in from the trash and there was a skunk in the parking lot. I didn't say anything because I was terrified MIL Might stay longer. MIL left and in like two seconds we heard a piercing shriek. I told my wife not to go out there because of the skunk. One of the permanent residents heard the scream and came out and was coaching my MIL to stay calm but from our balcony it looked like my MIL was backed against a wall with Pepe l'pu staring her down. It was one of the funniest things I've ever seen so I started laughing so hard. My wife asked me if I knew the skunk had been there so I said yes and that MIL deserved it after she'd been such a pain all day. After a couple minute ""stand off"" the skunk got bored and wandered off info the darkness and MIL didn't get sprayed.

Me - 20, lives with mum and J, has anxiety

Mum - in her 50s and has had some health complications recently

Last night mum was in bed and called J, asking him to come get me, and told him exactly why she needed me.

J came charging downstairs calling ""\[my name\]! \[my name\]! mum's heart is hurting! hurry!""

I flipped out, I ran upstairs, phone in hand, ready to dial 999 and get an ambulance over to our place ASAP, and barged into mum's room. Mum looked really shocked and just asked if I had the tablets. I asked what she meant.

Mum said that she had told J she had heartburn and needed me to get her some anti heartburn tablets. She had said it was heartburn and that she just needed some anti heartburn meds. She said she had explicitly told J not to do exactly what he did (charge downstairs saying mum was having heart pain). J was stood there laughing at me, calling it a prank, while I was still processing and panicking, as I thought mum was having a heart attack or something.

I went to the bathroom, got mum's meds, and came back and yelled at J. I told him he was an idiot, what he'd done was stupid and he should never make jokes about that kind of thing. I laid into J for a solid couple of minutes, and he was crying because I rarely yell, and never at him. Even once he was crying, I didn't stop until mum told me to.

Mum said that was enough and I should just leave J to go back to bed. Once he was gone she said I was way too harsh, he's just a kid, he didn't know what he was doing. She says I shouldn't have yelled at him, but it felt justified in the moment.

294,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account. 

So for the past couple of years my dad always took the family on trips to different countries in Europe, which I always liked when I was smaller. We would go to some nice places and I enjoyed just being in another country each summer. 

Fast forward to last year, he told me (M16) and my brother (M20) that we are going to less exotic places and he would like is to show some historic cities, since we have grown up. I tried to convince him otherwise but he said that it will be alright and we will enjoy it. 

Last year I realized just how wrong he was. Don't get me wrong, I really appreciate that he takes us and pays for everything but I kind of found it boring to go to museums and fancy buildings waiting in lines for hours to get in. Still, I tried to show him that I enjoyed it. 

Also, we had a lot of conflicts on that holiday. My father is as stubborn man and likes to take control of us. He also gets stressed if something doesn't work out and he mostly ends up shouting. 

This year, I had a part-time job at home from which I learn a lot and pays well too. He decided we would come to Russia and this trip for me is basically a disaster. 

I would like to say that I still appreciate that he took me here but I just can't enjoy it. The same drill every day. Wake up strictly at 8, go and have breakfast, visit a museum or building, have lunch somewhere, go visit another one or just randomly go through the city looking in souvenir shops. (something I really hate) He would also be angry if something went wrong or I tried to tell him that I didn't want to go to one of these places. 

After the first two days I started to grow frustrated. I hated not having the choice where to go and I found most of the places very boring. When he started getting mad, I argued with him and told him what problems I had. He said that everyone else enjoyed them and that I should too. 

Now it's the 5th day, we still have many to go and it's the same thing every day. I know I sound like a whiny kid but I just don't enjoy these trips anymore. The other do, so I thought I would tell my dad after we got home and some time passed that I wouldn't like to go next year. He sees that I don't enjoy these and probably wouldn't have a problem with it. I hope. 

Also I feel like I am wasting time here. Back home I have the job through which I would learn a lot and meet people who will later on help me with my career. Also, I have a robotics competition coming up and I feel like I left my teammate alone for the weeks prior to the competition where the most preparation would be needed. 

So would I be the asshole if I told him that next year I would rather stay at home and work/study instead of coming along? (to a trip that I wouldn't enjoy)",53,98,0.92
295,Not the A-hole,"In my country, some students pay tuition and some don't. It is regulated by a point system on a ranking list. Your points are a sum of your high school grades and entrance exam results. 

You can have the maximum of 100  points. The number of free tuition students is limited. For example, the first 50 students on the List get free tuition, the next 30 have to pay for tuition, and everyone else is not admitted at all. 

Anyway, you cannot be a free tuition student twice, at two unis. 

This is poorly regulated, though. Your student status is written on your high school diploma but many students that drop out go to their old high school and get a new diploma. 

Free tuition students also get discounted food at student restaurants, almost free rooms at student dorms etc

Well, to get to my point... There is ""Anna"". We went to the same high school, and she was 1 year older than me. Last summer, I met Anna at a bar and she told me she was going to try for the same university as me. She told me she had already studied at another university the previous year, but realized it was not what she really wanted so she decided to quit and start this one. 

So after the Entrance Exam, I looked at the ranking list and realized that Anna was admitted as a free tuition student. I asked her how that was possible, and she told me that she went to her old high school to get a new diploma. 

We got into an argument over it. 

Anyway, just before the Enrollment Day, I  went to the Administration Office, and told them about this issue. They told me there was no proof but they would investigate. 


So I forgot about all of this, until 3 months ago when Anna, who was now my classmate, asked me whether I had called the Administration Office to tell them about her diploma, in front of others. I said yes, because I thought that it was unfair for her to get all benefits TWICE, while someone else has to struggle. 

Apparently, they had called her in, asked her about it, she told them it was a lie, they told her they had to investigate etc

And now, Anna stopped talking to me. But it's not the worst that happened. Other classmates stopped talking to me too, even those that were never close to Anna and even those that pay for their tuition. One of them asked me if I enjoyed ruining other peoples' lives and one said I was an evil person. And they now talk to me only ""formally"", and I swear I can hear them call me ""b*tch"" when they think I can't hear. 

I talked to my friends about it and... *they agree that what I did was a really bad thing to do*. Only my mom supports me. 

I thought I was doing the right thing. But now I feel a little guilty. I mean, isn't it better for someone else to have free tuition (the person that lacked 0.50 points) than Anna who a) practically cheated her way into free tuition, b) has already been a free tuition student before...?

We didn't live together, but she spent a lot of time at my flat and had quite a number of possessions with her, mostly clothes, makeup and shoes. She took most of it when we finished, but also left a fair amount behind. 

Now, for over two months I text her about once a week asking if she wanted to come get her stuff or for me to drop it off. To begin with, she kept saying she'd come for it ""soon"" but was a perpetual no show. She'd tell me not to drop it off, assure me she'd pick it up one day that week, not show up, repeat. I guess she got as sick of that game as I did because she eventually just stopped replying.

298,Not the A-hole,"My children are 17 and 14 respectively, and I’m hoping the fact that they’re teenagers is the reason for their incredibly shitty behavior. 

My husband, before he met me, had a wife and a newborn baby that passed away in Canada due to hazardous road conditions that resulted  in a 4 car smash up. No one was at fault, it was a horrific disaster, and my husband was devastated as a result and fell into alcoholism to cope. 

I had my own trauma from the past, and similarly turned to alcoholism to cope. It was at an AA meeting where we met, 20 years ago almost to the day now, and we slowly started to heal together here in the US. 

I have always been incredibly respectful of my husbands last wife and child. I like to joke that I’m keeping her seat warm until my husband enters heaven. I’ve had too much loss and hurt in my life to feel jealousy like this, and tbh- I am so damaged that I just feel lucky that I got to actually feel love in this world and that my husband could open his beautiful heart to me. 

We had two children- two sons. We’d never told them about my husbands wife or baby, because it’s a part of my husbands life that he keeps under lock and key. 
He has never healed from his grief, and therapy etc has helped him only to a degree. 

My mother in law told the kids this Sunday gone, as she decided it was ‘time for them to know’. She didn’t consult us before telling them, and certainly didn’t do it in our presence. 

Since then my sons have been making the most disgusting dead baby jokes, they’ve been prodding their dad asking why we’d never told them, and instead of approaching the topic with respect they’re acting like we’ve kept a secret affair family from them or something. 

My 14 y/o went on to say to me in private, thank goodness not in front of his father, that he was glad my husbands previous family was dead. I broke and yelled at him, and told him it was the most disgusting thing I’d ever heard him say. I asked where his anger was coming from, and he burst forth that we were shitty parents for keeping secrets. 

He told me that it made ‘so much sense’ why we were abnormal, why we don’t drink, why we are so boring and quiet, why my husband is panicky around roads, etc. 

the two are pretty heartbroken, and I feel like we have just destroyed a part of our children’s lives as a result of us staying quiet.

299,Not the A-hole,"I'm 29M, gay, and my family sucks. I've always had a difficult relationship with my parents, my mother is a control freak and a helicopter parent, my father thinks a good father must be authoritarian, cold and distant, both of them have always treated me miserably in order to ""teach me strength"", they never told me they love me or that they're proud of me. My siblings and I have a bad relationship, my brother bullied me most of our lives and my sister dislikes and ignores me.

We aren't religious, we come from a big city in a modern country, gay people are everywhere, including among my parents' and siblings' friends. However, I chose not to come out to my family or tell them I'm seeing someone because I didn't want a potentially large topic of conversation. I don't want them asking me anything about my personal life, I don't want them knowing the person I'm with, I don't want them butting in.

I've been with my boyfriend for about 9 years. We met in college, moved in together after graduation and we're now engaged. I was able to keep all of this a secret because I live 400km away from my parents, they never visit me, and I rarely go home.

Last week, my SO and I hired a seemingly random photographer. A few days later, my mother called me and started freaking out and shouting at me about being gay and getting married without telling anyone. She did exactly what I was worried about - telling me she'll come over and help with the wedding, asking who he is, who his parents are and when her and my dad will meet them etc. Then my aunt called to cry to me on the phone. Apparently, the photographer is her friend's son and while talking to his mom about this gig, they figured out I was her friend's nephew. I usually have a good relationship with my aunt, but I never told her anything because I knew she'd tell my mom right away, which is exactly what she did.

So now, EVERYONE is upset with me, parents, aunts, cousins, grandparents... Some because I never shared this part of my life with them, some because none of them are invited to the wedding. The extended family think I'm behaving like an asshole and they want to be invited to the wedding. My mother keeps asking me what my SO's last name is, because she wants to stalk him and his parents on Facebook, to check if ""they're politically appropriate"" for me. She's called me more times in the past 3 days than since I moved away from home 11 years ago. She keeps texting me that I'll never see her or my dad again if I don't include them.

It was really cool getting to know her, our chats flow really well, we have a surprising amount of common interests, and we've even made a couple of flirty comments through texts after sending each other pictures (nothing risque). We finally decided to meet up last Saturday at 6 PM at a local gastropub. I get there a little early and wait until 6:15 to text her to ask if she's going to arrive soon, and I wait another half hour for a response. At this point I walk out of the gastropub and start heading home. At the time, more than anything I was confused. I was driving home when I got a call from the girl, she was profusely apologizing to me saying she ""forgot"" about our date. I ask her if she got held up at work or if there was a family issue going on and she said no, she left to go on a shopping trip with another one of our other mutual friends at about 5:30 so she was shopping an hour away when she realized she had a date to go to. She asks me if we can still meet up later that night but I decide I want to stay in for the night, I thanked her for her honesty and I said we should just be cool with each other. You know, just be civil because we have mutual friends and we don't want to break up those friendships either

She kept apologizing through texts and tried to call me a couple of times on Sunday to reschedule, but I just told her it's probably better for us to both move on. Monday morning, the friend that set us up called me to ask about what happened and why I'm not talking to her friend anymore. She believes that her friend made a legitimate mistake, and that I should give her a second chance. I tell her that I can't accept that someone could forget about a date if they truly wanted to see me. 

Maybe I'm being unsympathetic here, but for me if there's an event as important as a date with a person I like, that date will always be in the back of my head. I don't obsess over it, but it's there and it's something to look forward to. The only way I could forget about that date without any extenuating circumstances would be if I simply didn't care to remember.",55,125,0.98

I corrected her and she said ""then explain why George Bush served as president for all those years""  it took a minute but i figured out that she thought there was only 1 George Bush.  

I again corrected her.  I told her Bush Senior served before Clinton and Bush Junior served after.   She thought i was trolling her.   I asked her how Bush looked younger after Clinton.  She said ""plastic surgery ""   i asked about his wife.  Divorce and remarriage of course.

8 of our kids want to take part. Problem is: its a 2 week long hiking trip (10-20 km a day) and only one week camping at a campsite. No problem for most of them, but there's one girl that keeps us worrying. She's 16 yo and weights about 130 kg. There was a test event where everyone  carried their hiking Equipment + 5kg for community equipment. She maneged 5 km before quitting and calling her parents to get her home. 
The trip is in 3 weeks and i know that she cant make it. Problem is: If she stays somewhere and cant go on, nobody in her group does, because of the scout mindset and being a group bla bla...

306,Not the A-hole,"Hi redditors - a little background.  My boyfriend and his son have a very codependent relationship.  The father DOTES on his kid and never says no and lets him get away with just about anything.  When I am around, they usually remain in their own world of conversation, anecdotes, and annoying behaviors.  Also, kid still wants father to sleep in the same bed as him... Yes, he is 13 but that is another subreddit!

So, we just got back from a long weekend trip...a 4 hour drive where the kid literally deliberately farted the whole trip - seriously,  in the backseat, leaning back and pointing his ass towards the front, spreading his butt cheeks apart and farting then laughing and laughing.  Father did nothing but laugh and occasionally roll down the window, never once telling the kid to stop. 4 hours!

Fast forward to last night - we come back from a really nice dinner and kid deliberately stepped in front of me so he could separate me and his father, bent over and let a disgusting juicy one rip the laughed and laughed.  I had enough of this and various behaviors at this point and stated in an agitated voice ""C'mon dude, I am standing right behind you! and walked past both of them, upstairs and got into the shower to calm down.  I overheard dad telling his son that he wasn't earning any brownie points with me.

Look, I know we all fart...but I wasn't brought up to let em rip like that around everyone and especially doing it in a deliberate way - spreading his ass in the car?  Seriously...

307,Asshole,"I (28M) have an old friend (29F) whose friendship has become relatively low maintenance over the years, where at times months pass without us seeing each other. We still have infrequent communications by text/phone call, and whenever we do meet, it’s as though no time has passed – we catch each other up on life, commiserate about shitty things going on, and reminisce about old times (a healthy, functioning adult friendship, in my opinion). 

The past 12 months at work had been intense, I was travelling interstate for weeks and months at a time and was hardly ever in my home city. I saw my friend twice during that period (once for her birthday where I dropped in for dinner and had to leave early to attend another event, and again for my birthday where we had a one-on-one catch up).  I am now back in my home city, and life has returned to its normal pace.

About a month ago (June) I realised my friend hadn’t responded to my calls and text messages for about two months (April/May). It put it down to life being busy, but just to be sure I sent a text message and left a voice message along the lines of: “Not sure if you’re getting my calls/texts, but I haven’t heard from you in a while. I don’t want to seem neurotic, but are we cool?”. 

I expected a tongue in check response, but I was served a proper essay about being an absent friend, being generally selfish, and not making the time, and, because of that, she “needed a break” from me. She cited my leaving early from her last birthday as a major issue. It took the wind out of my sails. This was one of my oldest friends. I tried to call back as soon as I read the message, but the phone rang out. 

I sent back a pretty defensive text message asking her why she left it so long without saying anything, and apologising. It was angry in tone, I guess. I got nothing back. Today, I sent another text message, but this was a lot angrier in tone. I feel like I’m being cut out, and I’m can’t see how I am in the wrong. Am I missing something? 

I reached out to a mutual friend for an objective opinion, and he said I’m the asshole for not respecting that she “needs space”. I think this is a cop-out. We hardly see each other as it is, yet she needs more space. Am I being unreasonable?

Am I the Asshole?",55,58,0.87
308,Asshole,"Some backstory, this girl LOVES dying her hair. When I met her it was green. Since then it has been teal, blue, black, brown, blonde, red, pink, purple, multicolored, white; pretty much every color and shade I can think of outside of oranges. She’s a real life Romona Flowers, minus all the evil exes. 


The first reason she loves dying her hair is because she wants to be a hairdresser, and looks at this process as a sort of interest and practice for this. The second reason she does it is because she gets “bored” of a hair color after about a week or two and will want to change it. 


I don’t hate the concept of dying your hair, I’ve even done it myself twice in the past to non-contemporary colors. I don’t believe in any of that nonsense such as “people who dye their hair are just looking for attention” or anything like that. 


The first reason I don’t want her to dye her hair is because since the beginning of our relationship about a year ago, she’s wanted to grow her hair out. In the beginning she had shaved sides and enough up top to barely tie it up. It’s been cut once along the way to deal with some damage from all the dyeing, and now it’s around that short hair for girls, but medium long hair for boys range. The more she damages her hair, the more she’ll have to cut it. We both want her to grow her hair out longer, her more so than I even. It frustrates me that she doesn’t see how counterintuitive it is to keep bleaching and dyeing your hair, then having to get it cut. She could have shoulder length or longer by now had she quit this habit. 


The second reason I don’t want her to dye her hair is because I feel that a lot of the colors she chooses are unattractive or tacky. Bright hot pinks, dull barfy greens, ultra light blues, whatever. I think midtown’s or darker colors are better, and overly bright or ugly colors are really meh. I’ve made her aware of my preferences, but she seems to not really care about how I feel. She recently had very dark blue/purple, it looked almost black. This hair color was perfect imo, my second favorite of any color she’s ever had just behind her natural color, a light reddish brown. 


And then yesterday she bleached her hair again, and is looking to dye it some bright light pink color or something like that. She was at a great color, and she could have kept it like that as she grew it out, but she kept it for like not even two weeks. 


We’re currently having a tiny spat about it. I wouldn’t call it an argument, hair isn’t the end-all be-all or anything, but we both feel that the other is being inconsiderate. She feels like it is unfair for her to have to not be able to dye her hair just because I don’t want her to or because I wouldn’t like the color. I feel that she should be able to limit the dyeing of her hair in order to reach our mutually shared wish for her to have longer healthier hair, and that she can still dye it every now and then to colors I enjoy. 


Am I the asshole? Is she? No asshole? Both assholes? Interested to hear the answer.


Edit1: It should be noted that she still wants to grow her hair out, that priority hasn’t changed; she’s just not acting in the best interest of that goal. I am also not forcing her any which way, I’m just voicing my frustrations to her which has caused the aforementioned “spat”.


Edit2: an additional reason I’m against it is that she doesn’t have the finances to be dyeing her hair. She’s currently unemployed, and I pay for all our dates. She uses her money on snacks, vape pods, and hair dye. No real savings to speak of. She doesn’t have the money for any hair repair kits or such like olaplex either. We’re considering moving in together in the future, and I wouldn’t want to do that with someone who cares more about the color of their hair than having an emergency fund or money for rent.

Final Edit: Perhaps it was my mistake for using hyperbole with the word mad, but it seems a lot of commenters are making assumptions. Perhaps parts of my story were accidentally misleading, or maybe I left out too much information. This isn’t an ongoing argument that is a super serious crux of our relationship. I’m not repeatedly telling her I hate her hair / etc. in order to control her. I am in no way making any ultimatums to her about this issue, or any other action in an effort to force her to do whatever I want her to do. I understand that it’s her decision, I am only venting a minor frustration on the decision she made. I’m not sure even with all the semantic changes that should be made or additional information Reddit would care though, it seems most feel I don’t even get to have an opinion, so ITA",206,101,0.77

Been lurking now I'm posting.

A little backstory: I (24f) just moved a few months ago to a new city. I work from home and have a two bedroom apartment where one acts as an office. I wanted to live alone for that reason.

I'm new to living in the city but I have friends here so I'm social/know people who live around me. After settling in for a few months, I decided to start dating. I met a guy on a dating app and we hit it off. We've been seeing each other for the last three going on four months. The first month, we hung out in public pretty exclusively ie restaurants, bars, festivals/events, etc. He's walked me back to my building and I walked myself inside.

A month and a half in, we started to hang out at his apartment. Both after we went out and then as dates. We'd just watch movies, eat takeout, talk, etc.

He has a roommate: a friend from college. His roommate frequently hangs out with a friend who lives in their building and we typically try to schedule apartment dates then. There have been times when his roommate has come home early effectively cutting date night short. We’ve just kind of dealt with it.

About a week after we made our relationship official and exclusive (just recently), I decided to invite him to my apartment. We walk in and he asked where my roommate was. I told him I didn’t have one and I lived alone. He asked since when; I said since forever. He asked why I didn’t tell him so I told him my reasoning.

As a woman in a new city, whose family is states away, I didn’t want to let a stranger know that I lived alone because you never know who you’re telling. I wanted to trust someone before I revealed that vulnerability.

He was upset because we spent so many dates at his apartment making plans around his roommate and having his roommate walk in on us when we could have been completely alone at mine. I tried explaining my reasoning and he only kinda got it but also said he was upset I lied.

I never mentioned a roommate. Never said I had one, just didn’t invite him up to my apartment. So I guess it’s a lie by omission, I’ll admit that. But I didn’t set out to lie, I was just trying to be cautious.

We finished our date though he was a bit short with me. He’s also been short on text conversations and we haven’t made plans when we’ve been seeing each other two or three times a week.

So am I the asshole for not telling the guy I’ve been seeing that I live alone?",618,1055,0.95

1. I've run this by several friends, who are of course on my side. I've also run it by my divorce attorney, who is also on my side (she actually told me to tell him to go piss up a rope and any judge in the state would throw it out of court if he were to try to ""enforce"" it). But, I'm hoping to gain a deeper understanding of why my ex is so insistent on me changing my last name. I've asked him and he doesn't respond to my question, except to say ""change it"".
2. We were married for 10 years. My degree and my professional life is all with under my current last name, which is a super common last name (think Smith). We've been divorced for over a year now. Also, no kids together. I literally just don't want to go through the hassle. I live and work overseas, so it's on my passports, my foreign visas, all banking/financial/insurance records, etc.
3. When we first filed he was adamant that I changed my name (things were contentious for a while), I said I would think about it and I had it added to our divorce decree to keep my options open. In my state it's more difficult and costly to change your name if it isn't in your decree. A few months after the divorce things were amicable again, to the point that he even asked me to do his taxes for him, because he doesn't know how. I would never have someone I didn't trust do my taxes, plus we seemed to be on good terms otherwise. Even had another conversation about the last name thing and he apologized for being an ass about it and said he didn't care if I kept the last name.
4. Fast forward to yesterday, we haven't spoken/messaged in several months, and I get message from him asking if I had changed my name yet, because it's been over a year and it was in the divorce decree. I replied, no. Then he spouts off about having taken my name off of all the things I wanted my name removed from (duh, that's in his best interest too), and how I needed to get that shit done. I said, it's not of his concern, my name doesn't affect him in the slightest. He just kept coming back with, change it, change it, etc. I left it at, no, it's none of your concern. Then today I get a message that he will be in contact with his lawyer and to expect being served with papers. In my eyes, that's just a waste of money on his part.
5. I'm a bit lost as to what is driving this. It's either because he's a selfish asshole (took me several years to FINALLY come to that conclusion and get out) or possibly his current girlfriend is behind it. She used to be my friend when I was married to him - when I moved overseas and we got divorced she swooped in. Now any time she runs into any of my friends, she tries talking shit about me to them. So I'm assuming she has some unresolved beef with me, or is just really insecure.
6. Anyway, am I the asshole for keeping the last name? Any insight from the guys on why it's such a big deal? We literally live thousands of miles away from each other, aren't friends on social media, no clue why this is such a thing.",83,46,0.86

Now, that might be too far now that he's an adult. He's not doing chores around the house reliably, so I get my dad yelling at him even if it's getting exhausting and isn't really necessary. But he's recently started comparing my brother to me. ""Your sister got straight A's, why can't you?"" Or, ""OP does her chores and she's two years younger, why is that?""

The thing is, he acts like 1) it was easy and 2) it's comparable. I worked very hard during school to maintain my GPA and I work until I sweat cleaning the house. It isn't something my brother should just be capable of. Also, my brother is autistic. What works for me will not work for him and comparing my achievements to his will do nothing but make him feel bad-his brain doesn't work the way mine does. It's just not fair.

I told my dad I didn't appreciate these new, constant (daily) comparisons. He told me I have no right to object since he's not insulting me, and since it's his son it has nothing to do with me so I can shut up. But he's literally comparing him TO ME.

I kindly said, “I understand you’re pregnant but I have a couple health issues that make me very tired and dizzy so I would like to stay put. There are other free seats”.

323,Asshole,"I'm white and my wife is black. She teaches kindergarten and I teach high school. I honestly think being a teacher makes it so much harder to find a name. There are very few names that don't immediately remind us of students or parents. 

My wife has always loved a name that is very strongly tied to black males. It's a family name on her side and means a lot to her. Let's use the name Jayshawn for reference. She suggested it and I told her that I didn't really like it but would be okay with naming him Shawn or Sean if it was really important to her but that I didn't like Jay. I previousy had shut down Sean/Shawn because of a student we had and my wife asked why I was suddenly okay with Shawn. I told her that I still didn't love it but was willing to compromise. I said that I'm sure our son will erase the current connotation I had with the name. 

She accused me of trying to ""white wash"" the name she suggested and asked why I didn't like Jayshawn. I told her I just didn't like it and she asked if it was because I thought the name was ghetto. I told her that I didn't think it was ghetto but it's mostly associated with black men and our child wouldn't just be black. He would be equal parts white and should have a name that reflects that. She said that my cultural background would be passed on with my last name and giving him a name like Jayshawn would be honoring both cultures. I disagreed.

We were lucky enough to have our insurance completely cover a certain genetic test that would allow us to find out the gender extremely early so we decided to have a gender reveal party (cliche, I know...). Well we invited a lot of friends and family to this, but one friend in particular said she wouldn't come because she was having trouble getting pregnant and that it was hard for her to be happy for us given her circumstances...no big deal right?...Fast forward to now...she is pregnant and all of a sudden wants everyone to be happy for her and wants to talk all the time about her child and expects everyone to be happy for her. Maybe I'm a spiteful A*hole but I'm having a tough time being happy for her.  AITA?

Edit: Maybe I should have included a few small details. 1) I haven't congratulated her *YET* ...I fully intend to.
2) We struggled to get pregnant as well. So I fully sympathize with infertility.

325,Asshole,"So at like 5pm my girlfriend calls distressed: one of her family friends tragically passed away. I step away to call her for a bit and then she calls her parents and siblings and talks with them for a while. She texts to ask when I’m done with work, and I text back that I have a meeting with my boss at 6:30. Note: this is a little unusual; usually I get out of work at more like 5:30-5:45. My phone’s on do not disturb for the meeting, which I thought would be about 30 minutes. It ends up taking an hour and a half, and ends at about 8:00 pm. 

I get out of the meeting to a barrage of texts asking where I was and why I wasn’t responding. She texted “feeling good about having a boyfriend who goes missing when someone dies, aka you suck.” I call her to let her know I was on my way, and she says “don’t bother coming” and hangs up. She texted that I  should have told my boss “my girlfriend had a family friend die, I have to go.” 

Then she texted that she saw the real me, and has no desire to date someone like me anymore. We’ve been dating for about 8 months, and are both in college.

My ex and I split up about 2 years ago. While it was tough we manage to re remain civil with eachother for the sake of our daughter (4years old). We bought a car when we were together, a used Subaru Impreza, nothing fancy but in great condition. When we split we decided to share the car. Essentially the car is our daughters, it goes where she goes. This system has been working for the past 2 years but I'm at the point now where I'd like to have my own car, so on nights and weekends I don't have my daughter I can go camping, on dates, visit friends etc.

So I've suggested to my ex that it's time we think about selling the car or I would be willing to buy her out of her ""half"". She doesn't want to sell it, and she also says she doesn't have the money to buy my half out. So I said we should sell it to a 3rd party and split the money. She also doesn't want to do this as she won't be able to buy a car of equal quality with the money we get from selling it.

So would I be the asshole if I told her that it's too bad, we need to sell it so that I can buy my own?

Edit: just to clarify, my ex could afford another car if we sold the Subaru, she just can't afford another Subaru.",68,40,0.84
331,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account bc I like keeping my shit separate.

So I (18F) have a sister (15F) who means the world to me.  I say this to set the precedent that I don't bear any resentment towards her, it's just this situation.

Long story short: Had a skin condition that caused ugly cystic acne. This and untreated depression/anxiety made my early teens a spiral of self-hatred and frequent manic episodes of screaming, sobbing, and locking myself away so no one could see how ""hideous"" I was. I put chemicals on my face, refused to let my own family see me. A mess.

I  got treated for this and it got better.  I still have worse skin than my peers, but nothing like what it was, and my own appearance isnt a trigger anymore. Still, it can be a bit touchy.

My sister has  perfect skin, like natural foundation. We actually clown each other back and forth about it: She'll tease me about being jealous and having a ""54 step routine"" and I tell her I'll be the one laughing when we're 60 and she looks like a prune.

Recently she's been having skin troubles. Have you ever gotten those little red irritation bumps? She has 1, on her forehead. She has been complaining... a lot. Like, a lot a lot. Every time she sees a mirror she starts talking to me about how ""gross"" her skin is being and how she's ""so broken out"". 

At first I sort of just laughed and gave a sarcastic ""Haha that's my skin on a good day"" because yeah. My skin when it's doing great doesnt look as good as this ""gross, broken out mess"" she's describing. Though afterwards, I did tell her seriously that pimples like that are pretty normal, and she looks fine.

But she won't stop. It's every day. She's not even asking for advice on taking care of it: She just wants to tell me how broken out and nasty her skin looks because she has one pimple. 

 Yesterday night when she started for the 80th time I just rolled my eyes and didnt respond (I didn't think she was looking at me) and she got really upset.

 She said she didn't know why I always did this, and that I was being really insensitive. I told her I just thought she was being a bit silly over one pimple, and that it was impossible for me to not get a little upset, considering how bad my skin is in comparison. She got even more pissed, and said ""Just because my skin is better than yours doesnt mean I'm not allowed to have problems!""

I told her  I knew that, but that I couldn't help feeling uncomfortable when she made such a big deal over 1 pimple, considering she *saw* my past issues with my skin. She said I was being oversensitive and needed to stop being self-centered.

 I'm past all of the self-loathing, but listening to this still annoys me and makes me think ""what the fuck does she think of my skin?"". I *know* that she is allowed to have skin problems, and that she can be upset by them, it's just how dramatic she is being, considering how small it is.

So this morning he calls a meeting and announces that going forward he wants everyone there 10 minutes before their required start time in order to boot their machines and starts citing how much this so-called ""time theft"" is costing him and etc. I replied that if he wants me to come in at 8:50 instead of 9 that's fine, but the ten minutes has to come off the end of the day unless he's going to pay the 50 minutes of OT a week.

334,Asshole,"I, 26M,  got out of a long, intense 4 year relationship with a woman I was (and to some degree, still am) deeply in love with. It was a painful time in my life and I started seeing other women casually to ease the pain.

I met this girl Jane (20F) at the party of a mutual friend. We started seeing each other as FWBs since 5 months ago. I made it clear from the beginning that I’m not looking for a serious relationship. I also hooked up with other women in between this time.

However, last month, Jane confessed to me that she had feelings for me. I told her that I did not reciprocate these feelings. She said she understood. I asked if she was ok continuing with our FWB relationship, and she didn’t respond to me for a few days. Eventually, she came over to my place and we hooked up again. 

Two weeks ago, Jane again told me she was experiencing doubts over our FWB status and says she wants a relationship. I was annoyed because I thought I made it abundantly clear that I just wanted no strings attached sex, to put it bluntly. She said she feels a connection between us and asks if its ok to explore that connection. At this point, I said sure, maybe we can go on a few romantic dates and see how it goes from there.

I went on 3 “romantic” dates with Jane and I didn’t really feel much of a spark. She just didn’t seem like a match intellectually. I’ve been sort of ignoring her messages for the past week, as I’ve been busy at work and they can be quite excessive.

On Saturday, Jane called me. She said that she got into a fight with her roommate and asked if she could spend the weekend at my place while she searched for somewhere else to stay. I said sure, and she came over. She seemed pretty out of sorts and not in the mood for hooking up. 

On Sunday, I had plans to meet a Tinder date at her place. However, the plans changed and she wanted to come over to my apartment for drinks  and Netflix/Chill. I did not mention this to Jane because I didn’t want her to be upset.

After dinner, my Tinder date arrived. I told her that my friend was crashing for the night, and she was fine with it. But as we are watching TV in the living room, Jane comes out of the guest room and sees us. She was pretty shocked and a bit upset, I could tell. But she didn’t say anything, although it was still rather awkward.

Anyways, the Tinder date stayed overnight. She left the next morning for work. Today, however, Jane confronted me when she left and said that it was pretty douchey of me to invite a hookup over in front of her.  She said I need to think about other people not just my dick. I told her about the change of plans but she didn’t want to hear it. She left my apartment in anger and I haven’t heard from her since.

336,Not the A-hole,"To begin I firmly feel I'm **NOT** the asshole, but I have numerous co-workers stating the opposite. A little backing to the story...

I work for a large corporation. For the past few years we have been all about diversity and inclusion. One woman whom I work with refers to her self all the damn time as a POC, and constantly mentions diversity and inclusion in almost every meeting we have.

""I just need to state my opinion as a POC and a female...""

I'm all for diversity and inclusion but as you can probably tell a little bit annoyed that the same person is always shoving it our faces.

This brings me to earlier today when Mrs. Diversity and I, and one other were giving a presentation for about 50 people. me and the other guy (Call him Steve, if you are reading HEY STEVE) had important work related updates, and Mrs. Diversity talked about speeking up as a minority and a female. She went first, followed by me and followed by Steve. Steve never presented before and was fumbling his words and having a hard time reading the screen. Mrs. Diversity saw this and announced to the room:

""Perhaps he is having a hard time reading due to the glare coming from baldy_mcfatass's head"".

And the room blew up in laughter until they all saw my face and the room got quiet very fast. I stood up and shrugged my shoulders and said ""diversity and inclusion huh?"".

I stormed out of the room into my manager's manager's office and  vented to him. He told me to calm down and not call HR and that it was probably a joke not made to be hurtful. So I did until....

Mrs. Diversity showed up at my desk in what I assumed would be to apologize and if so I'd probably feel a lot better and move on. No no no however, this was now again about her and she double downed by telling me to get over being bald and that it isn't the same thing as being a POC and blah blah slavery, blah blah systemic....blah blah. Keep in mind I never mentioned me being bald was comparable to other things, only the fact that I am sensitive about it and not to be made the butt of a joke. She didn't back down so I called HR.

Now everyone is pissed and I'm the asshole because HR is going to have to investigate. I'm just sitting here like if you are going to be an ambassador for diversity you better damn well walk the walk. I'm so fired up still.

In closing had this comment been made in small group of friends I might not have cared. I did infact start loosing my hair at 16 and it killed my self esteem from 16 until around 25 when I shaved my head, hit the gym, and grew a beard....but the wounds from it are still there. So I'm not the asshole, change my mind?

**TLDR:** I called HR on the POC/Diversity and Inclussion Ambassador for making fun of my shiny bald head infront of 50 people....only moments after she talked about diversity and inclusion to the whole group.",102,54,0.74

339,Not the A-hole,"I have an incredibly boring day job, but I’ve always been into making dresses as a hobby. I wouldn’t say I’m great at it, but I’m decently okay and recently my
girlfriend Anna asked me to make her a tailored dress as she is VERY curvy and has a disproportionate torso-to-leg ratio which makes every dress look like a t shirt on her.

I complied and did the best I could, and she was thrilled with the result. I charged her only for materials used, because she’s a fancy girl and liked a Liberty of London print that we had to ship over from the UK. If it was cheaper I would have swallowed it but shits expensive yo.

She told a mutual friend and colleague about my dress making abilities (I like to stress I’m not the best at this and don’t derive any pleasure from making stuff for others. The pressure is too real and I hate it) and this friend begged and begged me to make her a dress that she wanted to use for her engagement photo shoot because she wanted something ‘bespoke’ 

This put me in an awkward position and I didn’t want to let her down, so I accepted despite not really wanting to. This mutual friend is larger than my friend Anna, and wanted a slightly cheaper fabric, also from Liberty. Again, I charged my friend only for the materials used, not for my time.

She was incredibly surprised when I told her how much I was charging, and told me I had charged Anna less. I told her the truth, which is I was ONLY charging for the material and even though it was only slightly less expensive, I had used much more of it in the making of the dress. I pointed out Anna’s dress didn’t have sleeves, this one did, etc. 

My friend has told everybody at work what happened, because she feels I unfairly charged her because of her weight. It sounds unfair but it’s her size, she’s bigger and it cost more to clothe her. Most people think I did a horrible thing and I should have charged the same. Only Anna is on my team, and my boss also who has told everyone if they don’t stop talking about the fucking dress-cident we’ll all get written up because she’s fed up of it being talked about whilst we’re meant to be working. 

My oldest friend thinks I should have charged the same because I “should have known this was a sensitive topic’ and that especially since it was for an engagement shoot, I should have been sensitive. I truly didn’t mean to offend my friend, and as I still haven’t been paid yet, I’m close to just texting her and letting it go cost free as a gesture of reconciliation so we can just drop this.

341,Not the A-hole,"This is more of an ""are we the assholes"" situation because I was not the only one but I got singled out. 

So I was at the Y, for those who don't know the Y is a gym/activity center that caters to all ages and has a great many kids programs and a daycare so there are lots of adults and kids, especially during the summer, and at the Y there are 5 dressing rooms, Men 18+, Women 18+, Boys 17 and under, girls 17 and under, and family. The family dressing room has individual privacy stalls for parents with young children who can not change themselves.

I use the Men's room as I am in my 20s and occasionally dad's bring their young sons in to the Men's changing room, honestly it's a bit awkward because kids are noisy and run around and the room is usually quite and take. Well one day a man brings is daughter in to the Men's room, she must have been between 3-5. As always the other men just ignore the child because it's whatever not gonna fuss over a rule getting broken once every few months.

I was in the shower when the dad came in and only a few people were in there. The dad had undressed his daughter first and let her stand naked while he undressed (presumably they were gonna put on swim suits and go to the pool) That's when I walk out of the shower, now when I get out I walk with my towel covering my self, not wrapped around me but covering the front, I'm an outlier as most guys just walks round naked. I walk to my locker, which is near the duo. With my back turned I set the towel down to open the lock , that's when I get this guy shouting at me. 

He calls me a pervert for getting naked in front of a child and how he is gonna call the cops. I'm taken aback by this, I grab my towel cover myself with my modest shame and turn around at this red faced dude. His daughter just looking at him. And a few people walk over including two fully nude old men air drying their bits. The dad starts shouting at them and kinda to the whole room how every one here is a pervert and deserve to be arrested. 

Now I'm not one who likes to be publicly embarrassed so while I wish I could have been calm I shout back at him. I tell him to fuck off because he is the moron who brought a child in to the adults only changing room and told him if he should have used the family room. 

This resulted in more yelling, and the dad angrily dressing himself and his daughter threatening to report me. I get dressed management comes in, the dad said I was waving my dick in his daughters face, my and a few witnesses told him the truth and nothing came of it but the manager said he we see kids in here to find an employee.

So in that right, I know I am not the asshole but I'm not concerned about the rules moreso as I am about the modesty. So should I have covered myself when I noticed the girl ( at any given time she would have only seen my ass, but if she looked around she would have seen the other two nude men) and reported it before it escalated to yelling?

343,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway.  

This is kind of long winded and complex, so apologies in advance. I (31F) lost my husband of two years about six months ago in a car accident. He had a baby when we met, a little girl, who he was a single parent of. The mother is not in the picture, and he had sole custody. A few months after we married, I moved forward with adopting his girl, my daughter.

Fast forward to now. Our daughter is now four years old, and I am considering changing her name only because ... it’s so awful. I would have left it up to my husband but obviously that is not happening now. His ex/baby-mama named her and he had very little say. She’s starting school in the fall and I am increasingly worried she will be made fun of as she gets older, and that teachers will be struck by her name when they meet her. My husband had no strong opinion on her name.

We already refer to her solely as nicknames that fit her name (Fiasco) and this started before her father passed. We call her Az (fi-AZ-co) and her grandfather calls her Fi. For this reason I am largely considering Fiona or Astrid. She knows her name is Fiasco, but she doesn’t like it (she replies to both Az and Fi), not because of the meaning like me, but because it “sounds like bubbles” aka soda (her aunt is a Fresca fiend...)

So WIBTA for changing her name even though I am not related to my daughter biologically? Should I honor my husband by keeping it? Am I freaking out over nothing? Life has just been so hard recently and this is the thing I’ve latched on to more recently.",511,1861,0.98

346,Not the A-hole,"Little background: I was a groomsmen in a wedding over the weekend. There was a bridesmaid we'll call C, and C and I don't really get along. She's IMO a drama queen and from the same small (<2,000 people) hometown as the bride and thinks that because her family is the ""it family"" in the hometown, whenever she visits us we should all treat her like royalty in a city of >500,000.

&#x200B;

Flash forward to the wedding: In between the ceremony and the reception, the bridal party was gathered to get introduced. The bride and groom ran off to get some sunset pictures taken when the clouds broke, and the rest of us were waiting around. C comes back form the bathroom and is in a panic because her period ""Shouldn't have started until tomorrow"", which at this point tomorrow is less than 5 hours away. My wife would not be caught dead leaving the house without her feminine products within 2-3 days of her start, but that's my wife. Anyway, the bridesmaid has no supplies with her, and neither do the other two bridesmaids. In comes the wedding planner, who was going to get us ready to go. Good news, she has a emergency supply kit that has among other things feminine products in it. So the wedding planner gives C what she needs, then goes to get the bride and groom. C then proceeds to bitch and complain for the next 7 mins (I happened to look at the clock when the wedding planner came in) about how the supplies the wedding planner had were store brand and not name brand, that the planner was cheap, these products were garbage, etc. I finally had enough and told her that it was her poor planning to not have anything on hand just in case, and she should be happy someone had something to give her. I told her to just go and do what she needs to do, I was tired of hearing her complain about it. She stormed off and gave my a nasty look saying that since I'm a guy I have no right to judge her brand preference or talk about ""period stuff"".

&#x200B;

My husband and I have been married for 10 years, we have two kids, J (7M) and L (3F). Both the pregnancies and the process before them were extremely taxing on me both physically and mentally. I suffer from PCOS (Polycystic ovary syndrome) and with that comes fertility issues as well as higher risk of miscarriages. My husband is well aware of that.

&#x200B;

When we were trying to get pregnant for the first time I had to make use of fertility meds and ended up getting pregnant twice only to miscarry later. The first at 5 weeks and the second at 11 weeks. This took a hit on me but my husband was very supportive at the time and we decided to try again. That was when I got pregnant with J and I was scared for 33 weeks because I was thought I would miscarry him as well.

&#x200B;

2 years after that my husband asked if I wanted to have another baby, I said yes and we went through the same route. I used fertility meds and ended up getting pregnant only to miscarry. Except this time it was much harder for me because I was 19 weeks along and I was very much attached. I ended up having to go to a therapist after that. 

&#x200B;

After that I ended up getting pregnant on accident and that was when L was born, although I didn't have to go through the stress of trying and using meds, I was terrified though the entire pregnancy and had to go back to my therapist. I ended up staying with the therapist even after L was born because I was scared of developing Postpartum Depression. This was when things got a bit rocky between me and my husband, because he kept saying I was over exaggerating and that I didn't have a reason to worry since L came out just fine.

&#x200B;

We overcame that and were living our life just fine when in the beginning of this year my husband started asking me if I didn't want to have another kid. I told him that no, because of all the reasons I stated above. He seemed to accept my answer only to come back a few months later to ask me about this again. The last time he asked me was last week and he has now started to drop hints about it every other day.

My husband had made it clear that he wanted to have a lot of kids but I thought that he would understand that this is something I cannot give to him. I understand that I say that I don't want to but it's more like I can't do it, there's noting to assure me that I won't miscarry again. His argument is that since L was an accidental pregnancy and I didn't have any issues while pregnant (I told him that I did, but he focused on the physical side of it) then we could just try without using meds and see what happens.",29,28,0.89

Still my father was willing to let me live with him and his wife didn’t have issues with that , it was me who told him no and that’s what hurts me and makes me feel like the asshole here.

Another thing is how I handled their marriages and how again I feel like a monster , when my mother remarried I gladly took part in the whole process , attended and I felt like this wasn’t just their ceremony but also mine ceremony. When my fathers marriage took place I destroyed the invitation and asked my stepdad not to tell my mother about this. 

And that’s why I came here to ask if I really am the bad guy here .",27,51,0.96
351,Not the A-hole,"To preface this: my husband and I both equally take care of the laundry. Where we vehemently differ is who's responsibility it is to check pockets before we throw laundry in the wash. 

He's under the impression that it's the burden of whoever the ""washee"" is to check pockets for wallets and change. I firmly disagree. Being a woman, all of my clothes have tiny pockets, so I rarely keep anything in them. I feel like it would take him 2 seconds to remove the contents of his pockets before throwing his clothes in the hamper, while it will take me 10 minutes to sift through 20 pockets of balled to shit pants before washing. 

I feel like this shouldn't be my problem. As I write this, his wallet has turned up missing and I may or may have not washed his wallet. If so he's going to be pretty angry with me.

I have a V8 and he has a V6. So now I knew why I was invited in the first place but I don't care cause I wanna go.  A week out my boss told me I couldn't go on this vacation because a very important client was coming in and he needed me.  So I tell my brother I can't go but he can still use my truck since that was the plan. I just wanted my share of the fishing trip which was $180. They said that they would try to find simeone else to go and not to worry.  Well they didn't find anyone to replace me and when they got back from the trip they said they would reimburse me.  Cool right?  The next day they reneged on that saying they should have to pay me back because I committed to the trip.  I was highly offended since I was generous enough to let them use my truck for a week. Just for a little background my older brother makes twice as much as me and has his wife to supplement that income.  I live in a shit hole and they live in a gated community.

356,Not the A-hole,"Our family and the family of my mom’s brother have an ongoing tradition of family lunch every month for more than 20 years. It became less frequent since my cousins, siblings and I went to college and moved cities for work. I also attend about once or twice a year for the past five years.

Both of my female cousins already have children. My relationship with one of them (let’s call her Belinda) has always been okay. I mean, we’re just okay. We’re not close. We don’t share secrets and all. We only speak about casual stuff like casual friends. Maybe because of our 7 year age gap. She’s 35, I’m 28.

Belinda has a five-year-old daughter with someone who has two children from another relationship. They met at work. She left her job because his legal wife called their HR department and revealed their adulterous relationship. Since then, Belinda has been a kept woman. They’re not married yet because he hasn’t gone with the legal proceedings to dissolve his marriage although she denies that he’s still married and says he comes home to her every night. Also, this guy sent his children to public schools so that she can fund Belinda’s expensive lifestyle.

Last weekend our family hosted the gathering. So everyone brought their children. After lunch, we settled in my room. Everyone was gushing over my newborn nephew (not hers) that I was carrying. And then Belinda started to bingo me out of nowhere. Everyone in the family is aware that I’ve made a conscious decision to be childfree.

Shit hits the fan when she started saying that I’m not being “blessed” enough because I don’t have children and she went on saying in front of everyone that I should find someone well-off to support me and have a baby; my career won’t matter much anymore once I start having kids. I clapped back and told her I don’t plan to be like her. I’m not desperate to steal other children’s father so that I can have my own child and be “blessed enough.” Everyone in the room went silent. I gave the baby back to the parents and drove back to my own place.

She texted me called me an insensitive bitch. She went on to reiterate that her child is not a sin and I should look at how beautiful and smart her daughter is so that I would know what’s missing with my empty life. She also said that I was being bitter because my ex-fiancé cheated on me. And that my master’s degree and career are bullshit because I clearly don’t have any manners. She added that I’m digging my own grave by not having a child and I deserve to die alone. I didn’t reply. I decided to block her number so that she would stop messaging me.

My mom called me up a few hours later and she said I should apologise to Belinda and her parents for what I said in front of everyone. I refused. My mom said I should not attend the next few gatherings like I did for the past 5 years to avoid issues.

359,Not the A-hole,"My fiance and I got engaged last year and decided we wanted to have a very small, intimate wedding. We originally wanted to have a destination wedding but were talked into staying near by and having a more traditional wedding. We purposefully picked a venue that only holds 80 people because we still wanted the event to be as small as possible. We love all the kids in our family but we were looking to have a classier event where our guests could enjoy their evening out with drinks, dancing and adult company only. My fiance has a lot of younger cousins and our friends have a lot of younger kids. We felt like if we were to have a ""no kids"" rule, it had to be all or nothing in order to be fair.

&#x200B;

When I first told my mom about our wishes, her response was ""sure, plus Jake though, right?"" Jake is my 9 year old nephew. He is an only child and the only grandchild for both sets of grandparents and very much the center of their lives. I sort of side-stepped the comment with something like ""uh...yeah, I don't know yet, we haven't really talked about it"". I spent the next few months getting the full guilt trip from my mom. Things like ""I could just cry thinking that Jake might not be invited! and ""You'll have to be the one that looks him in the face and explains to him that he can't come!"" those sorts of things. I sent the invites out anyway and addressed theirs without Jake's name. I also put an ""adult's only"" note on our wedding site.   


Last night, my parents took Jake to get ice cream and he mentioned that his parents got the invite for the wedding. My mom then explained to Jake that the wedding was just for adults and no other kids would be there. She said he seemed like he understood and wasn't upset by it. They took him home. Shortly after, my mom gets a call from Jake's mom (my sister in law). She's crying. She says she's so heartbroken that Jake isn't invited. She asked my mom ""how could you let this happen!?"" and even said that she won't be attending our wedding because of this. My mom relays this information to me and says that my SIL is not being selfish, she's just distraught and that I need to have a little compassion. She suggests that I meet with my SIL face-to-face to ""fix this"".  At this point, it's taking everything I have to be the bigger person here. It seems to me that my mom and SIL are feeding into each other's over the top theatrics on this matter.  I get that Jake's my only nephew but I the kid doesn't care whether or not he comes, he's 9! And you know what, even if his feeling were a little hurt, that's just the way things go, right? Some times being a kid means you can't be included in things. I feel like his mother's reaction to him not being included is setting such a bad example. So Reddit, am I a terrible aunt? AM I the asshole?",72,72,0.88
360,Not enough info,"Hi guys, obligatory 'first time post' comment and sorry if I've broken any of the community rules. I just would like your opinion on whether or not I was in the wrong. If I am deemed the asshole, I will definitely apologize after. Here goes...


This morning, I was talking with a coworker about her plans for later in the day. She said she was going to do an activity with a new date she met through an online dating app. She mentioned that her date's name was (Redacted). And I responded with something along the lines of: 'That sounds like an (Redacted) or (Redacted) name'. And I mentioned those races because I know people who are Asian and Hispanic that have that name. It was probably not a good call to say that in hindsight...

Immediately after that comment, she called me out for saying something (Redacted). Her date was not from one of those (Redacted). And she mentioned my very Western/Anglo first name did not give any hints to my actual race either. I believe she was actually offended by what I said since she was a little cold to me after. 

Am I the asshole for mentioning the name thing? I do feel very conflicted and bad now. So I'd like some unbiased insight.

Update: I apologized.

363,Not the A-hole,"Taking the side bar advice on using a throwaway account because of potential outside ramifications. I can’t really ask this question at work so here I am.  

For some background I was deeply in love with my fiancé, we were about two months away from the wedding when I found out he cheated on me. I knew of the girl but had never met her but had it on pretty credible authority that she pursued him knowing he was engaged. It was still his fault so while I called off the wedding but tried to reconcile and forgive, I just couldn’t do it. We broke up but it was a year before I could even face the world socially and 2.5 years before I went on another date. I’m past it but will probably never truly be over the hurt. 

I work HR at a large tech company and am in charge of hiring new people to work in our sales department. The girl in question has a fairly unique first name so when I saw her name I thought it might be her but her last name didn’t match. But when she sat down for our initial interview (me and one other person) we instantly recognized each other. I have to give her full credit, she was nervous for about a minute and then composed herself and gave an amazing interview. Her credentials are spot on and obviously she has the ability to talk and be a good sales person. 

But part of me feels like “fuck you, I don’t need to reward you with a Commissioned sales position with an amazing base salary.” My co-interviewer thought she was a slam dunk but the decision still goes to me. We have interviewed 34 people so I can easily hire someone else and raise no red flags, but the key is she is the most qualified and gave the best interview. 

She sent a very polite email thanking us for the interview and asked if I would be willing to meet with her again to discuss potential “conflicts.” I have yet to respond. I guess I have two choices, meet with her she probably hire her OR I just hire someone else a little less qualified and no one but me will ever know.

WIBTA if I don’t hire her?

edit: this may be too late for anyone to see this as it's probably dying off but my boss finally got back to me (he works across the country from me) and he basically said that he needs me to handle it, trusts me and expects me to hire the best person. So ya...no help there!",960,3421,0.95

I was sitting behind some.. rowdy kids. From their conversation, I gathered that they were around 12/13-years-old. First time, I friendly asked them if they could be a little more quiet.  That lasted for around a minute. These kids were going up and down in their seats, constantly making comments to one and other. One kid started dancing stereotypically during a Marrakesh scene.

After that, I decided to sit somewhere else so I wasn't directly behind them anymore. This was bearable, until they literally started shouting stuff at each other. I left the theatre, and got an employee. 

She stopped the movie, and told them to be quiet.  I got a few weird looks from other people. I feel a little bad about it, because it was an afternoon showing of men in black. I should have expected rowdy kids, especially because it's summer vacation for them as well.",47,136,0.92

368,Not the A-hole,"My mother is notoriously tight with her money. Even though she has plenty, she is very particular with how she spends it. That is fine in most situations, but a few years ago I noticed she never tips when we eat out. 

My sister and I have Sunday lunch with her once a week, in which we each pay for ourselves. My sister and I always tip extra because we know our mother is going to stiff the server. It is incredibly frustrating and we have mentioned it to her several times. 

Yesterday we ate at a casual restaurant that has a waitstaff, but has you pay at a counter when you leave. My mother was the last to pay and the cashier asked if she wanted to leave a tip on her card, to which she said no. I asked my mom if she had cash she wanted me to take back to the table for her, to which she also said no. So I said ""so you just aren't going to leave a tip?"" and she said ""not today"". We went outside and she got very upset with me, saying I embarrassed her in front of the cashier and that I was being rude. I explained that not tipping was rude and that I was tired of always having to cover for her. She said ""not everybody tips"" to which I responded ""no, but everyone is supposed to"". She cancelled the rest of our plans for the day and left, informing me that I have no place to tell her what to do.

This upsets me more than anything because I was a server all through college and tips were how I survived. My mother knew this and listened when I complained about tables stiffing me, often seeming empathetic. I am mostly worried about how she acts when my sister and I aren't there to cover her tip. If she's with her friends, does she expect them to take care of it too? I'm embarrassed for her.

369,Not the A-hole,"Last year, my daughter was finishing elementary school. She had been in special education, but for the last couple of years had been spending only half the time in special education. The elementary school principal was awful to deal with. She was against my daughter being mainstreamed, even though my daughter's teachers all said it was a good idea. We aren't the only family that has had these kinds of problems, so I assumed she has issues with special needs students. My daughter had done so well that for sixth grade she was only going to have to be in special education for math. 

One day near the end of fifth grade, my daughter and her friends on the school bus decided to sing on the way home, and they annoyed the bus driver so much that he reported them and they got detention. My daughter did the detention and apologized, and since she had never been in trouble at school before, I didn't think this was a big deal.

However, the principal had me come for a conference and made it seem like a serious problem. She said the behavior was unacceptable, and that she was going to recommend that my daughter stay in half time special education in middle school. I said that was ridiculous, this was the only time she had been in trouble in six years. I know of many kids who have done much worse things at school, and they're not sent to special education, and neither were the other kids who sang on the bus. The principal said this behavior meant she wasn't ready to be almost out of special education, but obviously I disagreed since all my daughter's teachers said that she was ready. I accused the principal of being biased against special needs kids and went over her head. Fortunately, the principal did not get her way.

My daughter did so well in sixth grade, that next year she won't have to be in special education at all. I'm very proud of how well she is doing, and I had forgotten the former principal and put the incident out of my mind. Unfortunately, I saw the principal again shortly before school let out. I was at a school event, talking to some of the other parents when the principal saw me. She remembered my daughter and asked how she was. I told her that my daughter was being moved out of special education, and the principal gave this fake looking smile and said that was great. The anger from last year came back and I said ""it is great, no thanks to you."" The principal got uncomfortable and stuttered sorry, and I said ""you should be sorry."" Then I told the other parents who were with us that the principal had a problem with special needs students and she got embarrassed and walked away.

I told my family what happened and I got mixed reactions. Some people think I did the right thing, some people think what I said was too mean, and some said that my reaction would have been okay if the principal and I had been alone, but that I shouldn't have said those things in front of other parents.

373,Not the A-hole,"My dad called me yesterday to discuss my, and my sibling’s, inheritance. I need a little bit of help understanding if I'm the asshole here.

A bit of background first. I’m 27 (M) and I am looking at two future sources of inheritance; one from my father and one from my grandparents. The dollar amount of these inheritances is what I would consider to be substantial, but not life changing amounts.

So on to our discussion. He informed me that he wanted to set up a meeting with me and my siblings to discuss “what we’re doing” with our inheritances. He said that he was going to create a “family corporation” where we will all pool the money from our inheritances so that it he can invest it into various avenues. My siblings and I would each receive “shares” in the corporation.

When I probed a bit deeper, he said that my siblings and I would have no idea how much money was in this corporation or where the money was being allocated. My father continually emphasized that he would have 100% control of the money and how it’s distributed. We would essentially be signing away our right to inheritance (as I see it).

It’s important to note that he also told me “in the future, if you have any major medical emergencies or something of that sort, I would permit you to use some of this money”.  While that seems nice, it would be at his discretion.

He admitted his main concern was that I or my siblings use the money for our lifestyle (e.g buying houses, cars). In his words, “I’ve seen too many kids’ work motivation ruined by having money”.

So this is my conundrum. While I understand him not wanting us to be lazy and unmotivated, I feel as if signing away all control of my inheritance is not a wise move. While I have a good relationship with my father now, I don’t know if that will still be the case in 10 or 20 years.  I think he is well intentioned, but taking things a few steps too far.

Would I be the asshole if I stood my ground and said I was not comfortable giving my father sole decision making rights over my future inheritance?

TLDR: Father wants my siblings and I to sign away control of our future inheritance money (from both him and grandparents). His fear is that we would be tempted to use the money for personal reasons and be less motivated to work. My fear is that it is unwise to sign away complete control of inheritance and I may regret that decision years from now.",542,2305,0.96
374,Everyone Sucks,"A friend decided she wanted to have her bachelorette party in Las Vegas, so most of the bridal party decided to road trip it out together, including the bride-to-be. We all chipped in so the bride wouldn’t have to pay for her hotel room, bottle service at a club for one of the nights, and a nice dinner. We also chipped in to get her some gifts. The rest of the time, we all covered our own meals, gambling, etc. Everyone had a great time, bride included. 


A little backstory: Several of us met through work, which is a freelance industry. We are still semi-new to it, so it’s always a grind to find our next job, and so none of us are exactly well-off. I even turned down a long gig, which really sucked for me financially, because it would have taken me out of the country for the date of the wedding. So on top of paying for my share of the bachelorette party, I also am paying for my wedding gift, a bridesmaid dress, two pairs of shoes she requested (wedding and rehearsal dinner), and a hotel room for the actual wedding which is also in another city a few hour away. So this wedding has already been fairly expensive for me. 


Anyway, as we are driving back home, we decide to just grab some fast food for lunch on the way. As I get to the front of the line, the bride runs up to me and tells me what she wants. I may have been a little cranky from the amount of money I just spent in Vegas, but I couldn’t do it anymore. I just looked at her, told her that sounded good, and paid only for my own order. Immediately, the bride’s face turned angry, and things have been weird between us ever since.

Problem: Would I be the asshole if I told my mother she needs to stop sending money and gifts to my Sister-In-Law who is in the middle of divorcing my brother.

Context: My brother and his wife got married when I was in college about a few years ago. She got a degree in teaching, he had to go back to school to become an civil servant. They soon had a kid and then another and that's when the stress started to happen.

His wife has always been....the super fake valley girl type to me and the rest of the family. I know my family is over-bearing but she made it a point to pretty much always never be around us when we were visit. I.E. would just drop off to go hang out with friends or not be around.  Only civil when my parents were taking care of beach vacations or holidays. 

Regardless, when their combined debt came up and it was too expensive to daycare their kids, she quit working and my brother started working 3 jobs. Too tired and stressed out to meet 'her needs'. She kicked him out of the home, went into the separation phase and has refused to put any effort into the relationship since. She's 'played nice' when she's brought the children over both not even in kindergarten yet, but refuses to acknowledge the pain she's causing my brother and worse...my mother acts like its not a big deal.

She is continually mailing little gifts, money and items to her and things for the children. I don't mind gifts for the kids, but the fact that she's actively rewarding my SIL for divorcing my brother, kicking him out of the house for not being around because he's working to support the family and only seeming to care when she takes the kids away from 'her time to visit' makes me rage.

This also means that they share their sadness if someone does, what happens pretty often, wich is leading to the point:

Nearly 5 - 6 times a year some dies, because they were old, sometimes because they were sick.. And everytime its a huge deal with crying und sadness for days.

I'm afraid of planing to go to vacation, even its a trip for just a weekend, because I have to pray someone doesnt die and fks up our plans. In 7 years,we're together, some special private days were crushed because someone died. We had do cancel holidays because some died. Since were together so many of her ""family members"" died and she was in tears for days. (I've put it into quotes because in my opinion family members are just the really close ones like parents, brother and my first grade cousins etc.)

She's really careful and shows me how important I'm for her, so usually I dont play ""the second fiddle"" in her family.

It just seems like always when something great happens (vacation, birthday, or just having a great day for no obvious reason) some HAS to destroy it because he dies. I even feel how selfish this sounds as I write this, but I feel like her feelings for the family if someone days are WAY of the top.. Like, yeah, you can say ""damn thats sad"" and be shocked - but she is completly in her own world of sadness for days after wich affects the life of everyone arround her - basicly me and her family. But her family feels with her because they share all the same ""strong boundage"" to themselfes, so it seems quite normal for them to react this hard.

EDIT: Apparently turtle soup is ""exotic"". I had no idea. I need some time to think about it. Thanks for replies.

EDIT2: Okay. So I was away for a few hours and I come back and I have tons of messages including some quite nasty DMs. Let me respond to a few nasty ones first: I do not deserve to die in my sleep tonight. Nor should turtles bite off my penis or be shoved up my anus so I can be eaten from the inside out. As for the ones of support: if you live in the Twelve-Mile Circle, maybe I'll invite you next time I make it. As for my AITA, after overwhelming ""I'm the asshole"" responses, I think I did screw up. I had no idea people considered turtle soup unusual. I already called and told the people I apolgize and I over-reacted because my feelings were hurt.",486,710,0.9
381,Everyone Sucks,"My SIL and brother were hit by a drunk driver and died a month ago. They had 3 kids which are currently with SILs mother. We figured she’d end up taking custody, but because the kids are 3,1,2months and the mother herself has 3 kids she doesn’t want to keep all three. She agreed to keep the 1 year old since he’s not related to us(SIL cheated) but wonders if we could take the other two. 

The problem is me and my other brother both agreed we’d take a kid in if we had to. I said I’d take the 3 year old but that’s it. If I couldn’t get him then I’m not taking any child in at all. 

My brother also wants the 3 year old because he has a baby himself and thinks it would be too hard to have two kids under 6 months. Everyone thinks I’m being an asshole and that I should just take the baby but honestly I can’t stand the crying so I couldn’t do it. So AITA for choosing which kid I take in?

Edit: everyone is saying they should stay together. Regardless if me or my brother were to decide we want them all, we can’t keep them together. SILs mother will NOT give us the middle kid because he’s got no relation to us

Edit: besides the crying and me not being able to handle that, I would be able to fit the 3 year old into my schedule since he can go to daycare and he starts school in the fall while still working and going to college",637,1185,0.95

384,Not the A-hole,"I started a partial hospitalization program a couple weeks ago to help me with my depression. The majority of the program is spent in a group therapy setting. I was extremely anxious over the idea, because I’m not very comfortable around people. But I decided to try my best and have been able to open up. I’d say for the first week things went really well.

At some point in the second week, I was sitting in the group room during lunch. Some of us will go out for lunch but some of us just stay there and eat. Usually during lunch whoever’s in the room will just chat about whatever, keeping things light for the most part. At some point someone else in the group told me that some of the stuff I say during therapy comes off as “naive” but they have to remind themselves that I’m young (I’m in my early 20s. This person’s in their early 30s). I asked them for an example, because I was curious as to what their point was. They couldn’t give an example. At that point someone else chimed in (this other person also being in their 30s) and started to make comparisons about the problems they had in their 20s vs the problems now. And just sorta laughing about it.

The whole interaction has been eating at me since. I’ve spoken less in therapy sessions now because I don’t want more reasons to be made fun of. I know it shouldn’t matter because after this I’ll probably never see these people again. But this is supposed to be a safe space of non judgement. I feel like an outcast. Amongst a group of people all hospitalized for various mental illnesses. What a joke.

I want to continue therapy because I know I need the help. But I really don’t feel welcome or comfortable there anymore. I barely felt comfortable to begin with and now that ship has sailed entirely. Would I be an asshole if I requested to be in a different group?",34,107,0.91
385,Not the A-hole,"So I had been talking to this girl for a little over a month now and honestly for the most part things were going pretty well. She was super sweet, really endearing, and expressed interest in things that I enjoyed. However, towards the end of our relationship she had really changed. She started being really weird around me and overall just creepy. She said things along the lines of:

"" I am the most annoying girl ull ever meet and I just like to piss people off. I'm the second child so since I was born it was my destiny, You're next.""

And

""It causes pain and I care enough to cause that.""

And

""Hahahahahahahaha you have a choice huh? Ur a funny boy it's happening weather you like it or not"" (her response when I told her that, no, I in fact did not want her to put forcefully put makeup on my face while I'm unconscious.)

She just kept going on and on and talking about what she wanted to do to me, specifically painting my nails and making out with me both while I'm asleep, which I am absolutely not ok with. But she still insists that it's going to happen even when I say I don't want it too. 

I eventually got so creeped out that I went to my friends and asked them what I should do. All of them had suggested blocking her. Some of them had been through rough abusive relationships and said that these types of messages were signs that something similar could happen to me, and that I should block her. So that's exactly what I did.

The next day I keep getting messages from her friends from her, but I keep blocking them too because I honestly just don't want to deal with her. But even though she is psycho, she does seem really sad that out of nowhere the guy she liked to text just shut her out of his life, and in a way I feel bad about that. Her friends have told me that so many guys have been assholes to her before, and as much as I didn't want it to happen towards the start of the relationship, it looks like that's exactly what I've become.

390,Everyone Sucks,"*Made some edits at the bottom of this post to address some questions and explain my situation a little more. Thanks for the amazing feedback, all of you. Such mixed results, now that makes for a good debate!*

I got a new roommate who moved in with me about 3 months ago. He brought his dog along to live with us. No problem with the dog living with us, the dog is actually cute and very sweet.

My roomate works late night shifts at his restaurant and for the past 3 months he has been consistently texting and calling me around 10pm at night asking me if I could feed his dog dinner because he wont be home until 12 or 1 in the morning. At first I was more than happy to feed his dog for him when he asked me. I have dogs myself so I know how it can be to worry about your furry friend. But he just keeps on asking and asking and asking until it begins to feel as if I am taking care of the dog myself. He would ask me to feed his dog almost every night he was at work. I really did tolerate it for a while and would give him suggestions like ""maybe you should feed your dog before you go to work"" or ""try fitting his feeding schedule around your schedule"". It was never super confrontational, but more passive comments to him. He never listened to my suggestions. So the phone calls keep coming in. I am a busy man and I have to wake up for work at 6am and having my roomate text me or call me at 10pm asking me to feed his dog really began to bother me. Like it really started to get under my skin. In my eyes he was an irresponsible dog owner and shouldn't dump his dog dad duties onto his roommate. I have 2 dogs to take care of myself and I have never once asked him to feed my dogs. I make sure I time out their feeding schedules around my own schedule. Responsible pet owner stuff.

One night I totally snapped on him. I had had a long day at work and was exhausted. I eneded up falling asleep early; only to be woken up by a phone call at 10:30 asking me to feed his dog. I told him he shouldn't have gotten a dog if he can't take care of it and that I'm not it's fucking caretaker. I told him he is a lazy dog owner and to stop asking me to nanny his dog. I ended the phone call by saying his dog will be fine not eating for a few extra hours until he gets home to feed him. Never got up and fed the dog that night. After that night my roomate never asked me again to feed his dog. He eventually did what he should have done in the very first place, he worked his dogs feeding schedule around his own schedule. 

AITA for refusing to feed my roomates dog that one night?





*Edit :*  *I thought I should add this part for more backstory. My roomate also would also ask me to take his dog on a walk everytime he saw me leashing up my 2 dogs getting ready for a walk. I would laugh and tell him if he wants to leash up his dog and come on a walk with us he is more than welcome to. He would just come up with an excuse why he can't or just tell me he doesn't feel like walking. That one didn't last 3 months though. He stopped asking once he figured out my only answer to him wanting me to walk his dog was that he can leash his own dog up and walk with us. Dude never takes his dog out for walks or to the dog park. The poor thing is house bound.*

*Edit #2:* *Alot of people here assuming I do not care about the dog. I worked with rescue dogs that was also a dog bording facility for almost 3 years for petes sake. I have seen it all. Terrible owners, outstanding owners, down to the utterly obsessed owners. I know from experience, he is a selfish dog owner. He never puts his dog before his own selfish needs, and to me thats pathetic. Also some comments assume I just feed my dogs infront of his and let out a supervillain laugh as I watch the poor dog go hungry. Not true. I feed my dogs the same time everynight in my room with the door closed. They are food aggressive so I cannot have any other dogs around while they eat. My roomates pup doesn't even know when my dogs are eating. I feed them very discreetly. Also people saying I am evil for not walking my roomates dog. Are you telling me he is not capable of getting up off his lazy ass, stop playing Rainbow Six Seige for 8 hours striaght, and put down his beer and joint so he can walk his own dog?*",153,448,0.95

Her savings end in August, and because of that, we might have to move from our house to live with some relatives in a small room.

Last month, I got accepted to college in another city. My dad got really excited and said he'd send me more money every month so I could live comfortably there. But I couldn't leave my mom here without nothing, so he offered to go live with her until she gets a job, paying for everything she needs to keep the house. This benefits the both of them, since my dad needs a cheap place to live because his (now) ex-wife is kicking him out.

My mom, who's against me leaving the city, said she doesn't want to depend on my dad again. She said I could try for college again next year, and we can live (barely) with my salary and my dad's child support until she gets a job. She guarantees she can get a job by the end of the year, but until then I already lost my chance to go to college.

AITA for wanting her to spend a few months living with my dad?

398,Not the A-hole,"So I was at the local pet adoption center today getting ready to get a new pupper. I went out to my car to get a harness. On the way in to the location, there is a set of doors, a small entry way then another set of doors. 


As I walk up to the exterior doors, I see a family walking out so I grab the handle and hold the doors open for them. Promptly one son from the family opens the other door next to the one I was holding and the family of 4-5 people start walking out. Another son is inside the entryway holding open an interior door. I wasn’t paying much attention to him I was just politely waiting as the family exited. (I live in the Midwest so this is just something you do)


Queue the very large woman slowly walking out following the rest of her family. This is the largest person I’ve ever seen in my life and for where I live that’s saying something. She was so large I can’t begin to estimate her weight. I’m confident in saying it was above 400. Likely much higher. And she was very tall. 


Anyway, I see this woman coming and this is where things get weird. I have the right door open. Son 1 has the left door open. Son 2 is holding open the interior door. I kept holding my door while the large woman *very* slowly exits. Large woman eventually gets out of the exterior doors and I’m still holding my door waiting for her sons to exit too before I go inside. 


Son 1 says “go ahead sir.” I take my cue and walk inside thanking both son 1 and son 2 for holding the door open for me. 


As soon as I walk past, Son 2 says in a completely different tone of voice and I’m pretty sure he was upset with me: “and thanks for assuming that my mom needed BOTH doors open”


Now I didn’t mean to do anything maliciously but looking back I think I did consider that she probably needed both doors open due to just how large she was. But looking back, I guess she got through the first door well enough with son 2 holding it. I just didn’t pay attention to that. I may have embarrassed her or her family by giving her a 8 foot wide exit. 


Also in my defense I grew up with a mildly disabled mother and when I wasn’t with her I was at my 80yo grandmothers house, so it is second hand for me to wait an overly extended period of time holding open a door for someone that moves very slowly. Not to mention Midwest Ope Syndrome makes you never want to be the person that walks through the door first.

399,,"My husband and I love camping and hiking. When we unexpectedly gained full custody of his children from a previous marriage, our habit of disappearing every other weekend into the woods had to stop. So we could both keep our sanity, we made a pact: each of us got to go by themselves (or with friends) 2-4 times a year. His daughters... do not enjoy being miles from a running tap or an iPhone charger :P so big family trips are out. These weekends are sacred to both of us; a chance to get away from everything and challenge ourselves in nature. Plus, the one who stayed home usually ‘goes easy’ on the one who went out on the Monday they return, handling most of the chores and childcare while the other recooperates. 

This worked quite well for a few years, and then we had our own baby. Husband waited 10 months before going hunting with some buddies. Now it’s my turn. But I find I don’t want to go hiking as usual because 

1. I’m exhausted like I’ve never been before. If I have a chance to get away, I honestly just want to recapture the days where I can play the Sims and eat pizza in my underwear, and no one needs me to do anything for them. 
2. My body has changed. Almost a year of being at home with baby has lessened my strength and flexibility, added fat, and generally knocked me down a peg. My favourite haunts are up rocky hills and thick Bush (were in Australia) and for the first time I’m... scared, actually. My pack feels so heavy. The other month I slipped on the steps of the local mall and twisted my ankle, like an old lady :( 

As you can probably tell, I feel kind of embarrassed about all this. I was thinking of telling my husband I was going hiking, but going to a nice hotel and chilling. But a girlfriend quickly pointed out that it would look like I was having an affair or something if the card showed a random hotel booking, and I do NOT need that. But I feel like he’ll feel put upon if he knows I’m just watching Riverdale eating BBQ wings, in a way he wouldn’t if I was sleeping on Mt Solitary, outside Katoomba.

I didn’t really think anything of this until he sent me a picture of my car with a bag of lollies on it. I wasn’t positive it was mine because I couldn’t see the rego plate. I park in the street, and when I went out to check, I heard a voice in the dark say “hello” and there he was.

Another is that I have specifically told him that I don’t want to meet up with him outside of work because my partner isn’t comfortable with that. And the main reason it is bothering me so much is that the week before this happened we had literally had a conversation about this topic, and how weird I found it that people would try to find people’s houses like that. 

He said to me “well your location is shared with me on Snapchat” and I said “that’s not an invitation”

405,Everyone Sucks,"TL:DR at the bottom 

My aunt is what you would call a helicopter mom. She goes wherever her son (17, turning 18 soon) would go. She went to prom with him and wouldn’t let him dance with his date. He doesn’t really hang with friends since she’s always there to accompany him. Even “coincidentally” met up with him on his senior trip, at the same hotel.

So this weekend I went to visit them in Philadelphia. Aunt needed a babysitter while she went to a get together with her friends. I felt bad for the kid. After her friend came and picked her up, I told him he could go do whatever and I’m not gonna watch him. I trust him. He’s old enough to be on his own for a couple hours. He’s already going to a college out of state in August. 

He got excited and told me he was going to the movies with his friends. I told him ok but be back before his mom came home at 6. He took his mom’s car and texted me he was at the movies.

6 rolls around and he’s not home. I call his phone no answer. I call my aunt no answer. An hour later, my aunt bust opens the door and starts yelling at me to pay for the damages to her car.  Kid got into an accident on the way home. He got a cut on his forehead, nothing serious, but hood and bumper are pretty bad. 

To add insult to injury, he told his mom that he wasn’t really at the movies but went to his gf’s to have sex and didn’t wear a condom. That started another tirade about how I’m going to pay for their child since I let him have sex and she’s not having a baby ruin her son’s future. 

I told her to fuck off because I’m not paying for anything. She has car insurance and expecting me to pay for a mythical child that isn’t  mine in any shape or form is beyond ridiculous. Instead of following her son everywhere, she should’ve taught him safe sex. 

I told her the only reason this happened was because she needs to stop following her son and let him have a life. Despite the accident he’s unharmed and we don’t know being supervised would’ve made the accident not happen. Was she planning on going with him to college? His job? His fucking honeymoon?! While I’m mad he had unprotected sex, this was probably as much freedom he’s had in years. I’m standing by that. Idiot should’ve just went to the movies or wore a condom. 

She said yes to all the questions and is looking for an apartment to rent for them. Called me an ass for not following her instructions. She said she paid (she wasn’t) for me to watch her son at home, not to be parent or make decisions for him. That she might take me to court if I don’t pay for the damages.

406,Asshole,"So, I was living  with my SO at his house and a female friend of his got into some serious personal and professional trouble so we offered her to live with us for a while as our roomie. 

During the first days she was Ok, although she often needed help to accompany her to some meeting with her ex boss to get some compensation for the problems before mentioned. 

Less than a week in, while my SO and her were at one of these meetings I decided to cook Taco Fish for them, it took me around 3 hours since I made three salsas and prepared the vegetables to go along with the taco. Considering the heat that day and me cooking with hot oil frying breaded fish fillets was quite exhausting not to mention how hungry I was.

I couldn't finish the meal so while they offered to help, I was already on the final phase so I refused. Now, my SO tends to be late to eat. Therefore I try to tell them when I believe I will serve the food soon. Considering how tired I was I raised my voice a little louder than it should have, and I was already cranky so the tone of my voice matched as well.

My SOs Friend started to complain about how I talked to him. I tried to explain but again, I wasn't in the mood for being calm and subtle so it only came out as "" it's just that he ALWAYS runs late to sit down to eat"". She stopped and sat down.

After I served both of them their respective tacos, and prepared to sit down on the table, I noticed she was serving herself like she was forced to eat it, with a face that was clearly upset. My SO was serious as well, but not as annoyed as her.

At this time, tired, sweating from being on the heat for the last half an hour, after standing for 3 hours cooking and washing dishes in order to make them happy (the salsas were their ""favorites"" ) I couldn't handle it. I left to eat alone in my room. My SO didn't even come to talk to me, they just ate and watched TV. 

After dinner I refused to talk to my SO since I was too upset to have an adult conversation. Next day I told him I was leaving to my mother's house for a month. Since I am afraid I will hold a grudge on both of them and can't be sure when I'll be able to talk it without feeling about to explode in frustration. Cooking is a very personal thing to me, so when they did that to my meal I was offended in a very sensitive way.

Four days have passed since and I still feel like not wanting to cook anything for them ever again. I even considered breaking up with my SO since he barely did anything to support me.

AITA for being this offended by that?

Edit: *It seems to be that I'm pretty much fully responsible for the whole issue. I still feel some lingering emotions, but I'm certain that I can withhold an adult conversation.

I also understand that I should focus my enjoyment of cooking to the action itself, instead of wanting to make people happy from it. I got into a situation that I couldn't handle properly emotion wise (being cornered up in an argument and then a negative feeling towards my food) and shouldn't let people affect me this much.

407,Not the A-hole,"Backstory: I was raised by very abusive parents (they only abused me) my savior was my older brother. He’s the reason I’m alive. He fed me and was basically my parent. I also had a younger sister who died when I was 12. My brother kind of turned on me after that. He became as abusive as my parents (mental and physical abuse. I can’t get too much into it because of the violence rule but it was really bad I have to say) 

So I had no one. I somehow managed to survive and moved out at 18. Now at 24 I’m engaged to an amazing women and we’re getting married in December. She’s helped me cope with the abuse and has gotten me into therapy (which has been helping a lot).

Recently, my brother contacted me through Facebook and said he wanted to talk. I decided to do it. 

We had lunch. He apologized for everything, and I forgave him. I left pretty happy. 

I have a best friend. He’s one of the only people I can really connect with and I love him to death. When I got engaged I knew immediately that I wanted him as my best man.

Invitations went out about a week ago, and I invited my brother. 

He texted me yesterday saying he was disappointed in me. I called him and asked why, and he said that I should have made him my best man. I informed him that I made my best friend, who has been with me through therapy and everything else to do with recovering from the abuse, my best man.

My brother reminded me of all the things he did for me when I was a kid. I most certainly would’ve died without him. But I don’t think that excuses his behavior after my sisters death. I know he gave a lot for me, but I don’t remember him for that. I remember him for everything afterwards. I told him this, and he called me an ass, saying he’d been going through a lot. Like I hadn’t? I know his childhood was ruined because of everything, but when it came right down to it, *I* was the one actually receiving the abuse. My parents loved him. Do you know how hard it is having your parents always point out their favorite son for all his accomplishments when I didn’t even have the opportunity to become a lawyer like my brother, and to have my parents tell me how much they hated me? I almost killed myself multiple times because my own family told me to, and he’s the one who was “going through a lot”?

I told him he was no longer invited to my wedding and hung up. 
He texted me saying all these horrible things, and I blocked him. He even used his wife’s account to message me on Facebook and I blocked that too. I don’t want to hear him anymore. 

Idk, was I an asshole? I sure am feeling like one. I want him in my life, I really do, but I’m not sure if he’s really changed back to the person I once knew.

UPDATE: (if anyone’s still seeing this) my brother contacted my fiancé on Facebook with his wife’s account again. She showed me the message. Here’s what he said:

This is (brothers name). Can you tell (my name) that I’m sorry? I overreacted, and I really want to be at the wedding. It’ll kill me to miss another part of (my name)’s life. Please tell him to call me. 

I’m not going to call him.",159,512,0.94
408,Asshole,"Okay, so there's this girl named Gray. Gray was an absolute thorn in my side for a whole semester. We were roommates and she was very unbearable in that happy-go-lucky-the-world-
is-wonderful-let-me-help-you-
fix-your-life kind of way. She was constantly on my case for missing class and staying up late because she made it her personal mission to ""fix"" my life even though my life is already pretty fine and I'm happy with the kind of student I am. She'd do things like call me a bad student and a bad influence in public, constantly try to hug me or touch my face even after I made it clear I really hated that, and basically just shame every decision I made even though it was really none of her business what I did or didn't do outside of our dorm room.

There were a lot of other little things that bothered me like some boundary issues and annoying habits that she had. The thing is that Gray isn't a bad person, she just gets on my nerves so I kept my distance as much as possible.

At the end of the semester people started looking for new roommates and a lot of my friends came up to me to ask me what living with Gray was like and I was honest and told them about all the little things that she does that bothered me, personally. They all took my word and by the end Gray was desperate because no one would room with her anymore.

after that I haven't had much contact with her but every now and then someone I like will bring her up and I always end up telling them about the annoying things she does. I never make stuff up or lie and I try not to exaggerate it, but I don't want to lie and pretend like she's wonderful.

Anyways now I'm thinking that maybe it's a little unfair of me to scare people away from Gray just because I can't stand her. Like in my mind I'm just saving them the trouble of getting to know her before the crazy pops out but now I'm thinking that maybe it's none of my business what my friends think of her and I need to just keep my mouth shut.

If this helps at all I know a lot of other people that also can't stand her, so I'm inclined to believe that I'm not just making the whole thing up in my mind,she's actually annoying.

409,Not the A-hole,"Okay so. I (21F) have been with my boyfriend (22M) for just over 3 years. I have 4 horses and his sister (16F) has 3. She grazes them all at my parents’ place (where I live and have my own horses). We agreed to one horse and no charge for grazing or hay. Somehow, that’s turned into 3! We never see a cent for the hay or grass consumed plus the sister can be extremely rude and cop an attitude (Typical 16yo but it still pisses me off). Whenever I say something, my BF threatens to leave me and says it’s not a big deal and to get over it. (He then makes it out like I have an issue with him or our relationship but I don’t and never have implied that I do when bringing this up). My parents agreed to the third horse on the condition that after 6 months, she sold one. That was in January, so it’s been 6 months! Sisters mum increased the allowed time...without ever actually consulting my parents! (Or me.). When I do try and talk to bf’s mum about it I get the same response from bf-tellingme to chill out and get over it. 
I’m pissed
I’m fcking mad actually, because horses are expensive and free grazing and hay for 3.... plus I look after them when she’s not there (often) and we take her and her horses to shows, also without charging them for petrol!! 
Another thing; bf’s sister is old enough to learn to drive or at LEAST old enough to catch the bus but she won’t do either and when her mom can’t bring her out to the barn, she doesn’t come. Which would be fine. Except it’s not because I get stuck looking after her horses with no reimbursement. 
Extra info but idk if it’s relevant: I have fairly severe mental health issues and have spent a lot of time in hospital. My bf and his family have always been amazing about it and done a LOT for me in that respect hence why I’m so reluctant to fuss. My parents feel the same for the same reason 
EDIT INFO: I’ve had serious mental health issues and been hospitalised a lot but it’s been almost 2 years since I was last admitted and I’m no longer under any sort of care, I work and function as normal on my own. Aka im recovered. 
AITA??????

410,No A-holes here,"So I was out for my morning coffee this morning and stopped afterwards to get some cash out of the ATM. Just as I got to the ATM there was a mother pulling up with a kid ~7 years old and a pram with (presumably) another young child in there. 

As I got into line behind her (it was just me and her), she was fiddling around on her phone, not really making any effort to get her card out or anything. After about 10-15 seconds she gets the card out, but then she gets the 7 year old to press all the buttons for her, which as you can imagine took forever. She had to tell him each individual number in her PIN (I had headphones in and didn't hear the numbers) and every number he'd hover his finger above it and look back up for confirmation. Same for the amount, confirming, etc etc.

Obviously it'd be rude to just watch the numbers intently, so partly to halt my rising frustration and out of politeness I really tuned it out. About a minute later I look up and she's back to just standing in front of the ATM playing with her phone and the kid just playing with the buttons.

She'd never acknowledged my presence so I came forward and said ""are you done?"". I guess a lot comes down to my tone, and I was clearly a bit annoyed, and that tends to make me a bit snarky. She replied with ""oh you go ahead"", which I did, and was done in about 20 seconds.

As I go to leave I hear what I'm sure many of you probably suspect, ""ok let's give it another go"".

Yeah I felt horrible, clearly she wasn't 'playing on her phone', she was doing things on her account so she could withdraw money, and I'd snarkily asked her to let me get mine done. I'd like to think it would have clicked with me sooner if not for getting the kid to press all the buttons, but I don't know.

Almost immediately after buying our house his younger brother moved in with us and has been here for about eight months; he’s a great roommate and pulls his weight around the house. About 2 months ago my SIL decided she needed a new start and she moved in with us (also a great roommate) now that my husband and his two siblings are living here his parents decided to move here also.

We’re in Canada so today we had a BBQ for the Canada day long weekend, because most people wanted tomorrow to stay home and relax so we hosted a day in advance rather than the day of Canada day. My brother knew we were having people over. Everyone came over around 4. 

Anyways my brother called to get a ride home at 6. My parents had already had too much to drink so they couldn’t go get him. They asked me to. I had much less to drink, but I did have 2 full cocktails.

422,Everyone Sucks,"Edit: Stepdaughter's **wedding**, I guess I accidentally tried to change it when I was reading over it to BPD or something?

&#x200B;

My stepdaughter (41f) and I (68m) have always had a rough relationship, but I love her just as much as my own daughter and sons. She’s getting married to a questionable guy (45?m) in about two weeks, after a **long** on-and-off relationship with him. I have my doubts about him, but that would be too long for this post. They have a son (23m) together, and he's diagnosed with BPD and low-functioning Autism. Since he was born, his parents have been nonstop enabling him. Whenever he would throw a temper tantrum, which was often, my stepdaughter would just bend over backwards to give him what he wants, even when it's far from financially viable for their household. She's also a loud-and-proud antivaxxer.

&#x200B;

When she approached her mother and I asking for her extravagant wedding to be paid, I was unsure. The wedding cost is in the high 5-figures. My wife (67f) doesn't work so I would be footing the bill. I can pay it, but it would throw a major wrench in my retirement plans. I'm planning on retiring in the next two years but that wouldn't be possible if I paid. Still I accepted, with the caveat that they put their son on a therapy plan. Initially, a few months ago, they agreed, but as the wedding date got closer they did absolutely nothing. In fact, if anything the son has been extra rude to me lately, calling me names when my wife/stepdaughter was around-- some of which were racially charged.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I really don’t want to pay for that wedding anymore. My wife thinks I'm the asshole because I paid for my own daughter's wedding. However I don't think that's a fair comparison. My daughter's wedding cost about $5,000 and was a quite modest event, although we all had fun. My stepdaughter's wedding would cost nearly twenty times that. Let me reiterate that I love my stepdaughter the same, and that I have absolutely nothing against people with Autism, or BPD as long as they seek treatment. But she's booked all the concessions already, so if I'm not paying for it it's likely she'll have to file for bankruptcy. She doesn't know yet. Reddit, am I the asshole?",41,48,0.9
423,Not the A-hole,"At the company I’m at (part of a statewide chain), I’m in a position where I’m on the phone, dealing with and helping customers. One of my coworkers, Hal, is 58 and has been with the company for 15 years; I have worked with him 4 of those years. He’s very close friends with our manager and is held in high respect due to his long time at the company and solid performance.

For the first two years I knew him, he was perfectly normal. But over the past two years, we all started to notice a change in his behavior/personality/performance. Conversations with him started to become very awkward and unusual; he started to become extremely forgetful, slow, and clumsy; he began to say things that were offensive/inappropriate without even realizing it; and just in general, it was clear there was something “off” with him that wasn’t off before.

A little under a year ago, it came out that Hal was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s. He is super private about the whole thing and refuses to talk about it with anyone. He has a very strong work ethic, is very bent on keeping his job and making all the money he can until he’s absolutely unable to work anymore. My manager (who is very close friends with Hal) has been supportive of Hal’s continued employment. Corporate does **not** know about Hal’s condition as far as I’m aware, and he’s tried to keep it as much of a secret as possible.

I respect Hal’s devotion to his job, but in the past year, he has been racking up an unbelievable number of complaints from customers. I know because complaints circulate pretty quickly where I work, and many people have called to complain to me about him. He often won’t be able to answer basic questions or provide information to customers; he’ll forget people’s info and make them repeat it over and over; and just seems slow and out of it in general. Customers have been questioning “what’s wrong with that man” and some have used quite choice words to describe him.

Despite this, my manager has kept Hal on board, and has told my coworkers who question this decision to mind their own business & “worry about themselves and their own performance.” Hal’s performance does affect us though; we have to deal with all the complaints and mad customers, and if our local branch loses business, that’s pretty shitty for all of us too. And while I’m very sympathetic towards Hal, I believe that someone shouldn’t be employed in a position if they can’t do the basic work required for that position.

I sent an anonymous email to our company’s corporate leadership, explaining Hal’s condition and how it’s affected his performance. Soon afterwards, he ended up being terminated (I assume with benefits and a severance package, considering the situation). My manager is furious about the whole thing and has been yearning to know which one of us “ratted him out.” I feel I did the right thing. Was I the asshole to “rat” Hal out?",1319,2945,0.94

One of my mid level employees, mid-20s F, has unmm.. shall we say, become a bit clingy?

I started out thinking her motivation was to get ahead by kissing up to me. For instance one time our c-level execs came to town and after a long meeting I took them to have drinks at a beer garden down the block. My employee showed up and instead of politely saying hi and leaving to do her own thing, she sat down at the table and ordered and started drinking with us. It would have been fine except she said a few things during the visit that didn’t sit completely well. Nothing horrendous but one of the execs did bring it up to me after, and definitely stepped outside of her role coming to socialize in a situation none of her peers had been invited to, which did not win her any hearts.

Anyways, this continued in weird ways- like following me on social media and sending me DM comments etc. At one point I ran into her out with my cousin and close friend and she did kind of the same thing as with the execs and just hung out with us- subsequently she has my cousin on social media too!

(And yes I did have a talk about both of these incidents with her after the fact) 

I could go on with examples but I’ll cut to the chase. On the weekends and sometimes evenings on the side I teach yoga at a studio in my neighborhood. It’s something I love, both the practice AND teaching. I find teaching to continuously challenge me in new ways and find it really rewarding, and I’m close with the other women who work there who are all around my age. Anyway my studio has a nice view so Friday I took a pic in front of the windows during sunset and posted it to my story. Within two minutes I get a DM from employee saying how cool the shot was and asking to come take my class. 

I try to make work fun for everyone and am pretty relaxed in my management style. I’m not sure if this has misled her to think we are friends or something. But yoga is my escape and my stress free zone and I wouldn’t want any coworker there because it really is the one time I’m not thinking about the job. This plus the fact I already feel a little like she’s creeping into my personal life has been really bothering me. I’m friends with most of the women at the studio so this does feel like it’s her stepping into my personal space once again. 

After seeking advice from a friend it was pointed out to me that I don’t own the studio and anyone who pays can come to the classes there. I can’t control what my employee does outside of work either. And, that trying to do so may create more problems than it solves. 

But I want to tell her I don’t think it’s appropriate for her to attend my class and my studio. WIBTA??",37,155,0.95

2. Any item in the middle of a road is garbage. I can’t just place, say, a cardboard box in the middle of the road, so I don’t think this sign should be any different. The owners of the sign forfeited their ownership by placing it where they did

I started my party at my house about 3 hours before all of this went down. It was very much a ""invite your SOs and we'll have some beers"" sort of thing. So I got the BBQ started, grabbed a few pints for some people that were showing up and started to loosen up a bit. My friend whom I have known for the last 15 years shows up with her new girlfriend after about an hour and a half from when I started the party. There's about 15-20 people over now, drinks are flowing and BBQ is being eaten. I saw Sally and said hi like I usually do ""what's up dude, how's life?"" and she told me how they came back from some trip last week and it was cool and all that. She introduced me to her girlfriend and this is where it gets a little weird.

I say ""hey what's up dude?"" to Mandy very casually and she gives me a weird look and says ""...I'm not a *dude*"". So I quickly apologized and just said I call everyone that, even my wife. Sure enough 2 seconds later as if it was a sign, my wife comes over and says to me ""hey dude we need some more hot dogs"" and she quickly introduced herself and left. I turned to Mandy and again quickly apologized and told her I was sorry if it came across weird and that I hope I didn't hurt her feelings(this was heartfelt, it could not have come across as bitchy or as a jab I assure you) then I made myself scarce. I find out about 25 minutes later that she's telling anyone who will listen that I'm misidentifying her and not making her feel welcome by misgendering her. I walked up to her and told her it was not my intention to make her feel unwelcome, I apologized and explained I just call everyone dude and that it wasn't personal but then right after that Sally comes over and starts telling me what her girlfriend told everyone else and that she agrees with Mandy.

ONCE AGAIN I apologized and Sally and Mandy left in a huff leaving me flabbergasted and having about half my guests come to me and tell me she was overreacting and the other half agreeing with Mandy. About 1/4th of my guests have left my party already so this is very upsetting to me. 

She made her feelings very clear on what I said, I quickly apologized and explained it was not my intention to not make her feel welcome and I'm sorry if I hurt her feelings. I hoped we could just enjoy the night after but to be honest I think she overreacted and it really messed up my party because now the mood is down and I am missing about 6 or 7 people who showed up earlier. 50% agree with me and 50% don't so AITA?",899,2327,0.92

I was always taught that it’s rude to just stare at someone without reason, so my eyes kind of just directed themselves towards the wall adjacent to our table during this period of awkward silence. It’s important to note that he didn’t try to start up a new conversation, either.

Then he told me, “You seem to be really interested in that wall...” with an annoyed tone. He seemed to be upset that I wasn’t talking to him but luckily, our food arrived and I began talking about the food, I guess.

Before dinner my grandma always makes a big deal of saying grace, I sit their quitly and respectfully but don't say grace along with them. At the last dinner my grandma pulled me aside and asked me to say grace with them because my nephew's see me sitting there not saying grace and then according to her think it's cool not to say grace. I told her respectfully that I won't say grace, if my sister wants to raise her boys Christian that is absolutely her choice and I won't say anything negative about their religion around them but I'm also not going to help indoctrinate my nephew's into a religion I despise. Que grandma tearing up and my family saying I'm an asshole why can't I just say grace etc. Now imo I did nothing wrong, they have their beliefs I don't agree with them but I respect them and their right to have them. If the shoe was on the other foot and I invited them to a dinner at my house I would never ask my grandma not to say grace so I am I the asshole here?",52,43,0.79
439,Not the A-hole,"Sometimes I have to go to a cousin’s house an they have a *big* dog. No, I don’t have allergies or anything. In fact, normally I’m a dog person but this dog is different. I don’t know what its deal is but even after multiple times trying to connect with him, or professionals trying to train the dog, it will bark like hell, pee like crazy, and *try* to attack me on sight. It’s been like this for a long ass time. 

The final straw was when they decided they wanted the dog to like me (again, it’s been years and nothing). I had to go on a walk with my cousin, who would hold his leash. For the entire duration of the walk I would have to stand like 10 feet away from her because even after giving him dozens of treats he acts as if I had just murdered his owner in front of him.

After getting back to their house and doing a pathetic game of fetch with him (I would have to back out of sight before she let him chase after the ball), the dog seemed to cool down. I thought I may have been safe. So after I tossed him a treat (I have to give him treats from a distance or else he would bite me) he ran off his leash, ran straight to me barking like a maniac and attacked me. I couldn’t run away (because that dog is fast), and I knew I couldn’t kick it or anything or else I would be forever painted as the “bad guy”. After like 15 seconds of trying to avoid it they finally got ahold of his leash. And put him in his cage.

Afterwards, they said they wanted to try a few more things to make him more friendly but I said I had enough and waited in the car 

I don’t want to deal with him anymore, so WIBTA if I told them to put him somewhere if I had to come over for a family event or anything? I would be fine with paying a *piece* of the cost but I refuse to come over if that monster is still there. And no, a cage wouldn’t work. It even barks and shakes its cage a ton if I’m even on the same floor! Hell even if he knows I’m there he will bark.

TLDR: Cousin’s dog is incredibly aggressive to me and recently attacked me. I want them to put it in a daycare or something if I come over. WIBTA

Recently we got a new student in our school. His family is from Spain but moved to Argentina. I was excited but then I saw her  last name, Boluda. Now in Spain that is a normal last name, but in Argentina Boluda is a curse word ( it means idiot or stupid ).

This obviously caused problems, every time I call her people think I’m insulting her, their classmates laugh when I say her last name ( I need to say her last name every morning when I take the presence of every student ), and now my students insulte each other and when I tell them not to they say “ I wasn’t cursing I was calling [ her name ]”.

I spoke to the parents and told them I would have to call her by her second last name. They were really angry about it, they told me I couldn’t prohibit her daughter from using her last name. I know it may be bad but her name is causing a lot of problem in the class and I fear that their classmates will bully her because of it.",82,282,0.97

443,Not the A-hole,"Last year in August my mother-in-law started dating her current boyfriend. From the very beginning he tried separating the family by conflicts, but no one seemed to notice untill I made them clear what he was doing. He also keeps all focus on him when he's in the room and likes to belittle everyone, especially my sister-in-law and my boyfriend. He's also very condescending towards my boyfriend and his siblings. Mother-in-law didn't notice this and even put this man before her own children. She spoils his little children and doesn't even give her own children (17 to 22) the attention they need. My boyfriend suffers greatly in situation but has never had the guts to do something about it.

In November I told her the man was poisoning the family and she had to be careful not to neglect her children emotionally. I also made clear how he supported her becoming an alcoholic and how he always tried to demonise her children to make him look better in her eyes.

She banished me from her home untill I would apologize, but I won't apologize for something I didn't do wrong in my opinion. Nothing has changed since. I tried to help my boyfriend as he was deeply hurt and his home became unbearable to live. She states to everyone I have attacked her motherhood and twists my words so they seem as if she's the victim of the whole situation.

Above all this I've been helping her for years with the housekeeping and cooking because of her severe scoliosis. I never got any thanks or any other conduct of gratefulness. My boyfriend once had a fight with her and she even called me a burden.

Next Saturday we're going to my boyfriend's grandparents party. This will be the first time I'll be confronted with my mother-in-law since November. I'm preparing myself emotionally which makes me question a little bit if I haven't gone too far.",22,29,0.93
444,Not the A-hole,"Earlier today, when my in laws came over just to drop off our older son (he stayed the weekend with them), we were standing in the kitchen chatting. My father in law then walked into our living room, and looked around for our remote and turned the TV volume way down. Our younger son was in the LR watching Mickey and eating his lunch before nap time. 

FIL does not have hearing issues, and our kitchen is a fair distance from the TV, which wasn't hardly loud at all to begin with. 

It was the oddest thing to do in someone else's home, without saying a single thing. So I said ""Can you not turn the TV down? *son* is watching it.""

He blew up. How dare I talk to him like that, I should respect my elders, he's just ""turning it down so *son* doesn't get hearing damage""

I just said ""It's my home and I'll have my own TV set to a volume I see fit""

They left, and now I'm the big bad mean wife/mom for saying something.

AITA for asking him to leave it alone?



TL;DR:. FIL turned the TV volume down in my house without reason or even asking me, and I asked him not to.

445,Not the A-hole,"Mine and my sister’s families are very close. Our kids are more like siblings than cousins. My eldest niece got engaged, and we were all thrilled for her. My daughter and I spent hours on the phone with her helping her with early wedding planning. My niece even mentioned to my daughter that she was having a hard time finding enough bridesmaids because many of her friends are pregnant.

Then we all stared finding out who my niece had chosen to be in the wedding party. Everyone in the family was included except for my daughter. My niece asked me and her two sisters to be bridesmaids, asked my son to be a groomsman, included her parents of course, and even asked my ex (who has been estranged from my side of the family since the divorce) to be the usher. She made a wedding website with photos/descriptions of all of the people in the wedding party. My daughter is the only one not on there. 

My niece didn’t directly tell my daughter that she wasn’t included. Instead she created a text group with all of the women in our families except for my daughter to plan hair/makeup/etc for the day of. My daughter was with me and my other nieces when we got the text and didn’t have her phone on her, so she assumed she was included as well. Turns out she wasn’t. When I reached out to my niece for clarification, she stated that my daughter was not going to be included. When I asked her if my daughter could at least get ready alongside us in the bridal suite (doing her own hair and makeup), my niece said no. Her exact words were “there won’t be any room for her.”

My daughter is understandably crushed and has no idea why she would be the only one not included. When she and my niece finally spoke about it, my niece wouldn’t explain why she had done this or apologize. Her only words were “It was my decision to make. I’m sorry that you feel upset about it. I hope you can get over it.”

I never saw my niece as a mean person but I am questioning my view of her now. I don’t want to participate in a wedding where my daughter has been singled out/excluded for no real reason. I can’t think of anything my daughter could have done to offend my niece. It seems that my niece can’t come up with a single reason for excluding her either.

When my niece asked me to be a bridesmaid, I didn’t know that she was planning on asking everyone else in the family except for my daughter. I wouldn’t have accepted if I had known this.  Am I the asshole if I tell my niece that I won’t be able to fulfill my commitment as a bridesmaid and just attend as a guest? 

I’ve already posed this with my daughter and she thinks that me and her brother should both still participate because she doesn’t want to be blamed for our dropping out. If I do decide not to participate, I will be making it clear to my niece that it was 100% my decision to drop out because I feel personally disrespected that she would treat my daughter this way.

Recently she had some tiff with her roommate and decided to move out and has been selling stuff online. After trying to sell a two year old couch for a week, she slashed the price to $40 and had a buyer. After communicating with him and making plans for him to pick it up, she decided to up the price, saying that she’s “still learning” how to sell shit online and she should “advocate for herself” and ask for more. She asked my opinion so I was honest and said that it would have pissed me off. I also asked her how she would feel if that happened to her. After trying to defend her actions I said “I know it’s hard for you to admit you’re wrong, but in this case I think you should.” She continued making excuses and the conversation abruptly ended. 

There have been big things that have happened in her life and she’s always blamed other people - a bad breakup, issues with her school, “friend” breakups, job issues, etc. She’s never admitted fault in any of these life events but I think she should think about where she may have been accountable.

450,Not the A-hole,"My dad used to work in a facility that provided housing, schooling, and mental/physical treatment for disabled people. I used to spend a lot of time in that facility as a kid, but I don't have a lot of memories from there. 

Yesterday I was sent a friend request on FB by an American girl. Turns out she's a former patient my dad drove around back in the day. I didn't think much of it, so I allowed the initial convo to end. Not much later, dad msged me:

""A girl from the facility will add you on fb today. She wants to learn Hungarian. Texting is difficult for her as her hands don't work properly. Says she remembers you""

At that point, I was visiting distant relatives, so the girl slipped my mind. I just got back home today. I should add that currently I'm very busy myself. I'm awaiting response from the colleges I applied to, starting a new job soon, and I'm scheduled to move house as well. Add that on top of having to upkeep my relationship with relatives, and having to put up with the bullshit of my narc mom, sis, and Edad, WHILE trying to be a supportive girlfriend for my fiancé who is going through a tough time. My plate is full. 

She called me today while I was omw home. Tbh, I have no clue what she was saying. Partly due to her accent, and partly because I was walking on a windy bridge. I politely told her I would call her back later, which she seemed okay with.

I get home and start unpacking when she messages me, saying hi. I knew she would want a full conversation, so I excused myself and said I just got home from a trip, and asked if we could chat later. She tries to call me. I rejected the call and explained that I'm busy right now and can't talk, but promised to get back to her as soon as I could.

She starts begging me to become a part of the support system. In a panic I reassured her that I would, I just need some time to settle down first. I even set a timer for myself, so I could call her back ASAP. 

I kept my promise, called her back and she begged me again to become a part of her support system. I said yes, out of guilt.

I think she has cerebral palsy or sth similar. But I know for sure is that I'm not ready to teach Hungarian to a person who I can barely understand, and who probably has problems understanding what I'm telling them, too. I  don't have the patience or skillset to deal with someone like this. 

This whole thing feels like someone decided that they could shrug the responsibility of chatting with this girl onto me for brownie points. If I tried to protest, they would tell me I should do it out of kindness, since I don't have much else to fill up my time anyway.

My grandma randomly stopped all contact with my dad when he was in his early twenties. She had bipolar issues. 

I grew up without knowing this grandma and never met her. I know little to nothing about her, and she is just a name to me. 

My grandma recently reached out to my mother by adding her on facebook. My grandma contacted my mother since my dad left my family when I was 14, and I haven't seen him since. Seems to run in the family, huh? 

My grandma called my mother and wanted my personal information. She supposedly wanted to put me in her will. That's fine. However, my mother gave her my information, including my social security, without contacting me. 

When my mother was telling me about  talking with my grandma, discussing the will, and giving out my social, I told her I would have preferred her to call or text me about the situation before she gave it out. She said that that's why she was telling me now.


Again, I told her to tell me about these things before she gives out my social. She started throwing a fit. She asked if I would have preferred to not get put on the will at all, because my grandma would have never called me to ask for the information.

I told her yes. If my own grandma couldn't call me to ask about that information, then I don't want to be a part of her will. And plus, I've never even had contact with her in the first place, and she's my grandma! She really couldn't woman up and call me for the first time in my life? ok. 

At the very least, I told my mom that she could have contacted me before she gave her my personal information. She started throwing a fit, saying ""what's a 70 year old going to do with your social security?""

Again, at this point, my grandma is a random person to me, that's had severe mental issues in the past. In general, I don't want my mother giving out my ss without me knowing, even if the person is family and is mentally stable. It's my fucking personal information. 

My mother continued her fit. She acted insulted and as if I was a disgusting person. She then stormed off. 

My mother and I have issues all the time. I can't stand her, and this is just one more thing that we have to fight about. I wasn't even making it a big deal.

My friend recently got this butt procedure done in Mexico for cosmetic reasons. I personally thought it was a little unnecessary but I try to be a good friend and support her regardless. 

She ended up inviting me to come stay at a hotel with her for a week while she recovered. Then we would fly home together. I am a teacher and have summers off so I agreed to do it. There was no mention of money. (Because my husband happens for an airline, I hardly ever pay for flights, so the plane tickets were covered). 

I get there and the hotel suite my friend rented is beautiful. I have my own room and everything. But my friend was in no position to do much of anything. I had to basically play nurse as she couldn’t even use the restroom on her own. Whenever I got a chance, I would try to eat out and go swimming or explore, but since my friend needed me, my time was limited. I managed to squeeze in one hike and that’s it. Obviously, it was not exactly a traditional vacation for the reasons I’ve outlined. 

On our last day there, my friend asked me when I thought I could “pay her back” for half the cost of the suite. I’m like uhhhh excuse me?? Why would I pay you to play mommy/nurse for seven days?? She was pissed and we got into a big argument which obviously ruined the end of the trip.

My husband thinks it’s insane that she would ask me to pay her anything. However, a mutual friend of ours is on the side of the friend who had surgery. So I’m starting to doubt myself.

466,Not the A-hole,"This happened a couple weeks back, but it's still been on my mind. 

My dad is in his mid-forties and recently experienced a heart attack at work. Fortunately, he made it to the ER before it got fatal. 

I recieved the news from my stepmom and she stayed with him in the hospital. She called me while there and I spoke briefly to my dad, he sounded fairly sedated on the phone (which seemed normal after recieving surgery). 

He texted me later updating me on the situation, saying they cleared the blockage and had him on nitroglycerin. I asked what the doctors thought ect. and said I was glad he was okay, I didn't get a response after that. I don't know what nitroglycerin does, but after hearing they had him on it, and hearing how he sounded on the phone plus the lack of response, i assumed it was some type of sedative and he was out of it. 

I knew he was going to be returning the next day and figured I'd get a better opportunity to talk to him then.

Well, turns out he did not agree. He got home and before I had the chance to ask him anything I was lectured about how hurt he was and how ""fucked up"" it was that me and my sister didn't reach out more. 

(Side note, my sister didn't reach out because of issues that arose prior to the incident. Our father kicked me out of my house without a phone or anywhere to go, and said he was ""disowning"" me and my sister due to a custody disagreement with my mom. This obviously upset her, because of what he said and because of how he treated her younger brother. I reached out regardless though because i'm not quite as blunt as her, and I still care for him.)

(He also said that the stress caused by that situation is what caused the heart attack, but I believe it's the 30 years of alcohol consumption and past drug use. I didn't think much of it, but thinking now I think he said that to put the blame on my sister and mother.)

I apologized and told him I thought he wouldn't be able to talk much. I don't know what kind of state people are in after a heart attack, but I can't imagine it's a very talkative one, and my few conversations with him seemed to back that up. Even after trying to explain myself and apologizing, he didn't let up.

My stepmom then created a group chat with me, my sister, and my half sister (M), for the sole purpose of saying, ""Thank you M for all your texts and calls, it meant a lot to your father.""

In the history, I’ve been noticing some searches in google images for some NSFW stuff. I only live with my mom and my dad so...it’s probably my dad. 

I don’t want him to click on some shitty website and get a virus. (Neither of my parents know how tf technology works). So I’ve been thinking about setting up some parental blocks.  Not on all porn. Just sketchy shit.

469,Asshole,"So I (25F) am getting married this October. Choosing my wedding party was tough because I had 3 really close friends growing up. One of them (Caty), was basically my best friend all throughout school. Caty, me, and our friend Lauren did everything together in high school. Later on, we became really close with Lauren's friend Anna as well. Caty and I were still close in college, but since then we've sort of drifted apart since we both went to grad school in different states. I see Lauren and Anna more frequently because they live close to me, but I don’t see Caty outside of planned get togethers. As a result, when I got engaged last fall, I asked Lauren and Anna to be in the wedding (Lauren’s the MOH), but I didn't ask Caty.

I didn't really think anything of it, but a couple months later, Lauren asked me if I'd talked to Caty. I said I hadn't and Lauren (gently) said that I should at least reach out to Caty since no one really understood why I’d excluded her from the bridal party. So I called Caty, we talked and she seemed really understanding about the wedding party. I also told Caty that she was really the only non-bridal party friend I wanted at the bachelorette party, but explained that I was afraid of drama with my cousin if I opened it up beyond the bridal party (my cousin’s a drama queen). It was easier to just say “bridal party only.” Caty said that if I wanted her to be there, she would love to come and I told her I hadn’t decided yet but I’d tell her when I did.

The more I thought about it, the more I realized that I didn't want Caty to feel more left out because she would be the only one in the bachelorette party who wasn’t in the wedding. So I told Lauren to go ahead planning the bachelorette party and to keep it wedding-party only. The thing is...I never actually told Caty I decided not to invite her.

So yesterday was my bridal shower and Caty, Anna and Lauren were all there. Later that night, we were hanging out at Lauren's house and Anna started talking about the bachelorette party. I guess she didn't know that Caty wasn't invited and assumed Caty was invited and going. Lauren was looking at me kind of panicked, but I didn't want to call attention to it and make it more awkward, so Anna kept talking about how much fun the bachelorette party was going to be. Caty didn't say anything, but eventually, she excused herself and when she came back, her eyes were really red. Still, she didn’t bring it up when she drove me home later so I figured she was probably fine.

So: AITA for not inviting her to the bachelorette party, and not telling her that she wasn't invited? I figured if she was there it would just be extra awkward because she'd be the only one not in the bridal party. But Caty didn't do anything wrong and I feel bad that she had to find out because Anna brought it up.

Edit: wow, ok, I get it. ITA. I can be pretty oblivious and I honestly didn’t think we were close anymore so I didn’t think she would care (also, with my cousin - I was at her bachelorette party so I wanted to be able to draw a clean line for why I wasn't opening up the bachelorette party, but other than that, i have no defense. I just hate confrontation). Clearly, though, I hurt her a lot more deeply than I thought. I’m going to call Caty tonight and apologize. I’d do it face to face, but I live in Virginia and she lives on the West Coast, so it’ll have to be by phone.",249,575,0.86
470,Asshole,"At a Mexican restaurant for lunch. The menu is book style, and had several pages. One of which was their “lunch menu”. (It was not a loose insert). My husband orders the “lunch fajitas” (he said exactly that to the waitress). They were 9.95 on the lunch menu. 

We get the bill and we were charged 16.99. When we point this out for the cashier to adjust, she points out the VERY small writing that says the lunch menu is only valid M-F at certain times (we were there Saturday). I’m visibly annoyed but I pay the amount and tell her that they should not put a menu out on the weekends for prices that aren’t available. My husband even said he wanted the “lunch fajitas” and she should have pointed it out that the lunch prices were only available during the week.

I’m generally a good tipper (20% and usually regardless of service). However, this time, BECAUSE my husband was specific about ordering the “lunch fajitas” and she never said anything, AND the writing was so small about the weekday limits, I tipped her $5 on a $60 bill (about 8%). Am I the asshole for shorting her since it’s the restaurants fault for the menu but it was her fault she didn’t tell us?

Edit: for clarification, we were there for lunch. We weren’t trying to order special priced lunch items at dinner. Also, it was labeled “lunch menu” and didn’t say “lunch specials” or anything else to make it obvious it was special pricing. BOTH my husband and I missed the disclaimer because of how it was placed and size. It was about a 10 font (if that). The menu was super colorful and the contrast of the font made it even more difficult to see.

Edit 2: I just asked my husband if he pointed to the lunch menu when asking for the fajitas and no joke, he did. He pointed to the lunch fajitas, said “lunch fajitas” and he was not informed that the price wouldn’t be valid.",265,225,0.87
471,No A-holes here,"My stepsister and I have been dating for around two and a half years. For the most part we try to act pretty casually about it and try not to bring up the fact we're step-siblings to people who know we're dating. We don't actively hide it like it's something to be ashamed of, but we don't bring it up either.

Our parents didn't know for a while, we just never got around to telling them to prevent it from feeling awkward. However, they finally found out around a month ago and they were PISSED. We tried as hard as possible to be calm and  understanding, and assured them we weren't doing anything irresponsible and that our relationship is perfectly healthy.

However, they just weren't having any of it, and continued to be furious with us, and made claims about how our relationship was everything from incestuous to irresponsible to destructive, etc. We left after that point and our relationship with our parents has been really strained since.

Nothing about our relationsip is unhealthy or like some kinda porno sibling fantasy. We were both over eighteen when we started dating. There wasn't any manipulation or coercion involved. We're best friends who genuinely love each other, and we consider ourselves partners in life. And again, we are STEP-siblings.

We really tried to be understanding of our parent's fears and worries, and tried to calmly explain why everything is okay and that we're both fine and happy, but nothing we did got through to them. We talked to some of our friends about it and they said that while they don't think our relationship is a problem, its unreasonable for us to think it could ever be okay for our parents.

Again, I get that it might feel weird and all, but its our lives to live and there's nothing wrong with what we're doing and we're both happy. I could understand being mad about us not telling them for so long, but that's not at all why they're mad us. Are we really the assholes for (patiently I might add) expecting our parents to accept our relationship?

EDIT: She's only a year older than me, our parents got together when I was ten. We felt more like best friends than siblings growing up and we even waited until we were both eighteen to start seriously dating to make it feel less weird.",155,182,0.84
472,Not the A-hole,"Apologies if this makes little sense, as I've had a pretty rough month and my head's all over the place at the moment.

On Thursday, I quit my job on the spot after being treated like absolute shit for weeks. I had the job since January, but 3 weeks ago, a new manager was hired who absolutely fucking hated me, for no discernable reason. She cancelled my holidays that I had signed off since March, bullied me in front of customers and coworkers, and threatened to fire me, amongst other things, when we were on our own.

I reported her to HR after the first week of her being here, which nothing came of, nor did I even have a response. The final straw came on Thursday, after she said something to me that I won't repeat here, leading me to quit on the spot (never done this before, and I've always had a job since high school)

Completely deflated and upset, I was invited out by some friends to a BBQ Saturday night. I figured hey, seeing some friends might cheer me up a bit. I go to the gathering and have a good time, until I mention what happened with my work.

When I told one ""friend"" I resigned on the spot, they were completely shocked and told me what a shitty thing it is to do to quit like that, asking me ""how are you going to feed yourself now?"", that I shouldn't be so soft, and so on and so forth, despite me explaining to them why I left and the things that had occurred to me there. It turned my mood completely sour and made me feel even shittier than before.

Overhearing our conversation, two more people listened to what I had to say and were visibly shocked at what I was telling them about my job. However, they didn't really have a chance to talk to me, as my ""friend"" was going on about how being unemployed is shameful (I've been unemployed for a grand total of one working day so far).

At this point, I'm even more upset, angry, and honestly just sad. Mid sentence, I walk away from the conversation and leave without speaking to anyone. 

I haven't spoken to any of them since, despite having about 10 missed calls from people at the event, none of which I have responded to yet.

473,Not the A-hole,"I recently posted something here and someone has pointed out something that kind of makes me question my well-meaning intention. 

Here's the link to my original post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/c7dti7/aita_for_telling_a_guy_of_because_he_accused_me/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

So I am 25 male who has been in a relationship with this guy for 7 years now. I don't really relate to popular gay culture. So I don't enjoy things like cross-dressing.  I am not feminine etc. My bf on the other hand is the opposite of me. 

When we first met, he was (somewhat) openly gay. You could tell by how he behaved. He wore what you call flamboyant outfits and hanged out at underground gay bars, and places which were not exclusively gay but gay people love to hang out at. 

I found myself falling for him despite our differences. But his being gay has many times got us in trouble. We live in a small city where people are so religious in a country that is not widely/openly accepting of homosexuality. In short, being (openly) gay means you are prone to discriminations, harrassment, and even violence here. 

Because I cared about him, I told him to TONE IT DOWN a little. Especially in public places. He could be as gay as possible in the right places at the right time. He could be gay af without drawing too many unwanted attentions to himself. He was hesitant but he understood I meant him no disrespect. He knew I was right. I did not ask him to change who he was. I asked him to adjust to our harsh and homophobic society because that's the only way for gay people to accomodate living their lives in peace here. Or we can always start pack our things and move to the US. 

But apparently some of the commentators think I am the asshole for telling him to 'leave his normal-self behind' and to be 'more like me'. I did not ask him to change who or what he was. His true self was what made me fall in love with him. 
What I asked was solely based on my love for him. I wanted him to stay himself and be safe. And we gotta play smart here. It was not like us denying who we are, or me denying who he is, because society will never accept us. But it was about staying true to yourself in a smart way and being safe in a society where gay people are very often discriminated against, treated horribly and even denied of their basic human rights. 

Am I The Asshole?

EDIT : I was and am not in any way embarrassed of him. Don't get me wrong. If I had been, I would have said no when he asked for my number when we first met. I love him so much and want him to be safe that's all. I just want him to play smart, not change who he is for anybody, even me. I have never like forced him to do whatever he did not feel like having to do at all.
I explained it to him and he understood. He did not think I was embarrassed of him being gay af.",54,120,0.87

476,Not the A-hole,"I guess this is more are 'we' the assholes.

I went to a pub to have a drink with a friend of mine, to catch up and discuss some ongoing issues in his life. I hadn't seen him for a while as he had taken indefinite leave from work due to mental health issues. He smokes, so we decided to sit in the beer garden with our drinks to chat. This beer garden has about 5 picnic tables, which could sit about 6 people on each. It was the middle of the day, so it wasn't particularly busy and we were sitting in the corner. 3 of the other tables were occupied but not full (similar to ours).

As my friend an I are speaking, a guy comes out of the pub carrying a drink and asks to sit on the same table as us. My friend said, verbatim, ""sorry, would it be possible to not as we're having a difficult conversation."" The guy looked taken aback but he walked away and sat on the table next to us where two guys were sitting. Honestly, I didn't really care if he sat with us or not but seeing as my friend was the one talking to me about personal issues, I understand why he didn't want him to. I also think, as other tables were free, it wasn't a huge issue and he did ask.

Fast forward about 5 minutes and one of the guys from the table that the man eventually ended up sitting on came over to the table and asked us if we had told the guy he couldn't sit with us. I explained the situation, that the guy asked us and we said if possible, could he sit somewhere else or on one of the vacant tables, as we're having a private conversation. He asked if we owned the table and began shouting at us and I shouted back, that he was being a twat and if the guy had an issue he could have said it in the moment rather then getting a stranger to defend him. The guy now at our table then insisted he wouldn't move and began to talk over us so we couldn't hear each other. An older man on one of the nearby tables gave him a thumbs up, as if to confirm his attitude/behaviour. We did eventually speak to the guys and deescalated the situation but AITA for asking him to sit elsewhere?

ETA: In case I've used the term 'beer garden' incorrectly. It's just an outdoor space for a pub with tables. The one we were in had tables like this:

We are on a family vacation at the moment and we had gone to a park where there were a lot of young families like my own. My 4 year old son has a new bike that he loves to ride around on and there was another family close by us that had also settled for a picnic like we had on the grass. They were pretty close by. 

My son is obsessed with his bike and loves it. He had been playing on it for a while, and the other family had a little girl his age that kept looking over. 

When we sat down to eat my son sat with me, the little girl came over and shyly asked my mom if she could play with the bike. My mom always says yes to everything, and she has this really blasé attitude towards belongings and she’s lost some of my sons stuff before that way because she just isn’t attached to material things.

I interrupted before my mom could speak and really gently told the little girl ‘why don’t you ask (my son) since it’s his bike?’ She did and my son said no. She looked a little crestfallen but went back to her family and she didn’t seem bothered afterwards. 

My entire family looked at my like I was an evil witch and even my own husbands facial expression was surprised at me. 

I got a little defensive and told them that it was our sons toy to lend out as he pleased, and I was a little irritated to hear my mom say to my son ‘honey, sometimes it’s nice to share’ because he looked upset afterwards. l know that, he knows that, but it’s his new toy and he shouldn’t be made to feel bad over not wanting to share with a total stranger.

Am I the Asshole?

I've been with my wife for over 20 years, we have an amazing child who is 2, we had him after many failed attempts at IVF. I love my wife dearly and I adore and love my little boy.

We are not by any means a wealthy couple although I earn just enough so my wife can be a stay home mom.

The whole pregnancy and birth of my son was pretty traumatic, my wife came close to dying twice.

Last year my wife told me that she wanted another baby, I was opposed to this for both health and financial reasons.

Also we live in a ""not very nice"" high crime area, I wish to move to provide a better environment for my son.

After some arguments and persuasion from my wife I agreed to have one more attempt at IVF, But we both agreed it would be our last attempt.

2 weeks ago we had the great news that we where having a baby, a week after that as part of the post transfer process we had another scan that advised that my wife had miscarried.

We are both still very numb from this news, but I've found out that my wife has contacted the IVF clinic to discuss going through the process again.

She has also discussed this with close friends, but not me.

I'm pretty upset about this and feel very betrayed.

I said idk and I sent him some article links. He didn’t respond to those and just asked if I was coming home soon so we could FaceTime.

I do not enjoy things like cross-dressing, I am not feminine and do not wear what you call flamboyant outfits. But if being gay simply means a person who engages in sexual activities with people of the same sex, then I am gay.

Now my bf is the opposite of me. He enjoys cross-dressing once in a while and is a little feminine. But we love each other the way we are so no problems there. 
He also has this circle of close gay friends who love to hang out together like once a week. Last week was my bf's birthday and he decided to invite these friends over for a little celebration at our apartment. 

One of these friends, Jake (not his real name) has been living abroad for a few years and was back in town so I do not really know him. He is a very outspoken and somewhat cynical guy. When my bf introduced me to him, he started bombarding me with a lot of questions about every aspect of my sexuality, which kind of made me feel uncomfortable.

He then asked why he had never seen me before, and my bf, bless his heart, told him that was because I never went to gay bars or places where gay people love to hang out. He then asked me why I, a gay man, do not associate myself with other gay men, so I told him, first I just don't really like being labelled as to allow everyone to define what I am or am not. Second,  I prefer keeping my private life private. 

He then said ""There is no such thing as a gay man living his life like a straight man. If you're gay, you're gay. You can't just walk around and give people the impression that you're straight while you still have a dick in your mouth every night in your bedroom. You're just living a lie.""

That really rubbed me the wrong way because I sensed it that he was calling me a hypocrite. So I told him that what I am or choose to be is none of his business. My sexual preference is merely a part of my self-identity. And I am in control of it in accordance with how I live my life. Not the other way around. If having a dick in my mouth means I am gay,  then I am gay indeed. But not because I identify with what most people and some gay people think is appropriately gay.""

He looked really offended and then left immediately. My bf thought I was being a little too harsh. Am I the Asshole?

EDIT : Now all of my bf's friends also think I am hypocritical based on their late night WA conversation, and I told bf that I don't give a shit about what they think but he said he gives a shit because it's between his good friends and me, the love of his life, and suggests that I be the bigger person and apologize for 'kicking him out'.  I, of course, said NO!

EDIT 2 : Thanks for one of you here who DMed me and accused me of posting a validation thread. This might sound like it is but believe me, a tiny itsy bitsy part of me is indeed feeling guilty because it was my bf's birthday and things were awkward after that one friend left, which completely ruined everyone's mood to celebrate more. So yeah I basically ruined my bf's birthday party.
Grammar.

EDIT 3 : Thanks to one of the commentators here who pointed it out to me that maybe bf's friends are just being jealous and upset that I somehow have influenced in him toning his gayness down a bit in recent years. He used to be more feminine and flamboyant but since we started dating I talked him into keeping it down a little. Not because I was ashamed of him, but because not everyone is as open as others when it comes to what is being perceived as 'normal'. I am from a small town where the people are so religious and not as accepting as those in bigger cities.

EDIT 4 : To everyone who does not understand. People here are crazily religious and homosexuality is not openly and widely accepted. Being gay means you are more prone to violence and denial of public privileges. I asked my bf to TONE IT DOWN for his own safety. I DID NOT force him to CHANGE HOW HE WAS. I love him and want to save him from harm and rejection because that's how it is living in this country as a gay person. And he understood my intention. He is openly gay and now knows better than to act 'all gay' in public places, which is my point actually.

EDIT 5 : To those who call me a homophobic gay guy it's okay. But at the end of the day I know and I get to decide what I am. Because I am the only one who understands me. My bf understood my well-meaning intention and is not making such a big fuss about it like some here. He knows exactly I love him and care about him. If he felt that I am forcing him to change himself or live a lie, or oppressing his freedom of expressing himself as a gay man, then he would have left me years ago.  We're still together and love each other and it's all that matters.",198,524,0.89

490,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend has missed a lot of events and dates that were important to me over the past couple of months. A few include:

-canceling my birthday dinner because he had a rough time at work and just wanted to cuddle at home 

-cancelling our anniversary dinner for the same reason and because he was worried about money

-dipping out of our RESCHEDULED anniversary celebrations because he had a headache 

-trying to back out of coming to a performance I worked on because he was so late (somehow managed to take 80 minutes to get from his work to the theatre, which for reference was about a 35 minute walk away, or 20 minutes in public transport). 

-canceling our plans to go to the pride parade because he had a stomach ache. 

-canceling several more casual dates because he didn’t feel like leaving the house 

If it was one or two instances of this, I would absolutely understand. I want to support my BF if he’s feeling sick or had a bad day. But it seems pretty much impossible to get him to go out; every time I manage to get him out of the house, we have a big fight about something stupid. When we stay home, no such issues. 

He keeps saying these things are out of his control; feeling sick or sad is not under his control. And I understand that, but it feels like he could still be making an effort to reschedule when he feels better, or at least be understanding about why I’m upset. Every time I bring the issue up and ask him to do better, he gets really defensive and refuses to admit that he has done anything wrong 

AITA for blaming him for being so flakey and wanting him to do better?

Edit: thanks for your comments everyone. I knew that we both struggle with depression sometimes, but honestly it had never even occurred to me that his cancelling would be because of it (especially since he seems perfectly content whenever we stay home, not depressive).",10,67,0.92
491,Asshole,"AITA? I’ve been dating my girlfriend for 6 months now and it’s been going great so far - I really feel like I’ve found the right person for me. But one thing that’s gotten to be a little overbearing is her absolute obsession with her college football team (I’ll leave the school out to avoid any bias).

Besides music, sports are what I live and breathe for. Just like her, I take a lot of pride in my team and consider myself more than just an average fan. But last night we got into an argument when I invited her to go visit my friend and his wife in September and she said she would have to check to see if there’s a home game that Saturday. I expressed my concern that she wouldn’t be willing to miss a single home game (there are 6 in a season) for something I wanted to do together and she got extremely upset and said I was being too controlling.

We’ve both been out of college for 5 years and her old campus isn’t even nearby... it’s in the next state. I totally understand being a die hard fan of your team because I am one. But at what point in your life should you prioritize that less than your relationship? She says going to those games is a tradition among her friends and they always went in high school and college. But my thing is, yeah so did everyone else who went to a major school. She definitely holds her fandom over my head as if I don’t understand (even though my team has 8 championships and hers only has 2 or 3, but they’ve been more recent - just sayin). I’m rambling a bit so I’ll just cut it off. But I’m seriously struggling here because we didn’t really resolve the argument that well and it’s still bothering me.

I guess it's been 8 or 9 years that I set up my mom and aunts Facebook accounts, for both I used the same password which I came to find out, neither has changed. They are so typical ""old people Facebook""  it's not even funny. 

They live two doors down from each other but haven't spoken in months over some slight that I don't really understand. I didn't want to get involved. But on Thursday my aunt posted a family picture and tagged my mom. This led to the most embarrassing old person flame war I've ever seen. It started off with jabs and deceased into accusations of each of the sleeping with different cousins growing up, my grandpa using lsd in the 60s, car wrecks, pet theft, illegimate children and other little things. Thier other siblings and cousins begged them to stop but then that woukd start side flame wars that caused other issues. 

Finally I had enough because they were talking around but still insulting me and my pregnant wife. Just to test it out, I logged into my moms, then my aunts and just deleted the picture and comment thread. Then I changed the password on each account. I went by and put a note on each of thier doors explaining I had thier accounts and I'd give them back when they grew up. I haven't heard from either of them.

496,No A-holes here,"I have lived with my sister for many months, and ofc been around her before that. Now that her kid is getting older, I have been getting concerned with how she's raising him. 
Context her only son is 7 almost 8 and she is a single mother. 

1. She still sleeps with him in her bed. He doesn't have his own bed or his own room, they completely share one. There is another room in the place, but she uses it as a guest bedroom instead. It has gotten to the point where he cant fall asleep unless someone else is in the room. 

2. There have been times where she will go; switch over laundry or take the trash out, and she doesnt tell her kid. When he looks around and can't find her he immediately panicks. ""Wheres mom"". The second she comes back he will run to her and hug her and say he misses her. There was a time where she was late coming come, while I was babysitting. She said she would be home at 12,and when 12 :30 hit her kid started throwing a fit about her being late and cried. Despite me telling him she said she would be late. 

3. She aids him in his panick by talking about her death. ""If I die you can go live with nana and granpa"". 

4. She speaks through her child when she doesnt want to do things like "" I dont think *insert childs name* would like that"" even though sometimes her kid will pipe up and say he wants to do it. She let's him do whatever, and helps him often. Sometimes when he cant find things he will literaly just stand wherever he is look around and go ""can you find it for me"" and she does, without fail everytime. 

I feel I should confront her. I may not be a doctor but this seems like textbook separation anxiety, and he is only 7. I have talked with my mom about it and she agrees that my sister may not see what's going on. I am just worried what this could do to a kid over time, because seeing a kid panick at such a young age about things that are not panick worthy is worrying.",165,740,0.96
497,Not the A-hole,"This could get convoluted so I'll just get right to the point: I became a father at 15, and a single father at 17. I won't waste too many characters explaining all of that, but basically high school gf and I were young and dumb, she never really took to mothering and decided that she didn't want to do it at all when presented with the choice of kid or university. By the time my kid was born both of my parents were already dead and my only immediate family were my sister, who is ten years older and who I lived with, and our brother, who is fifteen years older than me and lives abroad. 

As soon as I found out my baby's mother was pregnant, my sister made it very clear she doesn't care for babies and young children at all and, when my daughter was born she wasn't welcome in her home for more than an hour or two at a time and certainly not overnight. When her mother ditched our little girl, my sister basically told me to choose to keep my kid or keep living with her. Of course, I chose my daughter and we moved out. Sister entirely cut me out of her life, stating again that she doesn't like little kids. 

Now my daughter is 9. She's a wonderful kid, and I love her more than anything. Quite apparently, this is the age when she's stopped being a ""little kid"" in my sister's eyes because she's decided she doesn't mind being around her now and is trying to get involved in my life again. I've so far resisted all of her attempts because quite frankly I have no interest in being around her. I had an absolutely hellish time after she kicked me and my little girl out and I'm still angry that she cared more about not liking kids than she did about me. I didn't expect her to help with the child or anything, I get that she was my ""mistake"" for want of a better term and that I was responsible for her. But kicking me out and cutting off all contact hurt, especially when she was the only family that I had here, and in my mind she made it apparent there that she doesn't really care about me. Perhaps an important note is that she didn't apologise for any of this and feels like she doesn't have to. She's pretty upset that I want nothing to do with her any more, and has complained to our brother who's kinda trying to play peacemaker. I don't think I'm being unreasonable here but who knows, maybe I am. What do you lot, as strangers, think?

ETA: apparently relevant information, so I'll add it. Copy and pasted from a comment: what happened was literally that my kid's mum dropped her off with me one afternoon, was late for pick up, eventually called saying she wasn't coming back and by the next morning kiddo and I were homeless. She blocked me on everything, including my number, and my attempts to reach her through other people were shot down. She unblocked me after 18 months but still ignored my messages and calls.

ETA #2: because people are asking, I was planning on moving out when I turned 18, and when I say my sister kicked me out with no notice I mean she woke me at 6AM and told me I could take whatever I could pack into binbags within half an hour and then I had to get the fuck out of her house.",648,3070,0.96

502,No A-holes here,"I really need to help on this one because it’s been eating at my conscious.

A few years ago I decided to start sponsoring a child in Haiti, a little girl who is about 6 now. The sponsorship consists of just me paying $38 a month until she either turns 21 or leaves the program.

I was younger and more impulsive when I made this decision and only now as a college student working two jobs realizing that it’s actually more money than I thought, it’s one of my larger monthly expenses.

I took a trip to Haiti a while ago to see the program first hand for myself and I am certain that they are a good organization and that the donations actually help the kids sustain themselves.

I know that $38 doesn’t seem like a lot to many people but for me right now it would be nice to be able to save as much as I can until I get situated in the career I’m pursuing. I want to become a teacher because I am very passionate about helping children which is why this is so difficult!

The older the kids in the program are the LESS likely they are to be sponsored, with teens rarely ever getting sponsored, I want to believe that if I decided to stop sponsoring her right now that she would get a new sponsor fairly quickly.

So just give it to me straight: am I the asshole for wanting to back out of this commitment to focus on my own growth?

503,Not the A-hole,"More of an “are we the assholes”. My partner (26F) and I (28M) (both Aussie) aggressively spoke to a 70yo male American which caused him to leave the bar.

We had been sitting there in a quiet bar in Hue Vietnam, the bartenders are really friendly and chatted to us on and off. Then this loud af American guy comes in and only speaks to the female bartender who is fairly attractive. He says to her “You sit with me and I will buy 100 drinks. We sit and drink together”.

For the next hour he orders Long Island ice teas for himself and is trying to persuade the bartender to drink as quickly as possible. Without her being able to get a word in he also talks to her about America and how he can help get a visa etc below are some of the things he said.

“In America, you woman, him man both work in bar. You get paid exactly the same. That’s the law”

“The government pays you to study. If you come over you can get a job in any nail salon easily.”

“In my medium sized home town we have a shopping mall. You know the mall you have here every town in America has bigger one just as big”.

“They love me back at the hotel. I bought them all shoes so they adore me now.”

“My church won’t stop giving me money to help people here. Like I get off a flight and I have 5 emails from my church asking to give me more money.”

He also mentions the fact he is 70 years old all the time. Eventually the bar gets a little busier and the woman has to serve other customers. He continues to watch her and try to get her to sip his drink every time she comes past. Eventually another couple sit next to him and he starts spouting the same BS. He said to them “I once owned a big motorbike, so you know I’m not the kind of person you want to mess with”

We finally snapped when he said, “I’m hearing that all of the women in Australia are turning into men. Ya, know like they are just becoming more masculine”.

We pipe up and call him out on that he says “I’m sorry if I’ve offended you” we tell him he doesn’t need to come to this country and “save” people and he is out of line. He finishes his drink pays his bill and leaves saying “I don’t need this shit”

My parents are divorced. I’m 20, my sister is 17, and during the week we live with my mom and stepdad. On weekends, we spend time with our dad at his house which is 40 min away. My sister has a job where she works a few hours on Tues-Thurs, and I have a 10-5 research job at my university.

I’m living at my mom’s for the summer. I also lived at home during the previous 2 semesters and commuted to college (~20 min one way) every day. My parents wanted me to commute and I defer to them on these issues because they help me pay for school. 

On Wednesday, my sister and I told my mom that our dad wanted to take us to Canada to visit family for 5 days (Sunday to Friday). My mom said yes, we can go. 

Usually my sister and I drive over to our dad’s house on Friday evenings, but my sister had a picnic with friends today (Saturday). I woke up around 10:30 and chilled on my phone at my house the entire day. My mom is in a bad mood because my sister is out and I am home doing nothing. 

I know she is more stressed now because she’s holding a summer workshop for 3 weeks (just finished her first week) and she usually doesn’t work 9-5 on weekdays. Now she’s acutely mad at my sister and I for our respective activities (or lack thereof) today. 

My mom’s been “anger vacuuming” and slamming doors downstairs for multiple hours. She yells at my stepdad at some point  for “doing nothing all day besides drinking coffee and reading” (keep in mind he had 2 strokes!!!), and around 7 PM she calls my dad on the phone. I text my sister at 7:50 to ask her where she is— she hasn’t left for home yet. My mom is still on the phone. 

Around 8:30, my dad texts my sister and I to let me know that my mom isn’t letting us go to Canada. I’m angry but unsurprised. I ask my stepdad if he knows where the passports are. He does not but he goes to look. 

After my sister gets home around 8:30, she asks my mom for the passports. Strong no. 

I go downstairs and ask, and I tell her that whether or not she gives us the passports, we’re still spending the week with our dad. She says we can spend the week but I can’t have the passports. I immediately ask her if she’s “doing this out of spite” and she says “yes.” I then asked her if she “likes being a mean person” and she also says “yes.” She then follows it up with “get lost.” This is verbatim. 

I go back upstairs and into the library/storage/guest room. I find the passports in a box and take them. My stepdad tells me that he couldn’t find the passports, to which I reply that I did, and he’s just like “huh.” Rather than being supportive of our trip, I think he just doesn’t want to get involved/argue with my mom more than they already do. 

At 9:30, my sister and I grab our bags and leave for my dad’s. When we’re driving, my mom texts me that she’s kicking me out of the house for taking our passports from out under her nose.

507,Asshole,"I met my ex wife when we were 8. We were hot and heavy really young, and had our first child when we were 16. I loved them both dearly, but following a mental breakdown I had when I was in my mid 20s we split up. Thankfully, our younger child is too young to remember the divorce. But even so, I still thought the world of her. It took me years to realize she wasn't a wonderful person. 

A few serious incidents finally sealed it for me, like her dying her unconscious sister's waist-length hair black and making her shave it in retaliation for embarassing her in front of a date. Or her punishing our younger child for wanting to see me. Or her cutting off our older child entirely for choosing to live with me and not her.

About a year and a half ago, she ""got a job"" on the other side of the state and started vanishing for weeks at a time. I didn't think much of it. Eventually, though, she just never came back. Ten months later, we found out she was in prison two states over. She was in prison for fraud, extortion, identity theft and practicing medicine without a liscense. My older child was furious at her, my younger child was just glad she was found. I was glad she was out of my life forever.

Both of our daughters want to visit her. The older one to chew her out, I think, and the younger one misses her. I will not take them, but I can't bring myself to explain why. I keep lying about not having time, and how we don't have a car, and how it's so far away, when I know full well we could make it. I can't take it, but I just can't tell them I personally can't deal with ever seeing their mother again. Or that I hate her. Or that some part of me still feels guilty about the entire thing, like it's my fault.

I can't stand it. I know my older child has figured it out, and I feel awful not being able to apologize to her. And I know my younger one believes me, which is even worse. But that's where I am. I'm lying to both my children, letting my own feelings override theirs and keeping them away from their mother.

Am I the asshole?

EDIT:
I have spoken to my daughters. My older child already figured it out, she already knew how I felt about her mother before this all happened. My younger child actually didn't cry, but it was a near thing. 

I told them both I'd see if there was a way they could go without me, probably with their uncle. Neither of them liked that. I offered instead to go with as far as the city, and their uncle take them to the prison. My younger child accepted that. The older one wasn't. I even offered to go with to the prison, but remain in the lobby, or the car, but she explicitly wants me to talk to her mother. I was afraid of that. I told her I'd think about it.

I talked to their uncle. He agreed to this plan. He also wanted me to talk to my ex, though, and he's bringing his sister along. 

So that's where we are. The trip is next weekend.

EDIT 2:
We went. It took 12 hours to get there and 14 hours to get back. The girls talked to her. The little one was excited the entire way there and sad the entire trip home. My elder daughter gave her mother a piece of her mind, but she kept it brief and quiet enough none of us could hear her, and was dead silent for the first half of our trip home before the boredom won out. I did not talk to her, and with any luck I never will again, her brother did and politely informed her that there's no longer room for her at their house, all her sister told her was ""You're dead to me."", which is pretty much my sentiment as well. Overall, about how I expected it to go. It was not pleasant, it was not productive, it did not make anybody feel better (at least not yet), and I think it's why the little one has needed affection more or less constantly all day today, but it's done.",68,127,0.96

509,Not the A-hole,"I moved into a new apartment building about a month ago. It's a doorman building and most of the doormen are really nice. I always say a pleasant, ""Hi, how are you? Have a nice day/evening"" to them when I leave or enter the building, but I don't stop to chat to them as I have seen some of the other residents do.

&#x200B;

One of the doormen (whose shifts coincide with my coming home from work) has this habit of trying to strike up a conversation with me as I'm almost out of the lobby and heading down the hallway to the elevator - like, he'll shout out a question to me, or comment about the weather or something. I usually (pleasantly) shout back an answer and keep walking to the elevator, as I'm always exhausted after work and just want to go to my apartment and relax.

&#x200B;

The other day he shouted out to me, ""Come here, Miss Pretentious,"" so this time I turned around and walked over to the front desk and said politely, ""What did you call me?"" He then proceeds to say I'm pretentious and obviously think I'm better than everyone else in the building because I won't stop to talk to him or the other doormen. His tone wasn't angry or mean really, just kind of jokey but in a condescending way. I politely explained that it's not that I think I'm better than everyone but that I'm just really tired after work and want to go home. I also said I find it weird that he always tries to talk to me as I'm almost out of the lobby, thereby necessitating me turning around and walking back into the lobby in order to have a conversation (if I wanted to). He ended by saying that I won't fit in with the ""culture of the building"" if I keep on refusing to talk with the doormen. I told him (again, politely) that I wasn't really interested in fitting in with the culture of the building and told him to have a good night and I then walked away.

&#x200B;

Since then I have seen this doorman twice and both times he has greeted me with, ""Hello, Miss Pretentious"" (same jokey, condescending tone) as I walk into the building. I have completely ignored him both times.

510,Not the A-hole,"So, a couple months ago my dad & I (18f) had been together all day and I wanted to have a conversation with him about my stepmom, but since I wasn’t fully comfortable just laying it all out, I decided to ease into it my talking about my half-sister (14f) who has terrible hygiene. 

Within the previous week, I had found two dirty pads in her desk drawer, listen to her refuse to shower and had listened to my uncle make a “joke” about how he hopes his kids don’t end up (smelling/being unclean) like her.

Anyway, I mentioned my uncle’s comment to my dad & he said he “didn’t care what anyone thought.” I was kind of confused by this comment & told him that while my uncle’s comment was rude, it’s true that she has bad hygiene. He told me he wasn’t controlling & didn’t want to make her feel bad. He also told me that he would parent the way he wants & that I’m not the parent.  Since things were starting to get a little heated & off-topic from what I wanted to actually talk about, I changed the subject to my stepmom. 

A little backstory on my stepmom: I’ve never liked her. Don’t know if that matters. About 10 years ago she was in a car accident & hurt her back. She started taking pain-killers & my aunt and I are about 90% certain she’s been addicted ever since. I’m also 100% sure she has/had an alcohol problem.It’s cut down a little recently since you can now feel her liver outside of her body. In recent years she’s been worse than ever, gaining 100 lbs,eyes rolling to the back of her head, falling asleep at random times, constantly taking trips to the bathroom & ALWAYS with her backpack. She has a thyroid problem & takes medicine to help that, but any medication I’ve looked up for the thyroid never has symptoms like this. 

Moving on, I brought up her alcoholism to my dad & he said she stopped. I moved on & started asking what kind of medicine she took & if anything was a pain-killer. I saw him tense up and explain that she’s just always super exhausted & if she was addicted to pills she was doing it on the downlow.

He continued to yell & said I had a lot of nerve, etc, As we started to near the house I told him I gave up & that I was “sorry his wife was a drug addict and his daughter smells.” He flipped & told me leave. I left & felt guilty, but I’m not sure if I feel that I was in the wrong. I eventually came back when he called & told me to, but we haven’t spoken about it since.

I wanted to post an update that my friend did not make it. I was wrong to think his family was doing anything deliberate. They were just really, really hurting. I got a chance to say my goodbyes.

 Once I was there at the hospital, I understood much better what they were probably feeling.  When you are inside of the situation, it's almost a feeling of safety to stay in it, and not bring others in or out.  
I want to thank people for your support. I don't much care about the asshole bit at this point, but I received a request for update so. 

Hug your loved ones and _go see your friends!_  I kind of didn't hang out w my buddy that much, recently, because I had been depressed and got kind of in my head. I wish we had hung out more.

Then she texts ""at least you dont have to worry about that mess anymore. I wasnt sure of how you would react to that sutuation "" ""I was scared you try to kill that lil kid or something lol jk."" 

I DIDNT reply back yet but I feel pissed that I found something like this out AFTER we broke up. 

And why would she add a ""lol jk"" ?
 I dont know if she just found out now or a while back.

AITA for being upset ?






EDIT UPDATE:

She texted me again saying ""I wanted you to find out on your own"" When I asked why she said ""that stuffs to messy"" and "" At the time we thought what you didnt know wouldnt hurt you"" ""Youre too emotional and I did t wanna see you get beat up by a 15 year old son , he's a fighter""

TBH Im not used to her sounding like this. Normally she is usually the typical ""worried mom type"" about almost ANY OTHER situation but she acting differently about this.

517,Not the A-hole,"I’ll preface this by saying my sister and I are both 17f, but we’re very different people with slightly different friend groups.

So I’d just gotten back from a college visit yesterday, and four of my friends had made a Snapchat group message asking if we wanted to go to the movies yesterday. I happily agreed as I hadn’t seen some of them in awhile. The only problem was, my sister wasn’t included in the group message.

My friends picked me up, and we had gone to see the movie, and we all had so much fun. I just got back though and my mom sat me down and talked about how I should’ve asked if my sister could go too as she had felt really left out that she wasn’t invited. Her future roommate was part of the group as well, and that particularly hurt her feelings. 

But as I’d mentioned before we’re very different people with different personalities and senses of humor. She never really meshed well with that specific group (minus her roommate). Also about half of my friends were LGBT and they were really the only ones I could talk and joke about my sexuality with and just feel free about it as my sister was never really comfortable with it. That’s a whole other post though.

I do feel bad that she wasn’t invited and my mom said I’d have to ask if she could come too the next time we did something. However I just feel we wouldn’t have had as much fun if we did. I do love my sister though and I feel the need to say that. AITA in this situation though?",28,30,0.85

520,Asshole,"To put things into context, I've been with my girlfriend for about 10 months. Both of us have stable jobs, so we've been talking about getting a place together. My reason for not going through with it just yet, is that I have 2 giant breed dogs. 

In all the time that we've been together, my girlfriend has made very little efforts to get to know them or to learn how to handle dogs. Even though she finds my dogs cute, she's never had any pets at home and doesn't really know how to handle animals. She's always complaining that ""dogs are a burden"" because if we want to go to the restaurant or to the movie theatre, we can't take them. She also said that she likes her own place to be very clean and that it's hard to keep an environment clean with dogs. She says that's why she's been hesitant to be around the dogs often.

Yesterday I confronted her on the phone about it. I said that while all of her concerns are valid, they don't justify not wanting to be around my dogs, especially if she wants us to live together eventually. She's talked about moving in together, but in spite of that, in the last months, whenever I've talked about learning some basic training commands with me, or about going to dog training classes together, she's always come up with excuses to not do it. ""I'm tired, I don't want to deal with the noise today"", so whenever you are tired of have a migraine, you're gonna ignore the dogs? What if I'm not home? This is just not acceptable. How can you keep talking about living together in those circumstances? I called her out for just being irresponsible and I wouldn't trust her around my pets ever.

521,Everyone Sucks,"I am 30 and there is a big age difference between me and my 48 year old brother Daniel and his wife Zoe who is also 48. They have a 15 year old daughter called Jessica. 

Daniel and Zoe are the sort of people who belief that there would be no crime or poverty if benefits were cut because people would have no choice but to work. I have worked with people on benefits and know for a fact that nobody wants to be on them and everyone would rather be working. Unfortunately Daniel and Zoe are the kind of snobby people who honestly believe that people are only poor because they don't work hard enough. They also think ''council estate'' teens who behave badly should be treated harshly which is odd considering their daughter.

Jessica is perfect on the surface. She is very beautiful just like her mum, has lots of friends and is extremely smart (sat her exams two years early and currently studying A Levels while still in school), but she's also a delinquent. She has been cautioned by the police for possession of cannabis as well as for drunken behaviour in public. She's also a bully. Daniel and Zoe have been called into the school many times because of various bullying accusations made against Jess and her friends. Daniel and Zoe are firmly convinced that these accusations are all lies. Their response is to tell Jess that those girls (the victims) are just jealous of her for being pretty, which is why they are making up these stories about her. The weed and drinking were laughed off as just ''what you do at that age'' even though before this they were saying kids who get in trouble with the police should be publicly named and shamed.

Several times Jess has held house parties at their place, and the latest one resulted in thousands of pounds worth of damage. Again they refused to blame Jess for this and said that things just ''got out of hand''. I genuinely don't understand what goes through their minds to arrive at these conclusions.

Earlier today my husband Tom and me went to my parents for dinner with Daniel's family. Jess thought it would be funny to ask if we got our clothes from the charity shop and said she wouldn't be seen dead in my dress. I was very drunk and asked them why Jess hadn't been taught manners. I said that I knew somewhere that they could take parenting classes and that it couldn't hurt because they were useless right now, and said that I'm looking forward to seeing Jess get locked up like all the ''bad kids'' they hate do. This made Zoe cry and the three of them left. 

Having sobered up I feel bad. Not necessarily for what I said, but because I'm not a parent. If we ever have kids I could end up being a worse parent than them. Am I right to make them feel like bad parents when I haven't walked in their shoes?",54,271,0.96
522,Not the A-hole,"Essentially the title, but more complicated.

I had the unfortunate fortune of being born a gay man into a very evangelical family. I came out right after high school, riding the high of being recently graduated, only for my parents to tell me I was disgusting, not the child they raised, that I was being punished by god and if I was choosing to turn my back on him, they were choosing to turn their backs on me. These are all actual, quotable things they said to me at 18. 

I’m 27 now, and while at first we were somewhat in contact, after the first 3 years or so the only way I’d hear from or about my parents was through my younger brother, the only one of my 3 siblings willing to speak to me. I am in a loving and committed relationship, I am happy, and until now I thought my parents and family were in my past. Well, lo and behold, my cousin, my fathers sisters son, just came out!! Great for him, I’m proud of him. He is also 18, and his parents were confused but accepted him and now they are doing great and are happy and are an intact family. I guess my parents saw that and realized their mistake, because I got a call from a strange number that turned out to be my mom. That call ended up being nearly an hour of them explaining their mistakes and misunderstanding and blah blah blah. I think it’s bullshit. They don’t love me enough for me to allow them back into my life, and I know this because they shunned me for close to a decade. I ended the call by saying I had a lot to think about, and they didn’t seem pleased with that. As if showing love for their eldest son was such an amazing feat. I may be an asshole for this, but I can’t find it in my heart to forgive them. I’m happy now, but the last decade of my life has been filled with pain, isolation, confusion, and self hatred, and the majority of that was their fault.

524,Not the A-hole,"Hello all, I expect this post to get a lot of various responses, but I’m curious to see what others think of this situation.


Husband [38M] and I [28F] have been together 8 years and married for 1 year. I am currently 30 weeks pregnant with our first child. 

We haven’t had consistent sex lately (probably for the past 5 months) because of the pains it causes me, although we did have sex last week, and while it did hurt a lot, it was nice to be intimate and close again. Also my sex drive has been pretty non-existent due to the pregnancy (knowing how much pain it’ll cause and how uncomfortable it is for me) and due to medications I’m currently taking.

Anyway, to the AITA part: my husband has a high sex drive, which I think is great for him. I would never judge him for his natural instincts and wants. We are very open sexually and about masturbation. When I began disliking sex as much lately, he asked if I cared if he went in another room and masturbated. Of course I had no issue, I want him to fulfill his needs however he can happily. 

The problem is that he will masturbate for HOURS. The last session was 5 hours, and if I’m being completely honest, I’m writing this because he’s been at it for 4 hours right now. I wouldn’t care but I’m a stay at home wife-future-mom with no access to transportation to do anything during the week, and he’s gone during the day for work. The weekends are our biggest chance to spend time together. Because of his lengthy masturbation sessions I feel like I’m losing precious time with him. I definitely don’t mind him doing it, it’s just the amount of time he spends doing it that bothers me.

If he cut it to 3 hours maximum I wouldn’t mind, but it seems the sessions are staying around 4-5 hours. He also does this occasionally (2-3 times) during the week, and definitely every weekend.

AITA for getting frustrated with the length of his masturbation sessions? What would you do in this situation? 

Thank you.",111,59,0.88
525,Asshole,"My parents are pretty wealthy. 

I’m 26 and from 21-25 I was in and out of rehabs. I was abusing so many different kinds of drugs and I wasted so much money. I OD’d once  and it destroyed my family to watch me go through that. 

I am intensely ashamed of who I was as a person and I have been sober for almost a year. 

My parents are now approaching their late 60s and have started finalizing their wills and inheritance. 

Yesterday they sat me down and told me that I will not be getting any of the inheritance as they don’t trust me not to relapse with all that money suddenly in my possession and as a result my siblings will be getting my share of the money. 

I was pretty upset about this and I said that they were going to make my siblings rich while I would get nothing from it and that wasn’t fair. I was almost yelling at this point. 

They told me to calm down but I was too upset to listen and I left. I called my brother and sister after I left and told them what my parents said and they said that it was their choice and there wasn’t anything they could do. 

I accused them of just wanted all the money for themselves and not caring about what happened to me. 

Today I have my dad texting me that they are worried about me and “disappointed in my behaviour yesterday.” I talked to my sponsor and he said that while anger is understandable, I have to do everything in my power not to ruin the trust I’ve built with my family over the past year and acting like an asshole addict won’t help.

She was asking me two weeks ago how to make more money over summer when business hours are apparently slower, and so I jokingly suggested she get a sugar daddy.

I figured she would know I was joking but she didn't, and so she joined one of those websites where you get legit sugar daddies. Apparently the night she did, she found her *dad* on the website and got all weirded out.

The next morning she told her mother and long story short, they're getting a divorce as of two days ago. All three of them are really upset about it. My friend told me all of this last night, where she also said that we can't be friends anymore in a very hostile manner.

I told her she shouldn't be mad at me because if I hadn't suggested getting a sugar daddy her father would still be cheating on her mother unbeknownst to anyone. She didn't respond and has blocked me on all social media platforms.

I feel guilty, spooked, and generally terrible about the whole thing. But at the same time I don't think it's my fault; I didn't think my friend was actually gonna try and get a sugar daddy, and it's not my fault she found her dad on there cheating, causing a divorce, neither of which is my fault either.

528,No A-holes here,"This happened on Thursday, but I just told my SO about it, and he thinks I was out of bounds. 

I took my daughter, her friend, and 2 of my nephews to a restaurant for lunch. They range in ages 3-10.  I'm a teacher, so I'm the one with the kids a lot during summer. It's a lot of fun. Anyway, we all went to a restaurant that had a kids meal for super cheap. We sat at a table by the window. It was between lunch and dinner, so there were only a few tables occupied. For those who don't know, restaurants like to keep their occupied tables close during slow times because they only had one server working. (this is important)

The table right next to us was a group of college aged kids. They were a little rowdy but it was kinda fun to be around their energy. Their noise didn't bother me at all. A few minutes after we got there, one of the girls at that table said something about wanting to break up with her boyfriend. They talked a bit and then it got totally crude. They were talking about their sex life in a very loud volume. The friends were giving advice and asking questions. They were drinking and getting more comfortable with their conversation. I felt a little weird about all my kids hearing it, but we all pretended like we couldn't. It got more vulgar and I finally snapped when the first girl said ""I won't suck dick anymore but we can 69 all day long."" Yes, in those exact words. 

I put the oldest kid in charge and said I was using the restroom. I stopped at their table and whispered something like ""I know you're all here for good food and good company, but I've got a lot of kids right there. Do you mind either being quieter or using more euphemisms?"" 

So they all looked at me in surprise and minor embarrassment. I could tell they were having fun and not realizing their surroundings. I get it. I didn't blame them at all. I went to the restroom and came back quickly. Their conversation was dulled for the rest of their meal. Really quiet. They left shortly after. 

I didn't mean to ruin their time. It was family restaurant similar to Applebee's or Red Robin. There was a full bar on the opposite side where they could have sat and no kids around. 

So, am I the asshole here?

Edit: I want to clarify that I'm by no means a prude. If it were at a bar with my SO, we probably would have joined them for a laugh. My only problem was the time and the place. Had they been in the bar, I wouldn't have said anything.

531,Asshole,"After divorcing the mother of my children, I briefly dated a woman and broke up. After the break-up, she informed me that she was pregnant. I told her that I had a lot on my plate and had no intention of being involved with this child's upbringing. We didn't talk until she informed me that she had given birth to a son, we'll cal him A. I was already moved on from her and had a lot on my plate and told her that. She was quite angry and threatened to take me to court, so we agreed that I would pay child support for him until he was 18. A kept his mothers last name.

we met at my house once about 9 months later with her, A, and her friend. This was the only time that I met A. I held him and looked at this baby and honestly felt no emotional connection to him. This was not my son. I was not his father

A's mother called me once when he was about 3/4 years old and told me that A wanted to meet me and was asking questions about me. I explained to her that I was not willing to do this and had moved on. This was 19 years ago and I haven't thought of them really since and have not told anyone in my family of this.

About 3 weeks ago, A called me. He explained that he didn't feel animosity towards me but wanted to meet me. I hesitantly obliged and agreed to meet him the next week for lunch.

Last week I met A at a restaurant. The second he walked in I recognized him immediately, he looked just like his bother and just like me; tall, slim, short blonde hair, well dressed. I stood up and shook his hand for the first time and looked him in the eye. After greeting each other and making small talk, I started asking about him and was quite impressed. He was 22 years old, an air force pilot who had spent a year travelling north Africa and southeast Asia after high school. I asked about his mother and he asked about me and my side of his bloodline. When the conversation got to my children it became quite tense. He already knew that I had a son (29) and a daughter (32) but asked if they knew about him. I explained that they had no idea that he existed as did the rest of my family. I could see he was disappointed on hearing this. We finished our lunch and agreed to keep in touch. We shook hands and he called me by my first name. During the drive home, I was feeling a bit sad that I had missed out on this boys life.

Throughout the past week I've been really thinking and decided that I want to tell my son and daughter about their brother. I feel that they would be happy with this sort of news but am worried if they'll feel resentment towards me. My mother and siblings have no idea about him either and I feel like they would inevitably find out. What if they accept him and cast away me? will they resent him?

My parents are currently on holiday and me and my friend (who we will call Mark) decided that, despite my parents' wishes, we were going to invite around 60 people to a party at mine to celebrate the end of school. I thought my house would be a mess by the end of it, but that no serious damage would be done. 

The day before the party was supposed to take place I invited Mark over to plan the party, as well as try out a new bong that I had bought in preparation.  An hour before Mark arrived he asked if one of his friends could come as well. I said yes. Mark, his friend and I sat around my house smoking and laughing. Mark asked if it was okay if another of his friends came and I agreed.

About 10 minutes later Mark's friend and 6 other people, 2 of which I have almost never spoken to just walked in. As in they literally, just let themselves in because i hadn't thought to lock the door. I also hadn't given any of them my address and would have said no to most of them coming.

They weren't aggressive in any way but they started rifling through my drawers, smoking without asking and acting like the house was theirs. They asked if they could smoke outside and I flat out said no because my next door neighbours were all in there gardens and I knew that sitting outside smoking out of a bong wouldn't go down well. I went upstairs briefly and when I came back down half of them were outside and the other half were talking about how great the party was going to be and how fucked up my house was going to get (these were the people I barely knew and weren't even invited.)  I started to realise what the party would actually be like and told everyone to leave. Almost all of them could see that I was pissed, knew how disrespectful they had been and left straight away but one of them, I basically had to push out my house because he ""wanted to get a better hit"".

After this, I started to seriously reconsider the party. I felt it had gotten too big and there were too many people coming who I just could not trust to not break anything or let in people who I didn't want there. I waited until I had sobered up then I messaged everyone telling them it was off.

Since this has happened some people have been understanding while others have been desperately messaging me to have it anyway, as well as some subtle insults over Twitter. At this point, I couldn't believe how some people were acting and it became apparent that a few just wanted a 'Project X' style fiasco. Despite knowing that this was the case I couldn't help feeling like the villain for telling everyone it was off, and I am still devastated that my high school legacy will be the guy that cancelled the gaff of the century 24hrs before it was supposed to start.

534,No A-holes here,"My wife Lucy is pregnant with our first baby, a boy. We are delighted and very excited. There is one issue that has come between us. 

I was born and raised in the UK, but am of arabic descent, and was raised in a very religious, traditional, conservative muslim household. As a nonreligious adult I wouldn't wish that kind of upbringing on any child and always dreamed of raising a child free of religion and tradition.  There are numerous things that are done to babies in my family that I wouldn't dare to do. Boys are circumcised (religious ritual) and girls get their ears pierced (cultural practice). I would never do either of these things and would not want religion having any part in my child's life. 

Lucy is white english and not religious in any way and nor is anyone in her family, in spite of this it's still a family tradition to have babies christen. I objected to this as soon as it was brought up, because I don't want any kind of religious ceremony being done to my child. If it's what they want then of course they can choose it for themselves later in life, but it's not something we should choose to do for them. 

Lucy argued that it's nothing to do with religion and that's it's just a family tradition which every baby has done. She also rightfully pointed out that unlike circumcision/ear piercing, it's not painful for the baby. I understand all of this, but it's still a *religious ritual*. 

Lucy has said that if I feel so strongly then we won't have a christening, but understandably has been very down about it. To be honest seeing how upset she is I'm considering just putting my views aside to make her happy. I just want to know if having those views is justified.",36,46,0.84

All my death expenses will be covered by my life insurance and out of that account so no one will be left footing those bills

&#x200B;

Edit 2: The main contention is over an account thats now 7 figures that started with the money my late wife left. What I have earned and will earn is not yet decided.

&#x200B;

Edit 3: New wife is currently a beneficiary of my life insurance policy. I may include her in what remains in my 401k and Ira accounts. The house (which was bought with my late wife and paid off by me, and the account my late wife set up, is together over 3/4 of my entire estate. What I have is not insignificant but nowhere near as substantial as those other two assets both of which were from my wife and long predated the marriage (and neither of which is considered marital property)

&#x200B;

Edit 4 a large portion of this money came from a wrongful death settlement. She DIED for this money. I will make sure her daughter gets it.

&#x200B;

Edit 5 The will covers the assets that were created with my late wife. The house and the proceeds of the wrongful death settlement. Currently the state will split the other assets. They are not in contention. Its the multi million dollar account and the million dollar house that are in contention.

&#x200B;

Edit 6 I was trying to keep things vague and not get into specifics but you all want specifics so here it is.

Late wifes account 5.5 million dollars goes to my daughter

House we bought now worth 1.2 million dollars goes to my daughter

My insurance, 401k, Ira all combined currently sits at 1.6 million dollars split between wife and daughter by the state not covered in will. Wife wants half of EVERYTHING. because thats a lot more money then my own personal assets. The money came from a wrongful death settlement. That money came from my wifes fucking death. Something I really didnt want to talk about. She DIED for it. No I dont want to see someone else profiting off of my late wifes death. That money belongs to her daughter. I didnt even touch it and use it for myself. I put it all away for my daughter",543,1057,0.93
536,Not the A-hole,"As an art history major, one of the things that really makes my blood boil is when people touch statues when they are explicitly told not to do so and do not have the proper equipment needed to handle them. The main reason why you should never touch the statues (unless otherwise posted) is that the oil from hands actually wears down the material. When I was at the Louvre today, I saw this Chinese tourist grabbing an Ancient Greek statue dating from the Late Hellenistic era (c. 323-31 BCE) by the finger while her husband was trying to take a picture. Completely out of my instincts, I actually (gently) took the woman’s hands off the statue and very sternly told her not to touch the statues. 
 
While that gallery was a loud madhouse, was I being an asshole for taking the woman’s hand off the statue?

Edit: Thank you everyone for your responses! It was interesting and eye-opening to see a whole range of different opinions here. Since many took issue to the fact I made physical contact with the tourist, I will try to refrain from doing so in the future and talk to them first.

They asked us at the HOA meeting and sent out flyers saying their dogs are afraid of fireworks. I can’t remember the exact wording because I threw the flyer out. The dogs supposedly freak out and will stay up all night in fear from fireworks. I find it hilarious since their dogs keep us up all night and wake us up early with the barking.

540,Not the A-hole,"My older brother is on the autism spectrum. He’s functioning to where he can have a job (janitor), hang out with friends, etc. but he cannot live alone for several reasons. Growing up, my parents always told me that I would be the one to take care of him when the time came and that he would have to live with me. I was never expected to help much when we were kids when it came to the disorder, but it was just what they wanted me to do when both of them passed on. My mom has never wanted him living in a “home”.

As I got older, I started bringing up the idea of assisted living to her and she got upset. She says no one will take care of him in the same way she does. I sort of just let it go, because I know it’s a sensitive issue. My dad, I know, was either way about it but tended to side with my mom and say that “family takes care of family”.

My father passed away a few years back, not long after I married my wife. My mother isn’t sick at the moment, but the time will come at some point where I will be responsible (and it’s in the will that when she dies, I am the person responsible for my brother since he cannot make choices for himself).

I admitted to my wife that I don’t want my brother living with us. I love my brother, don’t get me wrong. I just do not want to be responsible for him and I think he will thrive living in an assisted living facility. He already attends activities at one and he loves it. My wife has basically said, it’s up to me because he’s my brother. I’ve spoken to him about it and he says that he doesn’t care where he lives, so long as he can keep his routine. I promised him that we’d (my wife, the kids and myself) visit him and he could come to us, he could still keep his job (which is the most important thing to him), he could do even more activities there, etc.

My mom is upset with me that this is what I want to do. I told her that ultimately, it will be my choice as his guardian, unless she wanted to change that.

542,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because I don't want this person to see my account.

TL: DR at the end.

&#x200B;

I (25F) work in a very small office with 3 other people, one of them being my coworker Gary.

&#x200B;

Gary is a parent in his late 30's, married, with two kids.

&#x200B;

I'm newer to the step-mom scene. In fact, legally I'm not a step-mom. I'm engaged to my wonderful fiancé, Jared(30M). Jared has two daughters that are 6 and 11. We own a home together, the girls have their own space, and we have custody of the youngest 60% of the time. Both the girls mothers wished me a Happy Mothers Day and I did the same for them.

&#x200B;

Now, that being said when we have discussions about children Gary likes to try and ""reassure me"" that I will ""understand when I have my own kids"". Just recently he was asking if we were bringing the girls to a day camp next month. He makes sure to always include my fiancé Jared's name in the conversation as if I could not do anything with them myself.

&#x200B;

I let him know that we work and that we don't usually have the girls during most of that time per our custody arrangement but that my mom could bring them the last day. (We have our 6-year-old Friday-Tuesday and the 11-year old is here for the summer but goes back to spend the week before and that specific week with her mom, they BOTH will be back the last day of this event). He got flustered and told me that our custody arrangement was confusing and I will really love having ""my own child"" because I won't have to deal with that nonsense. I did combat this and said if we planned ahead we could have worked this out as we change schedules easily but this thing was not one we wanted to prioritize. This apparently frustrated him even more. He let me know it was ""different"" when you have your own kids as you can do what you want with them. He followed it up with letting me know that things will change after we have a child of our own because we won't get a break from them like we do right now.

&#x200B;

This really rubbed me the wrong way as I think of the children as my own and I'm really sick of him telling me that I don't understand things because they are not mine. I do not know what in his mind disqualifies me as a parent when the children and their moms think of me as their step-mom. In my culture we do not say things like step/half/adopted, family is just family. My fiancé is from the same culture as well so its really lovely to not have to explain this. I feel blessed that his family, the girls, and their mothers love me and accept me as a step-mom. I don't know what to do honestly because it's not like he is going to stop being my coworker anytime soon.

TL:DR: My co-worker does not think I'm a real parent because I'm a step-parent and we do not have 100% custody of the children and he likes to tell me whenever an event comes up where we do not have the kids.

544,Everyone Sucks,"So, recently a very lovely co-worker of mine (I'll call her Bridget for this story) out of the blue asked me if I knew someone called Karen. I did and upon asking her why she asked, she told me that:

""Oh, my family just moved house and our neighbour saw my uniform and asked if I knew a guy called Rowan. I said yes and she said you went to uni together.""

She gushes about how nice she's been (she welcomed them to the neighbourhood with a cake and introduced them to her kids). Then, as we were working, she curiously asks me a bit about her and what she's like.

So I told her the truth. We don't really get along but she's nice enough, though she is a bit of a Karen™. We both laugh about how Bridget was unsurprised and kind of got that vibe regardless.

Then I was struck to the core by an insatiable urge to gossip.
I've only really told, prior to this, my best friend the story because I was utterly floored by it and needed someone to just be outraged with me (and we're just open about everything like that).
But, as she was:

1. Karen's neighbour.
2. I don't like Karen (we'd had a major falling out MONTHS ago and were not on speaking terms).
And,
3. The bitch was asking about me.

So, I felt that Bridget had earned all the juicy details of the 8 year long affair Karen was currently engaged in with a mutual friend of her and her husband. Leaving Bridget absolutely speechless that this kindly, though stereotypically Karen-y, lady was this awful.

Fast forward to a few weeks later and I'm on shift with Bridget again and am curious to see how Karen is doing, so ask.
Bridget claims that Karen seems VERY wary of her and avoids eye contact and doesn't talk to Bridget or her family. Despite being so friendly before.
Bridget swears she hasn't done or said anything, though I don't know if I believe her. She can be a bit snarky and passive aggressive, so I feel she may have done so and tipped Karen off.

Which seems to be likely as I received a phone call Last week from none other than Karen herself, correctly accusing me of telling Bridget:

""I KNOW you told that girl Rowan! How dare you! It's none of your business so how dare you spread that around."" hurling vitriol at me for a few minutes and very upset that it could effect her marriage before I hung up.

So, am I the asshole? Karen and few of our uni friends are calling me a prick (the nicer names I've been called) for ""telling people"" and not minding my own business. And in theory, Karen's husband could find out and it would destroy their marriage. Am I the asshole here, should I not tell anyone?",67,66,0.87
545,Not the A-hole,"I am 21 Male. Last week my mother and her partner got married after a year of being together. Her new husband also happens to be the father of a horrible classmate who used to bully me everyday in high school. 

The worst part is, one time at school I tried to stand up for myself by punching the son hard in the face when he was calling me names, and his father, the man whom my mom would eventually marry years later, got me expelled because he was a prominent figure in town.

I talked about it with my mom when I first found out they were dating. But she dismissed it as just kids being kids and he (her husband) was only protecting his son. 
The father had tried to apologize to me many times when he found out that he was dating the mother of a boy whom he had had expelled for standing up to his bully of a son. But I refused to accept his apology. 

What his son had done to me had affected my confidence in a way that I grew up being a recluse thinking I was not good enough because the son always called me a communist bastard, which may or may not have been true considering my grandfather had run away to another country to escape prison before I was born. My parents separated when I was only a toddler. 

My mother thinks I should let go of past hurts. I wish it was that easy. I'm still struggling with self-worth until now. I told her she can marry him if she loves him, but I won't be there for the wedding and won't associate myself with him and his son. It still hurts me a lot seeing them now.

552,Not the A-hole,"I use both boyfriend and girlfriend in this story so for clarity reasons, I'm a bisexual woman.

My sister Serenity was dating this guy Jalen for the last 5 months. They only broke up a few weeks ago because our parents forced them to after they found out about the relationship. They're not against her dating (I had a girlfriend when I was 16), but he was absolutely NOT good news. The dude was a 20 year old college dropout with a criminal record. I've talked to her about finding someone more age appropriate that's better for her and she seemed to understand.

On an unrelated note, I gave Serenity the key to my apartment a couple years ago in case she ever wants to chill. Our parents can be pretty overbearing sometimes, so I gave it to her in case she ever wanted to get away.

Well anyways, I came home today and opened my door to see her and her (supposed to be ex) boyfriend having sex on my sofa. I screamed which caused her to scream (I didn't expect anyone to be in my house) and then asked her what the hell did she think she was doing. She apologized and she tried covering herself and said I thought she'd be at work (I took a new job last weekend and I work 100% remotely; I was coming home from my boyfriend's place). I told them to get out and left my apartment.

I then phoned my mom (I didn't really care about the sex; mostly about the whom) and she went to pick her up. Her ride here was Jalen, and I was not going to let him take her home. My mom was furious because she was supposedly ""at the mall with friends"".

I feel kinda bad, because knowing my parents, she's likely going to be punished pretty badly. But this dude was not good news, and I felt like they should be aware that they're still seeing each other. Was I in the wrong?

Using a throwaway because it’s   possible to figure out my identity if I post on my main account. (However, I am in no way famous and have yet to achieve any form of mainstream success with my work). 

I recently made a low-budget indie film that is loosely inspired by some childhood trauma a friend of mine experienced. He’s confided in me slowly about these events throughout the years. I found his story to be tragic but also extremely interesting from a creative perspective. (I should note that my friend is not a writer and, as far as I know, he has little to no interest in the arts). 

The film is now done, with the exception of some last minute edits that need to be made. All names of people, places, etc. have been changed. The dialogue is entirely my own, and so are nearly all of the details. Still, given my source of inspiration, I asked my friend to be among the first to view the film. I kept the plot a surprise, which I admit was a precarious decision. Thankfully, he loved it and provided only positive feedback after the viewing. However, a few days later—I believe, after speaking with someone about it—his attitude changed significantly. 

My friend has now requested (1) some form of credit in the film’s opening lines and (2) a small percentage of the profits. (I have no idea what #2 would look like even if I agreed, since calculating profits can be an extremely complicated endeavor. There is also a significant chance that there will be no profits to distribute. However, I suppose we could come to some agreement about compensation, if I were so inclined). 

I happen to have several lawyers in my family. I am confident that, based on the specific circumstances at play here, I have no legal obligation to accommodate either of my friends requests. At least for now, this is a moral issue rather than a legal one. (I am sure some could make arguments about the legalities but I am **not** looking for legal advice at this time, and I would not post in this forum for that purpose, in any case). 

What I am wondering is - do I have some moral duty to oblige my friend’s requests for acknowledgement and/or money?

556,Not the A-hole,"I am moving out of my apartment and renting a small house. For the past 2 months, I have been searching for rentals, talking to realtors, touring places and adjusting my deal-breakers until finally, I have found the perfect place that is very affordable for the area but still gives me the space I want and the location that I want.  I asked my friend to come with me to tour the place and that led to a heated discussion.

She is married, living with her husband, and they qualified for subsidized housing. However, when it came time for them to re-qualify, it turns out that they just barely make over the income limit due to both of them getting raises, but they are literally a couple hundred dollars over. Not enough to afford an actual apartment. 

When I showed her the pictures of the house that I was going to tour and the price, she asked if I could forgo the house and get an apartment since I make way more than their combined income (which is true) and since I didn't need as much space (I'm single). She said without the house that I am looking at, they will have to take out loans to afford an actual apartment. I said no because I have been putting in all this work to find the house, and while I do make more money than them on paper, in reality, I have other expenses that sop up that extra money (student loans, auto loan, savings goals etc).  We didn't fight but it was heated and she said that she didn't want to come tour anymore.

557,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because I don't want this linked to my main account.

I'm going to keep this relatively brief.

I'm 23 and since I was 17 and first got a bank account, my mom's account is linked to mine so she has had access to it. It helped a lot when I was in high school and she was able to transfer me money straight out of her account for lunch or movie tickets or whatever when I didn't have a job (this was before Venmo/Cashapp/Zelle made transferring money a lot easier) but now that I'm a recent college graduate looking for work things are a little different.

Like I said, I'm looking for work right now and all I have in my account is a small amount of money I got as graduation gifts, birthday money, and a little from my campus job. In total, it's only about one thousand dollars. This is holding me over until I find a full-time job, and since I still live with my mom (need money to move out, need job to get money) and she doesn't charge me rent, I use the money for gas (I drive my brother to PT appointments twice a week), groceries (I cook dinner every day for our whole family), and student loan payments. The money should last me a few months, but it's really not much, so I'm being really conservative with my spending.

Recently, my mom got a new job, and because her paychecks got all fucked up from switching jobs, just this week she took $250 from my account to cover the car insurance payment, and then she took another $700 yesterday to cover other bills she'd paid in advance so her account wouldn't get overdrawn. She will give the money back when she gets paid, but I hate that she didn't ask me for the money.

This also isn't the first time she'd done this. She does it quite frequently, and sometimes she forgets to pay me back when she gets paid and I have to remind her to give back my money, which makes me feel like an asshole.

I love my mom, and I am *GLAD* to help if she needs it. She's such a huge help to me and she's very supportive of me, especially right now when I am struggling to find work. However, because she has access to my account she can just take however much from me she wants without asking and just say ""I'll pay you back"" and I just feel so violated. If she asked me before she took the money I wouldn't be so upset over it but it's so frustrating to look at my account balance knowing I'm supposed to have a thousand dollars and only having $50.

Because of this, I'm thinking about talking to her and just telling her to stop taking money from me without asking. Either that or just closing that account and making a new one separate from hers. I'm happy to help her if she needs, but I want to be the one helping her, I don't want her to use my funds like a piggy bank.

560,Not the A-hole,"A bit more than 3 years ago, my first car finally gave up the ghost and needed way more repair work than it was worth to become functional again. 

I mentioned this as a general life update when I was speaking with my daughter’s dad. (We platonically co-parent, I have custody, and he usually pays child support. This info may or may not be relevant later.)

I didn’t ask for anything in reference to the car situation, just mentioned my struggles with my old car and that I wasn’t sure it was worth repairing and asking his opinion about whether he would repair it or get a different functioning vehicle. 

He suggested a different vehicle and I told him I was browsing for a used vehicle to replace it. He took it upon himself and bought me my little car. 

I didn’t want to take it. He reassured me it was fine, it’s a gift to help {our daughter}’s mom. I was reluctant, but I agreed and profusely thanked him. 

From the outset, he never discussed repayment and always referred to it as a present or gift. It wasn’t a new car (it’s a 2009) but it has been exactly what I need and a good little car for me. Great gas mileage, no issues. 

About a year ago, he somewhat randomly declares that “it’s about time you pay me back for the car” and then proceeds to stop paying child support for the duration of the time it would be to pay him back for the car. 

No actual conversation or discussion in the matter and no inquiry into whether it suits my financial situation. He wouldn’t answer calls or texts, ignored emails, and didn’t visit our kid. He clearly avoided the topic and just genuinely dropped off the face of the earth for the several months it took for the car to be “paid back”.

Still, months after it was all repaid, refuses to discuss it. It’s like he completely shuts off the second I try to talk about it. 

Clearly, I’m still angry about it. It’s not about the money. My finances were fine for the duration. It’s not about the value of the car, as it was exactly what I was looking for at the time. It’s about his expectation that gifts require repayment, that he prioritized the money over his child, and that I don’t get to discuss it with him because he won’t talk to me about it.

I know that there are some funky things going on legally, but at the end of the day I want to know where I stand.

My oldest brother, “Dan”, is basically a piece of shit. He has several other children with multiple women whom he doesn’t keep in contact with nor support any of his other children. His girlfriend, “Jen”, lives with him with the other people I mentioned before. Jen and Dan have a one year old, “Kate”. Previously I had lived with all of them, the house was always disgusting when I lived there. Garbage literally all over the floor, random shit everywhere. My grandpa is an alcoholic who can barely walk anywhere. So, the house is always disgusting. 

So, I went upstairs to Jen and Dan’s room to get a box of picture for my mom. I haven’t seen Kate since I moved out because my grandpa is a dick, and Dan just sucks as a human being. As I walked upstairs, Jen was in the bathroom that is basically the master bath which has a door that is connected to their room. She was doing her makeup and I walked into Dan and Jen’s room and saw Katie sitting on the floor surrounded by piles of random shit, clothes, toys, garbage, etc. In another end of the room, was a large black garbage bag, which I’m assuming was garbage due to the fruit flies swarming it. It was probably the worst I’ve ever seen their room from previous times. Kate looked like she hadn’t had a bath in awhile and I felt very upset that they were allowing their room to be in this condition, let alone a one year old. 

I told my mom that it was absolutely horrid in there. And she could see the high level of disgust in my face and said, “don’t do anything”. Meaning not to call cps despite the living conditions of the house and their bedroom. 

So, WIBTA for calling cps? I should also mention that Dan is a hot head, and is very abusive in several ways.

I deleted the browser history and planned on keeping it to myself. Some days pass, and I was going to show bf something on Facebook. When I hit the search bar, his father's name of course showed up.

Bf is very mad. It's hard for him to deal with the fact that I know things about his father's life now. That makes him curious to know what I know. He feels I didn't respect his wishes. I didn't think he'd ever find out, he says that doesn't make it any better. I think it's natural for me to be curious about the future grandfather of our children. I have respected bf's wish by not asking about him for 8 years, and had not planned on taking it any further than just finding out what he looks like.

Bf has not been the same since it happened. I understand that it's hard for him, but I don't think it's right for him to still be mad at me. My intention was always to continue to respect his wishes by never bringing up his father.

566,Not the A-hole,"So I am an 18 year old male who is attending a college out of state next year, far from home. I got a joint checking account with my mom when I was sixteen. She can see any purchases in it, how much money I have, transfer any money, etc. I talked to her recently about opening up another new account, under my name, and using the joint account as a sort of savings (I’m currently using it to save money for college). She got very upset at the idea that I would want my own private account. She doesn’t understand why I would want to keep my purchases personal, why I would hide anything from her. Keep in mind I don’t plan on really hiding anything, I just don’t really like my mom knowing all my personal financial details, and I might buy something she might not approve of in future, or link it to a credit card (she believes credit cards are the devil and would be horrified if she knew I was trying to build credit). So, WIBTA if I opened a new account without telling her when I get to college? Keep in mind she does support me pretty well financially, not paying for everything, but certainly paying for a lot. I don’t think it’s that big a deal to want a little privacy in my financial life, even though I am pretty dependent on her. I understand that she wants to make sure I’m caring for myself financially, but I think a little independence is no big deal.

So as the thread went, I felt like shit. I tried calling my sister but she didn't respond (Almost certainly intentionally.) I texted her begging her to respond. I even started crying myself once I noticed she defriended me on Facebook.

After about a day, she sent me a brief text back saying to call her. I did. I apologized for the way I acted and my threats. She told me that she was certain that I wasn't going to actually follow up on that threat to cut her off from my kids for life, because I tend to make outlandish threats like that and have my whole life, but even hearing it hurt her deeply. She told me how much she loves my kids, how much fun they had together that weekend, and that she'd can't imagine being cut out of their lives.

I explained to her why I won't attend a Catholic Mass or allow my kids at one, and how my semi-raising of my kids in a different church is very different. She admitted that having thought about it she should've asked me ahead of time and not merely assumed that it was OK and basically the same thing, but also assured me she had never heard anything anti-LGBT at that church and if she ever did she would walk right out that service. She also told me that as hurt as she was she did consider if retaining a connection to an anti-LGBT church was right and that she didn't have to go to that one just because she was brought up in it to have a relationship with God. It was something she contemplated even as much resentment she had for me after that because in the end she still loved me. After that I was unable to talk because the tears were so strong. She also mentioned that our parents had talked to her that week, and she told them how much hurt she had over this. My parents told her that they know first hand how anti-Catholic I am and how much of a big deal this is to me, but that they wouldn't expect a reaction on that level yet also assured her my threats probably weren't sincere. They know me!

So the agreements we reached is she won't take the kids to Mass ever again, and that we won't speak of the incident anymore and forgive and move on. And that she would even consider seeking a different church. And then when the call ended I got a notification less than a minute later she accepted my Facebook friend request.

I then discussed making it up to her especially as I didn't pay her, and she said she'd just like for us all to meet up and have a fun day together with her, the kids and I the weekend after the 4th. So that's what we'll do!

I called my parents later and let them know that I think I mended it. They told me that that's always how I've been, although rarely that harsh, I don't recall being that nasty to her even as a teen. Regardless they're happy it's all mended now. All is well!",10,48,0.92

570,Not the A-hole,"Last night my gf told me she was going out for dinner with a friend she had recently made, after which we would go to the house of a long time friend of her's & have a small movie night. The time she said to pick her up rolls around & I message her to see if she's ready to go but says she is not ready & is in fact dancing. I thought that was strange but dismissed it as her being at a restaurant where you can eat & dance. 

The night goes on & I'm waiting at home for the all clear to come get her but finally at around 22:30 she tells me that its too late to see her friend & that I might see her tomorrow followed by a bunch of videos from the night showing that she wasn't out to dinner but actually at a house party for someone's 25th birthday, presumably a friend of the girl she was supposedly at dinner with. My gf messages me around 1:30 to tell me shes home. I have a short convo with her, quickly say goodnight & leave some of her messages unread because the whole situation has left me feeling irritated.

Some context on why I feel this way is needed so I shall explain. I have no problem with her going out & having a good time with her friends with or without me, I desire no control over her in that way. Where my gripe with the situation lies is that she veiled it as something it wasn't, flaked on other plans & possibly wasn't straight forward in telling me that she didn't want me to be there as from what I saw of the party it was not exclusive & I could have been her plus 1. Like I stated earlier I have no problem with her not wanting to bring me somewhere but I would appreciate knowing that that is in fact the case.

So, AITA for being irritated about the lack of straight forward communication & veiling of circumstances by my gf?",22,28,0.9

People generally pop their food in, stay near the machine till their food is warmed, collect their lunchbox and move along.
I was waiting in the line for a little while (the wait line was particularly long that day) and noticed that one of the microwaves had a box of food in it for the past 5-8 mins. The food had been warmed, but the owner was nowhere to be seen. When I was next in line to use one of the microwaves, I waited a couple of minutes, then removed the box, placed it to the side and popped in my food.

When I was nearly done with the heating cycle, the owner of the food finally showed up and was very annoyed that her food was outside. Her exact words were ""you don't touch other people's food"".

573,Not the A-hole,"My daughter Emma is 16. She’s a good kid; part of the reason why I’m having such a moral dilemma right now. 

In the last couple months, I’ve noticed her having a lot more stuff than usual. For example, her mother found an Anastasia Contour kit in her room (just an expensive make-up kit that her mother and I DEFINITELY didn’t buy for her). She asked me about it because Emma doesn’t really have a disposable income; I didn’t really know where it came from but I didn’t really think anything of it. 

Well since then, there has been a bunch of new stuff she’s been getting. She’s been wearing new jewelry, clothes from expensive brands, some airpods, and yesterday, I saw that she brought home a new Nintendo Switch. At that point, I’m like WTF is going on, and confronted her. I demanded her to tell me where was she getting all of this stuff and I need an answer, now.

She pretended she had no idea what I was talking about, then that excuse changed to she’s been thrift shopping (which is completely a lie because all her stuff is brand new). After that fake excuse, I demanded to see her phone. She relented but told me she wanted to confess.

Well it turns out that she’s been getting DMs from a bunch of random guys. She has a pretty popular Instagram and posts quite frequently, so she had a lot of grown men hitting on her and offering to buy her stuff. She told me she was just entertaining them to get stuff, that she promises she never did anything appropriate like send nudes or have sex. She just messaged them, flirt a little bit, but that’s it, and they’d send her money.

I looked through her messages which pretty much confirmed what she said. Her conversations seemed innocent enough, but I still found it unacceptable that she was essentially willing to entertain these grown sick fucks just so they’d give her money. I told her such, and told her that because she did tell me, she’s not in huge trouble, but she’s banned from having snapchat, Instagram, and twitter until further notice (probably until she turns 18 and can make her own decisions). I thought it was a pretty fair resolution to the problem.

She did NOT have the same reaction. She said I couldn’t ban her, that all of her friends are on social media, and that it’d isolate her from everyone she knew. I told her as a compromise, she can make a new account but can’t post any pictures or anything and she threw a hissy fit and screamed how I was being unfair. I told her it was that, or she has no phone at all until she’s 18 so she can make her choice. She reluctantly agreed but she’s still EXTREMELY pissed at me. I reminded her she can still make one; she just can’t post anything, but she ignored this.

I didn’t really grow up with technology like she did, so perhaps I’m just thinking about it from an older person’s perspective. Thought to come here to see if my reaction was warranted.",566,1306,0.94

My ex is American with Dutch ancestry & he only speaks English. I was with him for 1.5 years, before I unexpectedly fell pregnant (my BC failed) and my parents found out pretty much straight away because nosy Indian parents will find a way to know everything. 

The outpouring of love and support from my 2 old folks was tremendous and they were staunchly on my side and babies side especially because when I told my ex I was pregnant he bailed and went MIA for 3 entire years (he still paid CS) the rest of the Indian community basically shunned me and called me a whore but my parents stuck by me. 

I moved back with my parents and they added an entire wing to their home just for me and my baby. They speak only Gujarati at home, as my parents have multiple businesses in India, and they prefer it. My mom and dad only speak to my kid in Gujarati and asked that I make sure she knows her heritage and her home. 

I spoke with a child psychologist who told me it is absolutely healthy and okay for her development if I speak minimal English with her at home, because she’s exposed to so much American culture via external sources / tv and I speak English when I’m around others including with her when we are out and about. 

My ex came back into my life when my daughter was 3 because he had a change of heart and wanted to meet his daughter. He has fallen head over heels in love with her and begrudgingly I have to say he is a fantastic father and my daughter absolutely loves him. She’s 6 now and the two both look exactly the same as well as act exactly the same- he is very charismatic and silly and he has taught her those qualities because I’m pretty boring and serious and she has really opened up in a way I’m proud to see. 

His only ‘complaint’ is that she babbles to herself in Gujarati ALL the time and my ex hates it. He also feels that I’m delaying her development by strictly speaking in Gujarati when I’m at home and that it’s un-American of me. He has also expressed dissatisfaction that he can’t understand her and that he’s missing out on sweet moments because sometimes she can’t translate into English. She can speak English perfectly but she seems more confident in Gujarati, which I myself have noticed.

&#x200B;

My cousin is getting married in August - a destination wedding out in the mountains of Colorado. My husband and I are professional filmmakers and do a lot of work together. We own our own equipment and both act as operators sometimes, or otherwise we hire additional crew and take on different roles, depending on the job.

My cousin - who I am decently close to - asked if my husband and I will video her wedding for her. This was after we received her invitation, RSVP'd yes, and after we've purchased our plane tickets / booked our hotel. She says she will pay us a 'small stipend', but she loves our work and can't find a good videographer out in this small town in Colorado.

My husband and I don't want to do it. Not only would we have to cart all of our gear out to Colorado, but that's all we'd be doing the whole wedding. My cousin is super particular, really picky, and despite her saying that it would be okay if we only captured the best moments, those 'best moments' are all over a wedding. (We also don't film weddings - we've never filmed a wedding previously. The small work we do as a 2 person crew is mostly for non-profits.) You just have to be filming the whole time. How would it ever work for us to be guests, and be paid videographers? We aren't taking time off, paying $800 each for plane tickets, and the hotel etc etc just so we can work for way below our regular rate. We wouldn't be experiencing the wedding, we'd just be working - doing our regular job for this event. Also, I don't think it would be right for me to even accept the 'small stipend' from her any way - so we'd be doing it for free.

My cousin has said that she wants us there 'first and foremost' as guests, but I know that her ideal would be for the whole wedding to be filmed. If we do get to put down our cameras though, we will have to be charging batteries, or downloading footage. It's not something, for a one night event, that you can just stop doing to enjoy yourself.

I'm worried that saying no to my cousin will ultimately really hurt our relationship - but I genuinely feel she doesn't understand what a commitment this is for me and my husband to do for her, and, if I explain it all to her, I think she'll just hear me say 'no', without getting it. I'm really proud of my husband and my work together, and I know my cousin is expecting something of that caliber. It won't be of that caliber if we don't film the whole thing ... never mind watching through all the footage and editing, and probably hiring our composer to write something for the piece (what we usually do with our commercial work, and what my cousin is used to seeing from us).

I feel so torn up about this. I want my cousin to be happy, and she's definitely known to fly-off-the-handle (she held a grudge with my sister for months over something petty a few years ago) ... but I don't want to work during her wedding that I'm already paying a lot of money to attend.

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** I emailed her saying I don't have experience with weddings and it would be a disservice to her to not hire a real wedding videographer. I offered to look up some in the area and asked for her budget / who she's spoken to already. She called me, saying that it doesn't matter that I don't have the experience, and it would mean so much to her. She said she's over budget and loves my work so much. I told her that we really want to be there and enjoy it, and she said she'd make sure we had a good time regardless ... agh.

We're thinking about skipping the wedding entirely and pretending we booked a big gig that we can't turn down or something? We don't want to start a precedent of working for family ... feel like it will become a pattern if we say yes and do it. We were able to turn down a commercial due to timing for my uncle's business (on the other side of the family) who wanted a big discount ... we can't start working for family for free now.

&#x200B;

**UPDATE:** I called her this morning and told her we can’t do it. It's beyond our weight limit for our carry ons / suitcases without paying extra (which is true), we have a ton of other work we're editing currently (also true), and I want to be there with my family to celebrate her, not to work (true) … and that, even if we just brought one camera and minimal gear, it wouldn't be up to the quality she wants, or the quality I'd want her to have in a wedding video (true). She was pretty upset about it but said in the end that they weren't planning on hiring a videographer anyway - and a video was something additional they could live without. She just thought it wouldn't be a big deal for me to make something for them ... but she said she was expecting us to both be filming, and for us to bring our professional gear and make it like a ""normal wedding video"".

I ended the conversation by saying that we can't wait to celebrate with her, and she didn't push it any further, she was still kind of pissed. So ... ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

581,Not the A-hole,"TLDR at the bottom

&#x200B;

**Background**: 

I'm a massive sports fan. I watch both male and female sports. However, I've 0 interest in soccer. I read the headlines and watch some of the goals, controversial incidents etc so I can make small talk with my friends, but I've only sat down and watched a full match only 3-4 times in my life because I find the sport unbearable to watch.

&#x200B;

**The Incident:**

I met with my gf in the city to get lunch. After lunch, we ran into 4 of her friends. There was a soccer game on in a bar in a few hours so they tried to convince us to go watch it. My gf wanted to go. I said she can go but I'm going to head back home because I have work to do and don't want to watch the game. Her friends tried to convince me to go but I stood firm in wanting to go home. 

One friend asked in a snarky tone -  ""is it because it's a woman's match and you'd watch it if men were playing?"". I completely disagreed with her. I hate soccer and wouldn't watch a men's game either. I also said it was pretty rude to assume that I wouldn't watch it since it's a woman's match. She pushed back pretty strongly. My gf tried to stand up for me but her friend wouldn't drop it. I got quite frustrated and said something along the lines of - ""it's ironic you're criticising me for not watching women's sport since I know for a fact that you have very little interest in sport (let alone soccer) and I have spent more time in front a screen/pitch-side watching women's sport in the last 6 months than you have in your lifetime"". I added that she was sexist for assuming that I don't support women's sport because I'm a man and that she wouldn't have criticised a female friend if they didn't want to watch this match. This caused her to get really angry and she started crying.

My gf and I went home and she called me a douche for making her friend cry. I explained the situation to my friends and the majority are on my side but the minority strongly believe that I was out of line calling her a sexist and should have just gone to watch the game. So, AITA?

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

I'm sports-mad but hate soccer. My gf's friends wanted us to go to a bar to watch a women's world cup game. I had work to do plus I hate soccer so I declined the offer. One friend strongly implied that I was sexist for not wanting to watch the game. I pushed back and ended up calling her a sexist which caused her to cry. AITA?",186,348,0.88

583,Not the A-hole,"Hi, I have only read reddit post up until now. I have something in my chest that I can't hold onto anymore. This happened about 3 weeks ago.

So the story: My friend just graduated from college and got a job at a different state. I was /am very happy for him and I wanted to celebrate with him. I asked him to hang out and originally we were going to go fishing, but he had to stay late and we ended up meeting in the afternoon. After a few minutes we did a coin toss on who was driving and it was him. We went to the first bar and ate, then we moved to a second bar had a few beers and left to go to the 3rd bar. Here is where it gets stupid.

We stayed in this bar for a while. I kept buying drinks and everything was on me. I'm not gonna lie, I drank way more than I could handle, we met some dude and he started drinking with us and I remember was me smoking a cigarette with them. I then browned out..... and when I woke up in a car, the dude on the passenger seat and then my buddy on the driver seat. I thought everything was okay until I heard ""yes, officer."" I was stunned, I didn't know what to do. I was also very drunk at this moment and started throwing up... A lot. At this moment the dude in the passenger seat told the officer that I was very sick and he needed to get me out. the dude pulled me to the side of the street away from view( i think) and I proceeded to vomit everywhere.... I asked him about my friend and told him I did not want to leave. But he insisted and told me that if I stay I would just get him in more trouble and get in trouble myself. Me being drunk, I got scared and just went with him. The dude got his friend ( or maybe his girlfriend) to pick us up and told me that I should fill up her car since they were helping me get home and I did it, it would be the same price for an uber anyway.

I got home, I tried contacting his family but my phone died and it had throw up on it and I was not able to charge it due to moisture. I tried to instagram message his brother. I tried for an hour or so but I was so drunk I couldn't even log in to my instagram. I then passed out and I woke up sober, panicking that I FUCKING LET MY BEST FRIEND SLEEP IN JAIL. I then called the jail to pay his bail or get him out, but they informed me that he was going to be released in a few hours. His brother contacted me and I told him everything, I tried contacting him when he got out but he never picked up or responded.

I understand that you don't want to talk to me anymore because I left and you should be angry because I left you and I shouldn't have done that.

585,Not the A-hole,"Hey guys,

Yesterday, I started my new job as a delivery driver for Papa John's to keep me busy before I head back to university in September. I had the interview last week and the manager said that I would work a trial shift (singular) unpaid where I would be shown the ropes.

I came to work yesterday and it seemed like a fairly ordinary ""first day""; going over health and safety and customer etiquette etc and then I went for a ride with another driver. Bear in mind this was all within the first hour. Then I was told to start doing deliveries by myself (which I was perfectly happy with as I thought I would just be doing a couple and then going home). I started my deliveries at 4 and didn't finish until 12, when I then had to help clean the store with one other employee. By this point, pretty much everyone had gone home (there had previously been six other drivers and about the same in store staff).

I was then told my trial period would also include today, presumably working the same hours again unpaid.

When I got home, I was pretty pissed off as:
a) A trial shift is normally a couple of hours to get used to the work, I had worked a full shift like the other workers.
b) they hadn't told me it would be a full shift
c) If I was working the same shift again today then I would be missing out on 16 hours of pay which equates to about £120.
d) the store had just had an extra pair of hands helping them for nothing which seems pretty exploitative

I then texted my boss politely asking if the next shift would be unpaid (even though I already knew the answer) and that I felt that sixteen hours unpaid work is unfair when I'm doing literally the same job as the 5 other drivers.

I woke up this morning to a brief message off him telling me to come in ten minutes before I was due to start. When I turned up, he sat me down in the office and asked me to explain why it was unfair. His reasoning to not pay me was ""all the drivers have to do two unpaid shifts"" and ""you were slow on some of your deliveries"" and he then told me to go home and come back tomorrow.

I'm pretty pissed off to be honest lads, but I can't help feeling like I'm coming off as an entitled prick.

590,Not the A-hole,"My family consist of my husband, and two sons, ages 14 and 11. I do almost all the cooking for the family. My husband will make dinner one night a week if I need him to due to work. That dinner is normally pasta or he will order pizza/take out. 

My husband on older son are picky eaters. My younger son is to a lesser extent. Husband doesn’t like eggs, beans, fish or shellfish, yogurt, sour cream, anything cream based, casseroles. Older son doesn’t like pasta, red sauce, most vegetables (exceptions are potatoes, corn, peas, mixed veggies). Younger son is not a big fan of red meat and fish that is not breaded and fried, and not a big fan of pizza. 

To complicate things, I am obese and joined WW to lose weight and improve my health. I’ve lost 40 pounds but still have a ways to go. Most of the foods on my zero point list are things someone in the family won’t eat. I’ve been making multiple meals to appease everyone but I’m tired of acting like a short order cook. 

WIBTA if I made a meals that I know some family members would not like? I would post a menu in the kitchen so everyone knew what was coming and they could plan to make themselves dinner if they didn’t like it. I do already try to get them involved in meal planning but the kids never participate, saying they don’t care or have any ideas. My husband participates but his ideas are usually really high point. I’ve been making a lot of chicken and they all complain about sprouting feathers. I’d like to incorporate things like fish and shrimp and meatless options more often but don’t because someone (or maybe all of them) wouldn’t even try it.

Edit: Wow! This got way more responses than I thought it would. Some additional info for those who have asked- I work a full time job that can be quite demanding. My kids can cook a little bit. They are completely capable of using the microwave and making soups or prepared chili on the stove top. My older son can heat things in the oven as well. I agree with the commenters that day I’ve spoiled them and I need to get them in the kitchen more. It will be good for them to have that knowledge when they become adults. My plan would be to have things I know they can prepare or put together at all times, so soups, chili, sandwich bread and fixings. I always make a big salad and hard boiled eggs in the fridge. Quick frozen meals. I am trying to move away from overly processed foods to homemade foods but I can freeze those meals or leftovers for that.

593,Asshole,"So a bit of context:

About 3 years ago, my mom decided to quit smoking, mostly due to me and wanting to live healthy. For the first couple months she really struggled, sometimes sneaking a smoke. She was then reliant on nicotine gum for the first year, then quit completely. I was so proud of her and happy. 

Today however, I caught her smoking a cigarette. I was super upset, and confronted her. I had a bit of a meltdown and cried. She obviously felt bad, but wasn’t really doing anything or promising not to smoke. So, in order to keep her from smoking, I decided to sort of up my game. I will not make eye contact with her and am guilting her as much as I can. I am manipulating her to the point where she almost didn’t go out for the day. 

I kind of feel like this is some sort of manipulation. Also, just so it’s clear, I really am upset and really do want her to stop smoking. She has offered to do things for me, and I have denied it.

If relevant she asked for a smoke from a family member who smokes heavily, and essentially made her relapse.

595,Not the A-hole,"  My husband and I have three children: Anna (24), Jeff (21) and Jed (19). I adopted Anna a year after I got married. To avoid issues with my husband’s family, only I adopted her and my husband did not. Jeff and Jed are our biological children. The three of them are close and get along very well.

My husband comes from a well-off family, and a few months ago when his father died, he left trust funds amounting to, let’s say, $100K for each of his biological grandchildren (including Jeff and Jed) and $20K for Anna that they can access when they turn 30. It’s my FIL’s choice what to do with his money and I’m just grateful for the gift he gave my daughter, but I also feel for her because she has a smaller nest egg compared to her brothers. I talked to my husband if we could set up a trust fund for Anna using our own money to help close the difference, but he said he is not sure if it’s the right thing to do. 

To make it clear, my husband is Anna’s father in every way except on paper. He loves her and has never treated her differently than our sons. However, he is concerned that Jeff and Jed might see this as us favoring Anna. I was planning to talk to our children about it so they would know, but my husband said that it didn’t matter if we told them tomorrow or if they find out when they’re 30, the point was that we still did not treat them equally. He said that his father’s relationship with his grandchildren is his own, and our relationship with our children is our own. He thinks we should not try to ‘make up’ for his father’s decision to leave a smaller inheritance to Anna at the cost of possibly making our sons feel that we favor their sister.

I love all my children equally, but at the same time, I worry less for Jeff and Jed because they already have a comfortable amount of money from their grandfather’s trusts. I only want my daughter’s future to be as secured as her brothers’.",373,1423,0.96

I've done a lot of similiar things. I've always felt like it was never a big deal and they shouldn't worry so much. Today I left my company car keys at home. I can't get to work without them. I asked my father if he could get them for me and he said yes, but only if I paid him a $100 because I was taking away a lot of his morning. I waited to reply until he brought them to me then said no, I won't be paying you a $100 for doing me a favor. Now, both my parents are ganging up on me saying how ungrateful I always am. I really don't know if IATA or not. They've been saying constantly how ungrateful I act when they do stuff for me. I tell them that you shouldn't ask for things in return when doing service and that I would do the same things as they do if they'd ask.

603,Everyone Sucks,"In April, a family friend's daughter, Sarah, contacted me about doing an internship. Sarah's family is in the same business as I am, but she needed an in-family internship. I've had her work for me before, so I said yes immediately. She's a great kid and a great worker. She needed 150 hours, and we hashed out pay, I signed her internship agreement and we were on our way to a great summer. Before she started, I asked her if she was interested in a summer job (full time May to August) or if she just wanted to do her internship and be done. She indicated she would like the full time position, so I didn't hire any additional summer help.

Everything was great for the first three weeks, then she started to become unavailable due to family obligations- helping a cousin with a cross country move, a sibling's surgery- I didn't say anything because I do think a cross country road trip in college is more of an experience than working in my shop for a week. 

Except I found out that Sarah was lying about all of these things she needed to do. The last straw was when her sister called me angrily and asked if Sarah was working for me. We found out that Sarah had been telling her family that she needed to help me, and telling me she needed to help her family. I left her a voicemail telling her the hours I needed and to let me know if she was interested and did not hear back. That was about a month ago- she had approximately 40 of her 150 hours completed. 

That was about a month ago, and I didn't think any more of it, until I saw Sarah's dad at an industry event. He awkwardly asked in front of other business owners if I could still sign off on Sarah's internship. I told him I would, not wanting to make a scene. 

I connected with Sarah again, and told her I'd sign her paperwork if she could work about 10 more hours that I was desperately trying to fill. She informed me that it wasn't just a paper, it was an entire report and visit with her advisors. I told her then that I was going to need her to do more of her hours before I would meet with her advisor. She agreed. 

She did the first 10 hours, and I've contacted her to schedule more hours and she is ghosting me again.

Back in late 2017 she went to live with her father after getting into an argument with her mother (long story).  For a little over a year our relationship was long distance as I was in NJ and she was in Cali.   While in Cali, she adopted a dog (a pit/rott mix).  I never saw the dog (in person) while she was in Cali because the only time I visited her she just stayed with me in an airbnb room.  Back in December I got an apartment and asked if she'd move in with me.  She said ""only if I can bring the dog"".  We discussed this and she assured me that the dog was ""house trained"" and a ""good boy"".  

Then on January 30th I picked her up in the airport and the dog barked the entire ride home, a sign of what was to come.  She brought it into my apartment and it wouldn't stop barking.  It's the loudest dog I've ever seen.  It took a piss on the floor literally 15 minutes after she took it for a walk.  She assured me that this behavior was unusual for him and that the dog ""just needs time to adjust"". 


Day after day, week after week, the dog barked all day and most of the night.  If he's not sleeping or eating, he's barking.  He's so loud that even with white noise playing and earplug in, I can still hear him.  Somehow my girlfriend isn't bothered by this and instead complains about the white noise I play.  She keeps telling me ""he just needs more time to adjust"".  I went from sleeping 8-9 hours a day to getting 4 hours of sleep a day, if that.  I work around 70 hours a week.  I need my sleep, I'm going crazy.


A month ago, I told her that since it's been 4 months with no improvement that she needs to do something about the barking.  I suggested getting a bark collar or muzzling him while I sleep and she asked if I was joking.  When she finally realized I was serious she went off on me and called me cruel for even suggesting it.  She also thinks i'm ""jealous"" of the dog because of the attention she gives it.  No joke.  

Now its been FIVE MONTHS and nothing has improved at all.  He still pees in the apartment no matter how often he's taken for a walk, and barks literally every few seconds.

612,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway. Long time lurker, first time posting. 

I am the oldest daughter of 4 children. I’m currently 25, 2nd oldest is 23, 3rd is 20, and youngest is 18. 

When I was 8 years old, my mom had an affair with a family friend. I, being the oldest has remembered most of it and my younger siblings only remember growing up with our parents co parenting. 

This has put a strain on my mothers and I’s relationship- she cheated on my father who was battling cancer. 
She didn’t even try to keep it a secret from the kids, I remember during family/friend gatherings when everyone would be inside and I’d see my mom and the family friend kissing or doing things in the pool. As a kid I didn’t understand, but as I got older I realized what she was doing in front of us and I feel sick. 

People ended up catching on to their affair years later, and my mom left my dad and started a new relationship with this “family friend”. They split up shortly after that because he cheated on my mother. 

I’ve confronted her about this after my dad passed and we all went to see a family therapist. This was roughly 3 years ago. 

My mom has since remarried to an incredible man, but recently she was out and bumped in to this man from her past. They exchanged emails and she confided in me that they have been sending emails back and forth and are planning to meet up to chat and catch up. I read the messages and it’s very apparent that the guy still has feelings, while my mom is trying to make it seem like she’s just catching up with an old Co worker. But I know my mother, and I know she is still slightly infatuated with this man, and flattered that he still wants her. I mean it’s been years, why else would you want to catch up?

My new step dad knows about her past, and while he doesn’t agree with it, it’s been years, he wasn’t in her life yet.

She asked me what I thought about her meeting up with him, and said something along the lines of needing closure. She asked for my honest opinion about the matter and I told her; 

“To be honest mom, you dealing with this guy in the past ruined yours and daddy’s marriage and you guys had 4 kids. Idk why you think it wouldn’t ruin this one, but why don’t you stop being a whore and stop thinking with your pussy, and delete this guys damn email?”

She cried, said she couldn’t believe I just called her a whore and left my house. We haven’t spoken for a few days.

Today, I got a call from my siblings saying I hurt my moms feelings and whatever happened betweens her and daddy’s marriage was between them. I disagree, I had to witness my mom cheating on my father, I watched him die in bed while she was off to god knows where with this man. She asked for my opinion and my opinion is that she’s selfish and a whore who left my dad to die on his own and she wants to rekindle with this man and possibly cheat on my new step dad? Sorry I’m not sorry for feeling some type of way about it.",1112,23222,0.92
613,Not the A-hole,"For context, I met a guy on Tinder. Things were going well until we moved over to snap chat. The usual small talk ensues until he spots my pet Cockatiel. He casually says, ""yeah my sister used to have 6 of them, but one of them started eating out its own chest"" immediately alarm bells go off, because for those of you who don't know, birds that aren't taken care of properly pluck their feathers out. I tell him this and ask what happened to the birds.

 He said his Mum feed them for a few months after his sister left but got sick of looking after them and set them free. Which horrified me even further because where we live, the birds would have likely died of exposure. I told him this, saying that if they didn't have the time/resources to  look after the birds they should've given them to the SPCA or other similar organizations. Saying that because of the actions of him and his family, the animals suffered. He got very defensive and angry, saying that its not his fault because they weren't his birds, and not his responsibility. As well as that because his Mum is a single parent working full time, she was too busy to take them to the SPCA.

 I still believe that its horrifying that someone can live in the same house as a suffering animal and not do anything.

 And i still believe that being busy is not an excuse for animal abuse.

Am I just out of touch? Is it possible that his  Mum really didn't have time? I never said that any of his family was a bad person, just ignorant and made bad decisions which cause suffering.

For context, I’ve been with my husband for over ten years (yes, we got together young) and we’ll likely have kids in a few years. 

My SIL has started having kids, and my parents in law didn’t want to go by anything traditional like grandma/grandpa/grandad/nanny/pop/gran etc. In conjunction with my SIL, they chose two names that are... absolutely vomit-inducing cutesy. Neither my husband or I were involved in this discussion (and nor should we have been) and my nieces/nephews have been using these names for several years now. 

Now I’m worried that they are going to insist that my kids use those names for them too. 

Normally I’m a pretty live-and-let-live person, but I honestly think I’m going to struggle to use these names for them. I can’t say them without cringing or laughing.

Jax took me about 6 months just to even let me(male) put a leash on him. I would walk up to him slowly with the leash and he would cower and pee throughout the house just to fall to his side and surrender, thus allowing me to leash him up.  Finally, after 6 months of patience and perseverance, he started to trust me and allowed me to leash him up no issues! (Not looking for validation here, just backstory) 

Leia, my minpin, is highly protective of me and feels the need to alert me to any incoming ""threats"". She's got an attitude of a much much larger dog than she actually is.

623,Not the A-hole,"I can't think of a title that completely summarizes what i did but here's the story:

&#x200B;

So in our company, we have a room with 8 beds which is the sleeping quarters (there's no limitation on the duration of the sleep). My situation is that the distance of my company and my house is so far away that if i were to travel point to point, i will only get 4 to 6 hours of sleep, so i decided to have a bag full of clothes that will suffice my needs from Monday to Friday and basically i'll work and sleep within the company. So, with this in mind, i'm not the only person that is doing this. Every time i want to sleep, i always wait for other people to wake up because the rule is first come first serve basis.

My issue here is there's **always** 2 or 3 persons who leaves their bags and blankets in their bed; while, they are working. So they will come back 7 or 8 hours after their shift was done and sleep in their bed.

One time, I got fed up with their 'technique' that I decided to neatly remove their bags and blankets to the side of the bed and I'll sleep in the bed. So while i was in a middle of sleeping, a person that came back from their shift, woke me up and told me that i was an asshole for taking up his bed and he justifies it that he was the first person to put their bag in that bed.

With this, AITA for doing that? I did that because i was really sleepy and that they are not actually sleeping and they reserved it with their bags.

I know the story sounds childish but there are people who are bothered with what they are doing and I just want to step up with their technique.  


Edit: Hi everyone! For more info, all the beds were already occupied by a human being and 2 to 3 beds were reserved by a bag or their clothes. I'll actually email and raise a formal request on the matter with our HR team for them to check and update their rules on this as sometimes there are people waiting beside the room and they can't sleep because the beds has been reserved by the bags.

626,No A-holes here,"I’m 25. My gf is 24. She’s from Russia and we met in college overseas. She’s in Russia right now, helping her father with some business.

She told me in confidence that some guy (35) has been texting her sexually, and trying to get with her. She told him she has a boyfriend, but the man replied, “that’s fine I just want sex.” He even had the audacity to say he likes her ass, and when he sees her he feels like he’s in love.

Now this especially pisses me off because I can’t do anything about it from a distance. I told her that if telling him to f*ck off didn’t do anything, she needs to tell her father. She said she’s just ignoring him, and embarrassed to tell her father because the guy has been working for him for decades, and the texts are lewd.

I told her that’s completely ridiculous, and now she’s upset she even told me. 

I want to either A) tell her father about it, get him to have the man f*ck off

Or B) demand she gives me his number and tell him off myself. 

Now I’m wondering if I would be the ass**** if I did either of those two things, potentially instigating or put her in more danger.

627,Everyone Sucks,"For some background that might make this situation seem worse for everyone, the sex tape was one of him and his wife after they got drunk one night. Like, absolutely hammered. That makes him look like a bad guy for showing me, but his wife said it was fine and even watched too.

This may seem weird, but her and I used to date back in our college days, and a little after. It was never that serious, but we had a lot of sex. Because of this, she and my friend casual discuss things most couples normally wouldn't share to others (her excuse it that I've probably seen her like that more times than anyone probably will. And my friend is okay with it because, in his mind, he was able to ""steal"" her away from me, so he feels secure about himself.)

They have been married for a few months, dating for six months, but knew each other from college. My friend almost always brags about his sex with his wife whenever possible, and she fuels the fire by agreeing with him 1000%. So, last night, when we were getting hammered at a party(It was mine, so I had to clean a house with a huge hang-over. Yay!), I called their bluff and said I wanted some proof. They took me seriously and left to go film the tape. 

They showed up to my house the next day saying they have the video and were ready to laugh in my face. They even said they hadn't even watched it yet. My friend made a joke about being so drunk that the only thing he remembers was how great the sex was.   They took the video from the camera and put it into my laptop (not so tech savvy, I think it was using the sd card) and we watched the video. 

The video was an hour long, but the ""action"" was over in a few minutes. From the start of the video, you could tell he was hammered. He could barely walk straight without doing the extreme side lean, they fiddled with the camera while saying ""Turn on"" for a few minutes even though it was already on. They stating going at it when his wife said, ""Wait, hold on. Are you okay?"" He immediately responded with a yeah before going back at it. She just loudly said, ""You just feel different, Smaller."" He ignored her, finished shortly after, and then went to sleep. She tried to shake him awake, but he didn't respond. She then started to say, ""Hey, (insert name×2), wake up. You let me finish, you sure your okay? Why the hurry?"" Which is all fine and all (I mean, he was drunk. And him being quick wasn't why I laughed), but she didn't say his name. She said mine. That's why I laughed. They immediately left the house, leaving the video, and yelled at each other about cheating. 

I thought that would be it. I thought we could just get over it. I was wrong. I get to work earlier today a little later than normally(we work together), and everyone treats me like I'm toxic. When I ask what's up, they say ""You sleep with his wife, AND you show up late."" 

I explained what happened, and how I didn't sleep with her during their relationship, but they still say I am an asshole for laughing at him.

628,No A-holes here,"My son (17) came to us and said that he had gotten his girlfriend pregnant. Him even having a girlfriend was news to us, so we asked a few questions. When I found out who it was, I admit it made the situation worse. Our town isn’t Mayberry, but it’s not a sprawling metropolitan. The girl is the same age as him and is on her third pregnancy, which is well known at their high school-all by different fathers. First pregnancy, she had an abortion. Second, she miscarried. Now, she’s on her third with my son.

We agreed to meet with her parents. I said that while I’m not against the kids dating, we won’t be giving any money until we do a DNA test and know the child is my son’s. I even agreed to pay for one of those tests you can do while she’s still pregnant, so if he was, we could start figuring stuff out before the baby comes. Her parents agreed to it, but seemed turned off as to why I kept saying things as “If (Son) is the father”. I didn’t come out and say it, but I thought it was pretty naïve of them, given their daughter’s situation (they know of her previous pregnancies-they mentioned them in the meeting).

My husband and I sort of got into a disagreement about it afterwards. Obviously, our son isn’t innocent either. He got himself in a situation where he potentially got a girl pregnant at 17. At the same time, I want to protect him from a potential situation. I don’t think this girl or her parents are after money, they’re not in need of it. I just think they don’t want their daughter to go through this alone and I don’t blame them. And if this baby is our grandchild, they will not lack for love…but I’m not getting attached. Husband asked if I would feel different if she were say our older son’s first girlfriend, who was a much different girl-not a very racy past. I admitted, I wouldn’t.

Enter lady with four kids: A newborn, two toddlers, and a kindergarten aged kid (little girl in question here). She really really should have brought an iPad or a second adult or something because her kids were literally running around this tiny ass space, yelling and screeching. The mom was oblivious to all of her kids except the newborn, who was quietly breastfeeding while mom was glued to her phone screen. Accordingly, other people were put in the awkward position of having to discipline her kids. Several people had previously tried to put her kids back in line for whatever issue (harassing their kids, being loud, whatever).

Her kindergarten aged daughter, who clearly had some kind of special needs, was absolutely enamored with my newborn and his stroller. She was asking me if she could push it around (no) she was getting super close to my newborn (stop) and was generally just being annoying. Ffs at one point when I wasn't looking and was preoccupied with my own kid, she went digging in my diaper bag and throwing my stuff onto the chair and the floor. My newborn was really fussy because we were there for a sick visit and he wasn't feeling well, and I DID NOT feel like entertaining some strange kid. 

I tried being polite about it ""Sweetie where's your mommy?"" -points to mom- ""Ma'am!"" -points to kid- The lady would call her kid back, but the kid just kept coming back to me. Rinse and repeat. I told her she needed to stay with her mom. Little punk deadass says ""I don't wanna"" and keeps trying to touch my son, my stroller, our stuff. 


Finally, I'm trying to fix a bottle of formula while holding a screaming baby and listening to this little girl like a broken record ""why is your baby crying? Why is your baby crying! make him stop! I don't like that"" And her and her annoying self knocks my bottle of formula off the table and into my stroller. So now I'm out formula, kid still screaming, and I have a huge mess that I don't have a great way to clean up. 

I'm at my wits end. I raise my voice at this kid. ""LOOK WHAT YOU DID. I AM NOT YOUR MOM, I AM NOT YOUR BABYSITTER. YOU ARE BOTHERING ME. GET OUT OF MY FACE!!"" 

People looked at me like I was the biggest bitch on earth. A lady speaking Spanish actually did call me a bitch. The little girl starts crying. I'm not apologizing. The mom confronts me, I tell her she should have been watching her kid and that's the hill I'm prepared to die on.

My boyfriend and I are currently living in a small 2 bedroom apartment. Our dog’s kennel is in the second bedroom, and only have our bed and the couch for sleeping areas. I moved in after his old roommate/ friend moved out last August, which we darn near had to evict the roommate to get him out due to poor planning on his part. 

He was a pretty bad roommate, always behind on bills, never ever cleaned, left huge stains on the walls when he left and still owed my boyfriend $1000+ in rent and utilities when he moved out. Has since paid it off a year later, mostly. Nice guy, just bad at adulting. The only reason we still talk to him is because he is nice just irresponsible, not a problem when you don’t live with him.

The friend works at a nearby bar, and asked if he could crash on the couch when he gets off work a few nights a week so he won’t have to drive 45+ minutes home at 3am. I wake up early for work, and we have a dog that would be woken and will go bonkers if he comes in at 3am. I feel bad saying no, but I don’t want this previously bad roommate coming back, waking my dog up, waking us up, at 3am randomly. He’s a nice guy and we kinda want to help him but his past behavior would make it an extreme inconvenience.

632,Not the A-hole,"My (now ex) husband and I tried for 3 years to conceive with no luck before turning towards adoption, which was an uphill battle for 7 years. My husband’s cousin’s daughter (who we’ll call Kayla) for this story, came to us after a particularly hard failed placement (we had held the baby and all but signed the papers to bring him home). She was only 21 at the time, 6 months pregnant. We knew that she had been considering adoption but we hadn’t asked her about us at all, because one, we were planning on adopting the other baby and two, that just wasn’t our place. Kayla told us that she had given it a lot of thought and she really wanted to keep her baby in the family. She knew that we would be her parents, but she said that she felt we were the best fit. We talked about it, still a bit burned, though soon became overjoyed and told her yes.

She gave us a beautiful baby girl. Before our daughter’s birth, we outlined everything at length and made it clear that we would be the parents. Our daughter would always know that Kayla was her birth mom, of course, but she wouldn’t parent her. We also outlined visitations, pictures, etc. Kayla was okay with all of it. Everything went well those first 3 years.

Some stuff went on between me and my now ex. He’s now no longer in the picture, not with me or my daughter. This is by his choice, and I wish more than anything he would be for our daughter. This is when things with Kayla went south. She started trying to come around more (we live in the same town). She’d drop by unannounced, call constantly to check up on things and pick fights with me about my parenting. All of this while I’m dealing with the divorce of my husband of 16 years. My emotions got the best of me and I didn’t always handle it best, but it was just too much. Eventually, she told me she wished she hadn’t let us adopt our daughter because she wanted her to have two parents and now, she just has one. I snapped.

I told her that I didn’t want her coming to my daughter’s 4th birthday party. This would be the last event she’d be seeing her at for a bit since we’re moving. This greatly upset her, according to Kayla’s mother. I just can’t deal with this drama. I plan to just tell my daughter that Kayla is sick and couldn’t make it. AITA here?

&#x200B;

Edit: Some clarity. The adoption was legal and myself, along with my ex-husband, are my daughter's legal parents. (Though I now have sole physical custody.) We set up a visitation plan with Kayla, though it cannot be legally enforced.

I did not decide to move away because Kayla made this comment. I have been planning to move-which Kayla knows-after my daughter's birthday out of state as I can no longer afford to live in the same area after my divorce and becoming a single mother. Even with this, Kayla would still see my daughter, she just wouldn't be able to drop in and do what she does now.

633,Asshole,"My wife and I decided years ago that we would live a lifestyle that doesn't scream ""RICH"" to our kid before we even had him. We together make high 6 digit figures and obviously, rent/expenses are taken care of and we have nothing to worry about, but we're not going to go to some fancy restaurant and splurge on hundreds of dollars of food a night. He's 7 now, and we don't buy him everything he asks for. Maybe a console on christmas. A single video game on his birthday. We don't want him growing into a spoiled brat not thinking about his future and living on parent's money.

We sometimes put on an act in front of him, and tell him we're living day by day and we should be thankful for what we have. We want to try to instill in him that money is a precious thing. But recently, he told his friends. He said we're just getting by, and his friends told their parents, and that's when the issue happened. The parents obviously knew how well we were off, and several of them started whispering behind our backs, then in front of us. How we're looking down on others actually not well off and how fake we were. I can see a rip between the community and my household.

Am I the asshole here? I just wanted my kid to grow properly and be less materialistic than what he can be.

UPDATE: After a serious discussion with wife reading through the comments, we decided to have a sitdown with our son. We talked about the value of money, how we were doing fine, and he didn't have to worry a bit. We don't want him to grow up thinking we're liars

I want to clear some things up though even though it doesn't matter at this point. I never said the word ""poor"" once to him. When I say ""day by day"" I meant in terms he could understand. For example, when we go grocery shopping, he'll bring a snack and we'll say how if we buy that, we can't buy food then so he'd put it back. This isn't to say we never bought him things. We buy him snacks, clothing, and anything that could be considered luxury goods for a kid. I thought we never said it in a way for him to be stressed, but I guess we were wrong.

Some backstory here: my mom recently got remarried to a guy that I cannot stand because she starting seeing him before her and my dad finalized their divorce. It caused a rift in our relationship, and things have been rocky between us for the past two months. I live with her, and we’re very close, but her new marriage has caused countless fights between us.

Today I took my mom out for coffee and we were chatting. I mentioned to her that my financial aid had come through, and that it was going to completely cover the upcoming school year. She congratulated me, and then said “I don’t know how much longer you’ll be getting financial aid.”

When I asked her why she would say that, she said that our new household income had risen because of her new marriage, and after next year I probably won’t be eligible for any financial aid. I asked why she hadn’t talked to me about this before the wedding, and she told me that she hadn’t thought about it.

I was upset because my entire college plan is based around the amount of aid I’ve been able to receive as a low-income student from a low-income household. We fought about it. When we got home, I stayed in the car to calm down. Once I had calmed down, I went inside to make myself food. I didn’t try to make any conversation, because I was still angry. 

Out of (what felt like) nowhere, my mom starts telling me that by not making conversation with her, I was not being civil. She said I was driving my siblings out of the house, and that she was going to leave because of the way I have been acting. Then she threatening to kick me out because she says that I have been making life for her miserable by fighting with her so often. 

I felt like my feelings were justified and I wasn’t wrong for being upset and arguing with her about it. She thought that I was being unreasonable and that I should have let it go and continued having a nice conversation with her. 

So, AITA?

Edit: I’m getting a lot of comments that suggest that I wouldn’t have wanted my mom to get married if it meant I lost my financial aid. That’s not at all what I meant. I just wished she would have talked with me beforehand so I was aware of how the changing income could affect me. Yes, I should have thought of it. But I didn’t.

However they don't seem to care much about the invisible barriers between the 2 houses and basically play as if it's all one yard. I spoke to them about it and they very obviously rolled their eyes but did agree to move.

I work from home in a condo building with assigned parking for owners around the sides of the building, which also shares a driveway with two surrounding buildings on either side.

This morning I went out to run some errands and grab lunch, came back to find a car parked in the entrance to the driveway, blocking my access to my parking space beside. As soon as I pulled up I saw a lady from the neighboring building leaving it and carrying boxes to the car, she saw me, shook her head and motioned me to park elsewhere. I rolled my window down, explained she was parked in a drive way and blocking my access to my paid and assigned parking space, I made the point that she surely wouldn't block someone's house driveway to move her things and that was effectively what she was doing to me.

A younger guy (I'm 26, he was 20) followed behind and told me they weren't moving until they were done with those boxes, ""tough shit, (they) don't give a fuck."" I said ""No, you're going to move your fucking car, it's blocking my private property and that's illegal"". The lady again repeated that it wasn't happening, I said ""wow, fuck you then"". The guy suddenly runs at me, I barely closed my window in time as he's right up to the door with his hands in the air asking me who the fuck I think I am, cursing me out, yelling.

I drove away shaken because I didn't expect that kind of escalation for a parking dispute, he chased my car down the middle of the street until the end of the block. I called the police non-emergency line to report it because I was afraid they'd damage my car next time they saw it and I wanted a record. I kind of expected they'd just take a report and tell me it's a civil issue, but they sent 3 cops who took statements from me and them. I told them what I wrote here, the neighbors said I showed up swearing and yelling at them to move immediately and the guy ""over-reacted to seeing his step-mom talked to in such a way"" even though they were rude and dismissive to me from the start and I reacted emotionally once it was clear they weren't going to move. One of the officers I was giving my statement to said that my version of events made a lot more sense as to how the situation would escalate. No one was arrested and I'm not sure what they said to them once I went inside after giving the statement.

640,No A-holes here,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons

&#x200B;

Okay, let's get into it.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for less than a year and found out a few weeks ago that we're expecting. I'm only 6 weeks along. He has mentioned that he'd like to get married as soon as possible so that I can move in and all the insurance stuff will get worked out for me and our child.

So, I'm in my twenties and he's in his fifties. I'm not asking opinions on this, only adding it in for context. About three years ago, he tragically lost his wife to a car accident. I never dated anyone before him and we met after his wife's passing. We fell in love and are absolutely thrilled about this baby, though it was a major surprise.

I'm at his house every day and his house is filled with photos of him and his late wife. I mean FILLED. Every corner, I see her face. It was very hard to have sex in other parts of the house besides his room because I would look up and see her. I felt wrong in some way. I understand that his home is where he should be able to live peacefully and have what he wants up, but it didn't sit right with me. He talks about her quite often in the most inopportune times, and it bothers me some but I never say anything.

&#x200B;

Anyway, so now that we're talking about getting married and me moving in, the topic of me moving my stuff to his place came up. We talked about redecorating some and I VERY POLITELY asked if we could discuss her pictures. I did not tell him to take them down, but asked if he needed so many of them up now that I will be moving in. He got very mad and said I shouldn't question how he grieves. I was careful not to mention that I wanted pictures of us up, as I knew that may come across as I want to be taking her place. We've only exchanged words when absolutely necessary and that was two days ago. He thinks I'm being disrespectful and ruining what he's done to honor his late wife.

&#x200B;

Allow me to clarify that I do not expect to be taking her place, nor do I want to. I just want our home to feel like my home, too and I can't do that with his late wife looking me in the eyes around every corner. I don't want our baby to grow up and see these pictures and wonder who this woman is all around our house. 

Please, Reddit answer me this, AITA for wanting to create a new life with my new soon to be husband and father of my child?

641,Not the A-hole,"Hi guys,

Context, I'm a student who crashes at home during the vac with a younger sister (referred to as Sis). I like vintage clothing and spend a lot of time shopping for second hand designer items in thrift stores etc as a hobby. Even if I don't pay much for my clothes they are all irreplaceable.

Sis and I have always had a very open borrowing policy with clothes. At the beginning of the university year this year, I asked Sis if she could not borrow my clothes for a term, as I noticed some things were missing and I just wanted to gather them all in one place when I got back. I made clear that once I came back things would resume as usual.

During term I noticed Sis wearing one of my more expensive pieces in a social media post, and when I got back I found several bits in her wardrobe, which I hate as a lot of them have special washing requirements.

I got mad and said she could no longer use my clothes. She got angry and said I had no right to do that. I had completely stopped wearing her stuff, and she has never paid for any of my clothing.

Right before I left for uni, she stole some of my favourite pieces and hid them so I couldn't find them. I'm pretty sure she stole money as well.

When I got back, more pieces were missing, some of which I can't find anymore.

At this point, I'm pretty sure Sis is the asshole, but my mum is taking her side.

I get angry, and a bit petty, so I buy and install a security camera for my room

My mum now gets furious, as she uses my room as a guest room when I'm not around and throws it out. She promises that Sis will no longer borrow my clothes.

When I get back this term, I spot my clothes in her holiday photo's, and a bunch more in her room.

I've reinstalled the security camera, and am going to cable tie my wardrobe shut when I leave over the summer. I've also bought a lockable trunk to keep my favourite pieces in until I can move out.

Everyone is angry at me, saying that I am petty and selfish, but I am annoyed that my sister couldn't keep her hands to herself for three months as a favour to me, especially when I've been so generous before. I feel like they don't respect my room, my belongings or my wishes.

AITA for being so controlling over my clothes and reacting so harshly to Sis using them?

Edit: would like to say that the camera is obvious, I told my family I was putting up and why I was doing it, and it only shows the door so I can see who exits and enters the room. I can turn it off remotely and only store 24 hours of footage, so if needed I can turn it off if my mum has a guest.

Edit: oh wow so this really blew up.

So first of all camera was never hidden. Would like to clarify that. Informed whole family, hence the reason it got thrown out and only used for like a week.

I mainly bought it as a deterrent, and hopefully to prove to my mum how bad the stealing was which ended up being pointless thanks to social media.

Although I had reinstalled, have now taken it down after feedback in post.

Currently using the locked trunk instead, which my mum has allowed me to store in attick where it's harder to get to.

Am moving out soon anyway but due to the way my college dorm system works currently not an option.

Camera was petty, I know. But please stop complaining about it being hidden and read the damn post.

Edit: also thanks to everyone that responded. It's hard to be objective your own family, and the responses have helped me handle this better as I no longer feel like I'm going crazy, allowing me to take a step back and be more mature about it.",118,1055,0.96
642,No A-holes here,"So I’m a dude in my early 20s, and very often when I’m at parties or hanging out with friends, unsurprisingly, sex and hooking up comes up.

Now, I’ve never so much as kissed a girl, so when people start talking about when/how they lost their virginity I feel super uncomfortable and awkward because I’m super self conscious about the fact I haven’t done anything with anyone yet.

I also feel like it comes of as “weird” that someone my age has never done anything, and that often leads to them asking more questions about why I haven’t been able to yet or whatever.

She was a very free spirited, aligned with nature type, and from what I gather she used to cleanse crystals there, which was fitting because of the name. When she passed our family found a lot of solace and beauty in that location, it was always very positive and comforting to go there and it still is. Recently I became pregnant, and during a conversation with my MIL, she happened to suggest the name of the location of my sisters death. She had no idea about this, but my husband and I immediately looked at each other and knew it’d be perfect. I know my sister would love the idea. Well, when I told my mom, she lost it. She immediately got emotional and we got into a bit of an argument about how I could even think to name her grandchild that, and how it’s morbid and inappropriate. The thing is, I don’t see it that way. I see it as a perfect way to honor my sister, considering we spent so long in morning treasuring that place. WIBTA if I name my daughter this?

644,Asshole,"So I'm 20 but I turn 21 in late July. In the past I've never had any problems with my parents letting me drink at home in moderation ever since I graduated high school, things like letting me have a wine cooler with a meal, have a beer watching a movie at home, my mom ordered a rum and Coke and gave it to me at a wedding reception, they let me have a few shots at their friends' New Year's party, etc. Also they told me that as long as turn over my car keys to them for the night they won't question me about going to my friends places or what happened there, so I'll have my friend picks me up or take an Uber if I'm going to a party of my friends at home that'll probably have drinking. 

This summer they basically cut all that off once I got back home. My mom once asked to see my ticket stub when I told her I was going with my friend to a movie (I actually did so it wasn't an issue but I was frustrated by the lack of trust), they aren't giving me liquor or beer ever. When I asked my mom why the big change she said that my dad and her let me drink in limited amounts under controlled situations because they knew I would probably drink anyway and was at college, so this let me do it safely and not feeling repressed where I'd go drinking unsafely or driving drunk. But since I'm turning 21 so soon there's no need for this and the safest thing to do is just wait because it's pretty short anyway. She said she'll allow the occasional wine cooler with a meal until then but that's it.

This makes no sense to me so I kind of blew up at her. Since then I've been almost giving the silent treatment. I also can't believe I'm almost 21 and being treated like I'm back in high school. But now I'm feeling a bit guilty. Was I being a dick?",43,48,0.86

I said no due to the fact that 1) I’m not fond of babies and 2) I didn’t sign up to live with 3 other girls PLUS a newborn. She understood and left it at that.

647,Not the A-hole,"So a year ago my gifriend booked an appointment for a sleeve tattoo with a very difficult to book artist.  Its her second tattoo but way bigger than her first. Since we booked it a lot has changed, most recently we both moved and started new jobs. When i started my new job i arranged to get that day off to drive her there and back (50 miles each way) and for support and nerves. This has been the plan since day 1.

 Her appointment is now this upcoming Monday and my work is on fire. Our general manager quit with no notice, the schedule is changing effective immediately, and our new manager starts the same day as her appointment. I have been told previous days requested cant be honored for that day because of everything happening on top of it being the last day of our financial quarter in sales. I have nothing in writing from the previous manager to back up me having it off either. Ive explained to her that it puts me in a really uncomfortable situation to fight for a day off when everyone else is expected to be there and i feel like it starts me off on the wrong foot with new management. Im also the newest employee here. All in all it sucks and i feel horrible for having to back out so close to her appointment but i feel that its out if my control and it is what it is. I dont think a tattoo appointment is worth making a big deal about at a job I've only been at 1 month.

She is very upset, which im understanding of but im still not planning to escalate this with my work for the time off. Her whole stance is that im being extremely unsupportive, that i wont be at this job for much longer (planning to leave end of summer), and that i should fight for the day considering how long ago we made the plans. She pays for most things and feels like i shouldnt worry about possibly losing money or sales.

My whole stance is that I don't want to risk my position here and start off on the wrong foot day 1 with new management. I would be the only person off that day and would likely miss important meetings and possibly sales. Im too new to have a strong case to make as to why i should be able to be off, and none of this was within my control. I dont feel i can be called unsupportive when i had made evey effort to be there for her.

At the end of the day i love her more than any job but i also need to look out for my success at work for us to have a future together in the first place.

I wanted to post an update, since the response to my post was overwhelming and people have asked. I appreciated how passionate people got and even though I was not labeled TA, the people calling me one had valid points that I took to heart. I appreciate people taking the time to respond, even if it was hard to hear. And for giving me honest unfiltered opinions which was what I needed. I’m happy to report that my boyfriend and I ARE still together. We are now back to having sex, after almost 4 months of celibacy. It had been a month or so longer than I thought when I originally posted. I feel that this break really helped us connect on a deeper level.

It has been more awkward than I thought to get back into sex after not having it for so long as people warned me about. But it’s getting better with time. We don’t have sex every day anymore, it’s toned down quite a bit and I think we both feel less pressure, which was another thing suggested to me on my post. Going through this was tough, but made both of us realize our relationship is worth fighting for. We are even more serious now. 

A lot of people called me an asshole for making a unilateral decision, and they were right. However He was clear that this should have been my choice because it’s my body so I don’t think he held that against me as much as was assumed on my post. But he didn’t appreciate the blindside (fair). People suggested me setting an end date which was a good idea. I decided on not choosing a date to for sure start sex again because that would be counter productive, but a date that we revisit the idea. we discussed everything at length that was brought up in the comments of the post I asked him to be honest with me. There was some yelling out of frustration, But ultimately we were ok and he was patient. We decided that if we weren’t having sex by July (I let him decide) we would have to see if we needed to try something else or if it was time to part ways. Luckily we never had to have that talk.  But having a date to at least revisit things was a huge help. I also continued to check in with him. It was very, very far from idyllic But we kept communicating which was key. 

Overall, I’m at peace with my choices. I feel super confident, I know he’s with me for me, and most of all I learned how much value I bring to the relationship. I’m glad I posted that, because had I not I’m not sure I’d have gotten to this point if I hadn’t taken the advice I got. There were things brought up in my post that I never would have thought about on my own.",48,325,0.9

I tell him how I love to play the piano. My dad passed due to lung cancer when I was 8, but he was the one to really inspire me to start playing because of how often he would play the piano for me, or simply in his spare time. 

So I bring up my love of the piano and he starts to laugh. I ask him what’s so funny and he admits that he hates classical music. 

I was kind of skeptical and explained that a lot of songs use the piano, even if the songs aren’t classical. 

He didn’t believe me and continued to berate classical music and such. So I flagged down the waitress, spilt the tab, paid and left. 

I told my mutual friend what had happened and she said I was an asshole because he was such a good guy and music shouldn’t really change that.

My girlfriend and I met in high school. We started dating in my senior year and have been together ever since.
She is 1 year younger than me and was 2 years below me.

When I started university, we decided we would try long distance. I have traveled ~8 hours every weekend to see her. She never came to me as public transport is free for university students in this country and otherwise it would cost her too much.

She just graduated high school and is going to a university that's relatively close to mine. It would be a total of 4 hours (2 to come, 2 to go) instead of the 8 to go to our parents' home town.

My fiancé has 1 older half sister, who is 26. I’ve only met her twice and Im not very close with her. She and my fiance were close as children but now they have grown apart over the past few years. She is still invited to the wedding, of course, along with her husband and 2 kids.

I told him that I’m only planning to have 6 and that I don’t really know her well enough to make her my bridesmaid. He said that was understandable and told her.

I told her that my bridesmaids are people who I’m particularly close with, and besides, they all know each other and we live in the same city, while she lives like 6 hours away.

659,Not the A-hole,"Background on my condition: 

I have narcolepsy, a condition characterized by excessive sleepiness where your brain is constantly on the edge of REM sleep because my brain doesn’t produce the chemicals it needs to make me feel awake. Even with a good night’s sleep, I’m basically functioning as if I haven’t slept in 2 days. I experience constant tiredness, have hallucinations when I go to sleep and wake up, and can have sleep attacks where I basically can’t keep my head up.

I manage it pretty well. I take Concerta (time-release Adderall that serves as a stimulant) and try to get as much sleep as possible. But it’s still a daily factor in my life. My ex-boyfriend was really great with me. If I got too tired, we’d go home. If I had an occasional bad day health-wise, he’d be patient and even get me food or groceries because I’d be too tired to leave the house. Since he woke up before me, he’d wake me up, remind me to take my meds, and let me go back to sleep so I could wake up with them already active. Even though my ex was great (broke up because of circumstances), I can function fine by myself. He was just a support system. 



Recently, I matched with someone on Tinder and we got talking. We were supposed to go out for drinks tomorrow night but he mentioned that he has narcolepsy. I thought that was kind of cool that there are other people near me with the condition because it’s pretty rare but realized that I could not, under any circumstances, get romantically involved with another narcoleptic.

It’s just one date, but on the chance that we ended up really liking each other, I didn’t want to risk it. My narcolepsy is a huge burden in my daily life and I know how it feels to be constantly tired, occasionally agoraphobic, and definitely helpless on some days. If I end up with someone, I’d like that support system again and to be able to support them in whatever they need as well. But I just don’t want to have narcolepsy take over even more of my life. I’m totally aware a first date is very low commitment but I figured it’d be nicer to cut it off ahead of a meeting to not waste his time.

I sent him the following message: “I appreciate your honesty but I’m also narcoleptic. You seem like an awesome guy but I don’t think it’s a good idea to go out with someone who also has narcolepsy. Two sleepy people can be trouble! I hope you understand and I’m really sorry about this.”

He replied with a whole string of messages saying that I was prejudiced against the disabled and I need to learn how to be more open-minded. 

I considered my line of thinking as logical and genuinely didn’t want to hurt his feelings. Also, I’m confused on how I’m being prejudiced because I have the same condition he has.

This happened a few months ago. In high school I was close friends with a girl, let's call her A. We got along very well, but we had completely different lifestyles and drifted apart once I graduated. I didn't mind much, she often tried to pressure me into going out with her or drinking more than I wanted to, or doing drugs. (Nothing against alcohol or drugs) 

About two and a half years later, with no further contact than Facebook birthday wishes, she texts me out of the blue to let me know she's pregnant. I was surprised but congratulated her and we chatted a bit. 

It's hard to explain, but since then she's been acting like we've always been best friends and nothing has changed. 

She wanted me to throw her a baby shower, she's been asking for pretty expensive gifts, jokes about how her baby can call me ""auntie"", and already making plans for me to babysit. 

This whole thing feels weird to me. So I asked her what made her contact me again in the first place. She told me we're close friends so of course I should know. When I asked about us not speaking for 2.5 years she got defensive and said she's been busy. 

I told her that it feels like her friends after high school ditched her when she couldn't drink or do drugs anymore, and that I don't consider her a friend anymore.

Not only is he going to graduate from an Ivy League school but he's got an internship lined up with a prestigious firm. He's extremely confident, social and also good looking so it's not a surprise he's popular with ladies. 

He hasn't been the type for relationships but he got into one with a girl we can call Danielle about 6 months ago. He hasn't brought her to the house, they mostly stay at uni together and he doesn't want her to visit. It's clear he's not taking it seriously as she seems to be way more into him than he is her. Anyway, he came to visit recently and left his phone unlocked. 

My youngest saw that and instantly checked his phone and found lots of messages/nudes sent from other girls. He's clearly cheated which is confirmed by the multiple texts to other girls. He showed Anna and then me. I took a look, and didn't like what I saw. I decided to also tell my husband and he flat out said ''Don't bother me with this shit I have more important things to do'' (which to his credit, is true. He works close to 80 hours a week. Yes we are very well financially but it's largely due to him/his connections at a prestigious firm). 

Anna and Mike were disgusted and demanded that I punish Jack. They confronted Jack and he told them to ''Fuck off''. I had a word with Jack and told him this behavior isn't good, but that's about as far as I will involve myself. I'm incredibly proud of my son for doing what he's done and told him that although I don't condone his behavior, I still love him and if he needs anything that he can always ask me. So we hugged and then I dropped him off to see his friends.

Now my other two are angry at me and Anna said that I'm condoning misogyny. I said it's not like that. I took them aside and calmly explained to them that they need to focus on their lives, because quite frankly, I don't like their career choices. Anna wants to study some sort of Sociology degree and Mike wants to become a YouTuber. I told them that they I'll take them seriously once they start taking themselves seriously like Jack and now they called me every name under the sun. Well I told my husband and now he's super pissed at them and is going to have a stern word with them.

I wasn't expecting to hit the jackpot but I did. My husband is the best man I've ever known and we are the absolute best of friends. He took my son in as his own and loves him to death. I'm so so grateful for him every day and my son adores him. It's just an overall awesome situation I never thought would happen. 

Okay. So my husband has always gone back and forth about wanting to have a child of his own. I've gone back and forth about it too since I had my son and ultimately I really, sincerely do not want to have another one. I have a lot of varying reasons for this.

 My husband does want one of his own. Mostly for the ""novelty"" of having a child with someone you love, passing on genes etc. A child who is biologically his that he helped create. I totally understand why he would want that and I empathize completely with how he feels. Although other times he will say it sounds nice, but he could really live without it and it's not the upmost important thing to him, he sees more benefits to NOT having another one etc. I think he feels like that sincerely at times but deep down he still wants one of his own. 

Today it came up again after a long period of time of not discussing it at all. We were talking about some bad shit happening in the world and I said that it's another reason I feel I don't want another child. From there it spiraled. My husband said that I'm denying him the opportunity to have one of his own. He said that I don't want another one because I'm lazy and simply don't want to put in the effort to raise another child. It got nasty. By the end of it after we both kind of cooled down the tone was basically ""if it happens it happens, if it doesn't it's whatever"" but now I feel this massive weight of pressure and guilt that I'm not sure how to get past. 

I get where he's coming from. I truly do. And I know theres a big possibility that down the road he will end up resenting me if I don't decide to have another child. But I absolutely cannot force myself to want it. I can't make myself have a kid out of obligation. There is no part of me that wants another kid. Honestly, I didn't ever want to have kids in the first place but shit happens I guess. I love being a mom, I love my son to death. I know there is a possibility one day I'll change my mind, and I accept that, but I don't want my husband to bank on that happening. 

So WIBTA if I remained adamant in my convictions to never have another kid for my husband's sake?",74,73,0.87

666,Asshole,"So I’m in a relationship with a girl I met half a year ago and I love her a lot. 

The only problem is that it seems that in some situations she lacks a backbone. 

Recently she called me in tears about how a work colleague had been constantly playfully touching her up at work. He’s apparently one of those weird people who is touchy with a lot of girls. My girlfriend told me he had touched her a lot more than usual and had even breathed down her neck despite her telling him to stop. She told me that he always does it in such a jokey way that when she tells him to stop he never takes it seriously, although it makes her so uncomfortable it brought her to tears. 

There were incidents before this, apparently her ex also had a massive problem with her colleague. She’s told me that he also honks his horn at 14 year old girls and is a massive creep.

We discussed it and came to the conclusion that next time she saw him she should take him to one side and really tell him how uncomfortable he makes her. She has evidence of him drinking at work so could easily get him fired, thereby using that as ammunition she could get him to take her seriously. I obviously wanted her to get him fired right away but she wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt which is fair enough. 

She had work with the same guy again today but didn’t say anything because she doesn’t want to ‘make a fuss’ or ‘cause drama’.  I am quite pissed off and disappointed with her because she’s just throwing away her self respect and letting people get away with treating her like shit. She’d prefer not standing up to guys who touch her up rather than having an uncomfortable situation and I’m disappointed . Am I the asshole?",370,971,0.89
667,Asshole,"Several years ago my married little sister and her husband decided to allow two guy friends (who are brothers) to live them them. One was married with three children but was separated due to marital issues. His wife had/has full custody of their children.

A few months after they moved in, my sister started having an affair with the married man. Not to much long after that, my sister divorced her first husband and he moved into the basement of the house. After a while, the married man my sister was having an affair with divorced his wife and proposed to my sister two weeks after his divorce was final. Now they are married with his brother still living with them. My sister's ex husband moved out three or so months after my sister remarried.

My religious parents somehow approve of my sister's marriage to this man who carried on an affair with her. Now my mother continually shuns me for not wanting to be around my sister's second husband.  She likes this guy so much that she even made plans on the weekend of my birthday (this weekend) for her and my Dad to be with my sister's second husband's family, fully knowing that I dont want to be around them. My mother had even told me that ""the devil has my heart"" for not wanting to be around him.

668,Not the A-hole,"Ok first time poster here so let me know if I’m doin this right

My (ex)boyfriend bought me an iPad last Christmas.  He ordered it early but wouldn’t let me open until Christmas “so my family could see.” He put it on our joint Verizon account, but never told me how much it was or about monthly payments, etc.

We broke up in April and he kept saying “I want to make sure you get to keep the iPad.” Repeatedly. I mistook this as him trying to be nice because I’m an illustrator and the iPad is like my baby now I love it so much.

After the breakup he was stalking me through the location services on our joint Verizon account. And harassing me and my friends about where I was. He had done this previously in the relationship as well and I was generally freaked out at this point.

My family urged me to separate the account so he couldn’t track my phone anymore, so we went to Verizon to figure it all out. 

But when he kept saying “I want to make sure you get the iPad” what he really meant was “I want to make sure you have to pay for the iPad now.”

I didn’t understand that until we were already in the Verizon store. The lovely Verizon people notified me that my credit wasn’t even good enough to take on the iPad payment plan. (Student loans fml)

So now he insists I pay him the monthly payments until the payment plan is completed and he no longer owes. It still has several months left and I honestly want no contact, but because of this I have to communicate still to give him money.

It seems petty and I try to be a good person, but it really bothers me that I now make monthly payments on a PRESENT. Sure I love the iPad and I wanted one, but he bought it of his own free will so why do I have to pay for it? He also makes more money than me and after the breakup I let him keep the house and have been couch surfing until I move next month.

But then at the same time if I were him I probably wouldn’t want to pay for it either, so that’s why I ask you reddit, am I the asshole for not wanting to pay him monthly for a Christmas present he gave me?",88,218,0.95
669,No A-holes here,"Back in college one of my friends threw a house party. There was a guy in my friend group who was gay, and I think you could describe him as a ""twink"" . I say this because I'm taller and more muscular than him, so I wouldn't be scared for my own safety against this friend.

I'm not one of those homophobes who has the audacity to assume all gay people are attracted to me, but this gay friend was touchy with me all night and constantly trying to hold my hand so I think he was trying to hook up and it was making me uncomfortable as he knew I'm straight. At first I asked myself if I was just being homophobic, but I reasoned that I would think the exact same about a girl doing the same thing as him.

At the end of the night, we're all crashing at the house and having to share beds and the gay friend wants to share a bed with me. I ask another friend to swap and tell them that I'm uncomfortable because the gay friend has been hitting on me all night. The other friend says, ""[gay friend]? You? Quit being so fucking homophobic, [gay friend] is way out of your league anyway.""

I've always tried to be supportive of her choices and tried to be someone she can confide in because we do not have great relationship with our parents.

The last six months however has been stressing our relationship. She is involved with an older guy (33) and I'm not opposed to older men (I'm married to an older gentleman myself) but he's someone who isn't very mature and is leading my sister down some weird paths. 

I know they indulge in a lot of kinky things which I don't worry about too much. However, they're starting to be bolder with it in family settings and I think I want to call them out on it and stop them from doing it.

I noticed she had a temporary tattoo on her shoulder that had something to do with cuffs, she's wearing a little locker bracelet, and some sort of collar that I know is them doing something about their BDSM stuff in public. I also noticed she was not talking directly to him (eye contact) and staying back whenever we talked. I can imagine they enjoy this, but I want to keep this to the bedroom without others involved. I've got kids here for gosh's sake.

Am I being too controlling? It's my party, and I just want them to be normal and not have their bedroom spill over.

Thank you all for your responses. My boyfriend and I talked for quite a while and he apologized profusely. He sees things from my perspective now and understands why his decision was hurtful. He's reassured me that he wants to have me staying with him and that he was only avoiding having to break the promise he made with his sister.

After my daughter was born and I was confirmed bio dad, we split acrimoniously and there was a lot of unresolved anger from my part. My ex was vindictive and left my daughter on my doorstep (without telling me she was dropping off our baby) so many times. It got to a point one day where I called the police and sobbed and sobbed that I didn’t want to give my daughter back because her mom kept withholding her from me, and then leaving her in unsafe places without letting me know until after she’d done it. 

They helped a LOT and I was given custody of my daughter eventually. I can’t say a bad word against child services and the cops because they both helped me out hugely. Over time my ex wanted to see more of our daughter and she stabilized enough where she will take our daughter once or twice a week. She also ended up having 4 more kids who she has custody of. 

Lately my ex has been asking me to ALSO pick up her other kids whenever I pick up my daughter from school because they go to the same school because she’s ‘too tired’. She asks on days when she doesn’t have our daughter. Obviously due to the nature of our relationship I don’t want anything to do with her outside of necessary stuff for our daughter. I keep saying no, because a) they aren’t my responsibility b) I’m not a taxi service to be dropping her kids to her after school and c) I want to do NO favors for this woman. She chose to have all these kids, she can pick them up from school herself. 

I told my mom that my ex keeps asking me to pick up all the other kids too, and my mom thinks I’m being a giant ass because my ex lives close to the school and it would make her life easier. Frankly I don’t think it’s my problem.

Hi, first time poster so sorry if any mistakes. Me (42m) and my brother (36m) get on pretty well. We hang out and generally have a great relationship avoiding (for the most part) all the normal sibling bullshit that can sometimes occur.

Just for some background, he is starting a degree as a mature student and I work in a bank. Neither of us is rich but we pay our bills.

Now, today he texts me in work. I cant answer right away so about 20 minutes later he calls me asking for my address and some other details (nothing financial like card/account details though) for a 'student finance form' ASAP. He seems kind or hurried and urgent. I should say I would have zero problem giving him details like this but I did feel like I should at least ask WHY he wanted this info.

He basically said 'just because' and when I asked again he says that he 'just needs the details' in a kind of entitled impatient way that kind of annoys me.

Well, as I said, this all seems a little fucking off/strange to me so I ask again if he can explain briefly why I need to give him MY details for HIS finance form. At that point he says 'never mind' and hangs up on me!

I text him in a civil manner and say I really don't think what I asked was unreasonable in any way. He comes back to me with some shit about how he would have not even asked me any questions if the roles were reversed and that his girlfriend's brother gave him his details for whatever purpose was required on this finance form (I still don't know what he needed my details for..)

I should also say I really don't think this is anything shady. He's an honest guy basically. But, the basic lack of respect he showed by not deigning to even explain briefly the reasons for his request sort of irked me. Like I'm just some sap who should pony up his details on demand because little bro asked. I haven't had any communications with him since this happened this afternoon and that's expected as he can huff when he doesn't get his own way. I love him but recognise that this huffing behaviour is basically manipulative. He is going to stud psychology so is well versed in this shit.

Any questions please just ask. Thanks for reading.

My son is 23 and has cerebral palsy that is quite severe. It only affects him physically. He is very smart. I have recently setup his financials where he gets his disability sent to  him directly and got him his own place. 

His caregiver visits him daily at his new place. I did this because I wanted my son to be independent. 

He did very well for a few months but recently he has gotten into a relationship with a 58 year old man that I simply do not approve of.

It's not that I'm homophobic. But it's the fact that this man older then me has now moved in with my son. They've only known each other for three months.

And what's worse is that my son isn't gay. I had a heartfelt conversation where my son broke down and admitted he isn't gay but is scared of dying alone.

I have been heartbroken ever since and tried to setup some counseling sessions only to find out that his partner is double booking activities on those days and forcing my son to choose.

I'm not sure what this older man's deal is. He is contributing around 25% of the rent and seems to work.

Last Sunday I had them over for lunch and I couldn't control myself. I called him a predator and I thought he was disgusting. He then proceeded to take it on himself to physically push my son out the house without even asking.

682,Asshole,"I started a job for the summer a few weeks ago, and I commute each morning via bus. I always take the same bus at the same time and it's always been ""on-time"" at least within a 1-2 minute  window. Yesterday, I was waiting at the bus stop and checking an app that lets me know when the next bus will be here, and the time jumped from 2min away to 6min away (which is not unusual because the app is pretty unreliable). I thought that was a little suspicious but I wasn't too concerned because a 4 min delay would still let me get to work on time.

Anyways, the bus driver ends up being 9min late (which is hilarious, since the bus comes around every 10min so the next bus would be there in the next minute or so). I thought to myself that maybe there was a small issue that explained why the bus was held up for so long, but I didn't think much of it until the bus driver started driving: And I realized the driver was incredibly slow, going about a 1/3 of the speed that previous bus drivers have/cars around us were (below the speed limit). In addition, he wouldn't leave a stop until everyone who had boarded the bus was seated (which I understand is appropriate for some passengers, e.g. elderly, disabled, young kids). Midway through the ride, I realized if this driver kept his pace, I would be uncomfortably late for work, and so I went up to him and told him, ""Sir, do you mind driving a little more quickly? My work day starts at 8."" I said it with a smile and tried to say it in a calm/friendly way because I know it was selfish and I didn't want to sound high-brow/arrogant  (but I was pretty anxious so I'm not sure how it sounded). After I said that, the driver just shot me a glare and told me to get seated.

This normally is never an issue, because the bus always gets to the stop near my workplace at least 10 minutes before 8, but with this driver's pace, I would be uncharacteristically late. So what normally is a 12-15min bus ride ended up taking a whopping 25min which I've never experienced in my 3 weeks of commuting to work. In addition, the usual rotation of bus drivers always drive uncomfortably fast (but within the speed limit), to the point that I always have to grab a rail as soon as they take off or else I'll fall to the ground.

Yes, I understand that this is one experience in a whole lifetime/planet of human experiences, so me being worried about being late to work is inconsequential in the long-run; and yes, I'm aware that unfortunate things happen sometimes outside of our control. But because I don't want to develop a bad reputation in my office since I'm still starting out/in my probationary period, being on-time is important; and usually, I'm hit with a wall of work from my manager once I walk into the office, so being there on-time allows the rest of the office to function (in some way).

AITA for making this request?

tl;dr Bus driver drives unexpectedly slow, so I asked him to speed up.

EDIT: I've taken this same bus at the same time to work since my first day and it always gets me there 10-15min before my work day. This day was a random occurrence where I took the same bus at the same time and ended up being late.

Well, we've been having a lot of problems lately because of his excessive drinking and have been fighting a lot. My best friend wanted to take me to this nice store that's pretty much a grocery store for snacks to cheer me up. This was a couple nights after me and him had a big fight. When I told him I was going to go snack shopping he told me to take his card. I let him know I was planning on splurging because this place is fairly far away and theres alot of stuff I'd like to try and he said it was fine. 


Well when I got there, there was wayyy more stuff that I wanted to get than I thought. I knew if I was using my money I wouldn't be able to get much, but he had a good amount left after bills, so I figured I could get some extra stuff. So I called him for a couple of the things I wanted to make sure it was okay, since some of them were fairly pricey, and after like the 4th time I called he told me to not worry about it, I don't need to call him to ask, just get whatever I want and that it's his way of apologizing for being so mean to me lately. So I did exactly that and got everything I really wanted. For the record it wasn't actually a ton of stuff, it's just that most stuff there is pricey. When I got home and he asked how much I spent, I told him about $250 and he flipped out on me, saying that he didn't mean I could go that crazy and if I was planning on spending that much I should of told him. I didn't know it was going to be that much until I checked out though, it was only a few bags of stuff, its just everything is expensive there. I told him sorry but I did tell him I was splurging and called him about the more expensive items ($40 cake, $15 jar of jam, $25 cheese), and that he spends way more than that on his booze each week anyways, but now hes pissed at me. I talked to some of my friends about it and they said I shouldn't of spent so much just because it was his money and not mine, but he said to get what I want. AITA here?

685,Asshole,"So basically we are both in our mid 20s. I've been fortunate to have my goals set early on in life and knew the first thing I wanted to buy (other than necessities and other minor fun stuff) was a house. This means no car, no vacations, no big weekends, no rent (Yes, I lived at home probably much later than many of you, but I took advantage of my parents offering to let me live home to keep saving).


Anyways, I managed to buy a house and seeing as I'm still young, don't have an expanding family, etc, I don't need the entire house for myself. I rent the upstairs floor for approximately $1,500/mth (2 bed, 1 bath) and I keep the downstairs for myself. My total monthly mortgage payment is just under $2000. This means I have approximately $500 to make up to cover the mortgage. If I didn't live in the basement, I could probably get $1000-1100/mth for the 1bed/1bath.

First time poster, long time reader so please forgive any mistakes I make. 

We have lived in our house for 4 years (we own if that makes a difference). We have a rather large aide and front yard when you compare to the rest of the neighbors. We have a fairly good relationship with our neighbors, saying hi, general pleasantries etc. I didn't grow up in a city so have never really had neighbors this close to my house before. 

Within the last year our neighbors have been using our side yard as if it was their own. It started with them putting their garbage cans on the sidewalk in front of our side yard on pick up day instead of in front of their house ( not a huge deal just began to bug me when everything else started going down). I came home one day to find that they had painted the fence on my side (it's a super ugly color that clashes with my house). They let their dog out to do his business in my yard and acted as if they didn't realize he was doing it when I caught them. They have mowed a single strip of grass along the sidewalk at such a short cut that it killed the grass. More things have gone on but space restrictions and I don't feel it's really necessary.

This is what's going on rn and lead to this post, they decided to have a yard sale. I came home to find that they had stacked about 8 ladders in my yard without warning, just put them there as if it was their property. The wife came over and asked if we minded, putting me in a tough spot to look like TA if I said no so I told her that my dog would bark at anyone that came into the yard as it was his job. This morning I wake up to find that instead of 8 ladders being stacked against the fence these are now laid out all along the side of my house and a yard sale sign in my yard. Already there have been people standing in my yard, right next to my house. My dog is freaking out and people have been loud with my dog. 

Is this normal? Do neighbors use other people's lawns like this?  WIBTA if I went over and now asked them to remove the ladders as the people in my yard is making me slightly uncomfortable? Should I just let them have their sale and talk to them later?",155,439,0.92
687,Not the A-hole,"To explain my MIL, planned a family camping trip to Georgia in the summer without asking anyone’s opinion on the idea. It’d also be an 8hour drive from where we live to get to the campsite. In my opinion, it wasn’t very thoughtful of her to ask this of me and not get my opinion before making plans if she was expecting that I go with them. I’ve looked up the weather and it’s looking like highs in the upper 90s and lows in the 70s. I have a 6month old baby and the thought of driving that long in the car, being outside all day and  dealing with her at night sounds just miserable. Doesn’t sound like a vacation to me. If it were just me I’d have no problem dealing with the heat. I love traveling and adventures outdoors but my wee one complicates things. So I figured it’d be best if I stayed back while my 7 year old and husband join them on the camping trip. A good experience for them to bond as well. I didn’t think it’d be a big deal and it made the most logical sense to me. However, mil says baby will be fine because she did it with her kids when they were that young. Also, Husband says I’m being a baby and is trying to guilt me into going because I’ll be “missing out on precious memories”.  He also thinks I’m just not going to spite his mother.  Which is NOT the case.  We have our differences in opinions on a lot of subjects but I wouldn’t skip out on a family trip because of it. Part of me just wants to give in and go instead of dealing with the drama.  The other part of me thinks I should stick to my guns (my motherly Intuition) and not go.  Anyways, I’d just like to get the general consensus on the subject! Am I overreacting and it’s totally normal to go camping with an infant in the summer or should I not feel bad about staying home. Thanks!


Update: I just wanted to say thanks to everyone for their advice and feedback. I was feeling unsure of myself earlier today. However, I’m feeling much better about my decision to stay home with the baby while my husband goes with our older daughter now. Also, I took the advice from one of the commenters here and showed my husband this thread. It was just what he needed to see! :) He has since apologized and feels really bad about not initially being supportive of my decision that he now thinks is the right one.",277,709,0.95
688,Not the A-hole,"28F, living alone in a high rise apartment with my cat, Bella.

My Dad's sister, Aunt Jess her husband had no children, so they treated me as their own. We were close until my family moved overseas 20 years ago.

Earlier this year my Dad informed me that my Uncle-in-law passed away, and that Jess wanted to have a vacation to deal with grief. She'd be staying in my town for a month and wanted to stay with me, I agreed.

When Jess moved in, Bella rubbed on her legs. Jess swept her away, telling me that she dislike cats. First time somebody resist Bella's charms, but whatever, not like everybody like cats.

It was a busy period, I could not take days off work, so Jess passed time on her own, sightseeing and shopping etc, she also cleaned my place. During weekends I'd keep her company, we'd cook together and chat for hours. It would have been perfect had she not expressed how much she hate Bella.

Jess frequently complained how Bella creeped her out by rubbing, jumping and staring at her when I was out. She also complained how much I spent on Bella, and the money was better off elsewhere. I would always politely explain to her that I loved Bella and was willing to spend on her.

Once I came home and found the storage room open, it was usually closed to prevent Bella from entering as had sharp and toxic things inside. Fortunately nothing seemed touched. I asked Jess, she said she was cleaning and forgot to close the door. I suspected she did it on purpose, but brushed it off later, women her fifties and could get careless. 

Then came a day I reach home to find the windows open. UNMESHED, WINDOWS, 14 LEVELS FROM THE GROUND, WIDE OPEN. I closed them and looked for Bella, she was sleeping under my desk. I confronted Jess and asked her what the heck? Did she not know cats could jump? Did she not see the meshes I put on windows? Those unmeshed  should be CLOSED, AT ALL TIMES. Jess snorted, and told me that she opened the windows because it was too warm. Well, I installed air-cons for a purpose.

This was the last straw, not going to let my cat to be at risk any longer, who knows what she would do next time when I am out? I called up my Dad and asked him to have Jess leave before I kick her out myself. Dad soon ""invited"" Jess to live in his place. 

Dad told me later that Jess felt lonely, unwelcomed and unloved, and it was very mean of me to have treated her this way. I was sorry for not spending as much time with her as I should, but I could not have her endangering Bella's life, even after highlighting how precious she was to me.",344,2211,0.96

699,Not the A-hole,"Let me first state that I am 17f and have to share a room with my sister 15f. We have never got on very well especially in these past few years. I have moderate OCD and to be honest I do blame her for me having it (at least as bad as it is now). I have a job which is my only source of income and she gets £10 pocket money from my parents every week. 

Because of my OCD I struggle to know what is 'normal' to expect from her and what boundaries there should be in terms of keeping the room clean. I also struggle with people touching my stuff because if they do then it's not in the right place and it can send me over the edge especially with clothes. 

Now the main problem is my sister stealing my clothes. She began by taking my socks (that I have to buy because I'm over 16 and my parents refuse to buy anything for me except meals I eat at home now) and wearing them almost everyday even though she has her own that my parents buy for her. This has since progressed to tshirts, jumpers, jackets and shorts that she will wear then leave at the end of her bed or put them back where they came from. This disgusts me and I have stopped wearing some of my clothes because she has left them dirty for so long that I can't bear to wear them. 

But worst of all she's started wearing my bras. It's unimaginable to me to wear someone else's bra. She has plenty of her own that my mum has bought for her and has already stolen my old ones that I no longer fit into. It's insane and I feel like my privacy doesn't exist anymore, I can't even own underwear without her wearing it and it's breaking me.

The only clothes of her own she regularly wears are her jeans simply because she can't fit into mine. She has enough money to buy her own clothes and I know this because I would buy all my own clothes on even less pocket money a week before I turned 16. 

She also uses my skincare products and makeup so much that I've started having to buy them again twice as often because I lose half the bottle to her. 

I've told her not to wear my clothes almost everyday but she doesn't give a shit. I've gone to the extent of hiding my clothes and makeup but she always finds them. 

I'm losing it with this girl and all she is to me is a fucking pain now. She is the reason I want to move out and I'll say it to her face. She disgusts me and my parents keep criticising me saying to leave her alone because it's ""just how sisters are"" but surely she's gone too far. I feel like I'm being driven insane.

TLDR: my sister wears all of my clothes and even bras almost everyday even though she can afford to buy her own. She refuses to stop no matter what I try and my parents are useless at controlling her. I'm losing my mind because of it.",34,36,0.82
700,Not the A-hole,"My sister-in-law recently started dating a married man, she's not shy about the situation and neither is he. His wife doesn't know about it yet but by the way they're acting I don't think it'll take too long for her to find out. This has caused a lot of issues in the family as my father-in-law and mother-in-law both refuse to speak to her. Meanwhile, my husband and his older sister are certain that this is just a lapse of judgment on their younger sister's part and that soon enough she'll break up with her boyfriend. Because of that, my husband wants us to assure her that she can come to us if she has any problems because he doesn't want to push her away. Except I don't want to do that, I find it repulsive and absurd what she and her boyfriend are doing is terrible. The man has kids and a wife that have no idea of what's going on behind their backs and he's just proudly walking around with my sister-in-law like he doesn't care if they find out. While my sister-in-law goes around proudly stating that she's dating a married man and can't wait for him to get a divorce so they can get married. My husband keeps trying to convince me that she's probably going through something and while she has always been a very responsible person I don't want to stick around to watch this unfold regardless of the outcome. I truly despise what she and her boyfriend are doing because even if they don't stay together they still chose to be in this relationship at some point.

My sister (16) comes down into my room and watches either pewdiepie, someone similar to ricegum, and Korean soap operas. (Legit, subtitled soap operas) for as long as she can. My boyfriend (21) also visits during the summer and they hang out basically because she forces him to, which he doesn’t care because he has sisters and gets it. 

Last night she had been in my room for the first two hours I was home and I had asked her to leave for my last 2 hours before I went to sleep. I was doing an essay on her laptop (mine is busted) which has been sitting in my room this whole summer since she never wanted it back/used it. She looked at me, threw a fit, and wanted to take her laptop. I let her because I can type it on my phone. 
The worst part is my boyfriend “stuck up” for her and was like “why does she have to leave? She cleaned your room and you’re kicking her out?”

702,Not the A-hole,"I have always been the skinny kid in my family. Growing up I had a lot of ironic nicknames like ""fatass"" and such that were meant to be funny because they were so clearly off-base. 


Unfortunately as a young adult I developed anorexia nervosa. I'm in recovery now, but I'll be the first to admit that I'm still really sensitive to weight-related comments, even joking. To my family's credit, they've completely stopped with the insulting nicknames. Except for one, my mom still sometimes calls me ""cow"". 


Now to my mom this petname has nothing to do with weight. To her, it's about my eyes; I have really big, dark brown eyes like ""cow's eyes"". However, ""cow"" has pretty obvious weight connotations. I doubt most people would like being compared to a cow. I've spoken with my mom about how hurtful I find this name and she tries not to use it, but it's so natural now for her that she calls me it often without really noticing it. I point it out to her every time she uses it and she's always immediately guilty and apologetic. I feel like maybe I'm being oversensitive and I should just let it go when she calls me ""cow"". I know with all my logical side that the name is harmless, but the part of me that's still really vulnerable about my weight had a visceral hurt reaction to it.

704,Asshole,"I work from home.

&#x200B;

I hear from my office my wife telling my 5yo (who was crying ""I WANT AN APPLE AND A BANANA CUT UP IN PIECES!"") to go grab both the apple and the banana and peel/cut them himself.

&#x200B;

5 minutes later I hear my son crying and screaming.  


I go to the kitchen to find my wife holding my boy's hand wrapped in kitchen paper. I assummed the worst, but looked at my wife and asked what happened: ""he cut his hand because he used the sharpest knife in the kitchen"" (a pairing knife he found in the counter.  


I gave her the ""are you fucking kidding me?"" look and she immediately went full defensive: ""it's nothing"", ""it's not deep"", etc.  


""Let me take a look"", I said and grabbed my boy's hand, removed the kitchen paper and, indeed, it was a 1mm deep, 2 cm long, superficial cut in his thumb/index finger web, nothing too serious damage-wise.  


She wanted to use some spray antiseptic (the ones you put on their knees when they scratch them on pavement or something) but I insisted and took my boy to the batch, placed his hand over the sink and applied alcohol over the wound, let it sit there for 10 secs and washed with cold water to calm the sting.  


My boy was OBVIOUSLY crying from the alcohol sting, while my wife was telling me how we never, in 8 years, have used alcohol to clean any minor wound, and implying that I was just being an asshole for putting the boy through such pain just for the sake of usin alcohol.  


I told her that never before the boy had cut himself with a kitchen knife that was sitting on the counter, possibly near the sink, dirt with fruit, etc. THAT's why I rather had him suffer for 5 secs and avoid an infection for a silly wound. As the father, I have every right to be concerned about the boy's wellbeing and take action, within reason, to prevent future harm.  


My initial stink eye reaction to her was because she shouldn't have sent a 5yo boy to peel and chop food by himself.  


Am I the asshole for my reaction and/or for using alcohol instead of just a spray antiseptic for my son's cut?

EDIT: OK, I was an asshole for taking over my wife. I let my frustration over the situation drive my actions.

- I now know alcohol is not the best option

- ""the boy"" is an affectionate way of referring to one's sons where I'm from, English is not my mother tongue. Still, I don't see the creepy/chilling factor in it

- There's many assuming stuff here and reading between the lines. To those: I would have appreciated if you asked for more info before drawing conclusions

- The ones crying abuse, or than I'm sadistic, etc. I find your train of thought hyperbolic and mental

- The only reason I didn't jump off my office when I heard my wife telling our son to cut the fruit himself is because I do tech/customer support. I can't just drop a call, a chat, a remote session, etc. Which is what I'm doing 80℅ of the time.

706,Not the A-hole,"I'm 27 and I fly more than half a dozen times a year. I Just got to the airport and the bag drop line was maybe 100 or so people. The outside bag check opens up so I swoop in (or rather, out). 

As I walk up there's maybe 4 agents taking bags for people so it only took 5 minutes or. I'm next in line waiting for this guy to waive me up and he tells his buddy, ""damn they didn't even tip you?""

So instantly I'm thinking, is this normal? Do people usually tip the bag agents?

Anyway, I drop off my bag to the guy and he hands me my bag ticket and tells me my gate. Right as I start walking away I hear him say ""Oh wooow, really?""

But I'm thinking to myself, why would I tip the guy that has to walk 5 feet and put my bag on the conveyor? Is he assuming this is some ""expedited"" area where the workers are entitled to more since the line is shorter? 

Tipping these guys has literally never occurred to me since it seems fairly straight forward. I always tip Uber drivers because my life is literally in their hands. If they get me there safe then yeah you get rewarded for being friendly and doing a solid job. 

Also, just wanted to say it's 70°F and sunny so it's a pleasant day outside. 

Am I really in the wrong here or is this guy just trying to guilt trip people so he makes extra cash?

708,Not the A-hole,"(Throwaway for privacy)
Context: I’m 23F and she is 19F. We get along great and are very close. I just finished university and still live at home with her and our parents while she is finishing a traineeship. I have plans to move in September and she’ll be following me the next year. 

We share stuff all the time. Sometimes we ask, sometimes we don’t. We annoy each other a lot with this but at the end of the day we don’t really care that much unless we wanted to use that item of clothing that same day. Rarely happens but whatever. 

So I have this skirt, it’s a pleated, school girl kinda skirt. I wear it specifically and exclusively when I’m “dressing up” for my boyfriend, in a schoolgirl kind of outfit. She knows this. I’ve had sex in it multiple times. Now she wants to borrow it for a “back to school” event/party. 

Obviously it’s been washed and she clearly doesn’t care that I’ve had sex in it - I just find it a bit odd as it’s kind of, specifically, a “sex skirt”, and I relate it to that. My bf follows her on insta and I know she’d take photos in it and upload them. So he’d definitely see her wearing it and I just feel a bit funny about my bf seeing my sister in something exclusively related to sex (with me), bc the whole vibe of the skirt and me dressed up turns him on - that’s the whole point. I trust both of them and know there’s no sexual attraction there, I just can’t help feeling like if I was going to let her borrow it, it’d be under the rule of “no photos on Instagram with the skirt visible” which makes me feel really controlling. I haven’t said yes or no to her question yet, and I won’t see her all weekend as I’m going away with my bf. 

I also feel like it’d maybe ruin the purpose of the skirt/reduce the reaction he has to me in the skirt if he knows my sister has worn it, and I’ve let her. It’s something I bought for him as I knew he would like it. 

I know it’s just a piece of clothing but I feel odd about it. So, idk, AITA?

So I just wanted to thank everyone who took their time to reply, I wasn’t expecting to get many responses!
To answer a few things mentioned in the comments:

I spoke with my bf today and he did say he would find it weird to see her in it, and would prefer she didn’t. I told her no, and explained my reasons. 
A lot of people had suggested to take the skirt with me so she couldn’t wear it anyway - great advice but unfortunately by the time she had asked I was at work, and leaving straight afterwards so I didn’t have the skirt with me. 
She ignored the fact I said no, and is wearing it anyway. Although she hasn’t posted on any of her own social media, I only found out as I have one of her friends on Snapchat and she filmed her dancing in it. - I’ve messaged her angrily now so if anyone wants an update to that I’m sure it’ll be interesting.",188,990,0.94
709,Not the A-hole,"Me (19m) with my boyfriend (20m). We've been together for almost a year. He's amazing but he has the most annoying, shallow friends. They're all art school students who believe they're better than everyone else. Oftentimes they act like high school bullies and gossip behind one another's backs, which is immature and disgusting imo. Also hypocritical, given that most of them are also LGBT and have been bullied at some point.

For instance, they call every gay guy a f*g regardless of whether he's comfortable with that or not. They used to do that with me too until my boyfriend called them out, though I'm sure they're still doing it behind our backs. Why? Because they can't go a second without gossipping. The other day, I had to call out a dude in our WhatsApp group for revealing deeply personal information about a classmate of his (that he's a virgin), shared with him in confidence. Just to score easy points and start drama.

Given this, would I be the asshole if I broke off contact with my boyfriend's pals? He does hang out with my friends, so I don't know if that'd be hypocritical. Tbh he also admits they can be annoying, but he doesn't want to distance himself since they're his only close friends.",13,48,0.9

712,No A-holes here,"My apologies if this story isn’t very interesting, I’m having trouble sleeping and this is all I can think about for some reason. Also I’m on mobile yada yada. 

To start off this story I should first mention my biological father. He’s BARELY been in my life from the ages of 7 to 12, so about five years. However, in those five years I probably only saw him about 20 times, that’s all I really needed to know what kind of a person he is. Long story short, he isn’t a good person and I realized I didn’t need someone like that in my life. 

So then comes my mum’s husband, we’ll call him Bill. I have no real problems with Bill. But there is one thing that prevents him from being my step-dad. We have literally NO relationship. By that I mean we don’t hang out together, do any sort of bonding, hell we’ve only ever talked to each other a handful of times and he lives in the same house I do! It’s not that I don’t like him, it’s just that we literally have nothing in common except for my mum. 

So here’s where the question comes in, AITA when I get people telling me he’s my step-dad and I correct them when:
1.   We don’t have a father/daughter relationship
2.   My mum doesn’t particularly want us to have a father/daughter relationship
3.   These people haven’t even thought of if I even wanted a father figure in my life 

I like Bill and that’s what I call him. Bill. Because that’s who he is. He’s not my step-dad. He’s my Bill. AITA? Am I being offended too easily? Should I bother with the correction as it might seem rude or go with making myself more comfortable?

EDIT: Thank you all for commenting these past several hours. I’ve come to the conclusion that for the most part I’m not being an asshole, but shouldn’t get offended by people referring to him as my step-dad as long as they aren’t trying to impose a sort of relationship onto us by using that title. In the future I’ll probably let things go more easily. Thank you for helping me on my journey to be less asshole-y!",39,52,0.96
713,Not the A-hole,"This is a throw back AITA, because I’m pretty sure I am now. 

About 3 years ago when my family and I moved to a new town we took a couple friend of ours out to dinner. I personally had the worst service of my life. 

There were 7 of us in the party. 4 adults and 3 kids. I was the DD so I was not drinking alcohol. It was August and hot outside. We sat on the patio and had drinks and food at a well known kinda chain in our area - this place is in the PNW and has maybe 10 locations. 

We are having a good time. I ask the waitress for a refill on my soda and water as I had drank both of my glasses while others had drank their beers and what not - my kids had small kid drinks. The waitress continues to refill the beers and kid drinks but never my water or soda. The drinkers had 3-4 beers each, the kids had 2 refills each. I got nothing. I asked at the same times as everyone else. I’m not a monster. It got to a point where I was drinking the 3 beer drinker’s waters because I had nothing. We got our food. Still no refills for me. We were there for and hour + and the waitress never refilled my glass. I was pissed and thirsty. I paid for dinner and left a measly 5% tip. In the bill was a comment card which I was rude on. The next day I called corporate and complained as well -  as I should have at least gotten as many refills as the kids. 

I hadn’t been back to this restaurant since that occasion since I never heard anything back on my complaint and I won’t spend my money where it’s not appreciated. But yesterday I had to go for a work meeting. Table of 10 - the waiter was very good about keeping our glasses full. Meeting guest commented about the great drink service - waiter says they had a horrible customer a few years ago who made a big huge stink about drink service and now corporate will send “spies” to make sure the staff refills drinks in the most timely manor with out having to be asked. Obviously I hear this and think I’m probably the horrible customer he’s talking about.

Even so, she ""doesn't know how"" to even get her voice mail, never mind use text or email.

She is constantly phoning everyone to chit-chat with them about mundane things.  Myself in particular.  All the time.

Yesterday she got upset because she called my cell and the home phone land line and I didn't answer either one.  I was doing what I told her I would be doing, painting the fence.  It's not like you can drop everything to answer the phone when you have a paint can in one hand and a paint brush in the other.  But I did it anyway, and called her right back.  ""Why didn't you answer??!""  I explained the dilemma and she just didn't get it.

Today, I broke.  She called me (interrupting me from what I was doing, once again) to ask me to forward a photo she liked to one of her friends.  I dropped everything to dig up the photo and forward it to her friend.  Almost before I got done, she showed up at home.  Didn't even stick around with her friend to enjoy the photo.  I gave her the third degree about how rude it is, what an imposition it is, etc., to interrupt someone with a voice phone call about such a trivial matter, and then not even stick around to follow up on it.  

This is 2019, not 1990.  IMHO, unexpected voice calls are a rude imposition on others.

The issue:

So sometimes my 7 year old just wont listen! She's a really smart, thoughtful kid, but it seems she really likes testing her boundaries lately. I can ask her to be more respectful of my parents (who help tremendously!!) or not to mess with some of my belongings, or things at her grandparents house, and she just completely disobeys me!! It's super frustrating but I try my hardest not to lose my temper and yell. I try and figure out what she was thinking but, its usually something like ""I thought it'd be fun"". Its been a drink spilled on a computer she's not supposed to touch, my daughter losing a bunch of cards from my wallet and painting over the few that I found around the house, taking tons of feathers out of our pillows and just generally leaving a mess. I can go on...

The typical consequences are her cleaning up any mess shes made herself and stuff like no tv, no dessert or an early bedtime. Our typical routine is a bedtime book at about 15 minutes of cuddling.

If my daughter is in trouble, she doesn't get a bedtime book and I'll lay down and with her while I'm tucking her in, give a hug and kiss and leave the room. Que the endless crying a wailing! She goes on and on about how she feels so thirsty, hungry, scared or lonely. She cries ""I want my mommy!"" Over and over and it makes me feel terrible!!

I generally feel torn as a parent. If I give in, which I have before, the same behavior continues even after the standard 15 minutes of cuddling, so I wonder if I should just leave her to fall alseep on her own, with just a kiss and hug and explanation to her that if she wants her regular routine, she has to listen to her elder family amd respect other peoples property, even though it takes forever and she cries herself to sleep.

On the other hand, it's sooo damn hard to hear her so upset!!!

716,Asshole,"A little context, I work in a bar that has live bands 7/365. It's a very beautiful place so lots of people take pictures, snaps, 'gramming every facet of their night out. Because of this people always run out of battery and ask if my venue has a charger. We're a small family owned bar so we don't have excess novelties such as charging stations and the like. If someone comes up and asks to charge their phone if we can accommodate it we always do. Since these people in need will be parted from their phones I always ask that they turn it off. 

For me, it's utilising an opportunity to charge their phone for a bit so they can continue on their merry way. It also gives someone else a chance who are in the same predicament to get zappy with our electric sockets. Lately I've been getting incredulous looks at my request. I even say no to people putting it on aeroplane mode. I thought that was being a bit anal though. I just feel like it's totally unnecessary to have your phone running all these apps you wouldn't be using whilst it was charging.

717,Not the A-hole,"So this happened at about 830ish while I was at work on my break. I checked my phone and see a message from my roommate asking if I can give her roommate a ride home and that she already told him I would since I'm giving her a ride (wtf???).

Background time: my roommate doesn't drive and sometimes I give her a ride home when she has a late shift and buses aren't running.

Back to the story: I have never once met this coworker and this is the first time I've heard of his existence. I told her that I didn't really appreciate that she offered without asking me first. Then I asked where he lives. Opposite side of town from us; technically a different town altogether. All in all it'd be another 30 minutes of driving. Fuck that. I could ask for gas money but that's not really the issue. Don't know him, not comfortable with that, also lives very far away.

I was just about done working a double shift and I was not liking the idea of having to chauffeur for someone who aparantly can't plan ahead. And yes, I checked this fact. This coworker did nothing to plan for the fact that they did not have a ride/bus; they get the schedule a week at a time.

My roommate begins guilt tripping me. Saying if I don't give him a ride he has to walk for an hour in the rain. Honestly, that gets a whopping boo-fucking-hoo from me. And it wasn't even raining. It just might have rained.

So she's pissed at me. I ask if he's asked other co-workers. Aparantly not. I'm the first person he goes to?? Someone he doesn't know know , let alone even work with? What. What. That's not how... No. Just. No. So she gets him to ask around and evidently a coworker there lives near him and can give him a ride. But nevertheless...I wouldn't have given him a ride. Totally not comfortable with that.

---

So I (28 M) live let my sister (26 F) live with me in my small apartment.  She is unemployed and has never really held a serious job and has never graduated high school.  I take care of her since our parents wouldn't let her live with them anymore.  So she came to me one day and has been living with me for the past 5 years now.  I pay for everything including the internet, electricity, food and building maintenance.

All her time is spent either on her computer (which I'm using a throwaway because I don't know if she goes here) or on her PS4.  Usually her day consists of waking up late after I leave for work and then messing around until I get home and have to prepare dinner for her.  Sometimes in the middle of the day she orders pizzas using money she took from my wallet while I wasn't around.  Occasionally she's used a credit card that I keep around for emergencies to buy micro transactions for some dumb mobile game she's playing or to buy some anime nonsense.  Which her room is full of toys and other junk like that.  After that I had to close that account.

The only way I can get her to leave the apartment so I can have some down time is when I give her money to leave me alone, so she'll stop calling me at work whenever something is wrong back home.  Sometimes when I'm coming home from work I stop by a McDonalds so I can browse Reddit on my phone and I don't have to come home to her.

One time I tried offering an ultimatum to her.  Either find a job and pay rent or move out.  She considered the proposition for a bit, but gave up shortly after and resumed doing what she does now.  So I'm pretty much back into a corner because I know if I kick her out she's just going to come crying back to our elderly parents to deal with or try to shame me in front of our family for ""being a heartless brother"".

Edit: Great responses guys, but I'm getting kinda tired and have to sleep to get up in the morning.

---

**Edit 2**: I notice some reoccurring questions/things around here so I figure I might as well address them all in one go.  Or things I might not have been clear about since I typed this late when I was tired and angry.  Or there could be things I could offer more context on.

> Why would you put up with this for so long
 
Originally the situation wasn't that bad, admittedly it was actually kinda fun in a way back then.  I can't say that we never shared any good moments living together.  At the end of the day I can't say that I really hate her.  I love my sister and maybe that's why I've been so lenient.  I wrote this mostly from a place of frustration to vent admittedly.  

Initially living with her was kinda alright.  She mostly kept to herself and that's why I put more of a blind eye on her than I should have.  The first few years started off pretty good.  Back in 2014, I didn't put very much thought into it being a optimistic 23 year old.  When you're in your early 20s you view the world with more rose tinted glasses than you would care to admit.  We've always lived together as siblings so it was kinda second nature that I assumed our living arrangement would be similar to how it was when we were children.

Now that I look back on writing this.  It's more like a compilation of things that annoy me over the past 5 years rather than things that occur very regularly.  I don't vehemently hate living with her as much as I make it sound.  I'm just kinda worried in the long term what our actual plan is going to be, now that we're getting older and doing this is not as viable as when we were in our early 20s.  

Everyone has their breaking point and I suppose this one was mine.  This type of relationship can be quite trying at times.

> What about the money?

That seems to be the thing I see a lot of people see as the main source of contention.  The mobile game thing and pizza was really more of a one off thing that happened once and was kinda done from there.  Really the money is not as big of deal as I made it out to be now that I re read what I wrote.  I really don't care about the dollar amount itself because it's relatively small, more so was mostly a setting boundaries kinda thing.  

The reason she knew about the credit card was because I told her about it.  I said it was used to pay for things that are urgent or to top up online accounts that have depleted.  In reality the cost of all those micro transactions were negligible, as it didn't really put that much of a dent in my finances.  When it happened I said ""fine, but this is all you're going to get in the form of entertainment for the next year"".

> Do you really sit around McDonalds on your phone?

Yes, but I mean TBH really it's an occasional thing when I'm having a really bad day.  I don't do it every night, sometimes I go to a local sports bar.  It's pretty cathartic.  But I don't think I'm the first guy to ever do that.

> Are you actually going to evict her?

The way AITA makes you write titles makes it seem more urgent than it really is.  The reason I wrote ""would I be"" is because it's just an idea I've been considering in my mind as a long term possibility for the greater good of both of us.  At the end of the day I want what's best for my sister and I considered this as a tough love sorta resolution.  I'm not really settling on this as a concrete solution, yet.

> The ultimatum

This wasn't a one off thing more like we've tried to come up with a realistic plan over time to get her employed at something.  At first it we were thinking about how to re enroll her in some sort of school.  Then I realized maybe we're going about this the wrong way.  Some people have difficultly learning in certain environments, maybe it's not for everyone.  Now I'm emphasizing to her get some sort of high school equivalency.  We're, or at least I'm, considering different avenues to take.

> Is she really going to try to go back to my parents or out me in front of the family?

I realize I said ""I know"", but actually that was more of an offhand comment I made about what could possibly happen.  I'm not certain what would actually happen, but I figured I couldn't rule that out as a possibility.",74,195,0.95
720,Not the A-hole,"My cousin and his girlfriend are having a baby out of wedlock. This is a HUGE deal in my family. As a result, nobody in the family is willing to host a baby shower for her. Nobody in her family is willing to either. Everyone here is over 18.

As the ""secular"" one in my family, it's somehow fallen on me to throw her one as I'm the only female relative that doesn't have particular morals against it. They'll all go to a baby shower for an unmarried woman, but throwing one is ""showing support"".

I don't want to do it for several reasons: 

1. I'm busy. I really don't want to deal with the logistics of throwing a party. I'd have to go out of state (where the family all lives), rent a park or something, and deal with all of the food and decorations. I'm straight up way too tired.

723,Not the A-hole,"*Tl;dr: My professor in nursing school was embarrassed about goofing up and sitting in the wrong room for nearly an hour and took it out on us students. I wrote an anonymous email to the department chair and many other people reporting her behavior. My family and close friends that I told say that I shouldn’t have made a big deal out of her behavior.*

So, I’m a nursing student and on Monday, my class was told to go to a room for our lab hours through our online class site. We all were sitting in this room for 45 minutes with no instructor to be found. Eventually, the head of the program walked by and asked who our professor was, found the professor in the next room over, who was sitting in a room by herself wondering where her class of 35+ students were. She was clearly embarrassed and seemed to take this out on the class for the rest of the day. 

For example, she slammed a students personal laptop shut. She told people to “shut up or get out.” She yanked a stethoscope-that by school policy is required to be around our necks-off of a students neck, shoved it in his pocket, and told him he was going to get someone sick wearing this around his neck. Again, I’d like to reiterate, we were in a classroom setting, not a hospital setting. There were a few other examples of very unprofessional behavior that are detailed in the email that I’m linking to below and you can read through that if you’re interested. 


Now, to where I’m being called an asshole. I was not personally affected by any of her behavior, but I observed these things and it bothered me. So, I made an anonymous email account and sent an email to the department chair, VP of student affairs, the college dean, and the course coordinators and instructors. These people have launched an investigation into her behavior and there is now whispers from a loose lipped faculty member that the professor in question may be fired over this. 


I told my family about this, my boyfriend, and a couple close friends. They all think I’m an asshole because it didn’t affect me, so I had no business reporting her for what happened. They say that if anyone had a right to report her, they should have gone up the proper chain of command and it should have been someone she targeted.

Some background info - My sister (14F) takes showers/changes her clothes probably once a month. She doesn't brush her teeth, comb her hair, use deodorant, or clean her room. My parents have done nothing to change this. Currently we're on a roadtrip. (Me (16F), my sister, my mom, and my dad.)

I tried to convince her to just take a shower but she was adamant about sleeping in the chair so I pulled some sheets and pillows off of the bed and gave them to her. Problem solved.

729,Asshole,"My mother died a month ago. She was 78 and long divorced from my father. She had married again; we will call her second husband Giles.

My mother left a will in which all her property and assets go to Giles. So far so good, I don't feel slighted by this, and there are no large sums of money or items of any sentimental value at stake as far as I know.

**Plot twist**: It is *not a legal will*, because of her decision to leave it all to Giles. In the country where she lived (not the country where I live) it is not legal for a parent to leave a will which doesn't include their children. 

So, Giles is not getting my mother's assets unless I sign some kind of form to say that I renounce my legal claim to my share (I don't know how much of a share is required by law).

So, why would I not just do this?

1. I despise Giles and always have. He is a toxic narcissist.
2. My mother knew I felt this way.
3. Specifically, I blame his distrust of conventional medicine for my mother's ill-health in her old age; Giles specifically discouraged her from taking medicine prescribed to her in favour of natural/homeopathic remedies
4. I'm not 100% sure why my mother, a calm, intelligent and conflict-avoiding sort of person would have done something which was literally *guaranteed* to cause conflict and legal difficulty after her death. Any competent lawyer in that country would have strongly advised against it. Some thoughts:

    4.a Was she pressured into doing it or convinced to sign a will without reading it? 

    4.b It seems like the kind of thing Giles would have convinced her to do out of sheer narcissism, when it could have been avoided if she'd just left me a token amount to satisfy the legal requirement

    4.c Was she trying to force us to *reconcile* by making this troublesome will which requires us to contact each other after her death and for me to make a formal act of generosity toward Giles?

    4.d Maybe there *is* a lot of money at stake? That would come as a surprise, because they lived like poor people and as far as I know their assets were all used up or sold off long ago. But you hear stories about people who lived like paupers and then left millions in their will. The lawyer's letter doesn't say anything about the actual estate.

But until two nights ago, I had defended my Baptist upbringing in Oklahoma. 

My daughter went to my grandma's church for Vacation Bible School. They handed out these surveys to the kids to see if they're ready to be ""saved"". To me, that's an incredibly personal thing that a 9yo isn't ready to deal with. I was ""saved"" as a kid. It didn't take. I've fought with this internally for years. 

My grandma was sick that night, so I picked my daughter up from VBS. The preacher came to me and was pressuring me to have my daughter saved. Liked he'd get a commission on her salvation. 

It was honestly the most uncomfortable I've ever felt in a church. Last night was Parents Night and he asked me if I had talked to Peri. I lied and said I did.

I also explained that my nana was a conservative woman and would of liked everyone to dress quite formal. 
I wore a suit and tie. 

yesterday was the funeral and when I saw my girlfriend I was not fond of the outfit, she decided that a low cut booty hugging mini dress that was so short when she bent over you could see her thong was a good outfit choice, she also paired it with strappy glittery heals. everyone in the church looked super annoyed with her outfit. I pulled her aside and asked her why she decided to wear that and her response was, It was the only black thing i own. 

I was super annoyed and just decided to leave it and support my family.

Everything was fine until the last night of the trip when we were all drunk around the campfire. 

At one point the night ended and we all went inside to bed. I was sleeping in a room by myself and I crawled into bed and passed out pretty quickly. 

I woke up around 4am to pee and I found Ryan sleeping in the bed with me. I woke him up and asked him what he was doing. He told me he felt lonely and wanted to cuddle. 

I told him I wasn’t comfortable with that and asked him to leave the bed. He refused and started crying and saying that he’s in love with me and he’s sorry for being weird about it but that he wants to be with me. 

I told him that I didn’t think of him that way and it made me uncomfortable to hear that from him and I started to walk out of the bedroom so I could sleep on the couch. 

He begged me to stay but I just left and went to the couch. The next morning we had to leave and we didn’t say two words to each other and we all piled into the car. We all got dropped off and me and Ryan didn’t even say bye. 

He texted me a few days later begging me to talk to him but I haven’t answered him and I’ve been avoiding him since it happened.

735,Not the A-hole,"I live in a house with 5 others (strangers at first), and yes it's crammed. The house is contracted and there's a fee to opt out of paying for your part of the lease if you want to leave earlier than the lease ends. One of my roommates was visiting home for 2 months this summer, and we all kinda mentioned that he'd still have to pay rent, because of the contract, but he wasn't willing. He wasn't going to be working for the 2 months and he absolutely refused to pay. The other 4 of us didn't like that, because it meant our rent got more expensive, so we collectively decided that if he didn't pay those 2 months rent, we'd put all his stuff in the garage and turn his room into our own gaming room. We were paying for the room after all. We told him this, about 2 weeks before he left, but I think he thought it was joke. He got home yesterday and is furious, hasn't touched his stuff and slept on the couch last night. He's saying he's going to get the landlord involved if we don't move his stuff back into his room, but we're trying not to budge, we've all said that while he was away and not paying to live here our rent went up, but he doesn't think that warrants us to move all of his stuff.

&#x200B;

Just to be clear we didn't go through really any of his stuff, he kept his room relatively clean and didn't have a lot of cluttery small stuff, mainly just moving a desk, a dresser and his bed, we even kept his rug in there because we thought it looked cool. ALSO, we moved all of our stuff back out of the room the night before he came back and it's all completely clean as if brand new.

I turned to him and told him just to shake it off, it happens, don’t worry about it and he smiled. 

My mom kept the conversation going about the hickies, but was also throwing in MY sex life into the mix as well.

The last thing she said before I went off was “you should always make sure it smells good before you go in, you can wake up with itchy balls and a sore throat.”

People are hearing this shit, looking at my mom with disgust. My mom has never acted like this before. So I motioned her to come close so I can whisper in her ear. I said to her “mom, please, stop.

I picked him up by his feet and he was laughing hysterically yelling ""put me down big butt face"" to which I replied ""I'm gonna rub my gross butt on you."" I put Booger down and he runs and I chase him and butt bump him in his back and tell him he had ""gross butt germs"" now and run away while he chases me and tries to butt bump me. He's wheezing from laughing so hard the whole time. This is pretty typical stuff for us so I didn't think anything of it.

One of our uncles (we don't see often)  is sitting outside watching us and makes a weird comment about ""You better stop letting him touch your butt or he's gonna become a man sooner than he ought to"" (something along those lines) which prompted my aunt to scold me about it and make me feel like (an asshole). So I told Booger we had to calm down and stop playtime.

They've all left on a good note now, but I can't let it go. I feel like they turned what is an innocent play time into something weird and dirty. AITA for playing a game involving butts with my nephew?",30,29,0.95
739,Not the A-hole,"My bf and I had planned a small trip, and initially I had planned to leave our cat (Ki) with my parents for the duration. Our friend, Steven, offered to look after Ki as he also has 2 cats of his own. I thought Steven saved us a lot of money, and my cat had been to his place before, so I was just genuinely glad that we had such a wonderful friend. My bf and I had also bought souvenirs, sent various postcards throughout our trip, and planned to take Steven out to dinner to repay him for his time with our pet.

When we came to pick up Ki, I had noticed that my cat was acting very strange—he was super sluggish, visibly skinnier, and growled when I tried to pick him up. He was very low on energy and something was very off. But we were glad to have him back.

However, within the first 5 minutes of driving, I was mortified when I inspected Ki. Every single time I pulled apart his fur, I saw fleas. He was SO INFESTED. I had 2 flea bites from just the 5 mins drive. The weird part was that behind his neck, there was a wet spot and it smelled chemically. If you have a cat, you would know that this is where one would apply flea medications or other topical medications.

We then hurried to the nearest veterinarian. Our primary vet was not opened on Sunday so we had to see a new vet that required a completely new examination. We had to shave his fur, give him a bath, flea meds, shots, probiotics, new food as his old bag was contaminated, etc. and the whole thing totaled up to \~$300. We also took an entire day to sterilized or destroyed basically everything that came into contact with our cat.

If it was just the two of us, we wouldn’t have been this upset. But my bf’s dad is staying with us for a couple of months and he is arriving the next day, and if our CARPETED home is infested, we would’ve been fucked. Steven denied everything and said he had no idea how this could have happened. He was sure our cat would’ve never gotten fleas from his home or his cats. I sent Steven a message over FB asking whether he had noticed any weird behaviors from our cat because he is much thinner. He didn’t look at my message. When confronted in person, Steven also denied anything was ever wrong.

Whether my bf chooses to continue their friendship, that’s up to him to decide. But for me, I'd like to tell Steven that I am done. My bf thinks that I can tell Steven about how disappointed I am, but to say that my friendship with him is over is over-exaggerated. After all, Steven did save us from having to spend a lot of money, but at the same time he really did such a shitty job that if I had known this was going to happen, I would have turned down his offer and just go straight to my parents.

740,,"Technically, it would be ‘are we the asshole’ but it’s fine.

So I have a group of friends that are incredibly close and bonded. We play cards, play chess, and play video games together. On the last day of school, we decided our class should go to a convenience store that sells slushies and sit by the pond nearby, and talk about things we liked. It was pretty much confirmed.
Basically what happened was this girl in our class, who I will call Y. A few months ago she invited herself to our friend group and began handing out with us and intruding in our conversations. We decided to tolerate it because she was new, but we did notice that she was being rude to other people. She takes our inside jokes and teasing and does the same thing, but ten times more dramatic. 

Example: there is this 5th grade who has a crush on this girl in our class (we will call her G), like following her around and hanging out by her locker. Y told him that G will never love him, he’s a creep, and he should fuck off. She swore at a special needs 5th grader without taking in account that this kid is years younger than us. This type of situation happens multiple times with Y.

I’ll just get straight to the point. The organizer of the trip, my friend’s sister, said that if Y comes, no one was coming. So my friend told the class through text the trip was canceled. Most we pretty okay with it, some argued, but it worked out in the end. Later, my friend told our private group chat that we were still going and that to not tell Y, because she’ll ruin it (and the organizer said no). I kind of felt bad, but agreed. My friends also agreed and complained about how she invited herself to our friend group, she was too rude, etc. I didn’t say anything except ‘I feel kinda bad’ and forgot about it.

We forgot about it for awhile, but today Y asked one of the kids in the group chat to add her to the group chat, and told her ‘I’m part of your friend group too’. The kid (I don’t blame them actually) forgot about how we discussed about Y in the group chat and added her. Y read our comments on her personality and left immediately after. She knew we were still going, she knew we disliked her, and she was too sad to even come to the store trip. For some reason however, I didn’t feel guilty at all. I felt like she kind of deserved it. My friends mostly also feels the same way, barely any guilt.

So, AITA? Are we psychopaths?

EDIT: Me and the gang each decided to write a letter towards Y expressing how we feel. She’s apologized and we’ve apologized. Thank you for the advice.",14,27,0.91

So my girlfriend and i recently had a baby boy. We were both contemplating names, and had a few good ones in mind. In the end, we decided to name him ""Sirius"", named after the brightest star in the night sky.

Now, we were talking to one of our friends, and when we told her our sons name, she flipped and told us we are condemning our son to a life of bullying.

Now, i personally dont see anything wrong with the name, and I actually knew a Sirius growing up, and he never had any issues with his name.

743,No A-holes here,"My colleague was a genuinely nice person. Worked hard, performed well and was good to me generally. He had been at the firm for more than two decades and I and everyone else liked him. He had a wife with expensive tastes, two kids in private school and a fairly hefty mortgage. I was surprised and disappointed when my boss told me that I would be taking over his section next month and to start subtly rescheduling my work accordingly. 

This was strictly hush-hush and if word got out my boss would know it was me that leaked it and I'd have got canned. I understood that this sucked for my colleague but them's the breaks and I was fine with keeping it to myself. Until...

It was his fiftieth birthday a fortnight before he was going to be let go. He tells me he has set aside a six figure sum to make it the most extravagant and lavish experience of his life. Private jets, VIP events all weekend, luxury cars, open bars, etc. My immediate reaction was to tell him not to do it, that he'd regret it, that this was decadent and wasteful, etc. He said he knew all that but he'd been having a really tough time of it of late and that he had never done anything remotely like this for himself his entire life and that he had earned the right to finally do something for himself after always putting his wife and kids first.

I told him that I would never do this, that he'd regret it, that it wasn't worth it, and so on but I did not tell him that he was about to be fired. It wouldn't have stopped him getting fired but it would have meant I would have been and possibly ended my entire career in this industry too. But it might have meant he didn't blow his entire life savings immediately prior to becoming unemployed.

This has all happened now and he was let go but this keeps me awake at night. Should I have told him what was about to happen and AITA for not letting him know?",280,1507,0.96
744,Not the A-hole,"I (21 M) was at a club with my buddies and their girlfriends. Some of the guys and girls with us were single. We're having a fun time when a bunch of random guys invite some of the girls to dance. Most of them said no, including the girls with boyfriends, but a few of the single girls left to the dance floor. Notable exception being my best friend's girlfriend, who just leaves him and goes dancing with the random dudes.

Later, the guys and girls come back and say they're heading out to a party and ask if anyone wants to join them. Most of the remaining single girls get up to go, and my best friend (the 'Bro') looks at his girlfriend but neither say anything. I feel so bad for the guy so I say, ""Alright! Let's go!""

The random dudes didn't look that happy that I invited myself along, but one of the single girls says, ""Nooooo! Girls only!""

I look at the other girls (the ones with boyfriends) and say, ""Anyone else feel like going?"" They just politely decline. So the single girls go, including Bro's GF, and he's just sitting there not saying anything. I feel bad for him so I buy him drinks and tell him he's not staying sober tonight.

Later that night, he's looking quiet and moody. I ask him what's wrong and he says he can't believe his GF just left with random strangers. Apparently he's been texting her and she responded with saying he's being too insecure and jealous, and that he's being controlling and manipulative. He gets mad in the texts and she just ignores him.

I point my Bro to the other couples and say, ""Do you want what they have, or what you have?"" He wants what they have, so I say, ""Then find a girl like them, and dump the one you have! SIMPLE!""

\-----

Next week, we're together again on campus, and Bro's GF (ex-GF now but we didn't know yet - Bro didn't tell us and he wasn't present here) shows up and starts trashing me, saying I should mind my own business and that I was responsible for their break-up. She's crying and saying I ruined their perfect relationship and that's why girls don't like me (I'm single). The other single girls, upon hearing this, join in and starting insulting me. The couples don't say anything but they are looking awkward as hell. I say ""Good guys are looking for good girls. Good girls don't ditch their boyfriend to go party with complete strangers in the middle of the night. WHY ARE YOU SURPRISED BY THIS?"" This just makes them more hysterical and we're causing a huge scene so I just silently apologize to the couples there, and I leave.

As far as I know, no cheating ever occurred, and other than this incident, I've never witnessed nor heard of Bro's ex-GF being cruel or mistreating him in any way. This was the only thing prompted me to convince my Bro to dump his GF.

746,Not the A-hole,"Sorry in advance to those of you who are sensitive to this, but involves miscarriages, so stop reading I guess if it bothers you or you'll feel too sad. Up front, I want to say I understand that this is a very sad event for many other people and in no way do I think my response is the ""right"" one or anything.

Well I had a miscarriage. In all honesty, we hadn't actually decided if we were going to keep it. I found out and we knew we had to make a decision ASAP, but things kept happening and we couldn't really sit down and talk it through (this was over the span of three days).

Nature decided for us, and my reaction after going to the hospital was ""Phew."" I didn't tell anyone  because I knew I'd be seen as some heartless bitch because everyone's supposed to walk around in a threadbare robe staring out of the window when this happens. 

I took two days off work to deal with it, and when I came back, people asked if everything was okay, etc etc. There are a handful of women I am very close with at work (worked there for 9 years) and so \*after work\* one day we went out for drinks and someone asked me what'd happened, because I don't really take time off. I explained what happened, and they were all very good friends and quick to be very emotional about it for me. 

I told them ""Hey, it's okay,"" and ""No, it's really not that big of a deal,"" and ""Listen, it'll be fine."" But they kept making it into this big deal. I know, I know, that's the normal thing to do. But eventually I said ""Guys, I don't think we would have actually kept it anyway, it's okay, really."" It wasn't in a very flippant way, I was sincere. 

This was the wrong thing to say, because two of them got really upset at me, telling me how could I say that, what if someone around us suffered miscarriages and heard me talk that way, how I should never say that again. One of the other girls changed the subject, but one of the angry ones kept giving me looks all night.

A few days later, I got a long email from her on my personal account telling me that she was horrified at the way I'd acted, that I have no understanding how awful and heartbreaking a miscarriage is, that she's worried I might be a sociopath, how could I be so callous about something very tragic, etc. 

I gently asked her if this is something that is very personal for her, and she responded with ""No, but what if it was? What if I was struggling with infertility and my friend just casually said she didn't want her miscarried baby to begin with? Do you have any idea how that would feel?""

I told her (copied from my last email): No, I don't know how that would feel. But I can't be held responsible for someone else's feelings. I'm sorry that I'm not beside myself with grief for a child I didn't want.""

747,Not the A-hole,"A little backstory, I’m 20f, my sister is 29f and a single mother of two non-verbal severely autistic children, a level of severity in which it’s doubtful they’ll ever even have limited functioning in society even with full time therapy. She divorced their father about 5-6 years ago and the children are now 9 and 10. Their disability is intensely severe and I work full time as a caretaker to assist in their upbringing and daily needs. I have stated multiple times that I don’t want children now, and don’t know if I ever will, partly because I’ve seen how severe some disabilities can be and don’t think I would be mentally or emotionally capable of handling the worst case scenario. 

My sister loves playing the ‘what if’ game and today she’s been asking me if I love my niece and nephew and trying to figure out how I can say I love them if I’m not willing to care for them in the case of her death, and kind of insinuating that I’m an asshole for not being willing to do so. I do love them but I’m mentally exhausted each and every day I leave work just after a few hours of being around them and their extremely demanding needs. Being in a caretaker position has brought about extreme increases to my anxiety and depression that I’ve struggled with for years. 

In the case of my sisters death I feel that I have no right legally or otherwise to take care of her children when her ex-husband has a good paying military job and a wife that stays home everyday raising his other two kids. Legally the children would go to him as his responsibility, not me, a struggling college student living at home with my parents. 

TL:DR AITA for telling her that her children aren’t my responsibility and that me loving them doesn’t mean I’m willing to sacrifice my life and future for a lifelong obligation of raising and watching over them?

*Adding an edit- some of you have expressed your concern for my mental health in a job I dislike, thank you for that! I do want to ease concerns by explaining that I’ll be leaving the job and finding a new one in a different field this fall once I complete my bachelors degree. I took this as a temporary position for the 2 or so years I needed to finish the degree as it pays higher than most jobs I could find. My sister knows of my intentions and gives me mental health days when I ask, so it’s mainly just the status of ‘aunt’ that has given her preconceived notions and hope that I’d step up for the children despite what I’ve told her in the past.",192,2486,0.96
748,Asshole,"I’m at a moral conundrum here and was hoping to hear an outside perspective. 

I’ve been married for 3.5 years, my wife has a son from a previous marriage. He is 13 years old and has the same appetite that I did when I was 13, which is to say, he eats like a pig in a dirt factory. 

I am a manual laborer and the only one who works in the house after my wife had our baby who’s now just turned 2. Finances are a LOT better than they could be because I inherited my family home and we both own our cars, but you know, I’m poor so we aren’t doing great. I frequently skip lunch and breakfast and just drink water so my wife and the 2 kids can eat well, and I’ll usually just have dinner instead. I came home from work last night and helped my wife finish up dinner which was steak and potatoes and broccoli. 

There was enough steak to go around and there was some spare too. I went ahead and ate what was on my plate but I was still hungry when I was done. By this point my wife had left baby with me so she could go for a bath, and as I went to grab the last steak which was on the plate and my stepson said ‘uh, that’s mine, mom said I could have it’ I gotta admit, I didn’t even think. I said sorry kid, you can have all the cheesy potatoes and broccoli in the world and I’ll let you have an extra desert but this steak ain’t going in your belly. 

I ate it, and I’m glad I did because I was absolutely ravenous. My wife was majorly upset with me that night and told me I had disrespected her and her son as well as her decision making. She told me she gave me the biggest steak and that should have been enough. I apologized to her honestly and meant it, but I told her I also felt disrespected because she KNOWS I don’t eat anything apart from dinner to try and make sure the kids don’t have to go without and I shouldn’t have to go hungry for my main meal for a 13 year old.

750,Not the A-hole,"I’m 19F and my date was 25M, I was a regular client of a buddy of his who is a tattoo artist and he had seen me get tattooed by him once as he came to visit while I was half way through my session. 

I get an IG message from him, found it a bit odd as to how he would’ve found me since my page is super private, my username isn’t specific at all to my real name and I have 40 followers. 
He explains he’s so and so’s friend and we end up speaking and have great banter, we seem to really get along through text, it’s hard for me to keep up a consistent convo through text so I’m excited and we plan to meet up. 

We catch up to hang out and he offers me a drag from his spliff, I take a few drags and after a little while can tell it was a mistake. I smoke semi regularly but it hit me very differently this time around. We’re in his car driving around and he proceeds to ask me questions and we talk.

I study justice so he’s telling me how he’s an ex con and is out on parole yet still engages in illegal activities, then goes on about how women lie about s*xual assault 99% of the time, that’s when I freak. he makes a comment about how high I am then jokes about robbing me and leaving me in a ditch, at this point I start to get really scared.
He keeps asking if anyone knows I’m with him, who I live with, how much money I make & how much I have on me etc. Just weird questions. I was under the influence (big mistake) so my reaction IMO was much more extreme. I was scared and wanted to jump out of the car, the undertone of the convo was very off. My perception was exacerbated by drugs but safe to say I was genuinely scared.

I hid my unease and tried to convince him to pull over somewhere so I could be around people and also so he wasn’t DUI, he didn’t want to and kept driving but after 20 mins of convincing him that I felt sick and needed to sit down, we pulled up to a restaurant.

I get out of the car and start walking ahead of him up to the restaurant as he’s taking a phone call. I go up to 3 women and say as to not cause a scene “I’m really scared, can you help me and pretend to know me” they catch on and can see I’m upset. I sit with them, he catches up with me after his call and the women start telling him they know me and my mum wants me home, he says he’ll take me home but they are very firm. He addresses me quite angrily and asks “who does your mum think your with?” The owner gets aware and told him to leave and he ended up leaving. 

I felt guilty since I had gotten along with him and he’d taken the time to see me, I’m not 100% sure if I was in danger and if I could’ve stuck through it and left amicably instead of unintentionally causing a bit of a scene which was embarrassing not only for him but also me. I tried to have tact in the situation and didn’t have the confidence to be straight forward but wonder if in hindsight it would’ve been better to tell him I was uncomfortable and wanted to leave.

Edit: Some of you are saying this is a validation post or would be better suited to other subreddits, I’m super new to reddit but thought that most predicaments are pretty much fair game for this subreddit? Correct me if I’m wrong please. I genuinely wanted to to know if my reaction was rude, if there’s something wrong with me for getting freaked out the way I did and if I’m the AHole for handling a bad date this way.

He called in one of the most confusing orders I've ever heard in my 10 years of owning this business. Then he came in reeking like weed, which explains the stupid confusing order.

When I went out front to address the situation, he started using the extreme derogatory language towards me. He was acting like an entitled little child, screaming that the customer is always right.

I caught the entire incident on my security camera, and I was going to upload the video to my Facebook page which has over 5,000 followers. Right before I posted the video, I realized you could see his name tag clear as day in the video. He worked for a car dealership about a mile down the road from my restaurant. 

I took the video straight to his employer, and told him I was extremely disappointed with his behavior. I told him I wanted to share it on Facebook, but decided to take it to him before I tarnished his business with his employee's behavior. 

His employer agreed that his behavior was unacceptable and embarrassing, and assured me that he will never work there again.

756,Not the A-hole,"So last year, my mom had a stroke and became mentally disabled and paralyzed. I was taking my finals when it happened, and was put on academic probation shortly afterwards. My brother and I were faced with the dilemma of handling her finances. I worked at a disability law firm for a year, so the answer was obvious: sell EVERYTHING and file for government aid immediately. He responded with ""No no we can handle it"". Since then we agreed that he would pay for the mortgage and insurance. I would pay for the car and pay for all of her house fees and bills and such.

I was young, 20 years old and not exactly in the best place to be making financial decisions that large. About half a year passed and I was on the verge of academic suspension, largely due to the stress of juggling working full-time, and going to school full time in two different campuses 53 miles apart. I came to my brother and told him that I couldn't handle all of the bills and he agreed to pay the car note. I got into an accident, and found out he wasn't keeping up with insurance. I was stuck at the house with no way to get to class or work. This along with the threat of foreclosure, I dropped out of school to try and figure out just how the hell I was going to pay for everything on top of my bills.

Fast forward to 2 months ago. I'm gearing up to start school again, but of course I can't afford it.

I tell my brother that I have to move from the house in order to get financial aid, because I can't pay for both school and everything regarding the house. He offers me a deal. I stay in the house and pay half of the rent, he comes down and gives me an old beater so I don't have to worry about saving for a car. He never came. We did this dance about 2 more times.

758,Not the A-hole,"Ok so some background. Ever since high school I'd walk around without my shirt or socks on when I'm just relaxing in my own home since I have hyperhidrosis and I sweat terribly through my armpits and feet and I dont like wearing damp clothes (IDK why it just really bothers me, I change socks like 3 times a day). In college I was self-conscious about my family always hounding me to eat more and put on weight so I started working out and never stopped, so I got reasonably large, as one would expect. Later, I moved in with my current roommate who at the time was single but eventually got a girlfriend. In the past I'd usually put on a shirt when I'm just chilling in the living room but I never put a shirt on when I'm hanging out in my room and I'm just leaving to grab a drink or something. When his GF first started coming over to the apartment I'd obviously make sure I looked presentable (showered, fully clothed, etc), but then she started coming over regularly and I started to get more comfortable with her. One day she was over again (at this point she started practically living here) and I finally thought ""Nah I dont need to throw a shirt on to go get a drink"". So I left my room no shirt or socks and did my business, while they watched Netflix on the living room coach. I did this throughout the day to make a sandwich or dinner or to grab another drink or something. Sometimes I'd make small talk with her like ask her how's she's doing and stuff, and then go back to my room. At the time I didn't think anything of it, but then the next day he came up to me and told me that they both thought I was trying to ""flex on him"" and hit on his GF or some shit (I'm single right now) in the douchiest/creepiest way possible. He then told me we'd have problems if I kept ""being weird around his GF"". At this point I got kinda pissed (it's not a big deal for me to throw a shirt on but just the way he approached me about it pissed me off) and told him that I'm the one who pays rent, not this semi-permanent resident of a GF so I'll walk around my apartment however the fuck I want. He thinks I'm an ass, I disagree. AITA?

Edit: For clarification, the GF wasn't like psyched about it but she wasn't really uncomfortable or too mad about it either. It was mostly my roommate who had the problem with it. Also the GF had lived in the apartment for a week straight at this point (as in sleeping, showering, and eating here) Which I honestly don't mind since it's his apartment too. Part of the reason I was mad was that I thought that should afford me the right to walk around shirtless than. I'm not sure that how that stuff works though.

Final edit: I only small talked with his GF because that's my way of being nice, since I'm not super close to her. I feel like I don't need to do the same to my roommate since I've known him for some time now, so we don't ""small talk"" all that much, maybe that's wrong though. Lastly, I only mentioned working out since I think that's part of the reason he was mad. I think he'd be less mad if I was thinner, but then again this is just my side of the story, up for your interpretation.",591,4261,0.96
759,Not the A-hole,"Context: I am 16 years old and live with my mother and older brother. Up until about 4 years ago my mother wasn't a vegetarian and would eat meat. Ever since she became vegetarian she tried forcing me and my brother into also becoming vegetarian and for a few months she even tried to make us vegan.

Through all of this time neither I or my brother wanted to be a vegetarian/vegan, but she doesn't care about that. She even talked multiple times about making our 2 cats vegetarians.

In my opinion everybody should choose for them selves and ONLY for themselves whether or not they want to turn vegetarian/vegan, but my mother doesn't see it like that. She thinks that she's doing the right thing forcing us.

Now we get to present day, I bought meat from MY money for myself, and put it in the fridge in the kitchen. After she realized where I had put it she started screaming at me to take it out of there or she would throw it in the trash(this part I find dumb because she is a person that allways calls people out at home at dinner for not eating everything of their table with the argument that how many people don't have the food which we waste). Right after that I get up and take it out of the fridge and put it into my mini fridge in my room(I didn't instantly put it in there because she doesn't want it to be turned on over night).
Right after that we get into a conversation where I am basically just pissed off because of her shouting at me. I tell her that I think it's shitty to force other people into being vegetarian and inhuman forcing animals into being vegetarian. This is where she tried pulling the normal ""vegetarian cards"" by that I mean that animals get killed for meat and that how could I eat meat and so on and on. Shortly after that she just grabs the meat that I bought with my money and goes to return it.

Additional info: she also pulls the ""I dont want meat in MY apartment"" card even though I feel like she can't say that because she doesn't even work, 95% of the money comes from our dad who works his ass off and also just gets shouted at by her.",135,319,0.89

I park my car in front of my house, next to my neighbors porch and their is a small pathway down to the landing where my house is. All of this is considered ""my land"". I come home to other day and there is clothes line put up from the neighbors porch connecting to a tree I own, and their dirty clothes are hanging down over the one path to get into my house. I promptly left a note saying I felt it was inappropriate and rude, and told them to take it down tomorrow or I would be happy too. The next day as I am getting home from work, I see them on their deck so I remind them to take the line down and how I feel it is disrespectful. My neighbor who is a 33 year old women, begins sobbing on the spot, saying that that clothes line has been up since she was a kid, and then comments about how ""you haven't even been alive for 30 years let alone lived here for thirty years"". I was pretty shocked by her reaction, especially the crying. After a 10 minute conversation that went no where, I just left and took it down and told them if it went up again I would take it back down.

We would go and get drinks, food, LAN party, go to strip clubs; typical shady roommate stuff.

So 10/10 awesome dude.

In the next couple months he became passive-aggressive and emotionally dependent on me. I would get finger snapping, eye rolling, caught him smelling my clothes, wearing my pants, sleeping in my bed while I was at work, waiting in my doorway sighing about his day, etc.

764,Not the A-hole,"
My husband and I got engaged in the begining of this year. Hes in the military so for BT he was only communicating with me through mail for 3 months, and in one letter he proposed. He picked a date for me to go visit him at his training school and get hitched. I told my immediate family to keep it on the down low for superstitious reasons (we are a Hispanic family mal de ojo is legit people lmfao) anyway, him and his mom dont have the best of relationships but she bonded with me during his BT and I told him he should tell his mom about the court ""wedding"" to see if she could go (she couldnt) and she follow up with telling him ""not to post anything or tell anyone about the wedding"". Okay that's fine! We werent planning on it.


So fast forward to about a week after the wedding I still havent posted any of the cute pictures I have of the wedding because once I brought it up to him he told me he hadnt even told his DAD (whom hes much more close to than his mom) or his best friend (whom he wants to be his best man for our actual big wedding.) 
I told him ""why? I told my best friend and my immediate family, why cant you? Nothing bad happened. We are already married what could go wrong?"" 


And he just said that his mom mentioned ""something bad would happen if he did post or tell anyone"" he has since spoken with all his friends and dad multiple times. We never brought the topic up after that situation. 
It is now months later and I didn’t think there would be any issues with me posting it this far down the line. It turns out he never told any of them and he’s mad because I took his chance away of being able to tell them on his own terms that he got married. When he had all the chances in the world and at the end of the day I'm sure nothing bad would have happened if he told his DAD. 


I just didnt get why he is so gung ho about not mentioning it to his best friend and dad just because his mom said ""something bad would happen"" if he did. She got to flaunt her marriage idk why shes trying to control ours and hes just going with it, and now his mom is complaining to him about me posting the pictures. AITA for posting it? Or is he just low key ashamed.

UPDATE: the dad ended up finding out and though he said It sucked to find out through a post  he didnt understand why my husband didnt tell him about it. He expressed always having my husbands back and is very happy for us. So mo harm done. Universe is still intact! Lol my husband and I have known each other for years since middle school and are in our mid twenties, and though it might have seemed rushed we had been living together before him being shipped out to BT. We didnt want to fall into that stereotype but the military really made it hard to even see each other if we werent married.",29,58,0.86

766,Asshole,"I have a 5 year old son. He's very sweet and sensitive and smart and just a really adorable, awesome little guy. He has adhd and some behavioral issues, and I'm afraid he has also inherited my anxiety. 

 The first time someone told him and explained to him in detail about death was when he was at a playdate with one of his friends. Her uncle had recently passed away from an OD and it was a really sad, shitty situation. She was struggling with what happened and very upset. Her mom, who is a close friend of mine, explained that he was dead and some other details about death, in general. She decided to tell my son about it, and that he would die too and get buried in the dirt. It terrified him. 

He would randomly starts crying and saying he doesn't want to die, he couldn't sleep, he was attached to me constantly, and he was afraid of everything. It was awful. 

I finally got him to where he was ok, still afraid and would occasionally get upset about it, but pretty much ok. I reassured him that he was a little boy and he has a mommy and daddy who will never let anything happen to him. I avoided telling him that he will not die, ever, because I didn't want to flat out lie to him. I just sort of worked around it.

 Then, a few days ago, a little girl in his afterschool program who was a few years older than him, told him that he *will* die because everyone dies when they turn 100 and that I will die too and he will never see me again. When I picked him up, he was crying. He was so terrified. He doesn't really understand numbers, so 100 years old doesn't really mean a lot to him. For all he knows, that could be next week or tomorrow. 

I initially tried the same approach as before, but when he asked me if he can still see people after they die, I admitted that he couldn't. 

 He got scared again and started panicking and crying. I finally told him ""bud. You are not going to die. Ever. Not when you're 100, not ever. And neither will I. Your friend from school is just a kid and she doesn't know what she's talking about. ""

 I told my friend about it later because I felt kind of shitty for lying to him, and she said I shouldn't have done that because he will find out eventually and it was fucked up for me to do that.

 I just feel like he's too young. He can't handle it. He doesn't have the capacity to really understand, and all it does is scare him. I don't want him being afraid of everything and sad all the time. I tried to explain it more realistically and it didn't work. Idk what else to do. 

TL;DR Told my 5 year old he will never die and neither will I, because he's terrified of death. Might be an asshole for lying to my son about something so important

Edit: Thanks I realize in this situation, I'm an asshole. I shouldn't have lied. I should have known I was wrong because of how guilty it made me feel. That's usually a good indicator that you've done something you shouldn't have. I'm going to pull his therapist aside at our next appointment and ask her for some advice on how to better handle this.",178,135,0.85

768,Not the A-hole,"Background: I work in a VERY small doctor's office. We typically need about 4 employees on the floor on a given day and we only have two full time people (me being one) and 3 part timers. We recently fired an employee after 7 YEARS of her not doing her job when she was here and calling off at LEAST once a week. I'm pretty sure this employee has job security so that's not an issue. They rarely fire people here.

So this employee hasn't always been reliable. She is always going out on work nights coming in hungover or calling off (I'd say at least once a month). Well the past couple weeks she's been complaining of back pain, which I understand totally sucks, but she's been calling off due to said pain (about 5 times in the past 2 weeks). Now, normally I'd totally get it, as I've thrown my back out before and it totally sucks, but she will go out and make posts on snap chat and Facebook showing her going off and doing things where she's clearly walking around just fine. She also waits until less than an hour before her shift or when she's supposed to already be in the building to say she can't come in, which makes it super difficult to cover her shift on such short notice and screws the rest of us  The last time she called off she went to a wedding and then called off the next morning. Later on that day she posted about her out and enjoying the weather with pictures of her where she was clearly not in pain. After having to work short handed for so long (which makes the day super rough) and getting incredibly annoyed about it I took a screenshot of the pic and sent it to my manager. He's been aware that she goes out a LOT and he was the one who had to cover her shift and miss a family engagement because of it, so I thought he deserved to know. Today she storms into the lunchroom saying ""hey snitch"" and going off about how I'm childish for telling him. She claims that she sees the chiropractor before going out and doing these things so she feels fine and her back pain only occurs in the morning. I asked her if resting instead of going out may help, and she stated that has nothing to do with it and she just needs physical therapy (which she's not getting). She also said she would never do that to me, which I replied she wouldn't need to because I show up to my shifts and don't go out and party on the days I call off. 

Edit: She has been spoken with about the behavior from our manager and a few other employees and she just doesn't care. She's also the employee that begs for more hours but requests a LOT of days off because she ""wants to enjoy the summer"".

770,No A-holes here,"I (M23) have started a new job (about 2 months ago) that has me getting up around 4-4:30am to do fairly physical work. When I get home we have been remodeling the kitchen and so I get exhausted throughout the day. My Fiance (F24) has been saying that she wants to do more things together, because often when we have a break I will just sit in a chair to relax. It has also led her to asking about having sex more often, as my new sleep schedule doesn't fit hers (she gets up around 8). So often I work and then come home, work on the kitchen until I have to sleep, and I'm just too tired to try and do anything. I do stay up later some nights with her, but we don't often have sex unless it's the weekend and I can sleep in the next day.

Am I the asshole for wanting to sleep, over having sex?

EDIT: just wanted to clarify a few things: the kitchen is not ours, we live in (effectively) a duplex,  with my FMIL living in the other space (aka:her kitchen being remodeled). The remodeling was not my idea, I understand it needs to be done, but I wouldn't be working on it as much as we do if I had more of a choice (entire kitchen was taken to sub floors) and it has become a form of tension for the three of us.

772,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway for reasons.

TL;DR at the bottom.

I come from a typical ethnic background where names are stupidly long and even more stupidly difficult to pronounce. My parents raised us abroad as they wanted to give myself and my siblings a better chance of a good future and I am forever grateful for this.

However, I want to change my name legally. I have four names. My first name has 12 letters. My middle name 7 and my last two names have 16 letters between the two. All up, I have 35 letters in my name. 

More letters than the blasted English alphabet. Ironically enough in my parents native language, we only have 14 letters in the alphabet.

Throughout my life I have used a shortened version of my first name and opted to only use the shorter of my two last names. It's been a constant inconvenient pain. From trying to fill out forms to having to spell out names to strangers over the phone to my names never being able to be fully printed out on cards because they're too. Freaking. Long.

I have thought about legally changing my name for the last few years so this is not just a whim of a decision. I wish to legally erase my middle name, second last name and shorten my first name.

So I texted my mum to see if she had my original birth certificate and when she asked what it was for, I told her. In the past we have always made jokes about my name and my mum has always shrugged it off when I have mentioned having it legally changed and made comments such as ""whatever you choose to do, it's your life"".  

Howeve she was not too happy when I told her my plans and why. She has since told my dad and now both my parents are upset, my dad more so as he was the one who named me. I was christened after my paternal Grandmother and my two last names are in honour of my paternal Grandfather. 

I am not close nor have any emotional attachments to either my paternal Grandmother or Grandfather. My mum often took us to her family growing up and subsequently, I grew a far deeper bond towards my maternal Grandparents. 
The other issue I have is that said Grandmother only passed away last month. My mum and siblings both think I'm an insensitive asshole towards my dad for wanting to change my name so soon after the passing of his mother.

Now my parents have threatened not to attend my graduation if I go ahead with the change and I would be devastated not to have them there as I've always been close to my parents. However regardless of what name I choose to put on the degree, I still want to legally change my name as I feel life will be a little more simpler with having a nine letter name.

So AITA for going against my parents wishes?

TL;DR: Grew up with a 35 letter name, wanting to legally shorten it both for career and personal reasons but parents are against it and are threatening to boycott uni graduation.",60,184,0.95

774,Not the A-hole,"My mother called my today and with no context asked for my social security number. I asked her why and she said she wants a new insurance policy (I’m still on my parents’ insurance). She just got a new insurance policy three weeks ago, so I asked her why she was getting a new one.  I really didn’t mean this question any type of way, I was just curious because it sounded like a really good policy (for what little I know of insurance) and because of the new policy I am able to get an IUD not covered by the last one so I was excited to take advantage of that. She doesn’t know the last part and I didn’t mention it.  Plus, she didn’t need my SSN the last time she was shopping around for a new policy, so it struck me as odd that she suddenly needed it now. I do have my problems with my mother but I don’t think she’d do anything intentionally malicious. I was just curious about what my SSN was needed for and why. I did tell her what it was.

The problem is I mentioned I had a crush and my friends were able to pressure me into admitting it was a friend in our group. The next day me and the friend sat down with one other friend to talk about it and I explained that I knew he was straight and would never take any action irl. He rightfully felt ackward since I mentioned I had masturbated to him. I tried to explain that I had self control and didn't bring my feelings into real life but he was very upset. He said that unless I swore to never sexually think about him again I would permanently destroy the entire friend group and he would not hang put with me as much as possible. I agreed to his demands but I was lying to his face because I was still very unsure. Should I not be able to have freedom of thought if I never bring it into real life?.

There is this chubby girl who was friends with me. She seemed normal and we got along alright during the years.

One day I was being polite and I said ""good morning"" to her. She laughed called me rude names, then ran off with her other friends. This was fine with me because I had nothing to loose, and she was just an extra person to talk to.

Of course, she did this over and over. One day I was so mad that I called her a ""b\*\*\*h"", and told her to leave me alone. After I let out what I wanted to say, I started to ignore her.

I am pretty skinny, but I'm fine with it.

After the incidents we went through periods of talking to each other again. She would talk to me for 5 days, then would start crying saying I did something wrong. Or she would just block me all together.

783,Not the A-hole,"New account. Been dating my SO for 7 years (since undergraduate).

Background: I have recently graduated with my terminal degree and started a job making roughly $150,000. Throughout my years of schooling I never chose the best school I got into or a dream school in order to keep my debt down.

My SO took out 6 figures of undergraduate debt and has only been able to make minimum payments due to job outlooks in her degree so is still in 6 figure debt. As we get closer to looking at marriage I have always been fine with accepting that her debt would become mine and that her career choice will make very little money so I will have to shoulder most of it. This has never been a problem, but now she is looking into her masters and PHD in the same field and refuses to look into any school that's not her dream school.

Now for the problem. With my new salary she has made comments about how it wouldn't be easy but we could pay of a 300k loan for those two degrees and that its unfair that I got to spend the time in school getting the final degree I wanted while she never did. Even with a PHD her career field is limited and I have tried my hardest to find programs and research positions so that she can get her education paid for without debt. She has not been interested in these routes as she is only interested in going to a ""top school"" such as Berkeley.

786,Not the A-hole,"Basically there was this business trip a friend would have to go on and he needed some unskilled labor and wanted some company. Myself being unemployed and having no other commitments, I thought I'd join him, get some money out of it (not from him, but the organizer of the event he was attending), and see a different city etc. We'd be going halfsies on everything. Keep in mind I got paid about 150$ which barely covered the flights, while he got 8-9 times that with a paid flight. Essentially I thought of it as a cheap trip opportunity.

&#x200B;

The issue is that we had to rent a car from there. I checked online and the price was about 100$ for the days we needed it, from various companies. Now, my friend said he knew a guy which will make a good deal and I needn't worry about it. After the trip is over and we're back at home he gets sent the invoice, which is about 350$. Half of it is more than the entire cost from some random internet company. He says he didn't know, but also when I asked 3-4 times about how much the car is gonna cost before the trip, his reply was ""don't worry about it, I'm sure it won't be something crazy"". I couldn't check the price for myself as I didn't even know the guy's company name or smth.

&#x200B;

AITA for refusing to pay 175$ instead of the expected 50$?

Edit: the car is not paid for and he will not be reimbursed because it wasn't needed for the business, we mainly used it to travel around abit on our free time

Edit2: it's not about his integrity as a character. I know he genuinely didn't bother asking how much it would've cost, for whatever reason, and the price is correct, I've seen the invoice. The price difference came from a different insurance policy, which was basically unnecessary. I think that his friend's price for that type of insurance was actually quite fair compared to the market price.

787,Asshole,"My wife and I have a dog, which was her dog before we got together. He is an 11-year-old German Shepherd. Over the last few years he has started to have accidents (poop) on the carpet more and more frequently. Recently it seems that we come home to poop on the carpet at least every other week.

&#x200B;

He's a big dog. He takes big dumps. They are runny and smell horrible and get everywhere. We've tried changing his diet, had him to the vet to inquire about illnesses, etc. to no avail.

We love the dog, but this is becoming too much. We are very clean people otherwise. Our house is always clean. It always smells nice. We take pride in our home. So, naturally, having to spend hours cleaning up massive, runny dog shits three times a month is getting to be too much. In addition to the bowel problems, he's having issues with arthritis in his hips (common to GSD breed) and has some trouble getting around. This doesn't come into play with the bowel issues though, I don't think, because he always chooses to go down the stairs to the basement to do his business. He is let out in the morning before we leave, as soon as we get home, and multiple times throughout the evening. We have a large yard that he is able to spend lots of time in. Still, he poops on the carpet.

788,Not the A-hole,"I work at a library, when a woman came in with her daughter. At first, when the two were in the designated children's area, it was fine that the child was having fun and making noise, as it wasn't bothering anyone. However, when she brought her child into the main part of the library where it is generally quieter, the woman continued to play with her child in the same manner, making enough noise to disrupt other customers. 

I thought to myself that she should either quieten down or go back into the children's area where they were free to make noise. But then I got busy doing something else and forgot about it. A couple of minutes later, an elderly man reading a newspaper spoke up to the woman. I had no idea what he said, but he ended up leaving in a mood.

The woman then came up to the counter with her child and told me that the man told her to 'get lost' at the end of their argument. Rather than apologize and end the issue (which I probably should have done), I explained that there is a designated children's area, where there is plenty of space to run around and make noise. Then she said she doesn't understand my viewpoint and that children should be encouraged to come into libraries and restructuring them to one area won't do that. She asked for my name and wanted to make a formal complaint. That's when I apologized as I wasn't going to risk losing my job over something so trivial.

Forgive my English, it is not my first language.

I'm a 21-years old student and was on my way to the bus station today. There's a crossroad on my way where you can easily see cars coming around, and I was in a bit of a hurry and just crossed the road at a red light.
Now, on the opposite was a group of small children, led by some teachers I guess. I wasn't really thinking any of it and just walked on. 
At the next light I waited and was approached by an elder man, telling me how rude I was for simply crossing the road and not waiting and being a bad example for the children. 
I told him I didn't care and told him to mind his own business.

796,Not the A-hole,"Of course with all Reddit posts, there’s a ton of background here and I will try to make this brief. I know family related posts can get intense so I created a throwaway. I have a good marriage with normal ups and downs. My desire in life is to be a stay at home parent, my kids are my passion and I get more joy out of being with them and watching them grow and learn than I could any job. I do however do bookkeeping from home so I have a decent income(think I make as much as a new school teacher). However my husband confessed to me early this year that he’s tired of feeling like we don’t have the material things his friends do. He said he talked with his mom and she would be happy to watch the kids for free as a test run this summer. 

I reluctantly agreed and asked my work for a full time position while I study for the CPA. I’ve had major issues with my MIL, when it comes to food (worst example: she allowed my kids to eat nothing but marshmallows for an entire weekend), politics+religion (won’t get into it but we don’t agree and she always says things like “xxxxx is evil but don’t tell your mom I said that”) and safety (she flaunts the kids not wearing bike helmets and again tells the kids not to tell me). 

I was also exceptionally taken aback because before I got my first full time check my husband had taken out a loan at line 9% APR for a wakeboarding boat. I know he’s wanted this for a long time but the unilateral decision really, really bothered me. 

We are a month in and it’s not gone well to up to Yesterday. The kids have been repeatedly sick so I’m pretty sure she’s not following my food rules, they have had almost zero active time and she parks them in front of phones to watch unsupervised YouTube literally all day long. I brought both up with her and told her that when I was home with them we cooked together, we did play groups, we went to the zoo and did art camps. She head-nodded me to death and then when I left she apparently called my husband because when I saw him next he told me I needed to go easier on her because she’s why we can afford so many nice things now. Poor choice of words dude. 

Then yesterday she had two separate trips to the ER for 2 of the 3 kids. One severe sprain and one burn because my 6 year old was hungry for something besides candy and tried to make a pizza. Both will be fine but in addition to kids being hurt, she took them to exact ER I told her NOT to take them to and now we are going to have months long battle to try to get insurance to cover the bills. 

Edit: an exceptionally ignorant and argumentative commenter below is taking exemption to the ER thing. To be clear, I would have handled the burns and bruises at home. My MIL in panicked and took both kids to the ER. And she drove past the one I told her to go to in order to take them to one she was “more familiar” with. So it’s out of network meaning we are at least in for a months long battle trying to get insurance to cover and there’s a good chance we may be out thousands of dollars for these Er trips. We couldn’t potentially afford the goddamned boat (that had already needed extensive work  not in warranty) BECAUSE of these ER trips.

Id had it and told my work in going back to part time. I told my husband the boat is being sold and that was that. He is furious with me so is MIL.

His mom asked me to talk to him to give him advice, since I'm more 'popular' (so my mom says). So we went over to his house and to his room. We had a conversation, and he talked a lot about how he 'deserves' to have friends and be popular. I asked him if he wanted blunt honesty, and he said yes, so I told him that he doesn't 'deserve' popularity or friends. Nobody *automatically* is entitled to friends and popularity, him included. I told him, to have friends and popularity, you need to give people a reason to hang out with you: you're funny, or you have great social skills, or are good at sports (classic example). My point is that to have friends and be popular, you have to bring something to the table that makes people want to be around you. Just sitting and waiting for friends to drop from the sky is useless.

He accused me of victim-blaming, saying he shouldn't have to do anything and it's the bullies that should stop. I told him that in an ideal world, yes, the bullies would stop. But that's not how it works. Mason's family has gone to the administrators multiple times, to no avail. So the only real option he has to begin with is to improve himself and make friends. I don't think that's victim-blaming, just reality.

Traveling that distance is really hard for us as our son is a really bad traveller and a stickler for routine. It’s also really expensive for the three of us to travel vs one of him.

Despite this we finally decided to visit as I could see how upset my husband was getting that his dad hadn’t met our son. 

We’ve flown to see him (flight was awful!). Paid to stay in a hotel as FIL said his spare room wasn’t ready for guests hired a car as FIL didn’t want to come meet us at airport.

We went to his house yesterday and his three dogs were all over our son who can only just walk and not very well. One dog was growling and barking and showing his teeth and they had to put him on a lead (but they took him off several times and let him dig his claws in my leg while trying to get to my son).

These dogs don’t spend time around anyone including any kids so i was really quite worried when they were all over him (I held him cause I was too scared to put him down and the dogs were jumping up my legs and licking my sons arms and legs).

When we left I was actually shaking with adrenaline as I’d spend the whole time on high alert worried my son was going to get hurt.

Today we told FIL we weren’t comfortable coming round again cause of the dogs and that our son needs to be able to walk/crawl around and we’d be scare the dogs would knock him over and hurt him. He got all defensive saying the dogs just wanted to be a part of the family and he wouldn’t put them in a separate room.

So we said we could all go to a local soft play to let my son run around safely but FIL said he can’t leave his dogs home alone and was mad that we wouldn’t come over.

801,Not the A-hole,"I'm a 21 year old girl. I have PCOS and have had irregular and painful periods my whole life. Around 5 months ago, I was told by my obgyn to do some hormonal tests and bring her the results. Due to busy schedules and traveling (and the fact they need to be done at a certain point in the cycle, which is a problem since my periods are irregular) I wasn't able to do them until last month. However, the past 3 months my period was somewhat regular, but still extremely painful. I tried to make an appointment with my obgyn since last month, but was only able to get one today.

Today when I came into her office, she was pretty pissed off and told me how disrespectful it is to come after half a year and expect her to be okay with it. I explained why I couldn't do it and apologized, and then she asked the dates of my previous periods. After I told her, she got all snarky and said ""Your periods are perfectly regular, just take a painkiller"". I said that painkillers do nothing for me, and she said ""You're supposed to take them a few days prior"". I said I can't because my period isn't regular, and she said ""But it is"".

She said I for some reason needed to do those tests again in a few days, I said I wouldn't be able to since I'll be traveling again. At this point she lost her shit.

""Why did you even come today? You come here 2 days before your period is supposed to start, and tell me that you can't even do the tests. Why the HELL did you even show up TODAY? What did you even expect? It's NOT POSSIBLE medically to do anything for you now.""

I felt like shit. After I got out, my mom was waiting for me (she had an appointment in the same place), and I told her ""she yelled at me"". My mom asked what happened, and after I told, she said ""let me talk to her"". I said NO, but my mom literally barged into her office to ask her about my tests.

After she came back, I lost my shit. I yelled at her and told her that she can't just barge into people's offices like that, and that I feel embarrassed. That my doctor already thought I was a pos, but now she probably thinks I'm a spoiled brat whose mom needs to do shit for her.

I file a police report in hope to gain a restraining order, since she will be going to the same convention as me in July, and since I will be working in their healthcare group, I'll be very easy to find.

And, finding my address is an easy thing to do, due to my not-so-common lastname, and all of that info is public in Sweden.

Everything in the wedding so far has been decided by SO and I (location, invitations, guests, etc) but it’s mostly been up to SO to have the final decision as I have been happy with what has been chosen.

However, this week my mother wanted to help out by deciding the flowers for our wedding and SO doesn’t like the decision. My mother is insisting she really wants to help out our wedding and that the flowers will be paid by her as well. I thought it was very generous and thoughtful of my mother but my SO wants some other type of flower or floral arrangement. My mother is upset because she’s already ordered the flowers and arranged for them and I thought since everything else has been done to SO’s liking what would be wrong with having the flowers as what I want. I honestly don’t mind whatever flowers we have but since they’re already bought and everything else so far has been done to SO’s liking we could compromise on this decision. We also come from a culture where we should respect our elders decisions and I feel it’s really something small to compromise for our wedding. I told her I want these flowers since they’re already paid for but she got very upset asking if it’s really what I want and since when did flowers mean so much to me and isn’t it just because my family wants them.

I told my SO that when my mother suggested invitations, she liked them so we decided to go with those invitations, but because the flowers aren’t to her taste we can’t just refuse. That it’s selfish to only accept what we want but not allow the rest of the family to input anything else about our wedding. I told my SO when we’re marrying we are marrying into each other’s families as well and we should accept and respect their decisions too.

Now my SO has said that she wants to rethink the wedding and my decisions because I don’t seem to care about her thoughts?
She has said that she wishes we had planned out the entire wedding then told our in laws.

I feel like my SO is being very selfish/overreacting and disrespectful to my family but SO seems to think I’m the asshole for putting my foot down on the flowers I want for our wedding.

Ended up failing ½ exams in late 2018 and really shook her confidence and self esteem. Would listen to her vent but would continue to push to her work hard. Fast forward to 04/2019 and she re-wrote the remaining exam and passed it so getting called in 06/2019. I was incredibly happy to see her finally get to this point after knowing how much she struggled the past year. 

She has wanted me to be there for her ceremony alongside her parents but being in a residency program and on nights currently (8 pm to 10 am shifts for two weeks preceding her ceremony) there was no way I was going to make it. Asked her to take lots of pictures to share with me. 

A little bit about me: am from Canada as well but went to medical school abroad right after high school. Parents are generation immigrants and saw them work real hard to now to go point of relative comfort and pay for my medical school and brother’s as well. I am exactly what you call the opposite of pampered. Never gotten any any gifts, parties or even cards as such for any of my milestone in life (HS grad, med school grad, getting into residency finally). And neither do I care for these because for me, what truly made me happy was how proud I have made my parents 

On the eve of her ceremony, we video chat as usual. She asks me ""Be honest with me, did you think to send me a card even?"" Initially I became defensive that I have been on nights these last two weeks, but told her the truth, that no it did not occur to me. She told me she was hurt and immediately hung off. Texted me later she is scared that It never even occurred to me. To me the card represents acknowledgement of her big day. But I have been constantly doing that since her exam results came out and told her how excited I was for her. So I don't see whats the big deal behind a stupid card. 

I texted her some encouraging words on the morning of her ceremony while driving home from night shift and got a passive ""Thanks"" 15 min later. Since then we haven't talked or texted each other. She has put up photos of her from the ceremony on instagram but not directly shared with me.

808,No A-holes here,"I’ve never seen eye to eye with my mother in law. She’s a typical southern church going type lady and she’s from an older generation AND comes from obnoxious wealth. None of these things are inherently bad in themselves but put together, you can see that she’s the type of woman that’s always got her own way. 

Recently we moved to be closer to her, my husband has taken a larger role in their family business so he wanted to be closer to everybody else. 

We have a 4 y/o baby who hasn’t seen much of my MIL and FIL over the years as we lived so far away but my mother in law has absolutely fallen in love with him. She is literally creepily obsessed and has remodeled half her home to be more kid friendly and has set up his own room there which I am strictly against him staying in and has literally put thousands away for his college already. It’s just over the top and unnecessary.

We are polite and friendly towards one another but I really dislike this woman and I don’t want her near my kid. 

She invited us around for a big over the top welcome home party a few nights ago and she invited all the extended family and friends, some of whom I’ve never even seen before, and expected my 4 y/o to stay up as the dinner was served at 8:00pm. 

She insisted that he sit next to her, and then just before dinner was served she bowed her head and clasped her hands together to say grace. She smiled at my son and said ‘shall we do it together?’ And because he doesn’t know any better he nodded yes. 

I leaned down and whispered in my sons ear that he could just watch this part and not partake, and he understood and was happy to just watch except when she noticed neither me or my son had put our hands together she completely ignored me and looked straight at my son and said ‘darling, were saying grace now, you ready to copy me?’  

I was absolutely furious and decided not to make a scene and told him to go ahead but my husband afterwards was disappointed in me and told me that I had caused a scene by trying to stop him in the first place. as far as I’m concerned our son doesn’t need to be saying grace or thanks to any deity, and I don’t want him around that religious mumbo jumbo.

my MIL is still continuing to be icy polite and I just hate it because I have nothing to gauge on whether she’s pissed off or not. AITA?",1227,2221,0.91
809,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because I don't really care if my family reads this, but I'd prefer to keep my real username to myself.

&#x200B;

Quick backstory on the clickbaity title: I (f/31) have a brother (30) and, surprise, two parents. My family has never been close, even as a kid. While we never lacked anything (food, clothing, schooling), my parents were a bit abusive growing up, so establishing a positive emotional connection was difficult. I moved out when I was 18, never visited much. We keep in touch as in talk on the phone every few weeks and see each other about once a year. I call on their birthdays, they call on mine. I don't keep in touch with my brother at all as we have zero stuff in common. I text on his birthday, he usually forgets mine. That's our relationship. That all worked fine up until about four months ago.

&#x200B;

In December, I got engaged to my gf of five years. My parents know and like this girl. I texted them a picture of the ring, they said congrats, all good. In March, we sent out the save the dates, including one to my parents. In our next phone call after receiving it, they asked whether my brother was also invited. I said no, as we are keeping it to a minimum (30 people including us) and since my brother and I don't talk at all, he doesn't fall in that category. They said hm, ok and that was it. Or so I thought.

&#x200B;

Four days later, my mother calls me. She basically yelled and cursed at me for 15 minutes, telling me how much I suck for not inviting my brother, that I'm ruining the family, bla bla and that she won't be attending. I didn't really get to say anything and when she was done, I just sarcastically said ""well, if you're not coming that saves us some money"". This is pretty much me to the core, so a sarcastic snark from my side shouldn't have surprised her. Well apparently it did and she just hung up. This was my last conversation with her.

&#x200B;

Now to the WIBTA part. All of my family's birthdays are in June. I texted my father on his (we briefly spoke on the phone afterwards, nothing relevant), texted my brother on his (a two line conversation as usual) and now my mother's is coming up and I'm conflicted. On the one hand, I do feel it's a bit petty to just ignore her birthday, on the other hand, she said some awful things to me, apparently expects ME to apologize (according to my father) and I really don't want to be the person to break the silence even though she fucked up. My gf agrees with me, however I've seen some pretty insightful responses on this sub so I thought I'd also give it a shot.

WIBTA for not texting or calling my mother on her birthday?",40,110,0.92
810,Not the A-hole,"Okay, relevant background. So I (30F) work at a nursing home and ask out a younger coworker (24F). Coworker says yes, we exchange numbers, talk on snapchat for a couple weeks. She makes up a few last minute excuses not to meet up after plans were made and eventually says she's not actually interested. No big deal. I delete her phone number, uninstall snapchat (I had otherwise never used it), and unfriend her from fb. She got mad about being unfriended from fb and said she wants to be friends. To avoid work issues, I readd her. 

She offers to hang out on my birthday - today/yesterday (depending on time where you are). I message her to verify time and she says she's with another coworker but will ask if she wants to come too. But I never hear back from her. About an hour after we were originally going to meet up, I send her a message asking her why she even asked me to hangout. She responds immediately and says her dog had an emergency visit to the vet due to a broken leg. She always has an excuse and this time I was kinda salty so I called her a liar, crazy and told her to leave me alone. 

Turned out this time she wasn't lying, she sent a snap of the medication w the date and said to never talk to her again. Cool, it's over, right? Nope.

2 hours later she sends a snap of her and the other coworker talking shit about me and how I never had a chance, she never liked me, etc. But I'm feeling petty at this point and want to be left alone so I tell her I'm showing HR, she's harassing me. 

She freaks the fuck out. Tells me she makes 150% what her coworkers do because she reports to corporate and signed a contract and can't be reported to HR or her she and her mom (who does work for corporate) will be sued. 

Sounds stupid, but on my first day, the lady training me pointed at her and called her a ""corporate spy."" I didn't think anything of it until coworker confirmed it (and I had never mentioned it to her).

She offers to pay me not to tell, to please not ruin her life, and when I decline, offers to fuck me if I don't tell HR.

I freak the fuck out at this point. I'm not okay with where the conversation is leading or the implication that I would do something like that. I don't want to talk to her anymore, but she's losing her mind, begging me to pick her up, and for some dumbass reason I agreed. I guess I thought we could achieve a more reasonable conversationin person.

When I got there, she alternated between screaming, begging, and crying. Blamed me for the whole thing, accused me of wanting the residents at work to suffer because she reports changes that really do need made, like bad staff, poor conditions, etc. 

I can't work with her. This feels insane to me. I'll definitely be quitting on the spot first thing tomorrow.

But would I be the asshole if I reported this situation to HR as the reason why I'm quitting? I know I had some asshole moments (accusing her of lying about the dog) but I feel like this was too far.

Edit: Thanks everyone for the input. It was a bit of a mixed bag and a lot of people made some really good points. I'm inclined to think everyone sucks here. I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks she's crazy (I thought maybe I was) and I can definitely see how my responses made a lot of things worse. I've never experienced anything like this, but I have certainly learned to behave more cautiously and to leave coworkers alone.

One thing I want to clarify: when I went to see her (imo, my biggest idiot moment), it was not to engage in sex. There was no sex, no consideration of it. In my original post, I mentioned how bothered I was by her suggestion and how the offer was super non-consensual and I did eventually get her to understand how inappropriate it was. But the subject of non-consensual sex had my post removed so I deleted that part and reposted. This is my biggest concern in the whole situation and continues to be, especially considering some people think she might to try to use it to accuse me of something. 

Again, thanks for all the comments, suggestions, and opinions.",87,184,0.89
811,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway etc.

My sister and I have always had ups and downs in our relationship. We come from a narcissistic family and she’s always been my Narcmom’s golden child lap dog. This caused most of our issues as she they would gang up on me and treat me like shit. I moved to a different country 7 years ago and kind of gave up on trying to have a sister since her approach to communicating with me was quote “out of sight out of mind.”

Last year I moved back “home” and actually lived with my sister during a difficult time, and things were improving. I finally felt like I had a sister. Things were great until my mom pulled some of her classic shit and succeeded in putting my sister against me for nothing. The banned me from family holidays, the last ones I would be able to have with them before moving back abroad. I was so hurt. I haven’t talked to either of them since, until my sister invites me to be her bridesmaid at her upcoming wedding.

I was shocked and honestly touched until I realized that more than anything, this is a superficial invite so that she doesn’t look like that girl who’s sister isn’t at her wedding. She doesn’t want to “work” on our issues, and instead wants us to put the past behind us and move on. I’m not being petty- I’ve suffered so much abuse at her and my mom’s hands that “just moving on” is not an option. I’d love to have a real relationship with both of them, but they refuse to own any of their shit, or apologize to me. Like I said, it’s a superficial invite to make her look good, and I think that’s tacky and tone deaf.

Part of me doesn’t want to miss her wedding because I don’t want to regret not going in the future, and I don’t want to be the asshole sister that doesn’t come to her sisters wedding. But being her maid of honor means doting on her all day and ultimately putting on an embarrassing front for the duration of her festivities which I’m sure she’ll derive some sick pleasure from. I’d be on edge all day as not to slip up and offend her in ANY WAY. (she literally looks for things to be offended by, and I’m scared the slightest misstep and I’ll have “ruined her special day”.

I also live abroad on a tight budget, so I would have to take off work, pay for plane tickets and stay with my family who I cannot stand through all of this. I feel damned if I do and damned if I don’t.

812,Not the A-hole,"Few months ago I befriended a Chinese guy, I'd often see him at our gym doing weightlifting type exercises and since it's quite small and we only have one barbell we often shared that one. We also spent more time hanging out, also sometimes going drinking. 

One time we got talking about girls and he said that he liked white girls better because they got bigger tits than Chinese girls who are mostly washboards (I'm just quoting him here). I told him I actually sort of thought the opposite and that Chinese but also Korean and Japanese girls were often really cute. I mentioned how there's a really sweet Chinese girl in one of my classes, I also mentioned some of the good things about her looks, but I wasn't sure how to get to know her. So he tells me that he'll help me out and that I should just take him there the next time with me, he'd chat her up and help me get a chance to get to know her.

So next time we go there I subtly point her out to him so he knows who I meant. His reaction was a bit weird though. A bit later he asks me whether I'm playing a prank on him and that I know that she's his sister (one year younger), right? I told him that I didn't and whether he was joking. But apparently he was serious and he even told me that I should stay away from her.

813,Not the A-hole,"So title is pretty self explanatory I think. I mentioned to my boyfriend (of 6 months) that if anyone gave me an 'it's me or the dog' ultimatum i would choose the dog. To be honest, it's more the giving of the ultimatum that would be the issue in that situation, I'm not saying that in a life or death situation I would save the dog over any person. But he is extremely offended that I would say this and thinks it means I value him less than my dog.

But my dog has been with me for 5 years now, there's no way I would ever give her up  just because someone asked me to. She is my family, and is very important to me.

So Am I the asshole here?

We have discussed it and decided it's not for us.

My MIL is quite involved in our lives, which is fine and for the most part we get along well. My biggest annoyance is that whenever I introduce her to someone as ''this is my mother-in-law, her name', she will laugh and say something like, 'well, not really, because she isn't married to my son'. It makes things unnecessarily awkward.

Recently, we all attended a social occasion where there were a number of people MIL had never met and she said it every. single. damn. time. After about the fifth time I spoke quite harshly and said she was being ridiculous with her comment, and she shot back saying it was inappropriate to present myself as married when I wasn't. She then left the event early and hasn't spoken to me in three weeks now. My SO has confirmed she's angry at me and has suggested I apologise so we can all move on.

820,No A-holes here,"Context: Me (26m) and my GF (26f) have a wonderful life together, moved in, own a dog, all of that. However, we are both at the start of our careers and as such don't have the most stable finances. Add to this the fact that I recently had a medical condition that required us both to take some time off work, and we are more or less living paycheck to paycheck. But, I come from money and have always used that to buoy our situation (covering her rent if she's short, getting nice stuff for her or the house, paying our vet bills, etc.). Never the less, she is always stressed about money to the point of it making her physically anxious.

Today, she had planned on going thrift shopping (specifically only thrift shopping was mentioned. This is important) with a friend, but due to the aforementioned time off she didn't have much in her account. She said she would go and just not buy anything, but I know that this makes her feel left out and anxious. I offered to let her take my credit card, and she accepted. Later, she called me saying that she got a dress and was thinking of returning it. I told not to, thinking that she always stresses after almost any purchase. She also has some body image issues and frequently feels bad about her clothes which causes her more shopping stress. I assumed her desire to return the dress was related to this.

Later the same evening, I'm doing some banking online and notice my credit card statement is much larger than I anticipated. I check it and see that there is almost 100 dollars in charges from a couple of upscale clothing stores in town, and nothing from any thrift store.

Here's the thing. If she had told me that they had changed from thrift shopping to an upscale place, I would have told her to go for it!

821,Asshole,"So I’ve been dating a guy since 2012 or so and we recently got engaged this year (2019) on Valentine’s Day. My fiance has 2 kids, 20 and 18--from a previous relationship--one will be a junior in college and the other just graduated high school. Their mom isn’t involved in their lives at all and does not even live in the same country. 

However, I didn’t really meet them until late 2014/early 2015 when my then-boyfriend and I knew that we were serious. 

I’ve always got along well with the 18 year old because he’s relaxed and easygoing, but I’ve had more problems with the 20 year old girl. When we first met, she’d always try to find ways to avoid talking to me or speak awfully of me behind my back. She even stopped going over to my fiance’s house and instead chose to alternate living between her aunts/uncles’ homes because of me (this was when she was under 18 and legally under her dad’s care).

At some points, it was so bad that my fiance debated whether he should keep dating me or not, and I really didn’t want to break up with him. 

When she was about 17-19 or so, we got closer. Her dad dragged her to therapy after some behavioral problems/depressive symptoms, and we learned from her therapist that she had a lot of trauma from not having a consistently emotionally available mom figure in her life. 

Because I teach high school, I know how to get along decently with teenagers (am one of the more popular teachers at my HS) and what it’s like to be a 17-19 year old girl from personal experience. I used those experiences to kind of try and force myself and bond with her to be the ""mom"" figure she lacked. I started going to her soccer games, dance shows, and school rallies when she was 16 and a junior in high school. 

I just generally tried to show I cared for her by giving her hugs, listening to her friend/boy drama problems, and buying her things she liked. I think she likes me more now than before--I’m the first person she hugs when she comes back home from college and all that--although she is still closer with her aunts (she grew up under their care because my boyfriend was young when he had her and was in medical school full-time). She planned out a nice Mother's Day celebration for me this year too (explained that she wasn't comfortable doing it before we were engaged). She only came over 3-4 days a week when she was in high school, so it was doable. 

However, now that my fiance and I are engaged and getting married in either 2020 or 2021, I wonder if I would actually be able to handle having her long-term in my life. I feel like such an asshole for kind of faking my bond with my fiance’s daughter, especially when it comes so naturally with my fiance’s son and in light of our impending marriage. I do appreciate that she is pretty, well-liked, resourceful, and smart (attends a college that's Ivy level) but I am not sure if I love her or ever will.

But then he tells me how this woman is 32 and has a daughter that goes to the elementary school our other (younger) brother goes to. 

Naturally I’m concerned for him. This woman is almost double his age and preying on a high schooler. For reference, I’m 25 and thinking of sleeping with someone under 19 actually makes me viscerally ill.

She immediately said yes and seemed quite excited about it although she admitted that she never listened to any of their songs. Still, I'm taking her out for drinks on Friday. But just now, the friend who I asked originally asked if we were still on for the concert. I told her honestly that I already asked another woman, and she seemed disappointed but dropped the subject.

When I told my sister about what happened, she said I'm being really douchy. She says her friend is a huge fan of the singer and I should take her instead of my coworker who doesn't even like the band but only wants to go because she likes me. I said she can't understand because she's not a dude. Because let's me honest, if I had the choice between going out with a girl who only wants to be my ""friend"" versus a girl who is super into me and wants to take things to the next level, then obviously I'm taking the second one. AITA for just being honest about what I want?

**EDIT**: Because a lot of the hang up is over the hotel room thing: YES I would have been fine if the first girl agreed to go with me as a date, but wanted separate hotel beds/rooms. Nowhere do I even say that we have to share a bed...

But the part where she says she’s not ready to date anyone essentially means she is not interested in me. She likely said she’ll go with me as friends just to be nice and not hurt my feelings. So why would I make the experience awkward for the both of us when I could bring along someone who actually is interested in dating me? **EDIT OVER**",10445,19659,0.85
832,Not the A-hole,"I (30M) work using the end-products from my co-worker, let's call her Sammy. When she's unable to do her work, or gets it wrong, I end up being unable to do my work or at least unable to finish it completely because it's missing things from her.

Now, I have the skills to just fill in the missing parts, for example, if she forgets to add an order for our client, I can just do it for her. However, she's relatively new to the job so I figure it's better to tell her she forgot something, and show her how to do it so she won't repeat the mistake later on.

BIG MISTAKE

The interaction is brief, like 5 seconds. This is the first time I've ever corrected her for anything.

Me: Hey Sammy, when we get this request from our client, you have to add this order in.

Sammy: Oh, right...

I hand her the request, she fixes it, and gives it back to me later. No big deal.

Later on, at lunch, my buddy tells me she's been talking shit behind my back. I figure that sucks, screw her then.

Afterwards, she seems to be learning her job well and doesn't make many more errors. The PROBLEM IS she's still talking crap about me behind my back. I have different people telling me to:

1) Leave her alone OR 2) People telling me she's talking crap behind my back.

I go to her and ask if there's anything she wants to say to me. She says no, I ask if she's sure, she says yes, I say alright then.

The shit-talking only intensifies, and apparently I'm harassing her at work now. Drama ensues, only a few people are sticking by me, which kinda makes me sad but at least now I know who I can depend on.

Now comes the day when I see she makes a small mistake but could lead to a large inconvenience for our client. Nothing that would destroy lives but would delay our client's schedule and would make them very unhappy. This mistake went past her, her co-workers, her supervisor, and apparently nobody noticed the problem before it got to me.

So... I send an e-mail to her supervisor about the issue, which is standard protocol but the supervisor is gone for the day and they should (but don't) bother reading their e-mails after they leave.

The next day the client personally shows up and asks about this issue because he arrived in the morning and his people can't get to work because they were missing critical components for their operation.

Our boss smooths things over, gives them a discount on the order, and promises to take care of it himself. The client is satisfied, and leaves with no fuss.

Boss finds out Sammy was the one who made the initial error and fires her, everyone else gets warnings except the supervisor, who said she read my e-mail and was trying to fix the issue. Boss leaves, supervisor thanks me for catching the problem (she probably doesn't realize I could've fixed it myself since it's not actually my job to, and everyone else was too scared to say anything).

833,Asshole,"So my wife took my kids to visit their family in another state. I have jury duty so I had to stay. On Monday their dog passed away. He was pretty old, not sure how old as we got him from a shelter. I didn't tell my kids about it or my wife since they all loved him very much. I even lied to them and told them he was fine when they asked about it. In my head I didn't want to ruin their vacation by telling them that their dog passed away. My wife is very open with the kids and I'm pretty sure she would have told them. They're 5 and 7 so in not sure how well they'd cope.

834,Not the A-hole,"Okay, so long story short, my sister (Kay) has a daughter (Nicole) who I’m crazy about! I love both of them very very much. Kay and I were always really close growing up. We always said we would be close with the other’s child(ren).

Kay is religious and I am not. I’m also an out lesbian and I’m engaged. Kay doesn’t want Nicole to be around homosexuality. Which granted, is crazy because it’s everywhere, but she has a right to parent as she chooses (I guess). 

Nicole is just a little over a year old now, and she adores me. She always smiles when she sees me and always reaches for me. I seriously am crazy about this child. I love her so much.

I’ve been around Nicole from the day she was born, and just now Kay’s husband is always talking about me behind my back. Telling Kay that he doesn’t want Nicole around me. And Kay fought this for a while. But today she’s informed me I will no longer be allowed Nicole at all.

When i asked her “why all of a sudden?”, she said it was because when I saw Nicole last (several of us were helping Kay and her husband build the addition to their house), she had gotten a little sun and was tanned a bit. Someone said something to the effect of “oh Nicole, you’re looking so tan! We need to find you a cute Mexican boy”. Kay said “no Nicole, we will learn in Kindergarten to match colors!” And I looked at Nicole and said in a ‘baby talk tone’, “No Nicole! You can love whomever you want!”
That comment apparently makes me “a bad influence” on Nicole.

Now, all that info to say that I’ve been arguing with Kay all day how it’s garbage and that she’s a racist bigot, and my lifestyle isn’t a choice. I’m just trying to live. And be with the one I love. Who cares what’s between their legs? And Kay has continually been throwing out hateful remarks. So now I’ve been thinking about taking screenshots of the conversations and printing them to put into a folder/album for Nicole to see when she’s older. So she will know that I didn’t stay out of her life by my choice.

Am I the asshole for wanting to do this?

EDIT: for further background, I love my sister. I want to make sure that’s completely clear. I’m sure there’s more going on here than I’m completely aware about (homophobic husband related, probably).

I’m not going to show these to Nicole with “your mother is an evil horrible person”. I would never do that. But it would be with a “I don’t want you to resent your mom. Or be mad at her or anything. But I want you to understand that I never left. I was pushed out.”

EDIT 2: this has kinda blown up. More replies than I ever expected. I feel it needs to be added to the original post my intentions for this.

I kinda worded my intent a little wrong. I’ve been upset all day and have had a terrible time concentrating. Someone said it perfectly. The main plan is to have it in case this ever comes up and I have proof if Kay tries to deny the exchange. In case Nicole dates interracially, or she’s gay. I don’t know what the future holds, but I hope it’s an opportunity to be in her life and have a relationship with her.

EDIT 3: Wow, I now understand “RIP Inbox”. There are several of you on here trying to antagonize by defending racism. You can just keep on scrolling with that bullshit. In no way shape or form is racism okay. If you’re gonna try to justify it, go somewhere.

Thanks for all the advice everyone. I really appreciate the sympathy and love that I’ve received. You guys are making this a little more bearable.

I’ve decided I will likely save the screenshots just to have, but will likely never let another soul see them. I *will* be writing letters for Nicole. Michelle (my other sister) has agreed to pass them along and to also help to make sure Nicole knows who I am.",336,1490,0.94

They offered to pay me $150 for seven days, which is much less than I usually made, but since they’re friends and I needed some money I accepted. 

I was supposed to come by their house last Wednesday to meet the dogs and learn how to care for them, but at the last minute my friends had to cancel for some reason. After that the earliest they could meet was Saturday night, only about one full day before I was supposed to start. 

This is where it got complicated. When I met them on Saturday they told me they expected me to stay overnight with their dogs while they were gone (on an air mattress). I hadn’t expected them to ask that *at all*; their house is almost an hour from the job I work til midnight on weekdays; and I was already making way less than my normal dog sitting price. 

I told them I was very sorry, but if they wanted me to sleep over they should have told me in advance and I would have declined, and since they were leaving in a day I’d still do it, BUT I raised my price to $350, i.e. $50 a day. Needless to say they were quite upset. 

According to them I should have known I’d be asked to stay overnight since that’s what all dog sitters do. They couldn’t afford $350 so we didn’t agree on anything. Luckily they found someone to take care of their dogs - not sure if they boarded them or got another dog sitter - and we haven’t talked since then.

845,Not the A-hole,"Largely generalized for the sake of anonymity, and obligatory mobile warning.

So where I live there is a very large music festival of about 50,000 people lasting two weeks, during those two weeks it is absolute hell to live there.

 I can’t even get out of my house to go to work, because the event security harasses me because I didn’t buy access to the event. I have had to get police involved 7 times in the last 5 years, once ending in a security guard attempting to taze me, and the only reason I wasn’t is because the actual officer drew a gun on him and had him arrested. (These guards are not real cops, they don’t have authority to do shit.)

I have a friend who is a police officer, and he says he has been denied entry into the festival before when somebody called 911 in the festival. 

Extremely loud music literally shaking my walls goes well into the early morning hours, past the legal times here.

Whenever I do manage to get out, getting back in is always way more hassle, either ending with more cops, or leaving to spend the night at a friends place.

So WIBTA for getting this festival shut down completely for these reasons?

Edit 1: referring to comments about permits, they likely do have permits for music, but not permits to lock me out of my home and point tazers at me. To the one comment about detours first of all shouldn’t make my life a pain in the ass and second, yes I am taking detours but checkpoints tend to not let people through without admission.

This problem has gotten a bit better over the years as most repeat workers know me, but the chances I see them are slim to none between different checkpoints and them not returning.

Edit 2: I did not make it clear that this event is currently going on.

I called and got up to the event planner for this, he claims that access passes have been sent to me for every year I have been here, I do not know if this is true or not, but he said if I don’t have them he can deactivate the bands and see who has them. If he has been sending passes, then they have been repeatedly stolen.

This may solve a large problem, but does not excuse the guard drawing on me and getting arrested, and denying emergency services. My best guess is that the festival does not take responsibility for these actions and the guards were blamed and charged for it.

I also asked around and security guards are actually volunteers that are paid with a 1-7 day pass varying between years. This would explain incompetent security. (These volunteers are just checkpoints checking for tickets, the actual event security that makes sure nobody tries to shoot up the place is further up the road from me, I never drove that way and wouldn’t have known.)

Edit 3: Well shit, guess I still had too many details in here, for those that guessed it yes, it is Electric Forest in WM. I was given a pass to get past the security, the ones I was supposed to get in the past years had apparently been repeatedly stolen by someone and I never knew about this.",454,3208,0.94
846,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend was checking his credit card statement recently and noticed a charge that he didn’t recognize.  It was from a company that he’s a customer of, but he hadn’t bought anything through them recently.  He called the company, and they were able to confirm that someone had created an account at their site and used his credit card number to make the purchase.  They closed the other account and said they would refund his money. They also advised that he reach out to his credit card company about the fraud. Easy enough, right?  Nope.  He then demanded that they give him the name/contact info of the other account.

So basically we have a set group of wives/spouses for the office where our husbands work. We know each others personalities, we all have kids, involved in our churches etc. 

Okay so 4/5 months ago 2 newbies got transferred here. 1 guy, 1 girl. That same week we had a charity event I extended the invite to them the girl donated but didn't show, the guy + his wife did. My guy introduces me I liked the guy he seemed very GI Joe clean cut but the wife was...idk kind of like alt/gothy/punk. I make small talk and find out shes not religious (I invited her to church she declined) and child free (idk if thats by choice) but needless to say we didnt vibe. 

So bi weekly girls night comes up I invite new girl but not new wife. I figured I didn't vibe with her and this would give new girl a chance since she missed the event also It was a bowling and the numbers would've been odd. We had a great time and After that we kept the group as it was with the addition of new girl. This came up at a baby shower the last week when new girl asked wife why she never showed to girls nights. She said she didn't even know about it. It got awkward and someone changed subject to baby shower games wife wandered to her guy who was with all the other guys. They were talking guns apparently that's her ""thing"". I figured no harm no foul she found a group to join although it was weird since she was the only girl. 

Later in a group chat One girl asked why I was excluding wife my reasons were as follows: 

We have nothing in common with her
Our group dynamic was awesome as it is 
She Doesn't do church
Doesn't have kids
I pointed out in wasn't trying to be mean just practical.

We all have similar values where wife was pretty obviously on the other team as far as those go. 
New girl isn't married nor does she have kids but she's religious and all around fun. So its not like no babies means no friends but friendship means similar values/ideas etc. 

One of the wives told her guy about the group chat and he invited the couple to a group cookout on Friday. He also told my husband who said I was mean girling and how this would make office interactions awkward as theyre a team. He mentioned her guy has been pretty closed mouthed about outside office stuff and now he gets why he (my guy) was pretty upset. He said he felt like a jackass and He also said he liked her and that if we gave her a chance we would too. My friends are saying they are gonna try and include her in convos to be nice and I'm all for it but said girls nights were still exclusive until we can all discuss it.

He's started eating some foods but mostly just tastes of porridge and fruit and veg etc.

For context, my partner is a meat eater and I'm a vegetarian. I like to think I'm not militant, I don't try to persuade anyone to go veggie. You do you. 

My partner and I had a conversation today about our son progressing to bigger meals. I mentioned that I probably wouldn't be buying meat or products with meat in for him but I have no problem with my partner doing so if he wishes. 

My partner questioned me about this as he feels that I would be encouraging vegetarianism upon our son. He thinks I shouldn't go out of my way to avoid meat and that he needs the nutrients and choice.

From my point of view I'd still be giving my son a varied, nutritional diet - I've done some research and there doesn't seem to be any impact on a child being a full vegetarian, let alone one that would still sometimes have meat. If I'll be cooking meals for myself, it just makes sense for my son to have them too and he can also sometimes have meals with his dad which probably include meat. 

He's too young at this stage to be able to choose which diet to follow or to understand why people do/don't eat meat so why would I go out of my way to encourage meat now? 

If, when he is old enough to choose, he would like to eat meat then I'm absolutely fine with that and will purchase/prepare whatever he likes.

TLDR: I kicked out my brother-in-law for being a slacker and having the inability to own up his mistakes

background: I am the one paying for my brother-in-law's schooling and schooling expenses, me and my wife contemplated on letting him stay/live in our house for the next few years for two major reasons:

•My mother-in-law is verbally abusive, my wife got off easy since she was raised by her grandparents
•Our house is much nearer to the school (30 mins vs. 1hr 45 mins)

During the current summer vacation we have taken him under our wing, but during his stay he has refused to be a significant help in the house (e.g. helping us clean up after a meal would be a great help), playing the PS4 when he is awake, staying in his room locked up while the AC is on, and even not doing his assigned chores (trash duty, since me and my wife leave before the trash pick up comes).

So he crossed the line when during his enrollment he did not follow simple instruction which has costed us 100 USD(equivalent, his tuition fee is around 300 USD for the school year) mind you, we are pretty well off, my only gripe is his inability to follow my very simple instruction, and then when I scolded him, he told my siblings and cousins (through their chat group, we are a super close to my side of the family) that we are always on his ass, that we are always giving him chores, and that we don't give him a break (thanks to my little sis for asking us about the truth of the matter, because of her we found our about the chat group)

When we sent him back to my mother-in-law's house (mutual decision between me and my wife) she has sent us messages regarding money problems and how she can't raise my brother-in-law by herself, and how my wife is a useless daughter who is uncaring for her own brother and mother.

Mind you, we're still on the fence on taking him back on the merit that he will change.

So my partner and I have a pig as a pet. A potbelly pig. We’ve had her for about a year and a half.

We’ve also recently become new parents.

My partner loves this animal but honestly she just stresses me out and causes anxiety for me.

Even the night we picked her up I regretted it and said we need to turn around and give her back.

We had always talked about getting a potbelly and I thought we did some pretty thorough research for years. Just to clarify this wasn’t a random spur of the moment decision.

He convinced me to give it a few weeks to see how it went.

She was ok at first. Adorable of course, what baby animal isn’t?? I’d snuggle with her.

But the noises. Her grunts and squeals are exhausting! And I know she can’t help that, she’s a pig.

I’d walk past her as I cleaned the house and she’ll squeal. She hated anyone being behind her and started to growl and snap at them.

Then I got pregnant last year and my anxiety ramped up

She’s so messy! And it didn’t bother my partner so he wouldn’t clean as constantly as I did and she was one of the main sources of mess. (He does help with chores.)

She also got so big and is so stubborn I cant control her anymore.

She ate through our pantry door one day trying to get to her food and my partner blamed me when I complained about it. Said I spilled the food on the floor and what did I expect a pig to do?

She’s torn up the floor when we moved the food into the garage. She’s torn up the side of house when she wants in but we don’t move fast enough.

I’m worried about when my child starts crawling that she will snap at her. She’s snapped at both me and my partner though they’ll deny it happened to them.

I’ve offered compromises. Said we could foster her until we can afford a house where she can be outside. Honestly we shouldn’t even have her as we are in city limits.

But he doesn’t want to get rid of her. And he is getting so depressed because of this issue. He started crying when I sent him a link about rehoming her. He’s pretty constantly sad thinking about giving her up and I don’t want that at all. I want him to be happy.


He finally said fine we can get rid of her but only if you get rid of our cat that I’ve had for 12 years. I was so desperate I said yes. Luckily a sibling of mine said they’d take her.

I don’t think he was expecting me to say yes and basically caved and said he was bluffing.

I basically broke down last night sobbing because every time I get near her she grunts or squeals. I woke up at 430 am that morning to take care of baby and as soon as I got into the living room she started up again.

It’s driving me crazy!

I pleaded with him that I’ll get rid of my cats, I’ll get him a different less noisy animal, anything!

But he says he doesn’t know why it bothers me so much because it doesn’t bother him. He said if I just pet her more she wouldn’t make noises.

AITA for basically forcing him to get rid of his beloved pet?

(Edit) Just to clarify a few things.  
1. I still have my cats, ultimately I wasn’t going to give them up as a result of this. I was just desperate and said what I thought he wanted to hear.
2. The pig isn’t kept inside all day long and has adequate access to the outside although I do believe she’d be better off at a nice farm.

(Final Edit)

Okay so it seems I’m not a complete asshole in that I’m concerned for my child’s safety. But I do definitely see where I’m the asshole in other ways!

Also I just wanted to say that my husband is a wonderful father and great husband!! This post is the one area basically where we disagree and we have a completely wonderful marriage besides this one issue. I didn’t want y’all to think he was terrible or anything.

Also also a pet is completely different from your child! What the heck y’all? I’m not gonna get rid of my kid ever....",338,512,0.92

I put out the garbage can on the road and when I go bring it in a few hours later it's not actually empty because a few people have thrown their dog cleanup bags into the can post garbage truck.

Don't get me wrong, I love dogs.  We have a cat.  I gush over any pet I come into contact with.  But I don't want to smell dog shit every time I open my garbage can especially when I don't even own a dog!  This is actually a huge part of why we don't have a dog.  As far as I'm concerned, if you make the decision to own a dog you also make a decision to carry around their crap until you get home or until you see a PUBLIC garbage can.

Over many years of living here and actually getting to know her I have grown to really like her. She can still be flirtatious sometimes but I have come to accept that it is just her personality and I trust my BF so its a non issue.

 She comes outside and barbeques, sits and talks to us in our yard on a weekly basis, we follow eachother on social media, we exchange Christmas cards, last year she bought me a birthday present,she keeps an eye on our house/property and vice versa etc etc. I dont really consider us to be like close friends but the relationship falls somewhere  between bring friends and acquaintances. 

Her 40th birthday is approaching and her sister invited us to a surprise birthday party she is throwing but we politely declined because we are going away on vacation. I mentioned to my BF that we should get her a card and a bottle of wine or something because its a milestone birthday. My BF is totally against it.

 He is adamant that we ""shouldn't get too over involved with neighbor's"", ""shouldn't spend unnecessary money"" and that he is sick of ""the neighborly gift exchange"" ( a weird thing to say because we have never given neighbors any gifts though we have received gifts).

I was only planning on spending 25$ and thought it would be a nice gesture since she does spend so much time around us, gave me a gift for my birthday and it is a milestone birthday for her. I can't see why my BF is making it such a big deal and I kind of want to say screw him and do it anyways but I also dont want us fighting over something so trivial.

Naturally everyone's sharing life updates, and I brought along a couple of big ones to the table that I didn't know how to share without them possibly being a little jealous. First that the company I was an early engineer at was successfully acquired and that made me moderately wealthy (lockout period blah blah not withstanding) and that after a couple of years after my divorce I was finally in a steady relationship once more. My girlfriend is somewhat younger than me but not by much (42 to 25) and whatever mistakes I made with my last marriage and relationship, I'm looking to put them aside and do much better with this one. Luckily no kids in the mix.

Unfortunately I felt constantly under attack from a small set of friends and sadly, their family too. Too many robbing the cradle jokes, and how my acquisition apparently had other terms and conditions (referring to my girlfriend being a gold digger). About an hour or so and a few beers in, I just about had enough, and called out a few friends and their wives for being jealous and not being able to share in my success. Which is a shame, because at least the husbands were with me supporting me when my career was tanking and my marriage in the shitter not too long ago. 

I stormed out, created a bit of a scene (only words) and left. The host later called me and told me that what I did was immature and uncalled for, and he wished I had a better sense of humor. I don't know ladies and gentlemen, am I supposed to be forever immune to jokes about how I can afford top quality mail-order brides or whatever now that I've got an extra digit in my bank account or cradle robbing jokes (like how the software at my company might be older than her ... ) forever?

866,Not the A-hole,"My SO and I are expecting our first child, I’m five months along. This  will also be the first grandchild on both sides.
Since the beginning I have said that I wanted to keep the gender a surprise from everyone else once my husband and I find out. The first reason being that everyone I know who has revealed their baby’s gender early on ended up being given an excessive amount of useless gender specific baby outfits that are often not even worn before the baby outgrows them. The second reason is because I want to be the one who picks out my baby’s first clothes. 
I know my friends and family are planning baby showers and gifts and I would prefer to receive practical items and keep the infant formal wear to minimum, (especially because the baby will be born in November giving the grandparents plenty of time to shop cute stuff for Christmas.) My husband originally agreed to this plan and the reason behind it. 
However, both my mother and MIL have complained a lot about keeping the gender a secret. Their reasons are the same, they want to be able to shop for baby clothes and claim they can’t without knowing the gender. We have explained to both of them why we want to keep it a surprise, (my mother called me selfish but that’s a story for another sub).
Now If it were just limited to the mothers whining I could handle it, but now my husband has changed his mind. He is trying to convince me that we should just tell people the gender now that we know. He says that he doesn’t see why we are keeping “everything a secret.” 
AITA for wanting to stick to the plan and keep the gender a surprise?  Does anyone have a suggestion for a compromise?

Edit: I was trying to keep the post short so I didn’t want to write too much, but I am getting some comments about my reasoning. I’m also trying to establish boundaries with them. When we told the grandparents about the pregnancy both of our mothers started competing immediately. Calling dibs on first holidays and making plans as to who will take the kid to Disney world first. Forbidding use of certain names, and suggesting naming the kid after relatives.

I was able to speak with my aunt and my mother a week and a half ago. My aunt was actually still pretty upset about it and my mother still took her side. I explained why exactly I didn’t feel good about giving her Leyla’s social security number. They both told me about how their aunts/uncles had opened accounts for them 40+ years ago for the exact same purpose and they didn’t see anything wrong with it.

After explaining to them that 40 years ago you didn’t have to worry much about someone stealing your identity, let alone before you could eat solid food, they seemed to understand. We ended up working out a compromise - My wife and I opened a bank account which lets both my aunt and my mother make deposits but not withdrawals, nor can they see any details about the account in their online banking portal. Everything seemed to have worked out well.

Yesterday, my mom called and told me her credit card company had called about a several hundred dollar charge from Romania. She had the card cancelled, looked at her credit, saw a totally different credit card had been opened in her name. She said it completely justified my hesitation. Her information was stolen in the Equifax breach a couple of years ago.

He was very angry of course and within the next day or two he broke up with her. The wedding is canceled whether they workout the relationship or not. All her bridesmaids including myself had already purchased our dresses, and come to find out we can not return or get refunded on them (each dress was $250-300). We had a beach trip planned for the Bach party which was close to $500 a person. I was asked by the ""bride"" to consult with all the girls planning on going on the trip to see if we wanted to keep the trip booked or try and  get a refund. Out of all the girls only one was opposed to still going and her reasoning was completely understandable. I then inquired about canceling the trip which i was able to with a cancellation fee of $75. I was pretty upset about finding out we could not return the dresses or get any money back. Its not like a bridesmaid dress is something easy to sell especially without losing any money on it. I asked the bride to pay the cancellation fee for the because i did not think it was fair we were all losing money on our dresses, so why should we lose more money? She was very offended that i asked her to pay so all the girls could get their full refund. We got in an argument over the ordeal and we both said some mean things to each other.

I have been on the cheating side i know what it feels like to make mistakes and feel terrible about yourself all too well! This was also not her first time mistake “cheating” on her man. And she was honest with him about the first time after they got engaged and then when this incident happened she told him right away bc she felt bad for waiting so long the first time. They worked it out the first time and got through it and this time the dude is not okay and wants end it.

876,Not the A-hole,"So long story short, I have suffered a divorce recently. I saw it coming a mile away despite her claims to the opposite, its been over a year now and I have reached the point of just wanting to finally separate her from my 100%. While we were married I realized that she was terrible with money so I kept my account which she had no access to which I used to pay bills and save money, and we had a joint account for her money (which I never touched without permission) which I added to every now and again if she wanted something big IE vacations or something akin to that. 

&#x200B;

A few months after our divorce was finalized I asked her to get her own phone line, and close that account. For the phone I explained in detail I expected her to pay her half of the bill until she could find another service. First month she missed her half I agreed to cover it and she would cover the next in the entirety, another month and she doesn't make the payment, I speak to her about it and she says she is just waiting for a paycheck, two months later and several attempts to communicate, still no payment and they are threatening to shut off my phone...

&#x200B;

So I used our joint account (which had the money and had for weeks) to pay the bill and informed her I did so. Que fireworks. I stated I would not apologize and she should not be surprised that I had access to a bank account with my name on it, and I had warned her it was going to happen if she didn't pay.

&#x200B;

That was the last time I heard her voice over a year ago now (2 years since divorce) and she STILL has not closed the account. I have sent her facebook messages and I have sent her emails with confirmed read/receipt but nothing. She is doing better with cash now and isn't constantly over drafting so maybe she is getting better with it... but I still don't want my name attached to this account. I spoke to the bank about removing my name but they give me the run around saying ""You have to close the account if you want to do that"" because somehow hitting the delete button is beyond their capabilities.   


So now the question.... Its been two years now, she has made 0 progress to close the account and I have learned that the bank will allow me to close the account on my end and the left over money will be available for withdraw in check form at the other end.

I [22M] have been seeing my boyfriend [24M] for two years now. He's great, our relationship is great, his family is mostly great. The exception is his SIL. She never does anything especially mean or cruel, really, she's just...fucking weird. Some examples of her behaviour; 

- My parents are Russian. I have a Russian name. My first name is not an especially common name here in the UK, but it *is* a very well known Russian name and there's a very famous Russian author with my name. Point is, though most people here don't know anyone with my name, most people have encountered it and it's not difficult to spell or pronounce, really. For some reason, SIL has a horrible time of it. She's known me two years, and still insists she's no clue how to spell or say my first name and will either deliberately spell it wrong and cross it out a bunch of times or will just use the Anglicised version. I don't mind the latter hideously, but you understand how that would get annoying. 

- She has a habit of makong really dodgy jokes about people when they're not there. Example: boyfriend's sister has a history of eating problems, for which she's now well in recovery. When I was planning the cake I was making for her birthday, I asked what flavour she preferred and SIL said ""does it matter if she's not gonna keep it down anyway?""

- She doesn't tell lies about huge things that actually matter, but she bullshits about minor, nonsensical things. For example, she told me that she went to a certain bar and got super fucked up on strawberry margaritas. My friend works in said bar and, not only did she say SIL was drinking cider and barely tipsy when she left, they don't even serve strawberry margaritas. 

Like I said. Weird behaviour, and it's starting to get on my wick end, so I've started calling her out on it whenever she does it. Like, if she makes a big deal out of my name I'll say ""come on, I told you this last time did you forget already?"", if she makes one of her sketchy jokes I'll tell her I don't get it and ask her to explain why it's funny and if she says something I know is a lie (e.g. the one above) I'll say something like ""oh that's weird Mandy works there and she said they don't do strawberry margaritas"". I feel like I'm justified in doing this because she's being weird, but a couple of people have told me I should stop because it bothers her and also makes things awkward. AITA? Should I stop? 

TL;DR: bfs SIL pretends she can't spell my name, makes dodgy jokes constantly and lies about arbitrary nonsense. I'm sick of it, so I've started calling her out whenever she does it. Others have said it's awkward and bothers her, but I don't think I should stop.",179,1580,0.96

887,Not the A-hole,"I'm getting married in August. I love my fiancé but my future MIL has the most ""powerful"" personality I've ever encountered and had essentially planned (and to be fair, paid for) the entire wedding. We are getting married at her golf/tennis club in Scottsdale and the numbers she's putting forward are making my head spin because I'm thinking we could buy a house for what she's spending. My wedding is not at all what I wanted but that ship has sailed a long time ago I guess. 

I've lived in Scottsdale my entire life and even went to school in AZ so I have to say up front I don't have a lot of friends other than white people, so I'm probably not very ""woke."" But my first dorm roommate was an African-American girl from the middle of Alabama and we've stayed friends. Last year I went to her wedding and her grandma and aunt catered her wedding with traditional southern soul food and it was maybe the most delicious food I've ever eaten. I always wanted to incorporate somthing similar into my own wedding.

Since I didn't get to pick the food for the wedding since the club is catering, I've pretty much put my foot down that the rehearsal will have soul food. I've found a home soul food catering business and their food is so good and they are happy to cater the dinner. My future sister-in-law is now saying that I'm being culturally insensitive and inappropriatly appropriating my friends culture for my ""100% wypipo"" wedding. She also says that I just don't get it because I've never left AZ and she has a degree from Columbia. 

My mother in law is taking her side of course because she just wants fo have the rehearsal at the club anyways. I want to put my foot down but for the right reasons if that makes sense.

Am I the asshole for wanting fo have soul food at my wedding rehearsal dinner?

Edit: I came here looking for answers on one topic and may have had my eyes opened to another major problem (future husband being so deferential and involved with his mom).

Edit2: I tried to talk with my fiancé many of the legit concerns you guys brought out. He stormed out of my apartment, presumably to his parents house since his mom has called me 38 times and texted me easily 50 ""demanding"" to know what is going on. I'm sooooooooo fucking lost, this isn't how I planned on my day going for sure. I'm dreading what I think has to be done.",600,1172,0.95
888,Not the A-hole,"So yesterday I'd been out for a pub quiz and we decided to stay at my girlfriends place as it was closer. I've stayed there before but only once. We're both pretty exhausted and just say hi to the dogs and go to bed. 

After a few minutes there's a knock on the door. Its her housemate. She says that she feels uncomfortable with men in the house and that she needs at least 24 hours notice to allow it and that she's told the landlord this. No one has ever said anything even the last time I was there when she was also in. She proceedes to say that it's ok now but in the future she'd prefer it so we both remain in bed. 

Another knock on the door and its her saying she's just had a panic attack and called the police and that she's said she doesn't want men in the flat and I have to leave. 

This woman is usually verbally abusive and generally unpleasant and is always walking around the house shouting things. She also takes my girlfriends dogs out without permission which I don't feel like it's ok and one of them was out of the room with a limp so who knows what happened there.

Anyway, I eventually left as I was concerned that my presence would just make things worse and that I wanted to respect her right to not have men in the house. On the other hand I was genuinely concerned for my girlfriends life as this lady is for sure mentally unwell and aggressive.

I stopped this medication for a while and went back on it, and they just haven't bothered to put the warning on it at all. 

A few months ago I started another new medication, and when I picked up the refill last week there was a warning on it that it may cause drowsiness and to be careful when using heavy machinery, and that alcohol and marijuana make it worse.

I know the title sounds terrible, but hear me out. My brother and his girlfriend will be going on vacation in a few weeks and they had asked me if I could go over to the girlfriend’s house once a day to let the dogs out, feed them, walk them, etc. 

The reasons I have to object to going out there are because 1) she lives on a dangerous, winding road to drive at night, 2) I’ll be starting a new job with uncertain hours soon, and 3) I honestly just don’t feel comfortable with the situation in general. 

They told me I’m their only option and if I refused to care for her dogs for the week then she would not be able to go on vacation. I suggested putting them in a kennel or doggie daycare for the time being but the girlfriend thinks it’d be akin to “abandoning” the dogs plus she can’t afford to. 

I put my foot down after multiple attempts from my brother to guilt trip me about this and now both of them refuse to speak to me. I’m willing to compromise if it comes down to it.

This is honestly driving me nuts but I’d appreciate some objective opinions on this. WIBTA if I said no and ultimately put my brother’s girlfriend vacation with him in limbo?

895,Not the A-hole,"So please read everything before putting me on blast.

I recently directed my first short film a few months ago, and my videographer asked me if they could edit  it together for a film credit and experience. I accepted, and we planned a post production timeline together with the producer, sound designer, and SFX editor, starting with the videographer’s portion.  If everything went according to plan,the film would have been fully edited in about a month and a half. It was made this way since I had a study abroad planned and we didn’t want to have to factor in a 11 hour time difference when planning to discuss revisions for cuts.

A week goes by and the videographer misses their first deadline, and they message me asking for an extension so they could study for finals. I’m a student too and I get finals are stressful, so I tell them to put it on the back burner for now, and just go after it once summer starts. Around this time I also get the videographer a production job, filling in for me while I’m abroad.

Summer comes and they miss their second deadline for the first cut. I message them again asking about it and they said that it’s just taking a little bit longer than expected and tell me to expect it in a few days. They miss the third deadline and don’t respond when I reach out. I contact my producer about it and he says he’ll look into it.

About a week passes and neither I, nor my producer have heard from them. At this point I assume that they ghosted the project and I have the producer find a new editor. About a full month has passed at this point, and I have to fly out, making the post-production cycle a lot harder. 

About a week in to my study abroad, my producer told me that he reached the videographer, who had told him they were struggling with mental health issues, which caused them to step away from the project.

Now I understand that it’s not their fault for struggling and I truly am glad that they stepped away and got the help they needed, but I still feel angry that they chose to leave the project without telling anybody, especially when the current state of production hinges on  them. Now, because they ghosted the project without telling anyone, the entire production cycle has become delayed and disorganized since people have flown back home and I’m in a different country, which makes communicating needed changes and revisions more difficult. I’m also worried about how they’re acting filling in for me as well, since I vouched for them to get the position over other candidates. 

When I voiced these complaints to the producer, he told me that we should be more worried about their mental well-being than anything else right now, but I still think I’m justified for being angry. AITA?",69,215,0.95

898,Not the A-hole," 

This is kind of a weird one because I already know I'm an asshole, but I need to know if I'm being an asshole twice. Also, sorry for how long this is.

So my buddy ""T"" has been hooking up with a girl ""L"" for a few weeks. During the second or third time we all hung out together, they had both expressed to me (individually) that they didn't really get along well and that they didn't things going anywhere. It seemed  
odd that they so quickly vented to me about this, but I figured this is how many tinder-relationships go.

Now eventually we started partying with their friends and, a couple times, L had come on to me a tiny bit. I tried brushing these off as random drunk comments.

As of now, T has been out of the country for a week and a half. He has encouraged me to hang out with L despite him being gone and has even encouraged her to get me to trip on mushrooms. This last Saturday, I went to a party with L and she was able to convince me to ""micro dose"" on shrooms. Part of me thought it wasn't a good idea but she assured me that she'd babysit me if need be, and T encouraged it via texts to us. We both took the mushrooms and continuously drank beer throughout the night. When it was time to leave the party, L needed to be walked back home. I was going to go back to my car after walking her home, but she convinced me to stay since I probably wasn't ready to drive.

L suggests drinking more beer and proceeds to put on a movie and go change... into a big shirt that covers just her underwear. My non-sober mind figures it's no biggy but she then asks if it would be weird to cuddle. I said it wouldn't be weird, but I also tend to be very cuddly when under the influence, and to reiterate: we were both drunk and tripping. Unfortunately the cuddling led to kissing and more.

I'm very aware that we fucked up here and that being drunk and high doesn't excuse what we did. However, it was firmly established that L and T were casual, not exclusive, not really into each other, and had not seen long-term potential. Again, this doesn't excuse us doing what we did without at least consulting T first. We both told him about it when we sobered up the following day and we both apologized profusely.

T responded saying that it wasn't a big deal and that although he wouldn't want to continue things with L, he was still great friends with me and hoped to be friends with L. He even told me that it was a bit of a blessing since he wasn't sure how he'd want to end things with L.

Now for some reason, tonight, T decided to send me a venmo request of $250 and claim that I need to make amends for ruining their relationship and cover the costs of what he'd spent on her in terms of food and gas money etc. He also claims that I'm getting off easy.

I certainly know that I fucked up and had even told him that I wouldn't blame him for hating me, but I think that the $250 request is ridiculous.

So AITA for not wanting to pay the $250?",269,1207,0.94
899,Not enough info,"Some context, I (21M) live in a cramped house with my parents and two brothers.

To begin with, he only came to stay with us after an argument broke out with his parents and he got kicked out of his house. We'd agreed the living situation was temporary- maybe a few weeks max, just long enough for his parents to cool off. It was great in the beginning. My parents loved him. He would do chores around the house (moreso than me and my brothers), wouldn't ask for anything, etc. As time went on, I didn't push him to leave because he would say he had no other place to go, and I believed him. Considering the circumstances, especially the lack of space (he would make do by sleeping on my living room couch) in contrast with his lavish tastes, I couldn't see why he'd possibly want to stay any longer than he had to. His job brings in hefty (albeit inconsistent) checks that he would spend on new clothes, shoes, jewellery, ordering food every day, etc.

Having an extra person around has really strained the freedom I have in my house. We had to compromise about when I could have my friends over if he was working in the living room. I had to work around having his friends and girlfriend over at times I didn't really want them there. I would have to ask him in advance to leave if I had plans to hang out downstairs with my girlfriend. For a while, I ignored the red flags. I could tell he was milking it, but at the time he was still my friend. My mental health wasn't all there, and he supported me when nobody else understood what I was going through. So I dealt with all of these things.

Once I'd realized that the situation was getting bad, I thought that he would at least be considerate enough to try to leave as quickly as possible. Boy was I wrong. He would say he was looking for apartments, and that he was moving on some date. Then as it approached he would either extend his deadline or tell me things had fallen through. Eventually the vibe between us completely changed and the situation reached a breaking point. I asked him if sometime soon he could leave for a while so I could spend it with my girlfriend. He replied that he'd see what he could do, but that if he didnt find anything, he wouldnt just go out for no reason. That ticked me off. I mentioned that I'd let him stay with me for a long time. When I began confronting him about it, he flew off the handle. He said that he knew I didnt feel like he was welcome in my house, and called me a narcissist. Worse, my brother (who had overheard the whole thing) defended him and said that whether or not my friend stayed with us wasnt my decision because it wasn't just my house. Now we're not even friends anymore but he's still here.

Tl;dr: My friend moved in with me after getting kicked out of his place. Pretty sure he has enough money (but no intention) to leave. Nobody in my house seems to see a problem with this. I tried confronting him and he said he feels ""unwelcome"" by me.




UPDATE: To add some context, no, he doesn't regularly pay rent, but neither do I and neither does the brother in question. I put a more elaborate explanation about our finances in the comments. About the situation, my parents seem to be fine with it. They don't really care. They enjoy his company. He stays out of their way as much as possible so it doesn't really have any negative effect on them. Once upon a time (a year or so back), they were ready to kick him out because after conflict had came up within a mutual friend group, he said he ""wanted to punch me in the face"" and said other things that were completely uncalled for. He apologized when I saw him next so we made up before they got a chance to, but mind you, they were mad in their own right. They had only let him stay because I'd told them we had made up. Now, I've spoken to them about issues that have similarly been cropping up (him trying to be secretive about talking shit about me and my girlfriend (of many years)'s relationship to a long time mutual friend right in front of us and in my own house (but then having loud, toxic arguments with his own girlfriend in my living room, which we've had the grace not to throw back in his face), pretty much using me and our house despite the fact that he's monetarily well off and always brags about how many thousands of dollars he's made this week, him not pretending to make the pretense of talking to me at all anymore- even before our argument- besides in passing, but blatantly schmoozing my parents, etc.) Not to mention the fact that by this point, he's made up with his own parents. Despite telling them all of this they aren't taking any steps to ensure he has a plan to leave any time soon. They even allowed him to be a part of a family meeting recently, even though one of the topics that my parents mentioned was my and my brother's mental health which I thought was completely inappropriate.",26,91,0.95
900,Not the A-hole,"I'm (23M) spending the summer at my parents' place.

Yesterday I went for lunch with a close friend of mine whom I hadn't met in ages. She gifted me some sweets and chocolates she got from a place she recently visited. They were quite expensive and rare, not even available in the country where I reside. When I got back home, I shared these treats with my parents and they really enjoyed them. I left them in the refrigerator overnight so that they do not get spoilt.

Today I noticed about a third of the sweets had disappeared, which is too large a quantity to just have been consumed during the night. I asked my parents about this and my mom (49F) proudly stated that she'd distributed all of that among some poor homeless kids in our neighbourhood. I was instantly furious that she would do that and I told her that she had no right to give them away as they were mine and I had planned on sharing them with some friends and relatives apart from with the family. She got angry at me stating that there's still a large portion left and that I was an inconsiderate selfish spoilt brat who had no sympathy for poor people. My father wasn't mad at me but was disappointed with my reaction saying I shouldn't be so small-hearted.

Now I would like to make it clear why I was angry at her. It was not due to her act of charity itself but more so because:
        
* I had received the sweets as a gift and they were not my mom's to give away, no matter how much quantity
* They were expensive in value and rare in availability
* I consider myself charitable having consistently donated 10% of my monthly earnings since I was 18 regardless of how much I made, a practice I learnt from my parents
* My mother has a habit of doing stuff like this such as giving away my old items and clothes without asking me because ""I could probably do without them"" and I've told her in the past that I'd like to be asked if I want any of my belongings to be given away
* Recently she has been going overboard in her giveaways ever since her father passed away a few months back; he was well known by his friends and family for going out of his way to help the needy by way of volunteer work and philanthropy. Since his passing I feel my mom has been overly passionate about every little act of charity she does which I understand is her way of coping but in this case I feel it's uncalled for

**TL;DR:** I am infuriated because my mother, without asking me, donated a portion of sweets I'd received as a gift from a friend to homeless kids in our area.

My  adult sister has been living a double life, again! AGAIN. A DECADE ago she moved out for college. She ended up married, pregnant,  living with her then-husband and none of us knew. She was 19 and he was 45. Abusive stalker. My sister didn't contact us for a couple of days so my parents  got worried. Worried ensued, so my parents asked if there was anything I  could do to track her down. I found her real facebook that had all the proof. Wedding pictures and all. Bad ending, but she got away.

&#x200B;

I am  the first one to discover our first bombshell family issue. It broke my  parents heart. Ten years later, it is happening again and I do not know what  to do. I have discovered another double life that she has been living.  She is married, is a mother, and I believe she just gave birth to a  child (additional kid may be product of the husband).

Her lease was coming up on her apartment and car. She claims she moved  into a work friend's house. The house was renovated and owned by her  father. She would only have to pay nominal rent.

She  also claimed that she is able to use her then-work friends vehicle for family holidays and visits. After she surrendered her car, she rolled in this nice SUV w/ retractable foot rails with dealership tags. It was her ''roommates vehicle"".

Today,  the parent's house phone rings. Mom doesn't answer calls she doesn't know. One message  ""Ms. X"" name. Mom didn't recognize X  last name. Mom asks sister to look up the numbers. She claimed they were Indian scam bots.

I tracked #s down to a  local business in the city she lives in. It's a car place and the auto  loan agency literally at the same address.

Her  facebook is the bombshell again.Found recent wedding photos; family photos, new born, everything. I  texted her.

Why did you put the parents house phone number on a credit loan; they called you? I don't have a car

Why did you lie about having a social media? I'm not doing anything.

A couple of of years ago a friend of a friend suggested a job to me. I applied and got it. I have been successfully working there for nearly 2 years.

903,Everyone Sucks,"We went to dinner tonight with my GF Anna and her two best friends, Betty and Carmen, and Carmens husband Chris.  

&#x200B;

Carmen and Chris were 20 minutes late to dinner.  When they arrived, Carmen apologized for being late and said Chris had family that was coming over tomorrow so she was trying to get the house ready.  My GF Anna immediately asked why wasn't Chris doing this?  I thought it was already unfair to assume he wasn't.  Carmen said Chris had went to the gym after work, but when he got home he did help until it was time to go.  Anna quipped, ""You're not his maid.  Its his family, he should be cleaning.""

&#x200B;

Anna is a staunch feminist.  A lot of her identity is encompassed by this.  I'm ecstatic about this because we agree on, and are both enthusiastic about 90% of her feminist values.  I think it would be more ideal if she didn't base a lot of her identity on feminism, but to each their own.  I have also noticed that she only fights for equality in situations that benefit her, not situations in which actually egalitarianize (made up word) the sexes, but it doesn't bother me overall so I don't mention it.

&#x200B;

I thought that it was a bit unfair for Anna to try to embarrass Chris in front of the group.  I pointed out that she doesn't know the ins and outs of their household responsibilities and contributions.  Anna said she didn't need to know that in order to determine Chris was being sexist by going to the gym while his GF was at home cleaning up.  Carmen was in an abusive relationship prior, and Chris gifted her $5k to get out of it and get her own place while she didn't have a job for an entire year before they started dating.  They are now together, but she still doesn't work.  I also know Chris has issues with depression, anxiety, and stress and that getting out of the house and getting a good workout helps.  I find it really hard to believe Chris is not doing his fair share within his household, and I also think its unfair to act like Chris going to the gym is the same thing as him just wasting time.  So after Anna called him sexist, I said, ""There are situations in which some would call you sexist if they didn't know the full story.""

So I finally said, ""You're a feminist of convenience.  If it doesn't favor you, you don't care about it.  If it does favor you, you take advantage of it.""  She called me a liar and demanded examples, so I gave her 2 good ones.  She made excuses as to why they weren't valid, then got pissed off at me for trying to ""call her out"" in front of her friends with my fake reasons.",126,289,0.86
904,Asshole,"Throwaway because my husband uses Reddit. Also sorry for formatting because I’m on mobile. 

So here’s the thing, me and my husband are going on a trip together soon. It’s actually the very first trip we take together. He has a hard, manual labor job and very rarely has time off. And when he does it never matches mine, because I have a regular 9-5 job. 

We are both very excited about our first vacation together, since we didn’t even get to have a honeymoon. Thing is, my husband is insisting in contributing equally to the cost of the trip. 

He comes from a very poor background and is used to pretty much nothing and having to work his ass off his whole life for what he has. 
I admire this very very much, but we don’t live in those conditions anymore. I have a great job and I make really good money, so I am comfortable paying for a large percentage of the trip. 

For a bit of context on the trip: we live in Europe and we are planning on going to a small, European capital. The places I’m looking to book are not ridiculously expensive, just regular b&b’s somewhere in the city, with little to nothing included. Something simple because we don’t really need much. 

On my husbands budget, best we could afford would be something like a hostel with shared rooms and bathrooms. Which is not a bad place, but for a first husband and wife vacation I think I’d like a bit of privacy with him... 

I was thinking in telling him that I got a really good “advance purchase” deal and say that the price was much cheaper than what I am actually paying for. 

I don’t want my husband to feel bad about himself on something has little as money, I understand why he feels like this and that’s why I don’t want to insist in paying and make him feel like “he is living off of me” (his words). He contributes so much to the household and works so hard, I couldn’t care less about who makes more or less money because I know we are both very invested in each other. 

Also, it’s not like I’m putting us in debt or asking for loans. I have more than enough to afford this on my savings account.

All of the cousins got together and planned the performance 3 weeks ago (MG decided not to show up) and everyone just needed to learn their parts (mind that MG’s mother said she wouldn’t be dancing because she is 6 m pregnant now). 

So today we were suppose to meet and put it together. MG decided to change the list and put herself in the front of the group, push me to the back and take most of my part out. I was upset between work and school i barely have time to practice the dance moves and learn the lyrics of the songs. So i said “okay you guys changed it but the day it was changed two weeks ago or whenever you could have messaged me and let me known at least” they started getting upset saying “who cares it’s just a performance just do it”. I said “i won’t be doing anything different besides from the list that was made when MG was not here and she is pregnant she needs to be careful. “

Then MG begins to show me attitude and she started to say “You should know your place and that we aren’t changing anything” So i said “Why don’t we just split it and have equal turns where you’re in the front half the time and then i am for the other half”.

 She then started saying “You’re acting childish and I don’t want to dance anymore” and I got frustrated i’m saying “Why can’t we just compromise and work together 50/50”, then she scoffs and says “Wipe that look off your face before i wreck it” i was astonished and said “No need to say you’re gonna wreck my face calm down” then she says “Don’t tell me to calm down I have so much dirt on you so shut the f**k up before i expose you bitch” knowing well enough she doesn’t have anything.

 At that point i’m like “Okay expose me let’s go” and she goes “Let me f**king wreck your face first” and after all that I got agitated and said “Alright come at me” by that point everyone told us to calm down. Even though i was speaking in a calm voice up until i said let’s go. 

Our aunt then said sit down and talk your differences out and she begins to say “I’m literally shaking right now you got all up in my face i won’t ever be speaking to you again”. I’m shocked and i say “I am willing to speak to you there’s no need to be scared i just want a compromise in the first place” as i stepped one foot forward, she says “ Step back I’m scared”.  At that point i just go quiet and hope no one thinks i’m a bad person because i just wanted to enjoy the wedding as a Family


So AITA for trying to stand up for myself and not let her push me out anymore like from other functions while the pre festivities are happening at my cousins wedding...?",37,38,0.84
906,Asshole,"Male, 31 here. For the past 15 years, I’ve been dealing with a medical condition that requires constant medication and consistent doctor’s visits. I had always been projected to live until 50-60ish, however, a recent complication has cut that down to 12 months, 16 at best. In about 10 months, my condition should start getting a lot worse. After 12 months, I’ll essentially be living in the hospital.

I am married of 4 years (no kids). I haven’t had the heart to tell my wife the news. I don’t even know how. We always knew I’d die younger than I wanted to, but we never expected it to be this soon.

As much as I know I should tell my wife, I don’t want my last year to be plagued with an impending doom.

My wife and I have always talked about living abroad somewhere, maybe Australia, but we’ve never found the time or money to do so. I’ve been saving up to go to graduate school, however, I don’t see much point in that now.

So here’s my idea: take some of that money, and take my wife to Australia for a few months, and enjoy the time together. I have a job I can work remotely from anywhere, and she has a job that she can easily find work anywhere. We can work part-time, and enjoy our time together. When we get back, or maybe towards the end of it, I will break the news to her. I just wouldn’t want the trip to be ruined for us by constant reminders of me dying. I know my wife, and she’s very emotional - to the point where I feel like she will be crying everyday and not enjoying herself. I want this memory to be a good one for her, and not plagued by my time ticking down.

AITA for putting off telling her I am dying?

Note: I have life insurance that will take care of her, so I am not too worried about spending this money now on this trip. And I plan on talking to her about a sperm bank, just in case she decides she wants my kids in the future, as well as premised birthday cards and other things for her to have.",743,7772,0.97
907,Not the A-hole,"This happened a while ago. My friends went inside a fancy bakery to buy something and I decided to go in with then to see what they were offering (even though I had no intention of buying anything). I was just having a look at the cookies (they looked delicious), minding my own business, when the worker there asks me if I want a free cookie. Ofcourse, I was surprised since these cookies are $4 each but I couldn't say no to free cookie.

The worker asked me to choose a cookie from their selection. I picked one and they put it in a bag and gave it to me. I was caught off guard when they followed up with ""what cookie would you like to buy?"". At this point I didn't know whether to just say no and look really bad after accepting a free cookie, or to just bite the bullet and buy one (im a broke  student). I chose the latter and just hesitantly picked a random cookie to buy.

I felt like they used sneaky tactics to pressure me into buying something I didn't want and i was kind of upset about that. I've always wondered if I was in the wrong for taking the free cookie in the first place, or should I have just said no to buying one after they gave me a free cookie?",42,108,0.94

909,Not the A-hole,"So my girlfriend (31F) and I (34M) recently got engaged. We've been dating for about three years and with me moving to the midwest from the west coast for employment, a decision had to be made on whether or not we should take things a step forward. After talking about marriage she said would be open to a longer engagement period before tying the knot to be sure the new life in a different place didn't change things for the worse. Between her saying this and moving we decided to take a vacation abroad to take advantage of the free time I had between jobs.

&#x200B;

After travelling for a week she told me she was surprised I hadn't already asked her on the trip. I think with all of the challenges of travelling in a different country she had really warmed up to how well we worked together when times got tough. I told her I was going to wait until we were moved and were settled in before asking, but she told me she would be ready much sooner than that, as in any time I thought was good was good enough for her. I was ecstatic that she had changed her mind to move things up and started thinking about what I could plan in the next few weeks that would be special.

&#x200B;

Her job needed her to come back to work sooner than I needed to come back so she flew back while I stayed abroad to have my Dad come out for a week to do some father-son travelling. I knew that when I got back, I would only have a couple days with her since I had a specific date to start my job while she would be staying behind for 6 weeks to train her replacement. In the end of things, I only had 2 days to make it happen. I purchased a ring and made a plan to propose in a place that was beautiful and had at lease some personal significance behind it. On the night before I left to travel across the country I got down on one knee and proposed and she said yes!

&#x200B;

Shortly after she started talking about me proposing again. I had never heard of anyone doing this so I asked why she wanted to do it and she replied, ""because it would be sweet."" I told her that proposals were kind of a one time thing and it's not really a special moment if we set it all up and do it again. She said that she didn't remember what I said, which I said hurt a little bit, and would like to do it again so she can remember it better and it would still be special. She also suggested I do the second one in front of her family (who is extremely important to her) although they already know we're engaged. I told her the whole thing makes me feel awkward and I definitely don't want to propose again. I told her to ask anyone in her family if they think it's a good idea. She says it's not a big deal and I should do it to be sweet.

Is this a thing people do? A second proposal? AITA for telling her I don't want to do it?",127,229,0.95
910,Not the A-hole,"My husband NEVER charges his phone.  If I have to reach him during the day, I just can’t.  He gives people my phone number if they need to reach him.  Sometimes I need to reach him (sick child at school, etc.). Sometimes he is home while I am at work.  So I always try his phone first (never charged).  Then sometimes I drop in on one of the Alexas in the house or the Furbo dog camera.  I usually just say, “Hi husband, give me a call when you get a chance.”  Today,  I knew our daughter was having friends over and wanted to discuss those plans since he was to be in charge at home.  Called the phone, phone is dead.  I figured he was on his computer, so I sent a video message to his computer.  He called me back, and boy was he pissed.  He said he was sick of me spying on him with all of my cameras.  He went on at some length about me spying on him.  I’m not.  I don’t give a shit what he does at home.  Anyway he was so mean to me on the phone that I cried for about 15 minutes.  Then when I got home it continued.  Him yelling at me about spying on him.  I’m really not.  I’m just trying to get in touch with him however I can because he refuses to charge his phone.  I’m still upset about him yelling at me, crying on and off all afternoon.  Anyway thanks for reading.
EDIT:  Just to be clear, I ONLY contact him if I have to:  e.g., sick child, after school plans, flat tire.  I’m not calling him excessively or spying on him.  I don’t need to spy on him.  He sleeps, eats and watches TV.",2556,11342,0.92
911,Not the A-hole,"Our apartment previously only had 1 couch. Room enough for 1 person to lay down on, or 2 to sit upright on. My current roommate bought it from a previous roommate when he moved in. This and a coffee table he got for free from a friend are the only contributions he’s made to the shared living space. (I furnished everything else, dining set, kitchenware, lamps, tables, shelves, pantry, TV) Current roommate has a habit of spending almost all of his time at home on the couch laying down watching TV. If I were to join him I would have to sit on a separate seat 25% of the time. I got tired of never watching TV on my own TV while he was home, so I bought another couch. He helped me move it in cause he’s a pretty good guy. But now he doesn’t use the old couch. He lays down almost exclusively on the new one I bought. Am I an asshole for telling him to move from the seat I want to sit in because I bought it? I never have asked him to move from the couch when we only had 1 and I feel weird asking him to do it now. I legitimately don’t think he knows it bothers me.

912,Asshole,"So the other day I was watching TV with my mom and glanced over her shoulder at her phone. Some of the words on the screen immediately caught my eye. She was scrolling through an email chain and didn't notice me looking. Upon closer inspection, I realized two things:

1. The email chain was *extremely* sexually explicit, with her having sent a wall of text describing exactly what kind of sex she wanted to be having with the guy she was emailing.
2. The email she was exchanging these messages with is not my dad's email. It is a different man's name (e.g. my dad's name is John Smith and my mom is emailing Lucas Baxter - it's not even close).

I later borrowed her phone and surreptitiously forwarded the emails to myself, than deleted the evidence that I had forwarded them (and yes, I know snooping is definitely an asshole move - that's not what I'm asking about). 

Now that I have the emails, I can see that they are clearly my mother actively cheating on my father if he isn't aware of the situation, given the sexual nature of the emails and the fact that the most recent ones (that I have on my phone) were sent just yesterday. Of course, my dad might know all about it, and they might have an open relationship without me knowing, or this is some sort of RP thing, but I can't really find that out without asking one or both of them anyway.

My first instinct was to let my dad know, but a friend advised me that I should talk to my mom first and give her a chance to explain. I'm worried about doing this both because she might lie and try to cover up the situation if she really is cheating, and also because my mom and I have had a very turbulent relationship in the past and even if I try to confront her gently, she might blow up. 

Another friend suggested I should keep it to myself and let my dad find out (or not) in his own time and not ruin my parents' marriage, but that just seems morally wrong to me.

913,Not the A-hole,"WIBTA I’m new to reddit so not sure if format is right. I’m in my twenties and live with my parents. My older sister has an 8-year old, works weird hours, and the dad only sees her once a week if anything. So, my parents often take care of her. She used to sleep in their bedroom on the floor but they got her a smart tv for Christmas to put in my sisters old room.   To put this a little in perspective I was one of four shared a room with my other sister and never had a tv in my room neither did my siblings. Back to the point, I have trouble falling asleep at night. I know I’m being a baby but I check my closet and under the bed, then I close my bedroom door before I go to sleep and will put something lighthearted on YouTube to fall asleep to. Tonight my mom asked me if it was ok if I kept my door open. She did this while I was downstairs. I came up to tell her why it would make me uncomfortable and she was with my niece so I couldn’t really explain. I stared getting upset and told my dad who said not to worry about it and just close the door. I feel like I’m an asshole because I’m in my 20s and should grow up but I also feel like it’s unfair for my mom to make me feel scared while going to sleep just to condone an 8year old who’ve in my opinion should be able to go to sleep by themselves. Am I an asshole?                                

Edit: for clarity I should’ve said I feel more comfortable checking my room. I’m a pretty light sleeper and get sleep paralysis if my sleeping situation is changed. It’s not a situation where I’m scared of monsters but more of a fear of waking up in the middle of the night. But I can definitely see that from nieces perspective now. Ty

914,Not the A-hole,"I am pregnant and due to delivery in November - right at the start of flu season.   

My husband’s parents don’t believe in the flu shot - claim it makes them get the flu. I am in the health care field and know this is absolutely not true and that it is just an immune response but they refuse to listen.  I know my mother in law is also long over due for her tetanus booster which also contains the pertussis vaccine and doesn’t get it because she’s scared  of going to the doctor due to unaddressed anxiety.   

My husband’s sister and brother have also refused to get their flu and tetanus/pertussis booster shots when other more distant relatives had  babies and chose not to visit the baby. 

  I used to work in a pediatric hospital and don’t want my baby to be like so many that were admitted for flu and pertussis. My baby will be too young to be vaccinated this season so I have to rely on herd immunity. The herd (our family) doesn’t seem to take this seriously.

My daughter was confirmed about a year ago. I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all.

916,Not the A-hole," Gonna try to make this short. My sister and I were never close growing up. When we were children, I would always ask to play or hang out with her and she would cry and say she didn’t want to. When we were teens, she would never want to spend any time together. She’d never go to any of my games (despite the fact that I had to pick her up and subsequently went to her all of her track meets). We just never hung out and anytime I’d reach out, she’d always pass or make an excuse or just say no. 

She’s now 18 and got accepted to the college I’m going to (I’m going to be a junior). I’m not living at home this summer, but I’ve noticed that she’s been trying to text me or call me a lot more. She’d ask for advice about college or just start random conversations, but to be honest I’ve had no interest in responding with nothing but short phrases. 

Finally she asked what’s up and how come I didn’t really seem excited about going to school together and I just said she never really seemed to have a relationship growing up, I don’t see why have one now. She said I was being ridiculous and she was just a teenager and I told her that she really hurt me growing up (I have mild aspergers and didn’t have many friends as it was) and I was not interested in being friends or having anything other than a regular cordial relationship. 

She said I needed to grow up and a few minutes later, my mom called me and basically asked why I was being an asshole to my sister. I’m not; I’m treating her the same as she treated me all those years. Am I really being unreasonable?",908,2425,0.96

918,No A-holes here,"Throwaway because me and my wife are both avid users of Reddit, and she knows my account.

Anyways, a bit of background first: my daughter is 7 years old and currently in elementary school, and also currently attending their summer school program. At her school, there are these things called ""(school name) Prizes"", which are given whenever a student does something outstandingly kind, helpful, etc. They are cashed in at the office to win candies and such.

My daughter gets these prizes a good few times a month, I'd say 1-3 times. In addition to school given candy, me and my wife often buy her small treats like toys or milkshakes, to encourage her to do nice things and all that. It's been a tradition of sorts to her. 

Anyway, as of late, we've been putting together money to move to a nicer apartment. Both of us make decent pay, but we've both mutually decided that we will have to cut a few monthly expenses here and there to be able to pay for said apartment. Today, my daughter brought home a prize from her day at school, and had a very specific request: she wanted to go to Target and get a Unicorn stuffed animal. I know exactly what she's talking about, and the stuffed animal is around seven dollars. It isn't much compared to the apartment, but things do add up.

I told her sorry, we can't, and drive her home instead. Crying ensues. When we get home, she tearfully tells my wife about me not getting her a unicorn. Wife gets mad at me. Wife is currently still mad at me, and tells me that I should have bought the unicorn.

My ex-wife cheated on me throughout our marriage and I only found out four years in. I guess I was one of four suitors and when we got married, she didn't split ties with any of them.

I have my girl every weekend, starting at Saturday at noon and ending Monday 8am or so when I drop her off at daycare. Sometimes I'm asked to take over Friday afternoons, though, and I learned this uptick in Fridays is due to my ex-wife trying to date.

Am I the asshole for refusing Fridays because it puts a damper on her plans? She goes on dates almost every Friday now.

921,Asshole,"I'm a 27-year-old guy.  My parents had been happily married for 25-30 years when my dad died on June 20, 2018.  At some point this past spring, my mom (52) started dating a guy (37) from work.  She talks about him a lot, and while things seem to be moving surprisingly quickly between them, it's not my place to say what she can and can't do with her life, and ultimately I want her to be happy.

Several weeks ago she mentioned to him that I enjoy target shooting as a hobby.  Apparently he immediately went out and bought a gun despite having no prior experience with firearms.  I thought this was a little weird, but whatever, everyone has to start somewhere.

However, last week my mom told me that he introduced her to marijuana, which is still illegal for recreational use in our state.  She said that they ""only"" use it about three times per week, which seems like a lot to me, but again, it's not really any of my business.  The problem is that I've purchased enough guns to know that the following question appears on the form when you buy one:

> Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?

Lying on this form is a felony, and as a lawful gun owner with a license to carry, it bothers me that he committed a crime like this, even though it's unlikely that the police will ever find out about it.  And not only did he break the law while buying the gun, but he's also continuing to break the law simply by possessing it per the ATF:

> Therefore, any person who uses or is addicted to marijuana, regardless of whether his or her State has passed legislation authorizing marijuana use for medicinal purposes, is an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance, and is prohibited by Federal law from possessing firearms or ammunition.

My mom has been asking me to meet him.  My younger brother immediately refused because he doesn't want to see my mom with anyone other than my dad, and I could tell that she was upset by that.  I don't particularly want to be friends with this guy either, but I was planning to suck it up and do it for her because I love my mom and treasure my relationship with her.  But after she told me about the marijuana, I just don't know if I can respect him as a person.

**I want to be crystal clear that I have nothing against recreational marijuana use in and of itself.**  In fact, I wish the government would hurry up and legalize it at the federal level so I can start using it occasionally too.  What bothers me is that he committed a felony by lying on his 4473, and it's hard to see my mom with a criminal (regardless of whether he's been charged), let alone welcome him into my life.

We still saw each other and our marriage continued. I wasn't happy about the choice but I supported her because I know what her father meant to her.

I tried to tell her that her father wouldn't want her to be living like this and it was time for her to move on. I recommended we take some of her inheritance and use it to go on a vacation somewhere maybe it would cheer her up but she got extremely upset and accused me of wanting just caring about the money she inherited.

Well my roommate got a full time job about four months ago and is still collecting food stamps. He never told the office that he got a job because he would surely lose his monthly stipend. He even tried to talk me into doing the same thing he did. I told him no way I'm not that stupid.

Would I be the asshole if I called up the department of economic security and told them he has had a job for months and is intentionally not notifying them just to get free money?

Edit 1: the roommate makes  $750 every two weeks for a total of $1500 a month. His monthly bills consist of $240 (rent) and $30 (phone) for a total of $270, leaving him with  $1230 to buy what ever he needs.

Edit 2: I should mention my reason for considering this in the first place. My roommate started a passive aggressive war when we moved in together. I have done my best not to get involved, but this last weekend he upped his ante. At this point I'm ready to drop the bomb and end it, but in all actually it would probably only make things worse. Which leads me to edit 3.

Edit 3: I'm not going to report him because after reading all of your replies I've realized he will inevitably get caught come tax time. The fight has already been won.",114,62,0.8

929,Not the A-hole,"I’ve had a shit day. It started with sister’s two thirteen year old friends, A and B, walking in on me changing. They wanted to hold my pet rats, and I had to explicitly tell them to get out because I didn’t have pants on. Do parents not teach kids to respect others’ privacy anymore? Oddly enough, I (18 M) don’t feel comfortable having young girls watch me change.

Later on that day, my sister brought over another friend, we’ll call him C. B straight up said to C “Yeah, they have cleaners come every Wednesday and look how gross their house is already.” This had me LIVID. My house isn’t very clean, because I’m the one taking care of a five person household while my mother is bed ridden and my father works 80hr weeks. I almost told them to be more respectful then, but I had to go take care of my mom.

Then, maybe half an hour later, I hear laughing and yelling from my room, and my sister yells “A rat is dead!” I go upstairs and see my sister and her friends all laughing while poking my dead pet rat. After I took the rat out to check on it (Yes, very dead. She was the runt of the litter and had been sick for a few days), they all fucked off and my sister left me to handle our dead pet, while insisting I give it a proper burial instead of throwing it away like I had planned. (It’s a rat. You clearly don’t care about it and don’t take care of it, so how about you either bury it or let me handle it how I please?)

I’m planning that next time she plans to have them over she either has to tell them to be more respectful or I will, and that if they don’t change their behavior they will no longer be welcome in our home.

I don’t think I would be the asshole here, but I knowing if strangers on the internet agree with me would be very helpful in standing strong against my sister’s inevitable bitch fit when I tell her this. So, Reddit, WIBTA?",15,34,0.93
930,Not the A-hole,"Background: My uncle has a nasty temper and is verbally abusive, his yelling and berating me caused me to struggle with my self esteem throughout my life. His wife isn't any better, nor are his kids. They allowed them bully me throughout my childhood: I have cerebral palsy, and while it's not really obvious now, when I was a kid I had a speech impediment and I walked like a baby deer. He let his kids call me things like ret\*\*ed and Bambi. When I turned 18, I had a falling out with all of them. I don't remember exactly what triggered it, but the end result was me calling my aunt & uncle abusive and saying they should be ashamed of themselves--in front of several dozen friends and family at a BBQ. It went about as well as one would expect. They said I wasn't allowed at anymore gatherings or anything until I apologized to them. I told them that they owed me an apology for years of bullying. 

&#x200B;

My mom has maintained a relationship with my aunt and uncle, and has held onto hope at our reconciliation. As of current, neither party has ever been willing to apologize. The difference being that I'm respectful to them but I don't care and I've moved on, and  they can't seem to keep my name out of their mouths, and they try to stir up drama with the situation however they can. My aunt has actually texted me several times asking me to apologize to her, but not apologizing herself. I've ignored them. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward: About a month ago, my mom ran into aunt and they got to talking. My mom ended up inviting my aunt and uncle to my wedding. She tells me it's important to her, it's her brother, blah blah blah, I'm a little annoyed but whatever, I tell her that's fine. 

So the day of my wedding roles around. Ceremony was beautiful, get to the reception and my husband and I are walking around to the tables greeting our guests. We get to my aunt and uncle's table. I greet them warmly and thank them for coming, like I said, I'm polite to them, I'm not trying to stir up shit--especially not at my own wedding. My aunt looks at me and says loudly ""Seems a little fake of you to be so cheerful to us. If you really feel that way, it would be nice to have an apology for what you said at the BBQ to Bob and I, it was very out of line and very hurtful."" and then she looks at me and then looks around the table at other family members seated. I looked at her dead in the eyes and very quietly said ""Auntie, y'all gotta go"" and my husband and his best man escorted them out. They didn't leave quietly, they wanted to dig through the pile to find their gift, they tried to triangulate my mom to let them stay, it was ugly. My aunt started crying. 

&#x200B;

People are saying she shouldn't have said that but we should have just let it go. But I felt like she wasn't going to stop there, I didn't want her there to begin with especially not spreading drama. I just didn't want to deal. Her invitation was precarious, and she ruined it herself imo.",343,1362,0.98
931,Not the A-hole,"Before you ask, no, I’m not kidding, she’s 45 and is living in our furnished basement. Anyway...

I remarried around a year ago. She had a then 44-year-old daughter, who was living in her house. It hasn’t changed. Why is she living here rent-free at 45, you might ask? Because she’s a part-time freelancer. Meaning that she spends two hours a day on making charm bracelets that cost $5. You’re probably asking, you’re exaggerating, right? Well, yes I am. She usually spends four hours on week days and zero on weekends. So on average, almost 3 hours per day.

I wouldn’t even ask here, but I have a 21-year-old who lives with us, also rent-free. In my opinion, there’s a major difference. My daughter works during the summer, 12 hours a day (including weekends), in order to pay off her student loans (she’s on her way to law school). Even with that alone, she works 4 times as much as my stepdaughter does. Also, she’s had 3 years. Her stepsister had 27. (Counting since they were 18.)

I’m worried that I’m not being supportive enough, and that “I’m expecting wayyyyy too much” (from my sister-in-law). On one hand, she had student loan debt that took a lot of time to pay off. On the other hand, it’s her fault for getting a degree that she never needed, and for working 20 hours a week to pay off. Not to be unsupportive, but did she really need a degree to make charm bracelets? F***ing charm bracelets?  Then again, I’m might very well be “not supportive enough”, considering what I just typed.

I’m also concerned that because it’s her house, maybe I shouldn’t ask her to kick someone out of her own home. On the other hand, I’m paying my share of the bills, and her daughter is draining her finances (we have separate accounts).  If she continues, she might not be able to retire by 80, which is rather concerning. In order to afford it, she will have to downsize consideringly. I mean her living in a one-bedroom apartment. Which means that she’ll have to kick her daughter, unless they’re going to share a room. Even then, her daughter would have to pay her share of bills, which mean that she’ll have to get a more well-paying job.

933,Not the A-hole,"I work in a certain tech company on West Coast in the USA, which recently made me go through some mandatory trainings, just routine stuff.

In one of the trainings (I forgot the exact title of it) it explained what Export Controls are, and then went into detail that an employee is not supposed to share info with other persons from specific countries until they have an ""Export license"" documentation. Even employees working for the same company.

I talked with my manager, and told him I was under the impression that the company would take care of all this, so that I can freely interact with fellow employees. However, he admitted that due to liability and legal reasons, the employee too was responsible for checking this.

Now the moment in the title. We were in a meeting, and my Russian colleague was present, and I remembered Russia was one of the countries marked under Export Control. So I asked him if he had the necessary docs (not to show them to me, just an affirmation would've sufficed), but he got offended and told me it's not my place etc. My manager was present too, and he didn't say anything, didn't support me nor support him. I told the colleague okay, then I can't present my data in this meeting. He seemed really offended and took off from the room.

935,Not the A-hole,"MY BACKGROUND:

I'm 31M, only recently found a career (almost 100K/year). Prior to this, I graduated university with horrible grades, did some odd part-time, or dead-end full-time jobs here and there (think minimum wage like Wal-Mart), am a virgin (I don't advertise this), never had a girlfriend before, and I'm balding (Dad's side of the family is almost all bald). I don't have a lot of friends, and I mostly stay inside the house outside of work, only occasionally seeing friends on the weekend. I am an introvert.

I live with my parents, I'm saving a TON of money (I do pay rent, expenses, and broken appliances like if we need a new washing machine), and after recently discovering day trading (stock markets), I am making money hand over fist. I work a full-time job, and pay my taxes. My Mom and Dad do cook/buy meals for me. My mom does the laundry, cleaning, etc. My life currently involves going to work, coming home, playing games online with friends/co-workers, eat, sleep. Rinse/repeat.

INCIDENT:

So it's my sister's baby's (my nephew's) first birthday, and our family (aunts/uncles/etc) are invited to a backyard BBQ to celebrate. My sister, brother-in-law, my parents, and a couple of aunts/uncles are eating around a table when one of my nosy aunts ask when I'm going to get married.

I say ""Probably never, it's not for me"". Cue the awkward silence or muted gasps from everyone. My sister chimes in and says, ""Well now that you're making so much money, you can actually afford a girlfriend now"".

Me: If a girlfriend can be afforded, then she's not going to be my girlfriend.

Sister: So what else are you gonna use your money for?

Me: Literally anything else I want.

Sister: You're so childish. When are you going to grow up, man up, and start acting like an adult?

Me: It's childish of you to assume everybody wants to live like you do. If you can't accept people can live different lives, then you're just immature.

Sister: Who *wouldn't* wanna live like me? (she gestures to the giant house, luxuries etc. My sister doesn't make a lot of money, but she married my bro-in-law who comes from an obscenely wealthy family)

Me: If I wanna be a kid forever, that's my choice. It's my money, my life, my decision. What are you gonna do about it? Whine some more?

She just stares coldly at me and I can tell my family doesn't like what I'm saying, but I don't care. I just sit there and enjoy my meal.

AITA for Telling My Family I Wanna Be a Kid Forever?

&#x200B;

EDIT: A lot of people are telling me to move out. Why? Parents want me to stay, they've never even hinted at wanting me to move out, housing prices are INSANE where I live, and WHY would I pay rent to a stranger as opposed to my own parents?

Now if you are extremely wealthy and can afford your own place, or you would rather give money to a stranger than your own family, sure, go for it.

&#x200B;

EDIT numero Deux: Talked it out with my folks (we're traditional Asian, living in North America) about whether they wanted me to move out. My Dad said I was stupid for wanting to pay more rent to a stranger and my mom said I should save up to buy my own house so I wouldn't be 'paying other people's mortgages'.

My parents clearly love me and my eyes have been opened by the people of Reddit. I know in America it's expected for a kid to hit 18 and just find a job and pay for their own way but wages just haven't caught up to costs of living.

A lot of people assumed I was mooching off my parents, which is fair, since I can only fit so much in this post, but I suppose I'll just have to live with opinions from people without the whole picture. In your opinions, I am the asshole. /bows",720,1712,0.91
936,Asshole,"My daughter’s been back from college for a month. Frankly, she has not been doing anything. I told her that she should get a job over the summer because we all have to work to make a living. Moreover, she’s 18, so we’re not obligated to support her anymore. While she has been taking a summer English class and has gotten A’s on her first few papers, she has said that the class doesn’t interest her, especially the Shakespeare part.

I am getting really pissed off because I think she’s acting spoiled, lazy and entitled. She isn’t getting a job and she is not engaging enough in her classes. Last night, she was lying down on her bed texting instead of writing her essay, and when I asked her what she was doing, she said that she was tired.

I told her that if she was tired, she needed to see a doctor. She didn’t really reply to that, so I told her that she frankly was not doing enough to accomplish her goals--she wants to be a doctor, yet got a B in organic chemistry, and asked her what she would do if she didn’t graduate from Berkeley. I was expecting my daughter to review material for her next organic chemistry class and told her she would never be a doctor if she didn’t step it up in her science classes (her GPA is about a 3.67 or so, and her science GPA is a 3.5). 

She later locked herself in the bathroom, and I knocked on the door multiple times to tell her to get out because I knew she was texting her friends in there to complain about me or ask for “comfort.” My wife even asked if my daughter was sending an email to a teacher/other adult to do something similar about the situation: bitch about us as her parents and ask for support. My wife didn’t really take sides--she didn’t defend my daughter but didn’t stand by me either. 

It has been a pretty stressful time for us: my wife’s mom is very sick despite having around the clock care at a nursing home and I am a research scientist trying to get a proposal together for funding--lately it hasn’t been working out.

Perhaps I should not have taken that out on my kid, but even if my research were going better, I would still be angry at her for not working productively towards her goals and complaining about her English class. AITA?",164,117,0.73
937,Not the A-hole,"I have a friend (who we'll call Joan) who occasionally makes snide remarks that ""belittle"" me and my lifestyle: I'm not sure whether Joan's comments are malicious or just indicative of her being naive. Joan comes from a ""different culture"" since she's an international student, but our ethnicity is the same; they also come from a wealthier background though she often acts like she comes from a more moderate background (which she usually makes a big deal of.)  Also, some friends of mine agree that she's not super self-aware and is a little bit ignorant, but sometimes, I feel like its more of an act.

We're in an organization together and I host a lot of get-togethers at my place, which she's invited to because she's part of the org. Every time she comes over she makes some public remark about me/my place/lifestyle in front of the whole group that I feel like attacks me. (e.g. ""Your closet is so tiny,"" or ""When was the last time you washed the sofa covers?"" or ""What is that smell?"") I always feel a little flustered and don't really know how to respond with humor/lighten up the verbal ""attack"" but I don't visibly get annoyed, esp. with a lot of other people around.

Anyways, the last time I hosted something, I told Joan beforehand something along the lines of: ""Sometimes your comments are a little embarrassing, and I'd prefer if you didn't share them in a group setting.""

938,Not the A-hole,"So it’s a friends 21st birthday and another friend and I wanted to take her out to eat. My other friend, let’s call her May, wanted to take her out for drinks. Since I’m under 21 I was selfish and said no, I don’t want to pay for drinks if I’m not drinking. I also didn’t want to be a babysitter. I explained to her that I only wanted to go out for a nice dinner and that’d be it, since I also had work the next morning. 

May and I agreed to split the dinner cost, and that was it. Well the day came, and May decided she wanted to take our friend to a tavern-like restaurant. I reluctantly comply, and go grab a burger. During dinner my friend got one or two drinks(she was supposed to have a party the next night, so she didn’t want to drink too much), but May went all out. May had more than a couple of drinks, and was past drunk. Which I’m not judging her for, but i didn’t want to spend the night holding May’s hair as she puked.

Our bill came, and it’s a lot more than I wanted to spend on dinner. I was thinking at most $50-70 each, but the bill ran up to about $375(which I know drinks can be expensive, but damn). I told May I’d pay for my food, and for our birthday girl’s dinner and drinks, but not May’s. May got extremely upset and wanted me to stop being “stingy” and just split the bill with her. I told her we’d settle it later, because I didnt want to fight with her right there and then, and we paid with her card. 

I ended up sending her the money for my food, and our friends food and her 2 drinks, which was roughly $100, so I sent her an even.

I looked up the ADEA and researched how EEOC enforces age discrimination. Unfortunately, “reverse age discrimination” against people less than 40 years old is not unlawful, at least at the federal level. There are a handful of states that prohibit age discrimination including reverse age discrimination but we’re not in those states.

My boss makes fun of millennials regularly. He spouts the usual stereotypes about us, and has a real issue with work-life balance priorities that many people in our generation value. This has gotten so out of hand that some people have feared asking for paternity leave or time off for fear of retaliation. Since we’re not in a protected class per se, I thought maybe I can ask HR for assistance on how to prevent my boss from acting so hostile towards the younger generation of workers because his behavior is really unacceptable. 

So last week I went to HR and made a confidential report with specific instances where my boss’s toxic attitude towards millennials has created difficult work place conditions for us. I just wanted them to tell my boss to stop generalizing millennials and treating us poorly simply because of our age.

First of all, that religion is extremely conservative about everything (for example birth control, listening to rhytmic music and even watching TV is forbidden). We both have religious families and they have brought us into that cult. However, my wife and I decided that we will not raise our child with their rules, because we don’t believe in those. Almost all of our friends are from that religion too and all of my friends are very conservative. We have no problem telling this to my wifes friends, because they are very open-minded about these things, but my friends are the problem.

They stalk me and remind me if I haven’t attented in cults events and act like they are worried about the strength of my faith. I haven’t told them, that we don’t believe like they do anymore, because i’m afraid that they try to effect to my parents and siblings who are still in that shit.

- no rhytmic music
- no TV or movies or anything
- no opera or theatre

- no birth control (I have 9 siblings)
- no moving together before marriage
- no kissing before marriage
- no swearing
- no make-up

948,Not the A-hole,"I manage an office of a financial services firm. Recently I was to put forward someone for a senior analyst role. There are two in our office who I thought would fit the bill. 

Emma is a lovely young girl who was different as soon as she walked in. Most applicants for our positions have relevant degrees. A few of them apply with degrees that aren't anything to do with the industry, but it's very rare for someone to apply with no degree at all. She left school at 16 with her GCSE's which were acceptable but not exceptional. In spite of this she managed to secure an entry level role with a much smaller company. She paid to study and complete her certifications herself and is the most enthusiastic, dedicated and hard working person in the office. First person the office every morning and often the last to leave. In a depressing industry like this her enthusiasm is brilliant. 

Alice a graduate from an elite university, and even among her peers her performance was exceptional. She was headhunted as soon as she graduated and the company paid for her certifications. She isn't as hardworking as Emma though. Numerous times I've seen her on her phone or using facebook or instagram on her work computer and have had to tell her to do some work. There have also been some problems with behaviour. She's a pretty girl who walks around like she owns the place. She made fun Emma when she first joined which I nipped in the bud, and argued with the admin girl. I also gave her a formal warning after she verbally abused one a man from from IT for taking too long to sort something for her. 

For the promotion I thought that Emma deserves it, but on the flipside, Alice is more talented than Emma. In the sense that during a high-stress period in which everyone is working to their limits, Alice can produce results far quicker than Emma, but on the flipside Emma can still get the job done sufficiently, and on a normal day she makes far more effort than Alice. I've been in this industry long enough to know that those who make no effort and rely solely on natural talent crash and burn fairly soon, hence why I put Emma's name forward for the promotion. 

When Alice found this out today she came into my office saying she thinks I made a bad decision, and that the post is more suited to her than it is Emma. I tried to reasonably explain why I made my decision, but it got to the point where she was saying that the fact that she was an elite student who was given the job proves that she deserves it more. I then clearly stated that what she achieved when she was a teenager do not make her more deserving of something that depends on much more than that. She then left my office upset and was down for most of the day. When she was heading home she was clearly close to tears.

949,Not the A-hole,"Let me start out by saying I  (23F) have been babysitting now for 11 years. I work in early childhood education and a church doing children's ministry. I LOVE children, I love educating, raising, and learning form children. I have never yelled at a child, said anything hurtful (I will say things to make them think like ""You are not behaving like a leader"") and would probably be caught dead laying a hand on a child.

&#x200B;

Well I have been babysitting for a family of two; a six year old girl and a three year old boy. The family is wealthy, but they live like they weren't proud of their home (house is a mess every time I come to babysit). The parents both work, but the grandmother lives in the basement however the parents don't like to leave the kids alone with her for long periods of time (ore than an hour). This family doesn't seem to be organized at all, and it is clear the kids have not been disciplined in any way... In the beginning they were what most would call ""demon children"" they would scream, throw things, lock you in a room... etc.  However, I made it really clear this is not going to be accepted. After the first week of babysitting (Friday&Sat night) they really began to behave. Months went by, while it was a struggle they learned how to behave whenever I babysat.

&#x200B;

OK-- so the last time I babysat was rough. It was a Saturday morning, and the rule was this ""If you clean up after play-time, we will make slime after lunch."" Well the kids didn't clean up, so I said ""no slime."" Both the kids cried and begged for slime. Lunch came around, and the boy had gotten over the crying and even cleaned up. The girl however was still upset and started yelling at me telling me she was going to hit me if I didn't let her make slime (this is after ""running away"" and us having a talk). I asked her if it would make me happy or sad if she hit me, and she said ""I don't care, I'm going to hit you."" She then proceeded to take a towel and slap me hard with it out of her rage. I was fine, but I told her to go to her room, and that she was to eat lunch in her room to think about what she did.

&#x200B;

I  made lunch ( grilled cheese with mash-potatoes and veggies) I brought her her lunch, and she then threw the plate across the room causing the food to go everywhere. She then demanded a new plate. I said no. She said she was hungry and I said ""your food is on the floor, pick it up that is your lunch.""

She began to cry and scream at how rude I was to her. She did pick up the food and she did end up eating it. After that she took a nap and she was fine afterwards.

&#x200B;

I told my friends about this (we are in education) and a couple of them said that it was abusive of me to make her eat off the ground. They kept telling me that she's just a kid. I feel horrible if i truly am abusive, I would be up for therapy and help to understand how this was wrong. AITA here?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT:

I did tell the parents, they seemed ashamed but not surprised. They've been in the home when I've told the kids they  have to eat their food before desert. They know that while I'm kind, I don't just let the kids run the house.

Also, I told her to pick up her plate and pick up the food because that was her lunch. I didn't make her eat off the floor like a dog, she picked it up and put it on the plate.

Edit 2:

If this were at school or church, there would have been different consequences-- I have never had an issue with a child being blatantly disrespectful. I assume because the child was in HER home she felt she could hit me, yell at me and throw things at me. Her parents have not shared if she has mental health issues for those assuming that.

954,No A-holes here,"Disclaimer: I'm not a super nice person. I prefer to keep to myself and I rarely go out of my way for others, especially at work. I do my job to the best of my ability and go home. My niceness caps at paying a strangers' train fare with my card if they're taking too long at the turnstile.

But I have this coworker ""Rachel"" who's really, really nice. Like, if there's a retirement party she always stops by my cubicle and brings me a slice of cake. Or she leaves nice notes on my desk. We're only a 4-person department in a much larger company so we all talk and get along, but Rachel is easily the nicest, and she's honestly...too nice for my liking. I know that makes me sound like a dick, but hear me out. I know she probably wants to be my friend because we're around the same age in a company of people who are mostly older.

Lately she's been offering me rides to the train station I take home after work. Usually I have to walk about 6 blocks to the bus stop, then a bus to the train that takes me home. I've politely declined her offer several times, for several reasons:

1) I genuinely enjoy my walk to the bus stop and my bus ride. It's one of the only times I get to myself, and tbh I play pokemon go and listen to music and like doing that a lot. I like routine.

2) I don't know Rachel well enough to really enjoy small talk with her for an extra 10-15 minutes. We've only been working together maybe a month and I wouldn't get in a car with anyone I've only know that long, even if she's a 5'0 110lb coworker.

3) I'm not really interested in being friends with Rachel outside of work, and I'm concerned if I start accepting rides from her it's going to become a whole thing

4) To give me a ride, Rachel has to stay late and I have to leave early, about 15 minutes on both of our ends. I don't want to feel responsible for her staying late, nor do I want to catch flak for leaving early.

Like I said, I've politely declined, saying I enjoy walking every day, several times, but she keeps offering with more and more insistence. When I talked with some friends about this, they said I should just let her do something nice for me because clearly she wants to befriend me or something. But it's not something I appreciate or want. AITA here?

edit: Really wasn’t expecting this to get any traction lmao. Rachel if you somehow see this, I appreciate the work chitchat but I’m terrified of conflict! Keep being your nice self!

edit 2: Finally got to read through all the replies and everything, just want to add that I get absolutely no sense that Rachel is interested in me as anything beyond friendly.

958,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR at the bottom

A little background.... I moved into some low income studios about a year ago. It's only me and my brother so it's a pretty chill spot. It's not in the best part of town and most of the occupants have or have had a troubled past, either with drugs, addiction or lifestyle choices. I stumbled upon them when a friend made a post in Facebook about the complex accepting applications for new tenants. The units are what you can expect out of low income housing. Thin walls, crappy insulation, the works. It was an opportunity that I don't regret taking, for the most part...

Now, I have a neighbor that we'll call Frank. I've met Frank before. You can tell by looking at him that he's been through the worst, but is still standing. I'm not sure if he has a speech impediment or a mental illness (or both), but I've been able to have some BASIC communication with him when he's on his meds, as he calls them. He grunts at me when we see each other, and I've been able to understand a few words here and there. 

The thing with Frank is he yells, for hours on end, every day and every night. I'm not talking a short yell and then stop. No, no, no. Frank yells at the top of his lungs, stopping every 10-15 seconds to catch his breath, for HOURS on end. It's not a scared type of yell but more of a ""Make it Stop"" kind of yell. Every day and night. At night, it makes it EXTREMELY HARD to sleep. Both my brother and I work early AM jobs and it's been countless times where we wake up at 5am to get ready and Frank is still yelling his lungs out from the night before. There have been 5 or 6 times where he wanders throughout the complex while on his yelling tirade. When he's on his meds, he's a completely calm person but He doesn't like taking his meds. I know he has some caretakers that come visit him, and I've spoken to some but they're always different when they come see him. It's never the same person for more than 2 times. 

We've tried everything from insulating our door to wearing ear plugs over the past year, to no avail. When I first moved in, I called the cops multiple times because I didn't know if he was in danger. I can't move out because I don't have the means of doing so at the moment and am here on another year lease. My last option is to file a formal complaint with management, but I don't want to do that as they have a 0 tolerance for complaints and have been known to evict people over complaints.

TL;DR WIBTA if I complained about my disabled neighbors constant yelling, every day and night?

Update: I spoke to one of his caretakers today. She gave me the card of the agency that works with Frank. She mentioned something about them working with the budget he has. I don't know how disability assistance works but I'll try to look into it when in between jobs. She also mentioned that people don't stay long with Frank because he tends to be very aggressive and dislikes most of the people that work with him. In regards to his meds, it's not that he doesn't take them on purpose but literally forgets to as he suffers from mild dementia. She couldn't go into detail due to patient confidentiality but advised me to have some patience. They're working to relocating him to an assisted living community but are trying to find one that would work with his problems and aggressiveness",22,36,0.94

Eventually I saw my friend and she looked like she slimmed down quite a bit. I gave her a hug and asked if she lost weight. She got excited and said yes. I said, ""I can tell, you look great!"".

The mom and grandmother (who is frequently over at their family house) are diligent churchgoers. They go every Sunday, and mom spends a lot of time volunteering and helping out with the church.

I politely decline any other time I'm asked. For example, if we spend a weekend at the family house, we always get asked on Saturday, ""Are you coming to church with us tomorrow?"" Boyfriend has no strong feelings or ties to church, and knows that I really do not enjoy going, so he typically replies, ""Nah, we're going to sleep in if that's alright.

963,Not the A-hole,"I live in a state with the US with very strict gun laws. My father is a Vietnam veteran, very conservative type person. As you would expect, he owns a large number of guns and likes to buy and sell them on the internet as a pastime. 

I am a college student currently attending and I live with my parents to save money. My parents have saved a large amount of money and have been generous enough to pay my tuition, buy me a car, let me live with them rent free, and provide me with anything else I need as long as I continue to get perfect or near perfect grades in school to get the maximum financial aide available and generally stay out of trouble and make good decisions. 

Today, my father asked me if I would be a reference for him to buy his latest handgun. He has a very short temper and tenancy not to listen when people talk, and I honestly don't think he should be allowed to own guns. I told him that I don't feel comfortable being a part of his gun ownership process, and after a brief back and forth over the difference between guns and cars and their role as weapons, I told him that I wouldn't do this for anybody, not just him, that I don't want to be a part of anyone's gun ownership. He then threatened to start forcing me to pay for my health and car insurance and phone bill (I work very little so I can continue to get very high grades in school). I know that I'm not entitled to any of the help that I'm getting, but am I the asshole for refusing to provide a reference?

But I didn't tell him I am concerned about him going to far as he gets older.  So I decided possible legal ramifications would be worse than losing my financial footing for a while.

968,Not the A-hole,"i am a 24M who recently graduated and have since moved to Dallas, TX. This took place a few months before moving, in a college apartment complex.  I have a 3 year old hound mix who is very  sweet and loves people, as well as other dogs. The only thing he doesn't like is when random unknown dogs rush him all of the sudden, it makes him nervous.

 I have a ton of neighbors and many of them own dogs. The apartment complex has a very obvious leash policy, as it's posted up in multiple places as well as being in the lease/agreement. This is for obvious reasons. I often see ppl walking large dogs with no leash at all. There are a few people who have MULTIPLE dogs out running around at once.  It was at a point where I had to check outside every time before walking mine. This went on for a few weeks.

At first, I would go up to anyone I saw walking their dog without a leash and just remind them that there is a strict leash policy. Most of the time they would apologize and go back inside. Most of them  continued to walk the dogs with no leash though. At this point I had called the front office multiple times about the problem, and they always said they would keep a look out.  But i never noticed a change, the dogs continued to run around without leashes daily. I contacted my apartment through instagram trying to get something done and that's when they started telling ME that I needed to start taking photos of them and collect as many photos as I can of all the people and send them to the manager. This seems absurd to me, as I am a resident there and I should NOT be the one having to enforce their own rules. it seemed that this was the only way to get them to do anything about it, so I took a few pictures and sent them. There was one girl in particular who would go outside with her THREE large black labs and would sit on her phone while the run around. She did this multiple times a day. after the apartment thanked me, and then I didn't hear anything after that.

Fast forward to a week later, and I got a knock on my door. I open it, and it is the black lab lady screaming and ugly crying. I had never actually talked to her before, and she immediately asked ""ARE YOU THE ONE THAT HAS BEEN TAKING PICTURES OF ME AND MY DOGS?"" I was in shock, as I expected my identity to be kept private since the apartment complex was ASKING me to do this, even though they shouldn't. I said yes, as there is a strict leash policy and she violated it multiple times per day, and I was tired of having to deal with it. She tells me that she got fined $200 five times, all for walking dogs without a leash. I told her that she was breaking the rules and she needed to take responsibility, then shut the door.

My parents have been extremely helpful with my boys and housework as me and my husband work Monday through Thursday. I do have daycare for my youngest and my oldest is in school full time, my parents have been watching both boys a few days a week, but only when they want to, I don’t ask, they offer. A few days into the trip, we noticed that my Dad was tightening the diaper too much, it was making the diaper less effective and uncomfortable for my little dude. I brought it up to him and showed him how to do it correctly, he was happy and we had no issues. A few weeks later, the same problem, so again I showed him. This past weekend, my parents offered to watch the boys so my husband and I could get away for a few days. It was amazing and we really appreciated it, thanked them over and over. When we arrived home, the boys were sleeping all was good and they went to their AirBNB for the night. At 5:30 am my youngest woke up whimpering, so my husband went to check on him. He was soaked in pee, like neck to toes soaked. The diaper was on so tight it couldn’t do its job. Obviously not ideal, no one wants to be soaked in pee, so he cleaned him up and the world kept turning. Later that day we see my parents and I mention to them again that the diaper was too tight and LO woke up in a mess, I didn’t make it a big deal, and had a smile on my face the entire time, even cracked a few jokes. They nodded and we went on our merry way, or so I thought.

975,Not the A-hole,"Okay, please read the whole thing before judging me. And apologies in advance for any errors, English isn't my first language

About three or so months ago, new neighbours moved in. They looked fine, except they seemed a bit ""spoiled"". For example, when the moving truck came, Mrs. new neighbour was complaining about a parked car because it was near her driveway and may bother their movers while they got their stuff off the truck, so she was saying how she was going to complain about that car and report it as abandoned so it would get towed. Luckily that didn’t happen. 

So anyway, apparently she suffers from some leg injury and she limps a little bit, enough to be considered as handicapped by the traffic laws. So a month after she moved in, I've noticed a street sign that said that the driveway between my house and hers was reserved for her car, and stated the plate number.

Here is the issue, my house is in a very commercial area, and it is hard enough already to find a parking spot, plus her house has a garage big enough to fit easily two cars, and then two more cars can fit on her driveway. We don’t have the same space, so before they moved I always parked in that place.

If that sign wasn’t annoying enough last week when I left my house, I saw her car, with the plates matching the street sign, parked on our side of the driveway, not on her reserved spot, while the spot was free, obviously. When I came back, I saw the car still parked on the same spot, but now on the reserved spot there was another car, I’ve recognized it because I've seen it before on several occasions, it was either her husband, who could have parked on their garage, or a guest, who could have easily parked on their driveway. So I reached the conclusion that she was abusing of this privilege given to her, using that spot as a guest-reserved parking spot.

So I snapped and called a towing truck to report an illegally parked car in a handicapped place, later that day, the car was towed.

AITA for getting her car or her guest's car towed?

Thanks for reading guys, I know this was long and I appreciate your time.

EDIT: I use the word driveway to describe the part on the street where anyone is allowed to park (including her own garage entrance) and when I am referring to ""HER driveway"" I am talking particularly about her garage entrance, where it would be okay for her, her family or her guests to park, but not for anyone else.

The main reason I’m hesitant is that about 9 years ago (before we met), he opened up credit cards in his mom and dad’s name without telling them. He didn’t go to jail but he was sued for a few thousand dollars, all of which he’s paid off and he has a credit card from the same company.

977,Not the A-hole,"I'm going on vacation in a few weeks with some friends. 3 couples including me and my SO. We're all sharing a room and it has all been currently been paid by my good friend (couple 1).

The guy from couple 2 has recently made some very hurtful and insulting comments regarding gays and pride month in general. When I questioned him on his comments, he proceeded to compare gays to the worst kind of human being (I can't say exactly what as its not allowed in this sub). This is a level of homophobia I'm just not sure I can be around.

What makes this hit harder for me is that my dad (60) has recently come out as gay over a year ago, and I am in full support of him and his lifestyle. He is the happiest I have ever seen him.

I'm debating getting another hotel for my SO and I, and just to do the vacation separately to them, but I'm not sure if this is the right approach, especially as it leaves my friends from couple 1 high and dry with them all having to pay more for the hotel. After all, couple 1, who I am very close to, have done nothing wrong. My SO and my friend from couple 1 are very good friends and haven't seen each other for over a year, so I would be ruining their time too.

The guy from couple 2 who made the comments was raised by a pastor in a very religious family. I am also religious but very accepting of homosexuality.

Maybe I just need to calm down and not let it bother me. Im taking it very personally because of my dad. I don't usually get involved in any of these discussions because they're not worth my time, but for some reason this one bothered me.

Then my dumbass drunk self wanted to make out with them

I asked, but there was no reply, so I assumed they fell asleep so I continued asking. this went on for like ten minutes. eventually I assumed they were way to asleep to wake her, so I went to bed. To be clear, I never actually did anything. I didn't touch them or try to kiss them in any way. In the morning I apologized to them a bunch and I felt pretty bad.

Yesterday they messaged me and told me that they didn't want to hang out with me or be friends anymore. I'm still really mad at myself and completely regret everything I did, but was their reaction justified?

979,Asshole,"Up front, let me say that I will almost certainly get her a present bc I don't believe in retribution like what I'm about to describe, but I am sorely tempted...

My stepdaughter is about to turn 15. She insists on making a huge deal of her birthday. Everyone has to be nice to her, do whatever she wants, evening they hate the activity, etc. Fine. We celebrate birthdays in our house as that person's day to do what they want. And I personally enjoy birthdays all around.

Here's the problem: Even when it's not her birthday, my stepdaughter is incredibly selfish.  She's also a scorekeeper and always insisting on everything being equal (tracking if her brother gets something she doesn't, not offering to help with things, always expecting us to go out of our way for her and rarely saying thank you while also never ever wanting to do things for others). A lot of this is typical teenage behavior but trust me when I say it is relentless.  On top of this, over the last year, she ignored or forgot her mother's  birthday, her father's, and mine. Like, didn't even ask if she could get anyone a card. When her brother's birthday rolled around, she made him a card at the last minute and that was it. This despite the fact that her younger brother spends his own money to get her birthday presents.

Last year, my mother sent her brother money for his birthday months after hers. My mom is older and had forgotten hers, so of course her reaction was to be mad that she didnt get anything. This year, my mom remembered. 

Now, given all of this, she still acts as if she should be queen on her birthday and everyone should treat her birthday exactly the opposite of how she treats theirs.

I want to treat her as she's treated others. WIBTA?

PS, I might also add she does the same thing at Christmas and gets no one anything at all while expecting everything. This has been pointed out to her many, many times.

EDIT: Just a point of clarification since it has come.up multiple times. I have only been in her life for 3 1/2 years. The birthday issue is just the one that is immediate, but her behavior towards other people has been constant despite all of her parents discussing it with her. This is not simply a matter of teaching her better as nothing we've done on that front has mattered and this behavior is not learned from any of her parents. 

She doesn't treat people well in almost any situation, to the point that her stepmother really has little to say to her and that she has no true friends. I keep hoping she will learn and a blatant demonstration of how she makes others feel (e.g., when she ignores their birthday) is only the latest attempt to illustrate that for her in a way that sinks in.",118,312,0.93

981,Not the A-hole,"So, this happened over two-three years ago, and I don't give a shit about it anymore. But we were talking and we were wondering what the people of reddit thinks.

&#x200B;

So me, a few friends of ours and my girlfriend went to an event (think comicon- type thing) and my girlfriend found this shirt/type thing  that she wanted, but she had ran out of money so she asked another (male) friend of mine to borrow some money and he said yes.

&#x200B;

She wanted to change the shirt right away, and since it was very hot outside and alot of people were going shirtless and such, it wasn't a big deal for her to do so.

So this is where the thing happened: My male friend said (half jokingly) that since he gave her money, she ""owed"" him to get changed in front of her. She said ""whatever"" and she did it. So she did in a corner with just us, and when she removed the shirt she was wearing my friend was staring at her tits, and the bra she was wearing was basically completely transparent except for some flowers on top of it. I, and everyone else, could see her nipples.

&#x200B;

I honestly not a jealous person at all, at the point that some people would think I don't care about her, but this honestly took me by surprise as everyone pretty much pretended that her boyfriend wasn't even there.

&#x200B;

I got hurt and I acted cold for a few hours after that. I didn't do it on purpose or anything like it, but I didn't try to hide it either.

&#x200B;

After a bit, we talkled about it and nothing happened. She got surprised I was hurt as she didn't think it was a big deal.

She thinks that It wasn't a big deal and that nobody saw anything and that i got hurt over nothing. I think she showed her tits to my friends.

&#x200B;

AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT: My friend said that in a completely jokingly way, and just want with it when she said yes, just so you know :)

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: since i wasn't clear about it, it seems, the bra was see-through and you could see the nipples clearly

I just didn't think it mattered that much to point out, and with the first edit all I meant was clarifying the context of the situation.I honestly didn't think he was a creep before writing this but after all of you pointed it  out, my girlfriend and I talked about it and actually, yeah he was pretty creepy considering that it wasn't a thing that he said once, but he kept saying it over and over untill she actually did it, saying things such as ""I bet you don't have the balls to do it"" and shit like that ( i honestly didn't even remember).

Her sister is younger than both her and I, being in her twenties. My in laws invited us to dinner on Sunday and my mother in law had prepared us a wonderful spread which we took part in finishing up preparing. 

My sister in law decided to make the salad, which she had mixed with her hands and fingers together. Usually I have absolutely no problem with hand prepared food as long as hands are washed. My MIL’s kitchen set up is one geared towards entertaining too so we were all helping out at our respective work stations when I noticed her long fake nails and the amount of dark brown crud beneath them. I’ve never noticed her wearing them before but all I could see was black filth caked on the underside. 

She saw me looking and snapped that it was just fake tan, and I kinda laughed it off with her and carried on chopping my carrots to make it less awkward that she’d caught me looking. 

I discretely told my wife later on and she shrugged it off and said she didn’t mind- cool, I had done my part and warned her, and I do agree that we probably put all kinds of crap in our mouths without us knowing anyway. 

When it came time for dinner, my wife took some salad, I loaded up on baked potatoes and steak which I honestly genuinely love. I am not known for eating salad anyhow but my SIL immediately offered me some and I took it to be polite and left it on my plate. 

After dinner was over, she launched into an attack because I hadn’t eaten the salad, and she accused me of thinking she wasn’t clean. I told her I had taken exactly what I wanted to take and I didn’t really want the salad, and my MIL and FIL were both surprised at her reaction and asked her to compose herself. 

The rest of dinner was uneventful if a little quiet.  I feel really awkward about this and maybe think I should have just eaten the goddamn salad to save face but it really turned my stomach to see how black her nails were.",272,2106,0.96
987,Not the A-hole,"I know the title makes me sound like a massive one but hear me out.

I[F/48] my son, my husband, our 2 dogs and our cat, live in a moderately high income area that has high taxes to have general controlles like a residence that has a garden. Today we had a water leak problem on our apartment and we were controlled by the plumber. As you can see where this is going we kind of have problems when a guest comes in we have a fit in the house so we put the dogs and the cat in my son's room with him until quick guests like the plumber leaves which is mostly a short amount of time. 

I don't live in America and we don't go inside the house with our shoes on we put them to the garden door to make it easier to go out and as a result we don't have many house shoes or slippers. The problem occured when this plumber came he forgot to bring any overshoes (which is the norm when it comes to going inside houses where you have work to do) and asked me for a slipper. I told him that I don't have any spare at the moment(they were in my son's room with the animals) and told him to just come in with his socks on which is also acceptable because inside the house is clean due to no shoe policy. He told me that he couldn't step on dog fur beacuse he was a religious man. I am also a religious person and asked him what was the big deal and he told me he was sorry and did his job 

While he was doing his job I thought that even though we both pray the same(I know this because of the terms he used while talking to me) we might have different ways in how we do it, so I felt that maybe I was rude to him about the sock problem and figured out he was going to pray (through looking at the clock) after his job so I thought giving him a new sock which was sealed  was a good idea. I tried to gift him the sealed sock and told him that we should be understanding of each other religious practices beacuse in the end he stepped on my house that has dog and cat fur.  He told me he couldn't accept the gift after that he turned his back to me and left without saying anything. So was I the asshole for offering our plumber a sealed new pair of socks after he told me he couldn't step on animal fur due to religious reasons.

995,Not the A-hole,"Hi, this is a mental dilemma of mine. Might get slammed for the opinion, so I'm using a different account.

I'm far from an impolite person. With that said, I won't deal with verbal abuse from strangers who are clearly just looking to take out frustrations. In an everyday setting, this applies to angry people on public transport.

I'm a physically healthy 19Y/O girl, meaning I can give up my seat to those in need. Unless I'm literally losing consciousness or something, but that hasn't happened yet. But I refuse to get up for anyone, regardless of their age or state (unless heavily pregnant or severly disabled) if they're quite obviously acting shitty because they believe it's within their rights to do so.

I've encountered these situations on multiple occasions, most recently last week. I was riding on a bus home from class, staring out of the window because the line was packed and you want to avoid making any awkward eye contacts. When I turned my head, that was when I first noticed an older guy standing next to me.

I apologized for not seeing him and offered my seat. But that set him off on a loud tirade about how he'd been standing there for over 5 minutes and that I should've moved instinctively because of his cane. Despite the fact that I didn't even see this person, let alone his cane. Everyone was staring at us. His goal was obviously to humiliate me and come off as superior, because if he just wanted to sit down, he would've gotten my attention earlier and asked. Or literally any other seated person.

So I told him no, I'm not giving my seat up for anyone who acts like a child and insults me. After that he called me a disrespectful brat, which just made me more convinced in my decision. He left to another part of the bus and I could hear him swearing under his breath.

In your opinion, was I the asshole for refusing to give up my seat to this man? Personally, I don't believe his age and the walking aid give him an excuse to lash out at strangers. But I could be looking at the situation in the wrong way.

996,No A-holes here,"Background and context: I'm South African and things have been going downhill slowly but surely in the country. It's reached a point where we have no option, but to emigrate to Aus for both safety as well as career reasons. I don't have many prospects here with the skill set I have, but will have more career options if we go to Aus.

The concern is that I have a son (11) from a previous relationship and he has made it clear that he is not willing to move with us (myself, my wife and his brother who is 3) as he wants to stay with his Mom. I get that as I wouldn't have left my Mom at that age either. We have wanted to leave the country for a long time but I had put it off because of my son and because he was so young I didn't want to leave him behind at such a young age. But we can't put it off any longer because I am reaching the point where my age could become a roadblock.

Moving to Aus will afford me an opportunity to earn more money and provide a better future for my family. Once my son is older and a little more independent he would be welcome to come over and stay with us no questions asked. He is 11 now and understands that I am not abandoning him, (we have discussed this at length) but of course there were tears and him saying that he will miss us and his little bro, and I can't help but feel like a piece of shit for leaving him. I love him and we have a good relationship as he sees us once a week and stays over with us as well as staying with us every other weekend. I pay for his school, medical care and I pay his mother a monthly allowance and I will continue to do so. We will obviously come over to visit as soon as we can afford it and our new jobs allow us time off of course and he will also come over to Aus to visit us so we will be seeing him.

998,Everyone Sucks,"Hi.

I'd like to ask about how much of an asshole i was today.

&#x200B;

Today, while on a way from a little shopping trip, i was once again reminded by my grandfather to not drive behind a truck at a regular safe distance. In his view, i cannot drive behind a truck with less than 200 meters (218 Yards) between my car and the truck. His reasoning is that a brick can be stuck between the rear double tires and catapult itself into the windscreen.

This piece of information is delievered to me each time we drive. Every time, without error for six years. (kinda impressive, actually)

He will say this when a car starts braking\* in front of you, or when you need to focus on driving - instead he starts talking how unsafe my driving is. Today i reached my boiling point.

&#x200B;

I stopped the car in a middle of a road, Told my grandfather that he should drive himself home, got out and walked.

After around four minutes, i walked back to an dead silent car and drove away.

&#x200B;

Here are the A-holish things that happened during my fit. I stopped in a middle of a somewhat frequent road. I didnt put the hazard lights on. (I did stop in a middle of a clear straight road, so the car was visible, but still A-holish thing to do, i agree) I was the only driver in the car. And, the worst thing - The car was full. My grandfather, my grandmother AND her visiting family. The last part is what cements me being the A-hole in my view, the visiting family did not ask for this and i wouldnt be surprised if i ruined their vacation.

&#x200B;

But i just can't.

Every time i do anything, i get some kind of critique. I borrow his tools, i suddenly reshuffled his entire workshop and lost each piece of his tools. I study, get a degree, its worthless and i shouldnt have bothered. I have a problem, he doesnt care - But his issues are problems of the entire family. I can write on and on about his views and opinions, but that is not the focus.

&#x200B;

When i got home, i cried, because i just cant do this anymore. (I should add that i had just passed my final study exams, and i havent done anything to relieve the stress of those exams, which probably contributed to me acting out)

&#x200B;

I understand I am a huge Asshole when it comes to the visiting family, and if anyone has any pointers on how i can apologize to them, i would be very grateful.

&#x200B;

For some background - I'm 24 years old, and I've been driving for 6 years now. Grandfather does the same comments when my mother drives. He used to drive in the past (He is 74), but only on small motorbikes, and tractors. I do sometimes get angry, so maybe i have anger issues, but i am not sure - Most i do is yell, never struck out, or damaged anything (If the critiques of my grandfather are anything to go by, i have serious anger issues and am horribly careless)

If i forgot anything, i'll respond to any further questions.

Yesterday was a stressful day for both of us. One of those days where you get off work and it’s just constant chores until you drop. I was in charge of grocery shopping, minor errands and dinner. She was in charge of deep cleaning the bathroom. 

At one point during the cooking of dinner, she asks to switch for a sec so that I can do part of the drain cleaning that she doesn’t want to do. I oblige. I tell her where I am in the process of dinner and proceed to help her out.

As I come back, she tells me that I forgot to make the rice. I tell her I’m following the directions step by step and that part comes later. She tells me that I’m wrong. I tell her that no, I am, in fact, right. She tells me I just didn’t read the directions. I say yes I did. She starts exclaiming “where’s the rice cooker? where’s the rice cooker?” and I get flustered and walk out to change the trash. 

I come back, look over the directions and point out to her a picture that clearly shows the rice being cooked later in the process, proving I’m right. I tell her she didn’t read the instructions and that it was rude of her to say those things to me. She says I’m rude for being snarky and telling her she didn’t read the instructions.

I am torn here like really torn. So my parents split when I was 5 as my mom left my father as he had a very severe gambling addiction. He was never really around and I only have memories of him and my mom arguing about his gambling.  He left our lives completely and I have not heard a whisper from him till around 6 months ago (I am 26 now) when he reached out somehow through some old contacts that still kept in touch with my mom. Until this point I just assumed he was dead or locked up or something.

&#x200B;

We do the whole lets get to know each other thing again. He says sorry and introduces me to his new family (wife and 2 boys in their teens). I didn't have much to say to him and pretty much treated him as a stranger. But I did get quickly aquianted with his sons as we share the same interests (video games and baseball). We've added each other on steam and play games from time to time now. So fast forward to last week, he asks me for a loan quite a big one too. He asks me for **$3,000.**

*(Just a little bit about myself I am a software engineer and although i'm not balling out I didn't have to worry about college fees as my grandparents made some huge sacrifices to pay for it. Now I make enough to payback my mom and my grandad whilst saving a little bit each month).*

I have the money. I can give it to him and not worry about being paid back for a while. But something about me tells me this is very wrong. I have told him that I can't help him as it would:

1. Crush my mom
2. You are an addict and this would be me enabling you
3. I don't really know who you are
4. My grandad  would hate me for life if he found out I did this

So he is doing the whole, I need to pay for rent, I need to pay for school fees and guilt tripping me with his sons saying I am denying them happiness. etc.. etc..

&#x200B;

This really has been keeping me up at night lately as his sons are getting close to college and they are pretty smart kids. He is really putting the pressure on lately and gave me a call saying rent and bills were due and he can't pay it and he is saying that he shouldn't need to beg to his oldest son. I feel like a total jerk and can't sleep so I am writing this. Reddit please help.

&#x200B;

**Update**: Wow didn't expect so many responses.

Got some sleep and woke up feeling like an idiot for even cosidering it. The beatdown I would get from my grandad if he found out is reason enough.

I decided to give him a call later and say something along the lines of ""Sorry I can't help you as it would crush mom and grandad and I don't want to do anything to hurt them. But I would love to keep trying to rebuild our relationship""

I have enjoyed the times I have spent with my half-brothers and I enjoy being an older brother to them. I grew up an only child and never got to experience anything like this and I really treasure the bond that we have built. I am coaching my youngest brother through some coding courses and want to be there for him if he is to pursue this as a career later in life. Therfore that last thing I would want is for my dad to think I want to cut ties with him and his family and I want to express this to him.

&#x200B;

**Update 2:** Called him, told him I can't because I don't have that kind of money. He seemed very upset and I couldn't handle it and just hung up. He is sending me some really depressing and desperate messages that are quite hard to read. Not too sure what to do from here. This sucks.",121,368,0.96

She was curious that after knowing me for 5 years she never sees me getting mad so last week she started annoying me.(like saying god why are you so boring in the middle of our conversation and repeating the word “cool” to interrupt everything i say). So i was pretty annoyed and I jokingly said “hey look a cute girl is coming, lets pretend to not know each other” in the middle of our conversation .Now shes mad lmao",14,27,0.82
1004,No A-holes here,"I (30M) and my girlfriend (27F) have been dating for about four years and she’s absolutely perfect. When comparing her to all of my past relationships, I can truly see that she is someone I may want to spend the rest of my life with. Last week we were out hiking when she decided to propose to me. Now, just to add, I’ve made it clear to her that I don’t believe in marriage and do not want to have kids. It’s not that I’m afraid of commitment, but I don’t see the point of having the government involved in our relationship and making a big deal out of it to friends and family. That, and I don’t want any consequences for us splitting apart. 

So, when she proposed to me, I naturally declined, but I insisted that I really did love her and saw a future with her. We live together and do everything together already. She somehow got mad at me for that, saying that if I truly did then I wouldn’t have any problems with marriage and that I should stop being paranoid. She’s been being really cold to me as of late and has been saying that I emotionally hurt her, but it’s just that I really don’t want to be married. I still plan on being with her for as long as humanly possible, and that’s that.",135,46,0.82
1005,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway since some of my cousins and my boss know my main account.

So, bit of brief background. My Grandmother died a while back, and she loved Hawaii. She also left her 4 daughters (my mom and 3 aunts) a substantial amount of money, and they all decided it'd be nice for us all to go to Hawaii as a family, something we were never able to do when she was alive. So, the 4 sisters booked rooms for themselves and their respective kids, and left it to us kids to decide what we'd do as a family for the week we'd be there. Some of us wanted to go to a fancy luau one night, others wanted to go swim with Dolphins another day, and my input (that was surprisingly well taken considering i'd at best consider most of my extended family to be a bunch of chickens) was shark cage diving. We had all also agreed that there'd be at least one day where we had nothing booked, and could do whatever, a *""Free""* Day.

Well, the shark cage diving was a few days ago and things went great, everyone had a blast, and on this particular outing there was a girl there on her own, Anna, that I took a liking to (redheads tend to do that to me). At first it was just casual conversation, trying to explain that my family isn't certifiable, just *quirky*, and we hit it off. Turned out she was here alone from Canada, was only on her 2nd day on the island, and was excited to have made a friend on the trip. When we got back to land we exchanged numbers and began texting each-other pretty often over the next few days.

Up comes the previously mentioned *""Free""* Day, and it also happened to be Anna's last day there, so we decide to go walk down to the beach and spend some time together. We didn't last on the beach long, and we go back to her room for some fun. Before we know it, it's dinner time, so we go to the restaurant at my hotel to eat and refuel. After that, we go back up to my room to continue our previous activities and she ends up staying the night in my room. The next morning we had an early breakfast (both still on mainland times and whatnot), and I kiss her goodbye as she had to get back to her room to pack up and get ready for her flight.

What I didn't realize at the time was that 1st, some of my younger cousins had seen us at the beach, though thought nothing of it, 2nd, my older cousin (never really gotten along) had seen us at the restaurant bar and had gone to get his mother to ""come and yell at me"", but we had left before they got back down there, and 3rd, that same aunt (not being one to get up early) had apparently seen Anna leaving the next morning when she came down to clean out the breakfast buffet. Now she's upset at me for ""sullying this family vacation with my debauchery"" and is staying in her room in protest, and a few of my other cousins are apparently in agreement with her (though she's the only one staying in her room).

This is getting long, so i'll answer some inevitable questions in comments, but that's it, AITA?

Edit: Just to add a few points

* No one in the family is overly religious, so that's not a reason
* Due to me not being able to get time off initially and having to book my room later, i'm not even on the same floor as the rest of them, so it's not like they heard us (though if i'm being blunt, the people in the adjacent rooms likely did)

UPDATE: So, after posting this last night I had texted some of my other cousins, asking their opinions on the matter, and it was discovered that apparently the Cousin who saw us (who we'll just call Z now) had, unbeknownst to me, apparently ""saw Anna first and called dibs"" (then made 0 effort to talk to her/get to know her). Ya, so those of you who said he was jealous were on the ball there.

As for my Aunt's reaction, she didn't go on the shark cage diving outing, so what she heard from ""her precious little angel"" was that ""I was stealing his one chance at happiness"". When the truth came out she just scoffed at us and walked away, no apology or anything. Honestly, that particular side of the family has had that air of entitlement, and this will go down as yet another story in what could easily be a series of books on all the shit they've pulled over the years.

Thankfully as an adult (I do find it funny that some people thought we were underage) I can choose to cut them out of my life, which at this point seems like the best because I have no intention to stop talking with Anna, and will be up in Vancouver next month for work, we'll have to see how things go from there...",206,607,0.94

1009,No A-holes here,"I am on mobile. Hopefully the formatting isn’t too bad. 

My girlfriend loves sending me these little “love quotes” where it’s basically a picture of some cute little words about finding your “favorite person and how much they mean to you. Like your whole world just revolves around them.” 


She says that they remind her of me and so she wants to send them to me. 

My problem lies in the fact that she sends SO MANY. Up to seven in the span of a few hours. 

When I have to work and everything my phone is constantly lit up with these messages about basically the same thing. Just said differently. 

I guess it also kinda bothers me because everything I say to her I think of myself. And I try not to parrot love quotes at her. 

I’m getting tired of these, and as I’m writing this I just got two more from her. It just annoys me, but makes her happy.

1011,Not the A-hole,"Haha, I don't really like to talk about girls with my parents because they always NAG me about it. I recently went to my friend's cabin for 2 nights, and we've been hanging out for the past couple days. Today my parents sat me down and told me they think I'm gay. I got seriously fucking pissed and kept denying it but they told me I could come out if I wanted to. I know I'm obviously in the wrong for getting pissed at them, but was my reaction too much? Perhaps I'm just a homophobe or something, lol. I love my parents and wish I could talk to them about girls, but the fact that they mention me being gay just triggers me. Like a transgender female getting labeled as a male. :p",38,46,0.76
1012,Asshole,"To keep this shortish, I’m gonna skip over a novel with of details and just say it: I broke this girl’s heart. My drinking spiraled out of control and I couldn’t get a grip on it. By the time I had finally distilled the problem down to “it’s either her or booze,” it was too late. I’m sober now, but she won’t talk to me. I’m blocked on everything, and rightfully so. After I had been sober a few months, I reached out via letter which was VERY controversial in terms of breaching her boundaries. I had her address through some odd circumstance (I didn’t do any Jon from You shit I swear) and I decided to send her a letter despite her obvious signaling to leave her alone. On the surface that might sound outrageously selfish, and maybe it was. But, the essence of the letter was “Hey, I finally figured out why I’m such a cunt. I stopped doing the thing that makes me a cunt. In the off chance that you would be interested in not-cunt me, I still love you, and I am without cunt qualities.” Though, I like to think I put it a little more eloquently.

Anyway, back when we were dating, I loved this band—still do. Being the sweet heart she is, she bought us tickets to go see them. And being the wretched, decrepit, raging alcoholic I was, I got too drunk and got us kicked out for getting caught peeing outside the concert. We never saw them.

Fast forward to sometime later, when we are broken up but still talking, she finds that they are playing again. Not near either of us, but somewhere. She buys a ticket, so naturally so do I.

Fast forward again to now. We don’t talk. She never responded to my letter, i.e. she doesn’t want to see me, and this concert is coming up in July. I have the ticket, I do want to see them—it would honestly be healing in coming to terms with my past, but I can’t help but to think that the only \[or at least a BIG\] reason I am motivated to go would be to pursue the off chance of seeing her. I know some of you guys might be thinking “how do you not know whether or not X is what is motivating you, or Y?” Well, idk what to say other than alcoholism taught me that I can be pretty good at lying to myself, sadly. It’s not like it’s a small venue though, it holds just under 10,000 people. Maybe you guys can enlighten me as to what the odds of running into someone at an event that big actually are, because I’m not as well acquainted concerts as I would like to be.

I just love her. I just want her to be happy, and I don’t think seeing me unexpected like that would be a healthy experience for her.

Lastly, whereas I am admittedly at a loss in identifying where my motives lay, I can say with confidence that if I were to go, I wouldn’t try to reach out or look for her. I’d be lying though if I said I have the self-control to not scan the crowd.

So, what do you guys think? WIBTA?

&#x200B;

Update: Ok thanks guys. This was way more back and forth than I would have expected. After thinking about it some, I dont think I'm the AH, but I'm not gonna go. I love that band but id be going for her, and that does make me the AH. If I love them that much, ill see them later in life. If I love her that much, just gotta leave it alone. Fuck, I hope she calls someday though.",23,112,0.9
1013,No A-holes here,"My neighbor babysits our daughter and we have a pool in the backyard. We’ve told her she’s welcome to use it while she’s watching our daughter and we are at work. But a few times we’ve come home and she invited other neighbors over without asking. 

She swam today and when we got home we found out one neighbor was over and she invited another neighbor with two kids over tomorrow to swim.

We appreciate all she does for us and our daughter probably has tons of fun, but we told her today that we’d prefer if no one else besides her was at our house swimming while we aren’t home.

1015,Not the A-hole,"This happened a while back but a recent post about tipping on here made me remember this.

So, I live in Alberta, Canada, and we have pretty much the same tipping culture as the US. You are viewed as an asshole if you don't tip.

A while back, three buddies and I got kinda baked and ended up at Denny's at around 2am. We ordered a couple beers and some food, nothing out of the ordinary, the waitress came to our table ~3 or 4 times. Place was relatively empty other than us. Probably spent ~$35 each? At the end, we went up to the counter to pay, as you normally do at Denny's.

They had issues with the point of sale system. The credit card reader wouldn't fire up to ""Insert Card"" when the waitress pressed the button. If you're unaware of how credit card machines work in Canada (it is different to the US system where you write the tip on the receipt), basically, the machine will tell you the total, you confirm it by pressing OK, then it will ask you to insert a tip percentage, and it will show you the new total after tip.

After a few tries and some finagling, the card reader finally fired up. We had been trying to pay for like 5-10min by this point.

Unlike normally, the machine didn't ask for any tip, and honestly, nobody noticed that it didn't prompt for a tip. Keep in mind, it was 2am, we'd been trying to pay for a while now, and we'd all smoked and had some drinks. With these kinds of PoS systems, generally you just follow the prompts on autopilot when paying, so the missing tip screen before asking for the PIN or whatever didn't really even occur to me.

We each paid separately. After the last of us paid, when the waitress was consolidating her copies of the receipts right before we walked out, she noticed no tips on any of them and said ""Really? I'm here serving you at 2am and no tip? Assholes."" Sure enough I looked at my receipt and oh shit, I didn't tip (and I presume my friends were just as surprised as me).

It was an honest oversight, and I would've corrected it, but the way she said it was so inflammatory, so I got pretty ticked off. I told her something to the effect of ""sorry, I didn't remember because I didn't see the machine even ask for it, but you can get fucked if you think I'm going to correct it after you called me an asshole"" and left. 

Two of my friends came with me, the other guy gave her a $5 note that he had and apologized, and joined us down the road.

The general consensus among the three of us that left is that she was extremely unprofessional in the way that she handled what pretty obviously was an oversight (we were nice to her whilst she was serving us and had no issues waiting as she resolved the payment issues, so she shouldn't have had any reason to believe we'd short her on the tip) but the other guy felt kinda bad because the place was pretty much empty (being 2am) so she was already not making much in tips, which is why he gave her the $5. 

So, am I/we (the three of us) the assholes here?",49,41,0.87
1016,Not the A-hole,"My husband was a teen dad, we will refer to his daughter as An. An's mom, grandma and ggrandma were all teen moms. An is now 16 years old, and pregnant.

An stays mostly with us because I am the one who pays (most of– 75%) her private high school tuition. It had always been my husband who pays for An's expenses.

When An turned 14 she wanted to move in with us to start her high school(HS) in the big city we live in. We checked on HS and since public school is terrible here, we decided to enroll her in a fancy private HS. She has always been set that she wanted to be an economist, and that she wanted to move to another country to pursue her dream. I have been separating some money for this purpose, too.

My husband and I came to an agreement that I would also help her dream to come true, but I would cease any economic help towards her tuition if she became a teen mom (An did NOT know this) and he agreed. This conversation took place two years ago... And now, An is pregnant as soon as she finished her first year.

I laid some facts down to An, gave her some articles and statistics about how teen moms are one of the most vulnerable groups of people, that this will hinder her dream of going to another country to study and that she knows the stigma it comes with. I recommended she terminated the pregnancy.

An's mom is ECSTATIC and so is her grandma. They have this weird belief where they think they can make it for so much better for her than it was for them because of ""all the experience"". I think they're absolute loonies; I bet they don't even have the money to pay for the hospital when the time comes. I believe they think we will pay for all of the unborn child's costs.

I am dead serious about stopping tuition and using the money I've been saving in other stuff if An decides to carry on with the pregnancy. I have NOT and will NOT make the ultimatum of ""terminate or I'll stop paying your tuition"", but I will tell her that I won't pay for her nice school and her child's expenses if she decides she wants to keep it. I don't even want to become one of those grandmas who take care of the child. I firmly believe a normal teen life has to be child-free. Money will go to some of the child's expenses and I will give no more. An can either enroll in a public high school (or one within her dad's budget) and set herself for a uni scholarship under dad's budget.

My husband is telling me I need to understand the situation. I do not and will not endorse this teen mom dynasty in any way, this is the hill I will die on. I can actually continue paying for her fancy high school, saving (a lot less) for the uni, and  some of the future child's expenses too, but I feel like I'll be rewarding her for being irresponsible and fucking myself over something I shouldn't. Husband firmly believes I am doing this to punish An and I am being an ass for compromising her future over this matter. AITA?

&#x200B;

**Edit/Commonly asked questions:** Ann will NOT stop attending high school- she will just stop attending the fancy private school. I will use that same money to finance some of the child's caring, but I also feel this is not my baggage and has to be something bio mom and dad have to solve themselves (I still need to make a budget, but I don't think I will pay the full $1000 equivalent of tuition a month on child support, bio mom has to pay at least something once in her life).

No, I will NOT make an ultimatum. I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO ANN ABOUT THIS SITUATION. I plan on telling her I can't support fancy high school + child support, but not both. She STILL will be able to attend a less prestigious school, not a bad one but not the best, that her father would finance. If father and bio mom want fancy high school, they should pay them themselves.

I will definitely NOT pay for the private university. The country's private universities tend to give scholarships, she could apply for one. I AM NOT CLOSING HER EDUCATIONAL OPTIONS. I may not be giving her the best (the money for her to go to LSE, for example) but I am not giving her the worst.

Finally, the father of the upcoming child is a young man she met in some of her extra activities outside of school. Parents said they would pay for child support, but unless this teen gets a part time job (part time jobs here to high school students pay around 200 a month), the parents will only be able to give $300 a month. That would cover a month of 5hour/5days a week daycare.

**Another edit because forgot to add:** Ann was supposed to be on the pill. Gyn recommended the pill instead of an implant because of some reproductive issues bio mom has. She stopped taking the pill because mom told her she would get fat and then proceeded to *educate her* on the ""natural"" way, as in having sex before, during, and some days after her period. Husband and I have been teaching her sex-ed since she got her first period when she was 11, but I'm fearing of bio mom's teachings, and at this point I just want to fist fight bio mom.",2565,17065,0.92
1017,Not the A-hole,"Pretty quick and simple. 30 minute commute each way - unless its rush hour which at least once a day we would be caught up in ~45 minutes. 

Girlfriend works 12h shifts from 6am to 6pm and then 6pm to 6am. She wants to be driven to and from work because she is too tired and is worried about falling asleep while driving. My answer to that is that shes in her prime/youth 24, and she should be able to drive the 30minutes to and from work rather than me spending 2 hours of my day driving back and forth. Also we use twice the gas by dropping her off, the car is only insured for 3rd party so ideally the less its driven the less chance we have an accident - though that is countered by her saying shes tired I guess.

I don’t feel like I can talk about this with any other friends because it will eventually make its way back to my core group of friends.

I guarantee that’s not the case. I have no real desire to have kids and I am focused on a lot of other aspects of my life and don’t really want a relationship right now. Anyway, we try to get together about once a month for lunch or whatever. It’s not a lot, but we keep in touch via text. The problem is that ALL the want to talk about is their kids. Two of them are sisters so even though one doesn’t have a kid, she talks about her nephew nonstop. We went to lunch today and I barely said anything. I just didn’t have anything to add to the conversations about kid toys that they’ve purchased and what milestones the kids have hit and how “funny” they are. They are both babies and they act like, well, babies. It’s not that extraordinary. I get these kids are the light of their lives and I want the kids to grow up happy and healthy, but I don’t think I would have been missed had I cancelled like I wanted to. I’m already dreading our next outing. I have a ton of stuff going on in my life and when I try to talk about it, it doesn’t really get acknowledged or we talk about it briefly and it’s right back to the babies. I really want to ask them if next time we hang out, can it be adults only, but I feel like a jerk. The one time it happened to be just adults, it was because one of them had work right after and the other friend didn’t want to bring her kid with because he was sick. Am I the asshole for wanting to ask this of them or do I just have to accept that this is how our get togethers are going to be from now on?

Edit: Because it’s been asked: it’s the fact that the kids are there and the topic of conversation always becomes the kids right away. I guess I am hoping that by having it just be adults, that the kids won’t be a topic of conversation as much.

In all honesty,  they’ve been pretty shitty friends, even before kids. I didn’t really have any friends at work, but I’ve started a new job and have met some wonderful people. I feel like maybe it’s time to remove myself from the group, at least for now. Thank you, again!",28,57,0.92
1021,Asshole,"It was my wife’s first birthday last weekend since we’ve been married. I had planned for us to spend time together in the evening to take her out for dinner and other fun activities. But I picked up an eight hour shift from 6 AM to 2 PM on that day.

I admit that I did not give her any surprises at midnight and also went to work like any other day leaving her nothing to wake up to. But on my way back from work, I bought her some flowers and chocolates. When I reached home, I could see that she was really upset that I left her alone and started accusing that I had spoiled her special day.

I told her that I picked up the shift with the intention that whatever I had planned was for the evening and the day hasn’t been ruined because we could still do plenty of stuff together. But she kept crying and said that I should have not gone to work because I give away shifts to go and pickup friends from the airport and other occasions. I admit that I have given away small shifts in the past for doing things for my friends but this was an 8 hour full shift and I wanted to take advantage of the penalty rates.

I kept on apologising to her and finally was able to convince her to go out for dinner but she refused to do any other activities. Even after coming back from dinner, she kept on crying that I ruined her day. I was sitting next to her on the couch and unfortunately dozed off a bit (because I had to wake up at 4:30 AM to go to work and also my neighbours were partying so hard the previous night I had to call the cops in the middle of the night to make a noise complaint).

I am a brother to a pretty awesome little sister (24) and also a dad of three beautiful little girls (2, 5, 9). My sister dated men throughout her teenage years and I’d always assumed that’s how it’d stay. However she is now engaged to be married to a woman. Her soon to be wife is a really cool person and my own wife and I have enjoyed having her over and the kids enjoy her company. We haven’t told them they are dating.           
My sister came to me recently as the wedding planning has begun and she wants my wife and I in the wedding party and also wants our oldest daughter as a bridesmaid with the two younger ones as flower girls.       
Here is my dilemma.. I have a very Christian family. My wife and I take our girls to church every Sunday and to me, homosexuality isn’t in gods word. I feel that having my daughters go to church and then be a part of a gay wedding is only going to create confusion and questions for them. I have yet to discuss this with my wife. It’s not that I intended for any of our family to miss my sisters wedding, but I hadn’t even thought that far up until she told me she wants us to be a part of it.         
I spoke with our mother who is completely against the wedding happening at all. She says I should tell her no, in hopes she won’t go through with the wedding. That’s fucked up and I told her absolutely not. Like I said previously, I never made plans to not attend the wedding. I was hoping to maybe have the girls be babysat but I also struggle with that as they adore their aunt. Now that she wants them in the wedding, I can’t get a babysitter and decline her offer. That would break her heart.                  
But again this wasn’t a conversation I wanted to have with my girls. I don’t want to give them the wrong idea.           
I’m so torn here. WIBTA to tell my sister I don’t want the trouble of small kids at her wedding even though it’s a lie?                 
     
TLDR: sister is marrying a woman and wants my whole family involved in the wedding but I don’t want to have the conversation about homosexuality with the daughters I’ve raised Christian. I want to tell her that I planned on having them babysat as I don’t like bringing them to weddings despite it being a lie.",1692,2459,0.85
1025,Asshole,"I used to be a sub for about a year. I taught a fair amount of middle school and high school. I didn’t always agree with how the bathroom rules were set up but I made sure I stuck to whatever the school or teacher wanted for the most part. 

Most of the time teachers would have a one person at a time rule. So if someone was already gone the other had to wait. I got around this by telling the students (if another was gone) if they had to go that bad they can risk getting caught in the hall and had to accept whatever consequence came their way. 

The way I differed was I would always ask something along the lines of “can it wait?”  Most responses even from girls would usually be yes or the pee dance and “I have to go really bad.” Then they had the option to go without a pass. 

Now the difference. If a girl gave me a definitive “NO” like this can’t fucking wait kind of context I just told them “go and don’t worry about security.” Now the reason was I am a man and I wasn’t going to ask a girl why or push the issue because they are old enough that they are getting their periods. It was not a battle that was worth fighting. Some boys complained and if they got more upset I only told them that they took health class and should know why. 

I told this story to some male friends and some of them said I should have treated them all the same. My argument was there is no way I can reasonably do that without getting in trouble because men don’t have the same issues.

Edit: sorry maybe I didn’t make it clear but I did let them go if they told me no they couldn’t wait. They just had to go without a pass and if they were caught then they got whatever consequence came.

Edit 2: hopefully I will make much clearer here what I did and why. This never came up but if a girl had to leave for what I suspected was her period and got caught I would have tried to get her out of trouble. It was to hedge my bets from getting complaints over this. Where I live if a sub gets two or three complaints they are done. I wanted to enforce rules so I wouldn’t get complaints but I also didn’t want to get complaints for enforcing stupid rules either. So I tried to find a middle ground that kept them to what I hoped was nothing. I really hope this clarifies things.",213,166,0.85
1026,Not the A-hole,"I went out with my family for a meal and my daughter got quite unwell near the end (nothing related to the meal) so my wife took her to to the car so that she could get some fresh air and hopefully feel a bit better.


I asked for the bill and waited at the table with my other daughter for it to come. No bill. 5mins later I ask another waitress. 5 mins later no bill.


Receive a text from my wife saying we need to go, what’s taking so long. I went to the bar and asked for the bill. The girl on the bar tried to print me a bill but the machine ran out of paper so she disappeared to go find some. I explain to another barman that I have no cash but am happy to pay on card without a receipt and he says it’s policy they have to give one. 5 mins pass and this 3rd person still hasn’t got back with my bill nor the paper.

I move to the exit and ask the person on concierge to find her, or a manager. They go off looking and return saying she’s ended her shift, but to ask the manager at the bar. This is another 5mins now so we’re around the 20min mark.


I find the manager working behind the bar who is talking to another member of staff, and he tells me to wait by the cash register near the exit and someone will see me shortly. I tell him no, they need to take my payment now or I have to leave, explaining about my poorly child and wife waiting. No problem Sir I’ll get someone right on it.


My wife is absolutely blowing up my phone now and I wait for another 2 mins then tell my daughter (aged 8) it’s time to go, I’ll pay them later. We leave and get in the car explaining to my wife what just happened: she tells me I’m TA for not paying and setting a bad example to my daughter, but I’m so mad now that I just want to get the kids to bed, and drive home.


I do intend on calling the restaurant tomorrow to pay, but as things stand am I TA?


Edit & update: 
just called the restaurant general manager and told them what happened, she was very worried that my daughter had eaten something and gotten ill from this. I assured them this was almost certainly not the case but they took the details of everything she ate and drank just in case. 

She then said that waiting that long was ridiculous and they wondered what had happened to that bill as nobody (!!!?!???????) could remember. That got me pretty mad but thankfully she felt the same haha. She said as way of an apology the meal was on them, no charge, and hoped it wouldn’t deter us from visiting again. She also said that not many people would have called back the next day and thanked me for being honest. I thanked her and closed the book on that.


With regards to my wife as someone mentioned below I am going to give her a pass for that. She had spent something like 25mins in the car with a kid throwing up out of the window in the rain, and I didn’t communicate properly so she didn’t know what was going on. I understand she snapped which upset me at the time, but on reflection it makes sense. I think she’ll apologise once she’s calmed down and I tell her what happened with the bill.


My daughter if fine yes, but she’s off sick today. Just a normal sickness and diarrhoea but I think.

1027,Not the A-hole,"I’m 17 and haven’t had any vaccinations since I was a baby, so I’m about to get my shots in a week. My mom isn’t necessarily anti-vaccine, she’s “vaccine cautious” as she calls it, mainly because she claims I had a serious allergic reaction to the vaccines as a baby and because she’s influenced by people around her who say vaccines are dangerous. I’ve finally convinced her to let me get my shots, but she’s scared to death I will have a reaction and she insists that I take her homeopathic medicine as a precaution. I’ve told her I won’t take the medicine because it doesn’t work and then we got into a serious argument about the effectiveness of homeopathy. She gets very defensive about the subject and will argue with me until I either give up or until she sends me to my room. One of the other reasons why I don’t want to take this medicine is because it will enable her to use it in the future, and she’ll use this moment as an argument in that “you didn’t get an allergic reaction which means they worked.” I honestly don’t care if she uses the medicine for herself, but recently our dog was limping pretty badly and she gave our dog homeopathic medicine instead of taking her to the vet. I feel that taking the medicine is justifying her use of it for things that require actual medical attention. 

On the other hand my dad said he knows it doesn’t work, but I should just take the medicine to make her happy and I would be a major asshole if I didn’t. I feel obligated to take the medicine because it will keep the peace.


Would I be the asshole if I didn’t take my mother’s homeopathic medicine to make her feel better about me getting my vaccines?

EDIT: I looked at the medicine she wants me to take, and it’s actually harmless. Now, I’m not an expert in homeopathy, but if it smells like sugar, if it tastes like sugar, and if it looks like sugar, it’s probably sugar. They’re sugar pills that have been diluted to the point that whatever nonsense was in the solution beforehand has no remaining traces. The bottle says 30x, and I looked it up, and  [“A 30x dilution means that the original substance has been diluted 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times.” ](https://www.homeowatch.org/basic/infinitesimals.html)

1030,No A-holes here,"Not quite three years ago, my husband left me. At the time our oldest daughter was going into her senior year of high school. She was devastated. The girl (she is practically 20 yrs younger than him) he was dating was/is a real wedge between him and our daughter. He has virtually no contact with either of our daughters.    I have begged and pleaded with him to repair his relationships with our children- he just doesn’t seem to care. Anyway, a thing my daughter does is constantly ask me what I think her dad would think of something. It’s usually everyday things like what he would think of a restaurant or a song or stuff like that. I hate these conversations because I think they are unhealthy for her and because I am trying to move on. Recently I told her I don’t want to talk about her dad anymore. She said she understood. She hasn’t brought him up since. The thing is, she was visibly upset when I told her and I’m wondering if I am being TA.

Edit: Thank you all for the insights and the suggestions. I have on several occasions talked to her about if she wanted to go to therapy. She has always declined, but I’ve never approached it as her and I both going to therapy- so possibly I can try that. 

Someone asked about my younger daughter. She is severely autistic and attends a residential school. I see her regularly, her father has seen her twice since he and I split. It’s hard to tell what her understanding of this situation is. I can say- she never indicates she wants to see him (she’s non verbal, but very good at letting us know her wants/needs).",115,1347,0.97

1032,Not the A-hole,"Actually are ""we"" the asshole. Girlfriend is the birth mother. We have been together three years living together for two. We have custody of her seven year old daughter pretty much 100% of the time. Before six birth saw her maybe half a dozen times a year his choice. He has never lived more then an hour away, the girl visits his parents usually multiple times a month and he has a history of cancelling plans to see her. He now sees her more often but typically less then once a month. Usually she visits him for a weekend. 

Custody agreement doesn't cover visitation. Girlfriend no longer tries to get him to have daughter over. Girlfriend will provide travel and coordination if either one of them wants a visit. We don't force daughter to visit if she doesn't want to. 

Lately daughter hasn't been wanting to visit. She loves her dad but she doesn't like visiting him. Typically they stay in his apartment the entire time usually playing Minecraft or she might get to go with her father and step mom to a babysitting gig and play with those kids. She says it is boring. 
As far as taking care of her goes he is not that great at it. Daughter typically complains about not getting fed dinner when we pick her up. He also has left her alone in the apartment when he went to the store. Due to her age doing this was not legal in our state. He appears like he wants to take care of her but isn't good at it. He has never taken any initiative to buy her things like clothes, books, school supplies or toys. She doesn't have anything at his home and sleeps on a couch. 

Birth father approached us at a family dinner event stating he wanted to take daughter for three weeks during the summer. She has never been with him longer then four days. We said we would think about it and check our plans but in private both agreed it should not happen. The paternal grandparents said the same thing. The grandmother directly said ""You can't do that to her"" when it came up. 
Looking for additional perspective on this. On the one hand it is important for daughter and her father to spend time together but we don't think he can handle that amount of time in pretty much any way. We are considering five days in a row over a week and additional short visits if daughter wants them. Are we being assholes for out of hand denying this request",95,193,0.88
1033,Not the A-hole,"When I found out my SIL was pregnant the first thing I told her is to not worry about her baby shower. I told her that I will throw it at my house and I will pay for everything and to not stress about it. The only thing she had to worry about is set a date and give me a guest list. I kept reminding every other week. “SET A DATE GIVE ME A GUEST LIST. SET A DATE GIVE ME A GUEST LIST.” This went on for months, no date no guest list. Last weekend we were at a girls brunch and one of our friends asked her when her baby shower is, she replied and said “Next week at Dara’s (me) house.” I was not told of this but I just nodded and smiled as to not cause a scene and embarrass her. In private I told her that, this is all very last minute.
I own my own business and work over 10 hours a day! I told her that I have been asking for her to set a date for months in advance and she did not follow through. I refused and said sorry and left it at that. A few days later she starts sending me baby shower ideas and decorations and numbers for bakeries to order her baby shower cake from. She even sent me a guest list and a time of when she wants the baby shower to happen (5 Days from today). I told her again I was not gonna do it because it’s last minute. I don’t operate this way.

1037,Not the A-hole,"So to begin with the story, here's the context: 

&#x200B;

I am a recent graphic design graduate that had been relocated to Portland, OR for a month. I am currentlyliving with my aunt while trying to find a job here. I have sent multiple job applications here and there, but what I got back are either irrelevant (real estate sales agents, commission based insurance salesperson etc.) or just outright scams. So I am excited to heard back from the company that I have applied to over on LinkedIn. 

&#x200B;

The company in question is a prominent nationwide construction company, and they have a UI/UX opening posted. When  I received the job offer email, I was excited, thinking that the search is finally over. However, upon second inspection, I noticed that there are something off. (Details here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/c4fv94/a\_legit\_job\_offeror\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/c4fv94/a_legit_job_offeror_not/); TL;DR: The email is coming from a Gmail address \[for a nationwide construction company!\] and they are asking for a Google Hangouts chat interview) Having read articles in the past about job scams, my alarm is ringing like crazy at this point. So I decided to forward the email to my aunt, but she said there's nothing wrong about the supposed ""job interview"", and instead called me out for being stubborn to forfeit the ""opportunity"". So in order to find proof, I decided to do some detective work on my own and call the company in question as well (and recorded the conversation for good measure) as forwarding the email to my college's career adviser. The HR lady of the company indeed confirmed my suspicion as she told me that they have never posted a UI/UX opening and it was a scammer impersonating them. My college advisor also noticed the discrepancy and advised me not to go forward with the ""interview"". So I decided to forward it to my aunt, and you think she would accept my argument, right? 

&#x200B;

WRONG. She still isn't convinced, and she even rebuked to me by saying ""what did it waste? 2 minutes? I don't need proof (that it's a scam)"". At this point she feels like I am really pushing her button and she's ""90% done with me"", but in reality I have been finding jobs here and there to no avail. Now I can't risk to burn my only bridge here in the US, as I came here on my student Visa and currently pending my OPT. So my question to all of you is, am I the asshole for standing up to my uneasy feelings about a potential trap? Or am I being rebellious to defy my aunt?

TL;DR: I tried to ask my aunt about a sketchy interview offer, she insisted me to push forward despite my uneasy feelings and evidences.",16,27,0.87

1039,Not the A-hole,"I'm so sick and tired of being dragged everywhere like a dog on a leash to go to the store and ask for my mom if they have her jeans ready when she can easily say it herself. I'm so sick and tired of her calling me to the living room every 15 minutes to make some kind of call for her. I'm sick and tired of her telling me ""Then how about ya'll fucking work and pay all the bills so I can start going to English school"" when the internet has FREE courses, videos, and resources to learn English. I'm sick and tired of her getting mad when I don't know how to translate something between Spanish and English.

1043,Not the A-hole,"Hi,

&#x200B;

So my husband(30M) and I(27F) had a little drama yesterday.

&#x200B;

We just moved, so we've been purchasing new furniture for the new place.

&#x200B;

He's also considering buying a new coffee table, and I didn't know which one until yesterday.

&#x200B;

All I knew was that he's very obsessed with this one particular design, that's pretty pricey.

&#x200B;

Yesterday, we were having coffee with one of our mutual friends, and my husband started talking about the coffee table he's obsessed with.

&#x200B;

And he opened a website and showed an image gallery of this particular table on his phone, which looked really nice. He showed me those pictures before, but I never saw a price.

&#x200B;

So, I closed the gallery to see the price – out of curiosity. And it was over $2,000.

&#x200B;

I blurted out, ""Is it $2,000??"" and he seemed a bit uncomfortable for a second, and said ""No, I'm gonna get a similar one from somewhere else cheaper"".

&#x200B;

When we parted our ways from the mutual friend, he got upset and raised his voice and said ""How could you be so oblivious in such a social situation, were you trying to make me look like a pretentious pr\*ck who buys $2,000 dollar worth of coffee table???""

&#x200B;

As much as I'd admit that sometimes I have a hard time reading social cues, I didn't think it was my bad this time around. I felt like he was trying to mislead me into something that I didn't do.

Or maybe it was. IDK!

1044,Asshole,"This one is a hard situation for me. We have a resident at the nursing home I work at that I'll call Ms. Green. She's a nice lady and everything but the problem is, she has some quirks.

One of the main things she does is she coughs a lot without covering her mouth! When she does this, a lot of residents get very noticeably uncomfortable, especially when it is flu season or any kind of illness is going around. A resident cursed her out the other morning because she was doing it around their food.

Ms. Green has good intentions but yesterday she opened the door for a resident who isn't allowed outside. Some residents have on ankle bracelets that trigger an alarm if they go out the door. They can't go out because there's too much of a chance that they'll wander down the street and end up getting killed. Residents aren't supposed to be messing with the door controls anyway so that ticked some of the staff off.

Ms. Green also ticked off the administration because she contaminated the ice machine. In the employee break room is the ice maker that we use to supply ice to the whole facility. She went in there and stuck her bare hands into the ice machine. Maintenance had to come in, empty the whole machine, and sanitize it before we could use it again. This took a long time to do. The resident that saw her do it publicly told every other resident why no ice was being passed out so the residents went from being annoyed to being furious. These people love their ice.

Ms. Green has been asking people why everyone hates her and I don't think I have it in me to do something like that. I especially don't want her to think that I hate her too. At the same time, I know what it's like for someone to feel like everyone hates you and not know why. I feel like no matter what I do, I suck here.

EDIT: I said this in one comment but I should say it here too. She was really really sad one time when I told her that she shouldn't touch her roommate's things. She was sad for about two days just for that. I know if I give her this list of reasons she will be worse.",134,1270,0.97
1045,Asshole,"For this to make sense I need to set the stage, I’m staying at a 7 condo unit in New Mexico with my husband and two kids. It’s a gorgeous property but we can generally hear the neighbors next door. The owner of our unit and the one next door lives in the complex and up until this morning was polite, as was the neighbor.

Last night I could hear the neighbor playing music which sounded like a sort modern blue grass and I actually really liked the tone of the music. It was pleasant back ground noise in all honesty. This morning he must have placed his speaker in a different spot he used while the music was the same I could now hear the lyrics. I knew there was trouble wheb I could hear the words “Dixie” and “land of cotton.” I googled just to be sure its a song by some little known country star clearly celebrating “lost cause” and racism and hating on “city people.” 

I was furious but i politely went next door she said we could hear the music through the walls and would he mind turning it off. He said he was sorry and would. I probably made a mistake and said “I don’t want to expose my kids to that type of music.” He gave me a dirty look and closed the door. We went to breakfast and I could hear the song playing again. I decided after the dirty I didnt want trouble from someone who may be unhinged. I decided I would take it up with the owner. He said he would ask the neighbor to keep it down. I told him it’s not the volume, it’s the lyrics. He said he really couldn’t control the lyrics. I said he needed to do better then that or I needed a refund. He said he wasn’t going to offer me a refund for “offensive” lyrics but he would make sure I couldn’t hear the music anymore. I asked him if he was serious he said he’s not “speech police.” I told him we were leaving and I would take it up with Airbnb.

My husband is acting completely put out and that I’m being ridiculous. I told him we aren’t listening to trash and our kids aren’t either. Husband said the problem was solved when owner promised he would make the neighbor turn it down. I said no, the Problem is the neighbor exposed himself as racist, probably dangerous and we are leaving. Husband told me I was acting ridiculous and took the kids on a hike without me. 

Before I pack up and move, am I being ridiculous? (I know this sub is asshole but I figure that’s a reasonable substitution).

1046,No A-holes here,"Some backstory: Me and my (1 year older) brother have not been on good terms in a long time. In school he was my biggest bully, and as he got older things got worse.  He lived a violent, reckless lifestyle, always getting into fights, getting involved in gang activity. He's been to jail multiple times, and honestly it was a reprieve for me and my mom when he was locked up, cause it was hell living with him. He'd threaten violence (most often implied, sometimes outright) to me and her if he didn't get his way. He even put his hands on her once - that was the only time I ever fought back against him.

&#x200B;

He hasn't been above stealing from family either. He stole my mom's money or car multiple times. He's ""borrowed"" money from other families claiming he was gonna use it to go to school or get a car for work, only to use it to buy drugs to sell.

&#x200B;

Having been a broke kid in high school to being an even broker college student, I didn't often have much of value for him to steal. But I was always an avid gamer, so my game consoles were an exception. He's stolen systems from me three times in my life. After the most recent incident, I swore I'd never let him in my life again. A couple years passed.

&#x200B;

Then he got shot. I wasn't surprised. No one was. We all knew his lifestyle would get him shot eventually. He survived, but is permanently paralyzed from the chest down. I didn't go see him when he was in the hospital. I was glad he wasn't dead, but I had meant it when I said I would no longer let him into my life. Everyone told me he was doing better, no longer running the streets (like he'd be able to), that he was settling down. My mom, as much of a pain in the ass he was to her, still loved him, and  wanted me to forgive him. But I refused.

&#x200B;

Then. . . my mom died a month ago. . .

&#x200B;

I knew I'd be seeing him at the wake. And I knew my mom would want for me not to hate him. So I resolved to give him a chance. And, yeah, he was much calmer, more mature then ever before. I had the first decent conversation with him in years. I told him that I forgave him.

&#x200B;

A few minutes ago he contacted me for the first time since the wake, asking to borrow my PS4. He says he's bored out of his mind not being able to really go outside, and he needs something to do, and I mean, I understand that and feel for him. But I REALLY don't want to let him. Partially cause I just got it half a year ago, partially cause of the history. But I feel like a dick for not letting him.

He kept insulting me and of course I thought he was just joking around. I followed up with jokingly comments. He kept insulting me, and it gave me a hit that maybe he wasn't joking. I told him again, ""Stop acting like you're upset dude, it wont work on me. I'm not gonna apologize and let you make fun of me for doing so again""

He ignored me for a few minutes, I asked him if he was serious, and he did. Just now it hit me he was actually hurt by the comments. He apologized, I apologized but I'm not sure what to do in this situation. He told me that he has a tendency to hide his feelings, and that he secretely hated the comments and jokes all along. It's the first time he ever told me this. I told him ""You should have told me this way earlier"". He proceeded to say ""How can anyone find these jokes funny? You have to be really weird to find these funny"".

I feel hurt because he called me some serious shit and it wasn't a joke. I called him some serious shit too but it was a joke and he always seemed to be fine with it. Now I realize he doesn't. AITA for using dark jokes near him?


(Edit) Okay I have seen all the replies. Thank you for making them. People say I am a racist if I am making racist jokes but I mostly do it ironically, like to make fun of people who are actually racist. I don't know if that makes sense to you. [Saying random phrases like ""I support the slave trade"", calling each other Abu Hajaar, roleplay things like we live in North Korea etc. I don't make what your racist grandma would make in a dinner table. I don't find edgy stuff funny.] Plus his parents actually doesn't so cocaine, I made it up as a joke.

Now for the real reason I made this edit is because... HE WAS JOKING. Yeah. No shit he was joking. He was the one that enjoyed jokes like that all the time and it really didn't make sense for me for him to get extremely upset. I met him irl today, and he just told me everything was a joke and I was an idiot. I am pretty pissed at this guy because I genuienly felt bad for my friend that I kept making jokes like that always offended him. He even made fun of me that I made this post.

1050,Not the A-hole,"So, my significant other and myself went to visit her parents for fathers day. As a gift, her father wanted me to cook ''Pasta la Bolognesa'' which I made 7 pounds of. We (gf and I) bought all the ingredients (This was on Sunday), and went back so I could start cooking. Cooking finished, everything was great, they loved the food and we all had 2 to 3 servings and there were some more leftovers which I put into a big plastic container and into the fridge. We never discussed what was going to be done with the leftovers.   


Anywho, we went to sleep at a visitors room as we were planning to stay for a week. I brought my laptop with me as I work from home, and since we are planning on making a big trip we couldn't really afford missing a couple of days of payment. I slept in on Tuesday as my GF said she would be going out with her parents that day. At around noon I started getting hungry, and couldn't find my wallet, so I heated up the rest of the pasta as there was only one more serving since they reheated some leftovers on Monday, ate the paste, and went to work.   


Inlaws and GF come back at around 10pm, turns out my wallet was in my gfs bag and she forgot to take it out. This is when it got ugly, my in laws realized there was no more pasta and they blew up saying that pasta was my father in laws as it was cooked for fathers day. I explained I did not have money with me and I was hungry and didn't feel like cooking at a place that is not my home, but my MIL did not have any of it and started to ask my girlfriend if she was okay with me being the man she was going to marry. So I did get a bit pissed and just asked them if they were being serious about getting mad at someone for eating, EATING. We don't have the best relationship with her in laws because they can sometimes be extreme, but since we have plenty of rough interactions, I just want to see it's not a case of **''When you always find a problem with something, you might want to see if you are the problem, instead''.**",106,507,0.96

1053,Not the A-hole,"Back story. My parents got divorced when I was 4 years old and my mom got married to a very loud, violent person. I remember occasions where I was forcefully put in the corner, forced to eat food that I did not enjoy the taste of (to the point of throwing it back up onto my plate and being told to sit there until it's gone), and waking up to numerous arguments which eventually led to my mom's screaming and crying. For a young kid, that was some terrifying shit to me.  

My stepfather also has PTSD and bipolar. He's rather short-tempered so anything that anyone does sets him off. For example, if my mom pisses him off in the car, he will tell her to stop and he'll get out and walk the other way while my mom is driving alongside the road for miles trying to stop him.

Now I'm almost 30 years old and I had my first little daughter. Our relationship has gotten better but it's still hard for me. They come out for the weekend, and although hosting is extremely stressful, we understand that they want to see their first granddaughter. My stepfather still has his temper, but as an adult I rarely experience it. The only thing that we currently have a problem with is that he's rather aggressive when it comes to holding her. ""Here, give her to me,"" he'll demand from my wife. Almost like a forceful, unkind ""I insist."" He loves her, but it's a lot to handle his personality.

Now, my mom and stepfather used to live about eight hours away from me. With the recent news of my daughter, they took it upon themselves to move about an hour away from us. Weekend visits to visit the baby when you live 8 hours away is perfectly understandable, and for the first time in my life I'm seeing my mom and stepdad in higher frequencies than ever before. (I lived with my grandparents from 4th grade onward.)

During a weekend visit my wife and I were getting  frustrated with how we were being treated as hosts and we were burned out from consistently hosting them. With them moving an hour away, we thought it would be wise to have a talk with them about some basic boundaries to keep the relationship healthy. A few of those rules were no more weekend visits where everyone is staying the night since they are now only an hour away. Day visits are just fine. Another boundary was that my stepfather not being allowed to watch my daughter alone. Having PTSD and bipolar mixed with my horrible upbringing with him, we felt it necessary to draw the line before anything potentially happening. If we let him babysit alone and something were to happen, something even as small as him getting frustrated and treating her in  an aggressive manner, I would never let myself live it down. I'm extremely protective of my child, and I don't want to her to experience any of the negative aspects of my stepfather, while still having her know her Grandpa and love all of the good qualities about him.",164,877,0.94

I'm in my second year of high school. We recently had to go swimming with 2 classes. One of our gym teachers (40-50M) was swimming with us. We were just playing around and the guys are fighting (like one on the shoulders of the other) and trying to push each other off. The girls are just watching and talking when the teacher comes up to them and encourages them to get on his shoulders to fight against the boys. My first thought was: 'Wow, that's kind of inappropriate for a teacher to do'. All the girls were wearing bikinis etc. The girls were hesitant at first, but one girl climbed onto his shoulders. I left when that happened. When we were done swimming the other teacher asked me if I liked swimming. I was honest and said I didn't really like swimming, because the water makes me feel uncomfortable. The male teacher in response asked if I were insecure about my body. I personally don't think that that's a nice question to ask. Till now, everybody told me I should report it (even if I weren't the girl on his shoulders) but one guy told me I'd be an asshole and said there was nothing sexual behind it.

1058,Not the A-hole,"I have a friend who says she’s very unhappy with her weight. She recently had a doctors appointment who declared her as morbidly obese which she says has been a wake up call.

I put her in contact with another friend of mine who’s a personal trainer. I’ve never worked with him in a weight loss capacity but he really helped me get back in the gym after surgery on my knee and has a lot of clients who have lost a lot of weight so I thought it’d be a great match.

He gave her a meal plan, a work out plan and they agreed to meet 2-3 times a week depending on each other’s availability.  Obviously I’ve not seen her diet plan, but I really doubt what she eats is included. She had three take aways last week, and when we met up over the weekend she had 2 bottles of (900 calorie per bottle) wine. 

Having spoke to my trainer friend, she’s skipped a lot of their sessions for various reasons i.e her car broke down, she’s sick, there’s been a death on the family (that one she told me was a lie). He’s been understanding but is slowly loosing his patience.

When we met up over the weekend a couple of my other friends mentioned they want to lose weight for a wedding we have coming up and were considering joining the gym we attend. When I mentioned the personal trainer, my other friend chimes in, saying he was crap, he’s mean, she’s lost no weight and he’s too demanding. 

I basically called her out saying he’s keeping up his end of the bargain, but he can’t physically drag her to the gym or slap the food out of her hand. She went very red and told me it was none of my business which is true. 

The only reason I said anything is not only is she basically lying, but I feel like she’s taking money out my friends pocket by making him out to be a shitty trainer. He relies heavily on word of mouth for new clients and I felt like she was deterring potential clients.

AITA?


**ETA: my trainer friend wasn’t tattling or anything, he asked me to pass on a ‘sorry for your loss card’ to her which surprised me bc she never mentioned a death in her family. When I passed on the card she told me she lied to get out of their session.",80,741,0.97

So we were on a night out, just taking a taxi to the club. We all had bottles of beer with us that we were drinking at the time, so they were open. The taxi driver told us that it wasn't usually allowed to bring open bottles on the taxi, but he'd make an exception. When we arrived at the club, my friend F got out first, then noticed he forgot his wallet or something and came back in with the beer, spilling some of it on the taxi seats. He (F) then took off to queue up for club entrance and didn't notice.

I then went to my friends (a group) and told F angrily that we had to calm the taxi driver down because he spilled his stupid beer and that he was dumb for coming back into the taxi with the beer. Admittedly, I was kind of enraged because of my discussion with the taxi driver still and that probably showed. Now here's where it gets hot: The taxi driver was of Turkish/Middle Eastern origin, however only had a slight accent and was nice to us. F said to me ""If he wants to make such a big deal out of it, he should just go where he belongs."" to which I replied ""Well if you think he should go where he belongs, why don't you go where you belong?"" I'm a very left-leaning guy and against racism or discrimination of any kind, so his comment annoyed me and in the heat of the moment I said what I said back, because in my mind those two comments are of the same kind - and I didn't say what I said to hurt him but just to point out how much of a massive hypocrite he was being.

1064,Not the A-hole,"Me and a few friends recently got the amazing chance to spend two weeks bike-packing across Normandy we’re all really close and in a peloton back home so we were all really excited.

 The whole area is geared up for World War II commemoration and memorial because of the 75th d-day anniversary a couple days ago and the anniversary of the liberations of many cities afterward.
So museums and memorials were a large part of the trip. 

The trip was going amazing and it was my first time going so places like the American cemetery and point du hoc were all very moving. The trouble that this post is concerning started when we came across a burial site for Nazi soldiers who died defending occupied France. When we’re done reading the plaques and were walking back, all my friends spat on the graves as they went past. They are all Jewish, so I could see where they were coming from, but I felt like that’s not a correct thing to do at a cemetery no matter who’s buried so I didn’t spit.

When I walked past without spitting as they’d done before me, one of my friends, that we’ll call Adam, looked at me funny and tilted his head. And we left and continued toward our hotel.

 Me and Adam were in the same room later that day and he asked me why I didn’t spit and I said that I don’t think it was right to do that to someone’s grave. He said “it’s not just *someone* it’s a Nazi. Why are you trying to defend them?” I said that I’m not trying to defend them, but whoever they are they’re still a person. He then said kind of coldly, “they didn’t think my great grandma was a person.”  I said I hadn’t thought about it like that and I was sorry and went to get some air. Mostly because I felt like there was no good response to what he said.

The subject never came up again. And we didn’t discuss it further. But I can’t help but feeling like they were in the wrong there, and this eye-for-an-eye stuff brings us nowhere.

1065,Not the A-hole,"This is extremely petty and the title makes me sound vain, I know...

I have very thick, coarse, and curly hair. It's not often that I straighten it, but I do when I want to switch things up and it makes trimming easier. I usually do my hair by myself but this time my mother kept insisting that she do it for me, but I refused. The reason why is because she's not the most patient person and you really need to take your time when it comes to hair like mine. She also doesn't like my hair texture and has tried to talk me into chemically straightening it multiple times, so I figured zero patience and a negative attitude would only makes things worse. I was about a quarter of the way done when she came into my room and said she wanted to try something with my hair. I asked her what she wanted to do and she didn't tell me; she just repeated that she wants to ""experiment"" with something.  My hair has been extremely damaged in the past. I put a lot of time and effort into nursing it back to health, so I don't really like the words ""try"" and ""experiment"" like my hair is some kind of toy or template to do whatever with it.

At this point I didn't have a choice, and she took over. I saw her put some oil in her hands and I immediately turned around and asked her not to apply oil as it will fry my hair and will make it stiff. Once again, she said she just wants to ""try"" something with it and did it anyway. I saw her pull out the flat iron and I realized she didn't use my heat protectant spray. I asked if she used it and she said yes. I asked if she was sure, and she said ""Just sit there and be quiet"", and proceeded to flat iron my hair with just oil. She liked the result, and I said I don't feel comfortable putting oil on my hair before using a flat iron and she said, ""Well I like it"" and then continued to do what she was doing.

As time went on, I noticed she was putting these giant, old Hollywood style curls in my hair, and I said I didn't want that, I just want my hair to be plain straight. Then the situation escalated and she started saying I was being a brat for making all these demands. She said she offered to do my hair ""out of the goodness of her own heart"" and that I was being ungrateful for making a bunch of criticisms. In my opinion, it's no longer out of the goodness of your heart if you're forcing someone to accept your help, and then forcing that same someone to accept your version of helping.

My parents were usually ""moderate"" in that they allowed me to take off the hijab and never wear it in the US. I also don't pray 5 times a day, and don't cook or clean. When I lived at home, my parents were strict. I wasn't allowed to have friends, wasn't allowed to go out or leave the house, and wasn't allowed to play music, watch shows/movies that weren't PG-13, and anything else banned under Islam. They are religious and they fast and pray. I was expected to fast during Ramadan when I lived at home.

Some have designated areas for people sitting with their laptops. The few cafes that do restrict it put up signs clearly specifying their policy.

As the waiter brought me my cake, he told me there were no laptops allowed in their cafe. I said sorry, I hadn't realized that since there was no sign anywhere, but said ok and in that case I'd like to cancel my order. He said it won't be possible to cancel my order because my coffee was already being made. He also said it's shitty that it has become the norm for people to work on their laptops in cafes, and that it's ruining the cozy atmosphere. I said I can take the coffee to go, but that the cake can easily be returned and that I won't pay for it. He said they didn't have any to-go cups.

As I'm loading it some guy walks by and tells me I'm disgusting and I wave him off, so he comes back and starts yelling how I'm everything wrong with America because I don't follow the rules and I'm ""making everything fucking harder for handicap people"". Now I just marked this guy off as being crazy but my GF actually partially sided with him saying I should have parked 30 feet away in the nearest spot. Am I the Asshole?

1081,Not the A-hole,"This is a person we both use to work with and i want to make it clear that is not the reason i have a problem with this. She is free to massage whoever until there's a conflict of interest to our relationship.

We met at Jimmy John's and she was one of those girls everybody wanted including this particular person. We've both moved on since to other jobs and professions. 

This is where the problems begin. He knows I'm dating her and one night when we were all out at a bar with coworkers he tried to dance on her while she was extremely drunk. First action of disrespect. Once she noticed she pushed him away. No big deal. She did what she needed to so nothing needed to be said. This was about 6 months ago. 

Next problem came about a few days ago with this guy. I was playing on her phone and he texted her saying how he's excited to smoke and drink with her for his massage. She's told me about everyone else she's planned to massage but him. We don't snoop through each others phones but I became alarmed and curious so I looked through their messages. I found where he tells her how good she looks and cute knowing she's dating me. She sends emojis and thanks. I feel like she should have said ""thanks but would you say that if my boyfriend was around?"" He wouldn't. In my eyes that's disrespect. And let it be known its completely different if its someone she doesn't know coming in for a massage telling her she's cute. That does not bother me. Its the fact that he knows im with her.

Also since she's still in school for massage therapy she does this privately at her home not in a business. If it wasn't private i probably wouldn't have as much of a problem with it. I have a hard enough time getting her to do massages for me topless because in her words its not professional. To me getting drunk and high with a client is also bery unprofessional. She thinks im asshole though because she's ""just trying to network"" for when she gets out of school

Edit: she's actually already done the massage and drank with him. She just admitted it. I've broken up with her and don't really know what to think about all this.",89,55,0.86

This is fairly minor compared to some things on this sub, but it's a conflict I have going on rn. So, I'm a vegan. I'm not an asshole about it or anything, I won't tell you you're a shitty person for eating animal products or anything, but I do do it for ethical reasons. I've been vegan since I was 16, so six years and was vegetarian for four years before that. 

Now, here's the issue. I babysit my 7 year old nephew for a couple of hours after school three days a week, plus full days every other Saturday. He's a great kid, and we always have fun. I keep my fridge and snack cupboard well stocked with plant based goodies, and he's always welcome to help himself. He's not a spoiled kid at all and never complains, but he did recently ask about Babybel cheeses. Now, I'm of the opinion that vegn cheese is shite, especially if you're used to ""real"" cheese, and even if it wasn't idk if there's any kind of vegan alternative for Babybels specifically. I just kinda told him ""oh sorry mate I don't have those"" and he said okay and had some crisps instead. I guess he mentioned it to my sister, because she's been nagging on at me for being a cruel uncle who refuses to buy his only nephew his favourite snack. I've explained that I just don't buy animal products but I'm willing to buy him any vegan alternatives to things he likes. This isn't good enough for her, and ahe keeps calling me a selfish weirdo for this. Idk where I stand. I don't really wanna put my ethics aside, but I can kinda see why she thinks I'm selfish.

1083,Asshole,"One of my cousins lost her husband this weekend. He was found dead in his truck. I don’t know the cause of death but he wasn’t murdered, that much I know. It was still unexpected. He didn’t have any life insurance so his widow is asking for help with the cost of his funeral. She’s has shitty job at a laundromat that pays minimum wage. I lost count on how many kids she had. I think she was up to 4 last I spoke to her.  We’re not close. The oldest is like 25 and the youngest is, i don’t know, like 10. She’s 46, so do the math 

We’re a large family and one of my other cousins organized a goFund me and has asked all of us to pitch in a couple hundred bucks. Myself and the rest of my cousins are doing okay for ourselves and a few hundred bucks isn’t a big deal.  Well... I don’t want to participate, and this is why:

1. This is the second time we pay for a funeral for her. Her son died of the flu. He had congenital heart disease and needed a lot of attention. She is antivax and would take him to Mexico for treatment because “these doctors don’t know anything”. We all helped because, c’mon it’s a dead child. 

2. She’s “Christian” and doesn’t believe in cremation. Which would be way less expensive than a whole funeral. She’s being a choosy beggar. 

3. Her husband was a grade A creep, with a history of drug use. Honestly, I think he overdosed. He was 35 and my cousin was 15 when she ran off with him. Her parents were just kinda “meh” about it. Unfortunately it’s not unusual in Latin-American countries.  

My brother says I’m being a judgmental asshole.
So...AITA?

Edit: I will accept my judgement, and yes give her money, but let me paint a better picture of my reason for my disdain.  Afterwards I will say no more. 
When her child past away, we (family) were sadden but not shocked. She was very noncompliant with doctor’s orders to the point that the pediatrician reported her to CPS. Nothing came of the investigation, child remained with her. When her child died she posted selfies with his dead body on FB with only the link to the goFund me. It was grotesque. And I guess I never forgave her? Idk if that’s even the right word. 
Her husband was abusive and controlling, (no surprised there) and I guess I feel like he should not get a big funeral like he was some great man. I know that’s not my call. I just can’t understand why after all the abuse she would even care. I guess for his kids, idk. 
Thanks for all the comments. They did make me “dig deeper” into the reasoning behind my actions. I won’t lie and say we’ll best buddies, but I’ll do what the rest of my family is doing for her.",71,177,0.84

1086,Everyone Sucks," 

I will be married 10 years in Sept. Her kid (my step daughter) just turned 18. I've been with her since she was 4 but she has NEVER showed any real love or affection towards me. Her dad is in her life. I intentionally did want want to be her ""father"" but more of a ""father figure"" in her life. Currently I have been paying for her car insurance and phone for the last 5 years. Her grandma pays for her car payment. She barely works. She is extremely lazy around the house doing absolutely NOTHING to help out. When we ask her to watch our kid she is the worst and does minimal. It's like she doesn't even care about her half sis.

&#x200B;

Months before she turned 18, I asked that her mom and her talk about what the game plan was going to be when she turned 18. Nothing happened. Big surprise.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to now, she just turned 18 and moves out of the house. Partly because her mom wanted her out and partly because she decided she wanted to leave on her own. Just like that. Moves in with her bio dad. I gave her a week to figure out what to do with her phone. Does she want it? Will her dad pay for it now? Does she want to cancel it costing me $? 

&#x200B;

I really don't think I should be paying for her phone or car insurance at this point but my wife still totally baby's her to the point that she's admitted that she's ""fucked up"" in raising a spoiled entitled self absorbed selfish child. But now mom says she will pay for her phone instead of me. Yes she works, but it is our money, not mine or hers is my belief. I really don't think we should do anything and let her grow up. Especially since she decided to put her big girl pants on and move out and take all her stuff with her.

&#x200B;

NOW her dad says he can't take her! I don't want her at the house. I want her to grow up. Had she gone to school we would have continued to pay for things as long as she got good grades etc. But the moment she decided to move out, to me, all bets are off. She needs to learn consequences and accountability with I have battled with my wife for her to learn but then again, I'm only her step dad so I feel like all I'm good for is $ to her and that hurts my feelings. AITA for not wanting to pay for her stuff anymore?

Update:  I just learned that she doesn’t want to move in until I move out because she says it is “toxic” in our house.  So she is actually trying to manipulate the situation so she can get rid of me and make me divorce my wife.  Really.  It might work.  We have fought over how to raise her for years.  And my wife has said, if it comes down to your or my daughter, I will always pick her.  So this is what I’ve had to deal with since she was around 8.  Powerlessness.",277,535,0.92

1089,Asshole,"Where to start?

Going into this I thought it was going to be a pretty low-key bachelor party. The buy-in was $250, which covered 1 night at a hotel and a Red Sox game. Another $36 was going to be needed for one of the activities we were doing that weekend (brewing beer). The best man told us all we would need from there was just money for food and whatever beer we wanted.

Except that was nothing like what happened. First restaurant we go to, I *literally ordered nothing* while the other guys picked 4 apps to share and bought beers. $374 bill. I had one slice of a flat bread pizza, one spare rib, and one egg roll. I get stuck paying $90. 

The other major cost was eating out at a restaurant Saturday night. I bought a $20 meal and one beer and again, ended up paying $50 because other people got more beers or more expensive meals. It was always a split.

When all is said and done, it ends up being a $500+ weekend for me.

On top of it, I don't even get a bed to sleep in on the hotel and have to sleep on the floor cause there are 4 beds and 5 of us. Groom + bestman slept in one room and the other 3 of us were in the room over and we were all talking the next morning (Sunday morning) about how ridiculously expensive this all came out to be, mostly due to best man not laying out expectations correctly and in my case, having to split bills which I hardly contributed to.

I'm thinking about dropping out of the wedding. It is in late July, over 1 month from now. I'm looking at another $600 in costs, between a $200 tux rental, $300 in hotel costs, and a $100 gift. I just can't do it right now, the Bachelor Party just fucked me and left a really bad taste in my mouth. 

AITA if I tell my friend I no longer want to attend his wedding? (I am in the wedding party)

---

Update 5 hours later: Thanks for all of the responses. Just wanted to chime in with what I am going to do as well as give a little bit of additional clarity behind why I was considering this. I want to say that I have read every single response that came through to my inbox today while I ponder over what to do, but now I must make a decision so I can take this off my mind and get focused on work. Basically, for the past month I felt like the $250 ""buy-in"" was a rip off as it was not great seats to a not great Red Sox game and 2 hotel rooms split between 5 people. I felt like the best man was being lackadaisical about the whole thing, maybe not out to make a quick buck but didn't really think it over. That had me pissed off.

On to the restaurant issue on Saturday. I really felt it would've overly complicated to ask to pay for my own portion of just the apps and the groom's share and sent out a bad vibe. So I didn't say anything. It sucked but I figured it was better than making things complicated.

So anyways. Today is the first time I've really had a clear mind after a weekend of drinking and I just felt really frustrated with the entire weekend. On top of it, I absolutely hate baseball. I felt cheated by paying towards the drinks of the entire bachelor party when I was holding back and not drinking at certain restaurants. I felt pissed off cause I had a shitty night of sleep on a hotel floor after only getting like 5 hours of sleep the night before. These aren't even things my friend wanted to do either; it was mostly the planning of the best man. 

I guess I am going to go forward with the wedding and just make it happen. Its the only real option. As much as I am pissed off with the situation, a lot of you made it clear that really in no situation should I ever skip out on this wedding if I want to remain friends with this kid. So that's what I am going to do. I am probably going to remain a little frustrated with the situation for the rest of the day, mainly because I hate wasting money on alcohol at bars (I did suggest we pregame at the hotel before going out but it fell on deaf ears somehow) but doubly so when its alcohol that I don't even get to drink. 

So, thanks for all of the responses. I read all of them and tried to factor in most of the little nuanced points some of you made. And it really did help me see the situation more clearly. I think some were a little harsh and/or immature but beyond that I mostly see both sides of YTA and NTA. I don't think IATA for wanting to skip it but its financially feasible for me so I will not skip it. I'm just in a bad mood and its Monday. 

Once again, thanks all for bringing some objective clarity to what was a very difficult and frustrating situation for me, and I am going to get on with my day now.",905,3665,0.96

A mate (17M) of mine (22M) passed away five years ago. We became super close after meeting in hospital, and our parents bonded. 

A friend of his parents is organising a fundraiser in his memory, and my parents have agreed to host it (we have a big field suitable for the size marquee they want). They agreed on the date and I was looking forward to attending and helping in any way I could. 

Situation:

The fundraiser has now been moved forward, which isn't a problem, except it's now on my birthday. I don't have a problem with it going ahead, but honestly, I don't think I can attend/help out. I don't want to spend my birthday feeling guilty for being alive when my mate isn't. I've been stressing about it for a week now and I don't know what to do.

I (25 M) and my girlfriend (25 F) have been together for around 4 years now. We have been living together renting out a place for 3 years now and everything has gone amazingly. We have a really strong relationship together and are looking at getting a mortgage. We are getting to the point in our relationship where we are thinking about taking our relationship to the next level with marriage, kids etc. 

I have a very well-paying job for my age in the UK (around £45K a year which can rise to easy £80K+). My girlfriend not so much, with salary of around £22K a year with not much progression. Whilst renting, I have always paid substantially more, but have never had a problem doing this due to the obvious gap in salary, and also, if anything ever went wrong in our relationship, I wouldn't lose out financially.

Anyway, I mentioned to my Dad how we are looking to get a mortgage together soon. He told me to not get a mortgage with her unless we both paid 50/50 down the middle. I told him this was not possible due to her salary and he told me to pay the full mortgage each month and take ""rent"" from my girlfriend to whatever she could afford. I asked why? So he explained how if she was named on the mortgage but only paid say £200 a month and i paid £800,  if we ever broke up, the mortgage would be split down the middle, leading to me losing out on a hell of a lot of money due to us being common law husband and wife after 2 years of living together.

I know in the past this happened to him with my Mother, and he has told me of friends that this has happened to. He said at the end of the day, it is my decision, but he was offering only a word of warning that he wishes I never have to experience.

I mentioned what my Dad told me to my girlfriend, and she said how she wouldn't be willing to do that, as if I was the only name on the mortgage and we split, I would keep all the money she has contributed to the mortgage. I understand where she is coming from, but I don't want to be financially stung in case our relationship ever goes sour.

1095,Not the A-hole,"Edit at bottom with update.

So I will try to keep this short. But a little back story.

I live wuth my dad, sister, and nephew. My 2 dogs and my sisters dog and my dads cat.

A couple of months ago my sister and her wife came to visit. They live about 10 hours away. When they were about 30 minutes away they call and tell my dad they have their 2 dogs. My dad would have been happier if they had asked (he would have said yes) so he could have put some gate ups in the house. So for 3 days we had 5 dogs it was a bit crazy but with my family it always is. 

Well my sister and SIL kept going to visit friends and would be gone for hours and would leave me to watch her dogs. (I'm disabled so I dont work). Their dogs kept peeing and pooping in the house it was driving me crazy but I didnt want to fight so i just cleaned up the mess and moved on.

Now fast forward to the present time. My dad and i are suppose to go visit and stay with my sister and SIL for a week over 4th of July. And dad asked her if I could being my 2 dogs. Now I have a 8 pound toy poodle and a 20 pound maltese/poodle mix. (My sister has two big hounds) My sister automatically said no. There was no ""let me think about it"" or ""let me talk to my wife"" it was just no. So then my day said okay how about just the Maltipoo. Still no. Her reasoning, she doesnt want 3 dogs in her house. 😒😒😒 I dont get it. 

Now one of the main reasons I want to bring my dogs (besides I just want to have them with me) is it's too much for my sister who is staying home to watch all 3 dogs, plus the cat and her son and she works longs hours. It's just to much for her, it's not fair to  burden her with all that. 

So we said if at least one of my dogs can't go then we are not going. 

So am I the asshole for not seeing my sister because she refuses to let me bring my dogs? (Also she lives in a 4 bedroom house on 10 acres of land so it's not like she doesnt have the space.)

This is my first post so please be kind. 🙂🙂🙂

Edit: Update on what finally happened. I had decided not to go because I was not going to put my sister, who was staying staying home, in a postion to take care of all of the animals, plus work full time (usually 10+ hour day) and she has a 3 year old. 

Originally my dad was still going to go. However after thinking it over for several days. He decided to ask my sister one more time to see if she'd change her mind. Well she didnt and she was actually extremely rude to him about it. She was just extremely disrespectful to our father. 

Well since he really did not want to drive 10 hours by himself, he told her he wasnt going. Now my dad used to travel the country all the time by himself for work. So he can do it but he is at a point in his life he'd feel more comfortable going with someone plus it was the original plan. Also he said he is tired of being basically dictated what to do by his kids whether we are adults or not. So if that means she doesnt allow me to bring my dog, which in turn means I cant go, then my dad wont go. 

So then she will either have to wait until my dad is willing to fly ( which he hates) or when my other sister can take off work and go with him instead. Since I'm disabled and dont work and dont have a child it's easier for me to take care of the animals by myself.",55,318,0.92

Although quite hurt, I made peace with the fact she was atleast being honest and split up as amicably as possible. I know for a fact she's never cheated on me for the duration of our relationship. 

Now, X is very irresponsible with money and mostly lives paycheck to paycheck. I've often had to lend her money to help out with her monthly expenses. Nothing very large, $100-200 here and there. To her credit, she's always paid me back and never once defaulted on any of her ""loans"". 

At the time we split, she owed me around $200. She did bring up the topic and said she'd pay me back asap and I was cool with it. 

Couple of days back I see my now ex posting Instagram stories of her partying and vacationing with her new boyfriend. I get kinda pissed and call her saying I need the money she owes me back right now because I need to pay for some unforseen expenses. She kinda gets the hint and pays me back within a day. But she tells me she knows what's up and calls me an asshole for putting her into unnecessary trouble. She says she had to ask her dad for the money. I chose to stick to my unforseen expense story. 

Now that I've cooled down a bit, I kind of feel shitty about doing what I did. Especially after I'd assured her she could pay me back whenever she could.

He is aware of it so I don't bring it up often, and aside from that he is a genuinely good person and a good friend so I enjoy hanging out with him.

He says he doesn't like to take showers. But at this point I find this disrespectful for other people, because he stinks a lot and with this heat the smell is even worse. And even for him, it's not good to not even scrub your body a bit with simple water. Plus, it's not like it takes much time at all.

So, after we talked about it, I told him what I thought etc and he just told me ""I just don't like it much..."" I told him he was going to be sweaty and stinky to which he replied ""I know"" and after that he changed the topic and said he was coming over tomorrow. Honestly I didn't know what to do at this point so I just told him ""Not if you're sweaty and stinky"". I think he was vexed but he told me he was going to shower.

I've been friends with this girl we'll call Mia for about two years now. We've never been super close by any stretch of the imagination, but we've certainly been in the same friendship group. To be honest I've always found her...a lot. She's the type of person who will post on Facebook about feeling miserable and then say she doesn't want to talk about it when people ask. 

Anyway, about six months ago Mia and I discovered that we both suffer from the same mental health condition. I won't get specific so as not to reveal too many identifying details, but it's a pretty shitty condition which comes with a whole host of pretty intense symptoms. I went through hell with it in years past, but am dealing much better now. I believed she was too, and told her if she did ever wanna talk with someone who knew she could talk to me. She told me the same. 

Honestly, I regret telling her this. It feels like every day she's calling me with some new problem, usually crying on the phone for up to an hour. I get that our condition can make tiny things seem like catastrophes but the things she calls me and cries about are varied and endless. Anything from a fight with her parents, with whom she has a horrible relationship, to the supermarket having no milk left so she can't have any tea tonight. I feel like this would take a lot of energy and be draining even for a neurotypical person. With my condition, it's downright exhausting. Especially given she more often than not ghosts me if I try to talk to her about my own issues bc she doesn't have the energy to help me out that day. 

So here's my situation. I've tried talking to Mia about maybe switching therapists/getting more therapy (I've used her current therapist myself in the past and honestly he's not great), but she insists this is working for her. She doesn't like to take medication, which I believe would help, but okay that's her decision. Point is, she doesn't really seem to be making any proactive steps to improve and I don't know if I can handle her at full-tilt any more. The issue is I'm kinda the only person apart from her therapist she can really talk to about mental health things. None of our other friends have the condition so, while sympathetic, can only help so much. As I mentioned she has a shitty relationship with her family and can't really talk to them about it. If I cut her off, I'm essentially taking away her one outlet in order to save my own mental health. I just feel like that's disgustingly selfish, and idk if it's worth it.

This is something I'd never even consider cause of lack of money, social status, accomplishment but he honestly does not seem bothered by this. Still I feel as if he will end up regretting it long term when he's older, which is why I've suggested to my wife cutting him off and then seeing if he still feels the same way after he graduates.

1104,Asshole,"Earlier this week I went and got a massage from a place I've been to once before and really liked. The time I went before was my first ever massage, and I was super excited about going again. When I got in, I got undressed, I laid on the table, yada yada, and the masseuse started my massage. But I mean, he didn't ""really"" start it.. he was just using one hand and moving it with way to much pressure up the side of my spine. My first thought was that he must be on his phone or doing something else that had him distracted and the real massage was about to start. But it didn't. He did this same move, with only one hand, for 40 minutes. I felt so uncomfortable interrupting him but it was just the worst. I finally spoke up and said I needed to use the bathroom. I stood up and got dressed and took my purse, phone, everything with me to ""use the bathroom"". I did end up walking over to the bathroom, and then realized that the exit was the other way. I tried to get up to reception sneakily, but my masseuse was waiting at the door of the room, basically standing in the hallway. I walked by him and held up a finger to say ""just a minute"" and headed on over to reception. I told the guy, ""I'm leaving and I don't want you to charge me."" He was shocked and apologetic, but I just hurried on out of there. It was such a weird experience and I wasn't going to waste my money by staying there. I realize I could have said something to the masseuse, but I was feeling so awkward about the situation, and I didn't know what to say. ""Uhh could you do a better job?""",43,50,0.85

1106,Asshole,"I'm a teacher so I get about 2 months off every summer but my mom, sister, aunt, and cousin all work regular 9-5 jobs with 2-3 weeks off a year, so it's really difficult to organize time for trips where we can all go. We managed to schedule a girls trip to Cabo from June 1st to 9th. Made payments (almost $3K a person) several weeks prior to the trip and were all very excited to go to Mexico and bond -- I'm best friends with my sister & cousin, and my mom and aunt are identical twins so we're all a very close group.

My boyfriend & I have been together for 2 years. His family lives across the country so I only see them twice a year and it's usually pretty quick. No real one-on-one bonding with anyone in his family but we're all definitely friendly with one another. We like each other's posts on FB/IG, send happy birthday wishes, stuff like that. 

A few days before we left, my boyfriend's mom passed away unexpectedly. I spent days attached to his hip, supporting him, wrote the email to his work explaining what happened, cleaning the apartment, making sure he ate, called his dad & siblings and expressed my condolences, booked his flight, helped him pack, etc. He asked me to go to the funeral with him. I felt so, so, so bad telling him no. I hardly knew his mom and feel like I already committed myself to the trip with my family. He was heartbroken and begged me to go with him for support but I told him that his whole family is there and if anything it's a special time for them all to recount memories of their mother/wife/sister/daughter. 

He asked if he gave me $1500 ""could you go on the trip sometime later? you have two more months off. I know you won't get some deposits back, so I'll give you this money"" and I honestly felt so bad but the thing isn't the money (although obviously as a teacher, I'm not swimming in money) but it's about how this is the *one* time a year that the women I'm closest to can go together.

My mom & aunt told me ""we want you to come with us, but it's ultimately up to you"" whereas my cousin & sister were like ""you should definitely come with us, it'll ruin the trip for us if you're not there, just come, etc.""

My boyfriend was upset and left mad at me, I called/texted a bunch but he didn't respond until days later, anyways I went to Mexico and came back on the 9th and things have been weird with us. Sometimes he's really close with me like usual other times I can tell he's mad I didn't go with him. He said he's not furious at me but just disappointed and sad that I chose to go party instead of be there with him. Says he would've dropped anything for me, keeps emphasizing that I have 2 months of vacation, but he doesn't get that no one else in the group has that kind of vacation time, I really couldn't reschedule.

1110,Not the A-hole,"I’m 99% sure I’m the asshole, but Reddit, I need your help.

So about a year ago, I asked my dad about buying a new laptop. Now my work (cartooning) I found is best on this really specific laptop that cost about $800. My dad agreed, and said that we could look into one as long as I agreed to pay for *half* of the price of it. 

While looking, I repeatedly brought up that I did NOT want a Macbook (Not only because it’s terrible for my work, but because we have 4 other Macs at home) and that I wanted the really specific laptop. My dad knew about this.

Christmas time rolls around, and lo and behold, my dad bought me a MACBOOK PRO. I genuinely pretended to be really happy, but I was really kinda upset. The laptop was almost $1800 and my dad told me I needed to hold up my end of the deal, and pay for half ($900!!!) which is more than the laptop I wanted in the first place.

Now about a year later, after I have paid my $900 in debt, I have made countless cartoons on this thing. My Dad couldn’t be more proud of himself. One day recently he brought up, “See? Aren’t you glad I bought this Mac instead of that other computer?”

And I told him that no, I was not glad, because I had to pay $500 dollars more than I would have on the other laptop, and that I didn’t even need this one since we have a bunch at home already. I said that this computer has terrible performance, and has no support for some of my animating/drawing software that I was also saving up money for. 

I immediately regretted it after seeing the look on my dad’s face. He got incredibly angry, and said “Well then, you wouldn’t mind if I took it away then.” and I got grounded. My family is all telling me that I’m the definition of an entitled brat, and that I need to be more grateful that he was willing to spend that kind of money on me.

I feel really bad, but I still think I was somewhat justified. AITA?

Edit: I’m 13, and could not get a job and buy the laptop I wanted with my own money. My parents look after my spending, and I can only buy what they approve of (fair enough). My dad only approves of Apple.

1112,Not the A-hole,"I recently helped my roommates move across the country (I paid the security deposit and 4 months worth of rent by myself), and so far everything is fine. Previously, they had a very terrible roommate, and they complained about everything she did, including how loud her and her boyfriend were during sex. I'm a very sexual person and I made it VERY clear when we were first talking about moving in together. I'm bisexual, into BDSM and my boyfriend and are in an open relationship. I definitely get around. 

When we were looking for apartments together, they said that they wanted to make sure that the bedrooms did not share walls, so we found a floor plan where there is a master bathroom that separates the two bedrooms. I thought this was so that any sex noises would be muffled. Which is fair, no one wants to hear other people having sex. I've lived with at least 12 other people (during college one of my roommates subletted over the summer) and no one has every complained or told me that they heard me having sex. Before they moved in I mentioned that the walls were insulated well and you really couldn't hear someone masturbating or having sex through them. 

Since moving in, they've made it clear that they don't want me to have sex at the apartment with them there at all but they rarely ever leave the apartment. Had they told me about this before we moved in together, I would never have agreed to live with them. Before this was communicated to me, my boyfriend and I did have sex multiple times while they were home and no one heard anything. 

I explained that they couldn't hear through the walls if I shut my bathroom door, and I tried to compromise with them. I was fine with limiting my dates to the weekends, and only having loud sex with my boyfriend at his place, but they do not wish to compromise at all. I told my boyfriend about this and he is very angry because he thinks I'm being taken advantage of and he thinks I should be able to do whatever I want in my own home.

1113,Not the A-hole,"MINOR UPDATE: My partner is seemingly more positive towards the idea of counseling, and we're going to start that. We've also had another conversation about living separately that went better than before with regard to our ability to continue on good terms as well as me seeing the kid if we end up breaking up. There's still a lot of unknowns and no guarantees, but things seem a little less bleak regardless of whether we live together and/or continue our relationship. Also getting some grounding as far as where I stand and whether it's reasonable has been really helpful in keeping our communication more sane and balanced in general. Thanks for your help, everyone.

Throw away account because they're on Reddit. This also might be a little choppy in my attempts to anonymize everyone involved, sorry.

I've been living with this person for several years, and we had moved in together quickly and at a pretty young age. Partner's kid was basically a baby when we started dating, and I've had a big role in raising the kid.

I'm a non-smoker and my partner smokes in the house. They know how I feel about this, and when we first moved in together it wasn't supposed to happen but there you go. Since then we've tried to have compromises about it but they all result in me being constantly congested and disappointed and our house stinking like an ashtray. My partner doesn't ever smoke around the kid, though, and usually doesn't smoke around me although sometimes does if I don't remove myself from the area.

We're not married and I don't feel confident that I'd be allowed time with the kid since legally it wouldn't be required. If I decide to move out and it results in an end to the relationship I may be essentially abandoning this kid when I've served as a parent (their other bio-parent has limited access to them).

We've been arguing a lot lately and my partner expresses the belief that I'm primarily responsible for the problem, while I disagree and we each cite manipulation as a problem in the other's behavior. Attempts to resolve this have gone nowhere so far although we are still trying.

I'm finding myself increasingly unhappy with the living situation, and ideally I'd like to see if living apart eases some of the issues and tension. However, this would potentially complicate things for the kid, as well as financially for my partner. At one point I expressed interest in living separately and my partner made it clear that I would be the asshole and that it would probably cause them to leave the relationship. Because of this, I have not brought it back up yet but I still feel like it may be physically healthier for new and emotionally healthier for both of us. Would it be an asshole move to (giving advance notice of course) move out at the end of our lease? If not, would it be to move out (again with notice) before the lease is up?

1115,Not the A-hole,"So my wife really wants another child. We have a few, all under 7, youngest still in diapers.

Each pregnancy has been harder and harder for my wife. This most recent one she had horrible sickness and physical pain, and her emotional stress was horrible. She was, justifiably and understandably, in an absolutely horrible mood. Even she freely admits that. 

Pretty much all that came out at me. I was at fault for everything. If I did the dishes, I did them too loudly and it woke her up. If I bought her a gift to make her feel better I was spending money we didn’t have on stupid crap she didn’t want. If I tried giving her foot massages or back rubs my hands were sweaty and disgusting and it made her want to vomit. 

Because of all this, she had absolutely zero sex drive. My wife has never had an orgasm. She was a virgin when we got married. She refuses to go to therapy about it, but that’s her choice. In her mind she just can’t, so no real point in trying. We had sex twice between when she found out she was pregnant and had the baby, then none for about 6 months after that. The two times we did it was miserable. She just laid there, silent and still, then got mad at me for saying we had to have sex and then not doing it. She had no desire for physical closeness or intimacy with me even of non sexual nature - no holding hands, no cuddling, no kisses even on the cheek. All of it was annoying to her.

Even after the baby was about 3 months old, she didn’t want to start having sex again. In her words at that time, she would rather have a loving roommate than a sexual partner. I feel she maybe had PPD, but she never went to a doctor about it. 

Flash forward a few months, and we had another talk about the lack of intimacy. She actually asked if maybe we should just get a divorce. I shut that down. She mentioned maybe I should get a friend with benefits but that’s not what I want. 

Several books, retreats, sessions and many months later her willingness to participate in sex is back, and she seems to genuinely enjoy it. Her body had returned to normal as well now that she is not breastfeeding, and she is back on her birth control which manages her horrible cycle, which I know helps. 

She told me she wants to have another baby. I told her no, and she insisted to know why. I finally told her it’s because I think our marriage can’t survive another pregnancy. She got very angry, for several reasons: 1) she feels as though I am blaming her for how hard her pregnancies are 2) she feels I am saying that me not having sex for a few months is somehow worse than all the crap she suffers through and finally 3) she feels I am an asshole if I think our marriage can’t survive a year without regular sex. To her, that places too high of a priority on it, and it shows a superficial requirement to our relationship. In her eyes, if I feel that way I very well might not think our marriage could survive if she got obese, got old, got horribly injured, etc.",374,1396,0.96

1118,Asshole,"Sorry if the title is confusing. Throwaway for all the usual reasons. Apologies for formatting, I am on mobile. I think I'll probably be TA but I leave the final judgment up to you, my family of Reddit strangers.

A little background: my SO and I will have been together 2 years come August. We do live together. He has two kids from his previous marriage, a son (11) and a daughter (turning 8); their mom is not in the picture anymore as of this year so they both live with us. He is 38 and I am 22, if that makes any difference.

Last Saturday was the oldest child's birthday. He was going to go to a sleepover with friends in the evening so his father and I wanted to take him out for lunch. I offered to drive since my SO had been to the dentist in the morning and was still a little loopy. We all had a good time—there was lots of laughter and many silly and serious pictures. 

On Sunday, I noticed that my SO had made a post about the lunch on Facebook. When I opened the post up I quickly realized that I was not in a single picture. Every photo he posted had only combinations of him, his son, and his daughter. There was zero mention of me. It was like I never even went to the lunch. 

Frankly, I was hurt. I have talked to him about 'hiding' me before when he mentioned that his mom still doesn't even know I exist. She definitely knew about his ex girlfriend—his mom sent him a Christmas package when I was already in the picture and it included a gift for the ex. His mom didn't even know they'd already been separated for a while by that point. I understand not wanting to broadcast our relationship as not everyone is comfortable with the age gap, but it seems to be skirting the edges of overkill, to me. I did ask him straight up a while ago if he is trying to hide me, and his answer was a resounding 'no.'

So here is the WIBTA part. I am considering leaving a comment on his post. Something like 'Looks like you guys had fun!' or 'Looks like you three had fun!' Innocuous enough to the innocent FB bystander, but definitely calling him out since he knows I was also there. I am honestly a bit insulted by the fact that he deliberately went through and chose pictures that didn't have me in them for his post. I've been with him through thick and thin, including a recent tragedy after which any (probably sane) 22-year-old would have packed up and left. I didn't because I love him and I love his kids. I consider them to be my family. So why is he trying to give the impression online that I'm not in his life? Am I just being immature and entitled, overreacting? WIBT passive aggressive A if I comment on his post? 


Tl;dr— bf deliberately left me out of one of his FB posts so I am considering leaving a comment on the post.


Edit: To anyone who's interested, though I doubt there are many. I did talk to him. He got mad at me for being hurt about the pictures. He derided me and said that I don't matter and basically ended the issue with 'oh am I supposed to include your selfies? Yeah, we have SOOO many good pictures with you to include.'

1119,Not the A-hole,"I am 17. I write a lot in my free time.

My dad has been wanting me to ""publish"" a book for a long time now. I come from a family that's not rich per se but we live comfortably enough to afford a few things. My parents are parents, they're utterly obsessed with my writing and think it's godsend. I have a few national awards under my belt so I'm not a joke or anything but suffice it to say self publishing is pretty much a joke-- anyone can self publish anything if you have the $ to do it, I'm pretty sure amateur furry fanfics have been hardbound on Amazon, but my parents think a self-published book will make a good feature for my resume or something. At my age it would be very difficult for me to get published by a major publishing house, even if  am indeed a good author for my age-- I still have a lot of growing and refining to do to get to a professional level of authorship.

For a yearish my dad has been pressuring me to ""write a novel"" and I REALLY don't want to. Partially I've fallen out of the habit of writing since I've been busy with school and other activities, but also I don't want to self publish something I'll be embarrassed by later. For context when I was 13 my parents self published stuff I had written when I was 10-11... complete with embarrassing illustrations, and now people ask about it all the time. I hate it. I don't want something like that to happen again with this book, 8 years from now, when I am trying to get my foot in the door at a major publishing house or at a normal job or whatever.

So my dad has been pressuring me to write this, and I know if I didn't write it there would be consequences, so I just compiled a bunch of short stories I wrote for school and stuff and gave him that, around 60ish pages of work, just to shut him up for a while.

It's only now that he's starting to read through it and I realized I put some stuff in there that I would not want to be put out there-- content that is triggering for me, that's inspired by eating disorders I had that I kept hidden from my parents, etc. And that I don't want to tell my parents about anyway. So my dad is asking me about this story and I say, sorry I don't want that one to be in the book, I'm deleting it. Then he says no, it's good, keep it in... goes on like this back and forth for like 5 min. I get pretty adamant and admittedly lose my temper pretty majorly because this is pretty sensitive content to me (my dad doesn't know why though) and call him a psychopath. Then he calls me a rotten misbehaving spoilt brat and an asshole, tells me I am a child and to ""get in line and know your place"", that I better ""shape the fuck up for college"", and says just because I wrote 10 pages doesn't mean I get to choose what happen to them, and that I gave him this manuscript a year ago and said it was ""finished"" so why am I throwing a fit now, etc. He has some good points, and I know I shouldn't have lost my temper, but Istill feel that it is ultimately my work and I should be able to choose what happens to it, even if he is my dad.

1123,No A-holes here,"First some background. I’m a happily married man with a 2.5yr old daughter living a fairly normal suburban life. However, I have a bizarre and unusual phobia, pittakionophobia. It’s a fear of stickers. Remember that time you saw a bandaid floating around the public pool and thought ewwww? Slap a pool bandaid on a couple hundred apples at the grocery store and that’s how my brain processes those little stickers on fruit. It’s totally disgusting, makes my skin crawl, but in a pinch I can cut off the section of the apple with a sticker on it.

I’ve built a reality around my phobia. My wife peels off stickers from things she buys. If I shop it’s generally at either Costco or the farmers’ market where fewer things have stickers. My issue was pretty manageable until I had a daughter.

I knew this would happen. Kids love stickers, everyone knows that, but what happens if they don’t exist growing up? Is it nature or nurture? I survived 2.5 years with a sticker-free child except for the occasional bandaid.

Here’s what happens. She got smart and learned you need an injury to get a bandaid and bandaids are the only form of sticker she can get. She started faking injuries and claiming booboos to get the thing she wants.

My wife thinks I should seek cognitive behavioral therapy and let her be a kid. I’m of the opinion that kids had perfectly fine childhoods for thousands of years before stickers existed. I can’t imagine I’m ruining her life with this and I'd rather avoid my admittedly weird phobia if I can.

There’s no guarantee of success with that, but having a designated “sticker time” while Daddy's running errands seems like a very good stop gap.

1124,Not the A-hole,"Last week my mother called to ask if her step cousin and his son from the village could stay at my apartment for about 3 weeks because the son was going to take some tests to apply for scholarships in the city. 

I guess I am what you call a neatfreak. I hate messiness and dirty things. My apartment is always in a clean, deodorized and neat condition. So the thought of having people that I don't really know at my place seemed a bit unpleasant.  
But I could not say no. They have no other relatives here and don't know anybody and staying at a hotel or an inn is too much of a luxury for them. Besides my mother is really close with her stepfather and his family. So I said yes.

They have been staying at my place for almost 2 weeks now. And to say they're lazy is an understatement. They did not do the dishes after breakfast, lunch etc. They let the trash can pile up and overflow its receptacles. There were food crumbs on the counter and all over the kitchen. 
And because I have only one bedroom, I bought a king size matress for them to sleep on in the living room. And they always fell asleep with all the lights and tv on. Not to mention that they always snooze until noon! 

I have tried to talk to them about it many times. I tried to say it politely. ""Could you please do the dishes and take the trash out in the morning?"" and ""Don't forget to turn the tv and all the lights off before you go to bed.""
At first they seem to understand. But after a few days, they always seem to forget somehow, which is frustrating because I feel bad having to tell them all over again. I talked to my Mom about it and she said she understood how upset I was. But they have nobody else to help them and no place else to stay.  She asked me to just put up with it because they're family and they're less educated than I am so they have no idea about what to do when you're staying at someone else's place. I just needed to be the bigger person. Besides it's only for a couple of weeks. 

Last night after a rough day at work, I went home to find them snoring in the living room with all the lights and tv on again. There were empty bottles of beer and cigarette butts scattered around on the floor. I'd tolerated them not doing the dishes and letting the tv on all night long but I decided I've had enough. 

I spoke on the phone today with my Mom and I told her that I will have to tell them to leave if they're still acting like they're in their own house. She was so upset about it.

This is the 2nd year we’ve gone here in addition to recommending it to friends and family based on our last positive experience. They apparently changed owners since last time and now they suck

We paid $300 for the kids party plus another $150 for food for adults. At the end of the party they said we had to pay an extra $50 for the adults who sat at the tables in the general seating area during the party. They said even though we bought food they still have to pay to sit at the tables. Mind you we’ve spent over $1,000 there in the last year and they want to charge us $50 extra to “rent” the table for 2 hours 

We went around and around in circles with the manager and owner about how ludicrous this is. They said we had to pay it because we signed it as part of the contract. So I asked to see the contract I signed. It mentioned NOTHING about a table rental fee. Then they said we just had to pay for them since it was their “policy”. We continued to refuse but gladly offered to pay for the food and drinks we consumed (obviously). They said our 2 choices were pay up for everything (including the tables) or have the cops called on us.

1127,Not the A-hole,"My parents got divorced about five years ago. Ever since then she has been extremely unstable. For awhile she had a great job that paid all her bills, but she quit on a whim. Now she is only working part time.

I just graduated college and have a great job that pays well. I live in a townhouse with a roommate and it’s my safe space. I finally got away from the toxic environment I had while living with my dad while in school. Living on my own has caused my anxiety to lessen significantly.

Every month she asks me for hundreds of dollars to pay her bills and I give it to her and never ask for anything back. Things are getting worse for her and she wants me to get my own place so she can come live with me. She promises that she will pay rent. But she can’t even pay her rent now so my bills would go up while I’m trying to save for my future.

Apologies that the line up is a bit complicated but I’ll try to lay it out as best I can. 

My family is going on a group vacation this summer. We are pooling our resources to rent a nice property on the beach for a week. My husband and I are (unfortunately) taking the lead on planning and organization. 

It will be me, my husband and our two kids, my brother, his wife, and their 3 kids, plus my parents. (Kids’ ages range from 3 to 9). In addition, my sister, her husband and their girlfriend are invited.

We initially only invited my sister and her husband,  but my sister insisted that their girlfriend (who I think they’ve been dating for 9 months or so) be included as well. 

My sister is in a polyamorous relationship and, although my family and I don’t get all of the nuances, we have tried to be understanding. So as a compromise we said that her girlfriend could come, but we asked that everyone  please refrain from any PDA in front of the kids. We were planning to just refer to the girlfriend as a friend of the family. 
My sister was not happy with this suggestion and is now, once again, saying that she will not go on the trip under these circumstances. 

At this point, everyone else is exhausted with the subject and all for letting her exclude herself from the trip. I’m conflicted though. She’s my sister and I obviously love her. But I also think my other family members are trying their best in a touchy situation.

1131,Not the A-hole,"  

Throw away account and all that.

This happened a few years ago and I've always wondered if I was an a-hole.

Was on vacation with my family and we got up really early, drove to a national park a few hours away, hiked a lot, and then headed back towards our hotel at night. We were all exhausted (me especially, as I did all the driving the entire day) and hungry and looked for a place to eat we entered the city again.

We chose one of those salad places where you get your salad first and then pay.

There are 2 sides of the salad bar you can go on with a register at each end. My lady and our 2 teenage daughters are going down the line, with me behind them. 

A young mom, her dad, and the mom's 1 year-old girl come in line behind me. Grandpa is holding the baby and is right next to me with the mom behind him. When I say right next to me, I mean like practically touching shoulders. The baby is holding a little stuffed toy, so of course it's in her mouth.

Suddenly a slobbery wet toy lands in my plate. I just stared at this uninvited topping on my salad. Grandpa picks up the toy from my plate. I honestly don't recall if he said anything beyond ”oops"" or something else non-apologetic.

I was really annoyed, but not mad. He really should have seen this coming and been a little more careful, but whatever. I sighed and walked to the back of the line, handed an employee my plate and said, ""Can I give this to you? *Something* was dropped on my plate."" I might have put a little snark on the ""something.""

Of course the mom heard me and was not happy. I don't recall the exact conversation, but it went something like:

Mom: ""She's just a baby!""

Me: ""And I didn't say anything to you.""

I took a new plate and went on the other side of the line so I wouldn't have to stand next to them, forgetting I'd have to pay separately at the end of the line since my lady and our girls were almost to their register.

Mom: ""What kind of person would get mad at a baby?""

Me: ""Maybe you should watch your kid better.""

She said something else I don't recall, but I replied in a very tired voice, ""I've been driving all day, I'm exhausted, I just want to eat."" She said something else I don’t recall, but never apologized. I started getting those angry shakes and just said, ""Be a parent!"" That was it.

By now, my lady is ready to pay on her side and looking at me wondering WTF was I doing on the other side. She didn't see/hear anything that happened.

Meanwhile, a lady that was now behind me in line witnessed the last half of what happened and said, ""I'm sorry you're having a bad day"" and offered me a coupon. I couldn't tell if she was siding with me or just trying to diffuse my frustration.

1132,Not the A-hole,"My nephew is 21 and got a seasonal job this summer that my husband and I are far closer to than his parents and we love spending time with him and have a spare room, so we have an agreement he can stay with us for the summer paying a small rent, we get ahead on our mortgage, he gets a good place for way cheaper than any apartment would be. We only live 40 miles from my sister, but that makes a huge commuting difference. 

A couple weeks ago I caught him smoking marijuana in his room. It's not legal in our state but decriminalized and hardly enforced in my city. I told him he could do it as long as he doesn't bring in any amount over the decriminalized limit. I don't give a shit about marijuana despite not using it, I've let friends use it at our house before.

Talking to my sister recently she asked if he had been using any, she found some in his room at home and he's not allowed to have it. Frankly I don't think it's her business, he's an adult, he might live with her most of the year (he goes to community college and worked a part time retail job before this summer) but she doesn't get to control what he does outside of her house. Plus I think it's silly he's allowed to get drunk but not have a joint even if he can legally drink alcohol, and if I didn't allow it in the house he'd probably just go smoke it somewhere else less safely.

One day we were hanging out and I had an appointment to view an appointment so I decided to bring him along. I didn't like the apartment so didn't take it.

AITA for not wanting to change back to my maiden name after my divorce 8 years ago? Mostly, I kept my married because I don't want to have a different surname to my son, but it's also because I have had this name for most of my adult life and it's part of my identity. Everything I have achieved: my degree, masters, career and being a mother, I have done with this name, so I kept it.

Anyway, I recently started seeing a guy and everything was cool until he learned I was using my ex's name. He didn't say much at first, but gradually he started making little snide comments until eventually he came right out and asked me to change it to my maiden name. I said no. He asked if I would compromise and change it when my son is grown up (we've already agreed to never marry) and I still said no because I feel like it's my name and part of me.

It ended in a row with him giving me an ultimatum that either I change it or we're through as he did want his gf to have another man's name, to which, I told him we were through as I didn't want to be with anyone who would give me an ultimatum.

I don't think I'm in the wrong, but since we broke up, his sister and friends have messaged me and met me in the street and told me that I was unreasonable and wouldn't see things from his side. Am I the asshole?

He said he would be right back but he didn't come back. We didn't speak for long, but I felt a  connection to him. We had a lot in common and I wanted to speak to him more. 

So I searched up one of the friends names on Facebook (it had been said earlier), went through it, and found him in their friends list. His account was semi public, so you could see some photos and old posts, but not all for some reason. I scrolled for a bit and I learned some things about him without even meaning to. Then I requested some people on the previous friend's list and hoped they'd be friends with him too, and eventually a few accepted (I will admit I did join some's Facebook groups and talk to them in there so they would accept) and then we eventually had mutual friends! So then after a week of this I requested him. He accepted it. I messaged him asking if he was the guy at the party and said how much of a coincidence it is we already had mutual friends and he showed up as a suggestion for me to add (maybe this lie wasn't very good, no). He said yes and we started talking. I watched his favourite shows and listened to his music so we'd have something in common too (I DID legitimately enjoy them, I didn't lie) We then just started talking, he asked me on a date, and now we've been in a great relationship for 8 months.

1138,Not the A-hole,"After we married, my spouse started a bi-weekly game night leaving me solo (I was invited to join, but declined). Game lasts 5ish hours and game night is sacred it’s a long term RPG & everyone tries hard not to miss

&#x200B;

Then we had a kid and spouse took a break. When kid turned 1, my spouse returned to the bi-weekly game leaving me to parent. Off week was family time. After a few years - about the time our kid got past the terrible 3's and became a cool person - spouse said ""Hey, you're (OP) getting a bi-weekly solo night with kid. I (spouse) want solo time with kid. Lets do this, every other week I'll (spouse) do game night and you (OP) get solo kid night. On the game off week, I'll (spouse) do solo night with kid and you (OP) get night to yourself to make up for game night""

&#x200B;

Kid #2 came and kid #1 starting doing extracurricular stuff outside of school. Spouse took 2-3 months off from game night after kid #2 came along. Once game night restarted, the new plan was to use baby sitter. Game night week, babysitter got baby, I (OP) got solo night w/ older kid, spouse did game night. Off week, babysitter got baby, spouse got solo night with older kid, I got night to myself

&#x200B;

As we move forward, the amount of family time we have erodes. A year ago kid #1's sport schedule changed and a new family schedule started - kid 1 has practice early on a weeknight, too early for fam dinner (we lose another evening as a family) . Spouse says ""I'll (spouse) take kid 1 out for dinner and then to early practice, you (OP) and kid 2 do your own thing"". Then spouse realized they were getting 2 solo nights with kid one so they converted the non-game-night night with kid into solo no kid night for just them. I was OK with this because spouse would invite me to join (date night!) or since this solo night was not as sacred as a game night it was open to being canceled to make up for family time

&#x200B;

Then, spouse makes a friend who learns about game night and says ""I haven't done that in years! We should do one"". And they do on what was the ""off week"". So, now my spouse is playing in 2 games, 5 hours each and now game night is every week. I was invited to join, I declined because I'm not into this stuff.

This is where I said it was too much. My spouse claimed I can't tell them what to do with their time. This night (the game off night) was their night and I have no say about them doing a game. I said it was only your solo night b/c of some changes to the packed schedule and I have the right to ask for more family time. I said that based on our current lives (2 working parents of 2 kids who are doing stuff) that you getting a \*weekly\* 5 hr game night was unreasonable. My spouse said this was being manipulative and that I don't have any say in how they spend their time since the night was already theirs

1139,Not the A-hole,"A little backstory:

I am a white male from Kosovo. We ran away from the war in 90s and pretty much sold everything for very little money. Long story short, we ended up in Compton, LA. I grew up being a part of the gang and still don't know how I wasn't killed or in jail. I did well in school and got a full ride to Berkley and currently, in the PhD program in Boston, MA.

&#x200B;

I have a colleague. He is a skinny white guy and overall, he is a cool dude. We were working on some projects and we became friends. Not the best friends but we still good friends. He was raised up in Richmond Hill in Canada and last summer, I went there to spend a weekend with his family.

&#x200B;

Now, this guy (let's call him Adam) loves rap music. He is a huge fan of Kendrick Lamar, Dr. Dre, Eminem etc. Occasionally, when he gets excited, he says something like: ""Damn, I owned this code, like Biggie owned 'Pac"" or ""This nigga got nothing on me"" (he was referring to a problem in the homework, that was particularly challenging). Also, he cannot drink. I mean he gets drunk after one beer and he starts acting like he is Creep or he is in a gang. It's awkward and in some weird way, funny.

&#x200B;

We are having a conference in Berkley in couple of weeks and I am planning to take couple of evenings to go see my friends in Compton. This came up during a lunch conversation and now, Adam is all excited and wants to come with me to see the ""hood"". Compton is not as bad as it used to be but nevertheless, it's not exactly the safest place on earth. I grew up in Compton and I would be with my friends and they are known on the streets, so I am not too stressed about myself. However, having Adam by our side adds a slight problem; I have told him once that he might get in troubles if he keeps acting like that but it didn't work. He might control himself in the beginning but as soon as he gets comfortable or drunk, that's a different story. Guys in Compton won't be really asking questions and having a long conversation about why it's not OK to say ""was good, my main nigga"". And if/when something goes down, there are very little things I will be able to do to help Adam.

1143,Asshole,"Throwaway account because people from our town would know who we are.

My wife and I were both brought up in very conservative christian homes. We’ve known each other since early childhood and were married three years ago at 19. We’re both christians but neither of us are anywhere near as conservative as our parents and don’t plan to lead the same type of lives as they have. Our marriage is great, we love each other a great deal and always talk about how we feel.

Anyway: We told everyone that we weren’t going to prevent pregnancies when we were married but as my wife had just started college and neither of us felt ready to start a family, my wife had an IUD. Up until today, we’ve told everyone that we’re trying but that God just hasn’t given us a baby yet. Obviously there (most likely) isn’t anything wrong with either of our reproductive parts so we’ve been very chill about our “infertility” but our families have started to worry a lot. I haven’t felt great about lying as I do believe it’s a sin but my wife has been adamant about not telling anyone so I’ve respected that.

My wife has been doing amazingly in college and was accepted as a transfer student at a big university out of state a few months ago. We’re moving up there in august and planned to tell our families about our move today at church.

When we told them, our families were pretty sceptical but seemed accepting of our decision to move. But afterwards, my mom cornered us and outright asked us if we were using birth control and I just couldn’t lie so I told her yes. She immediately started crying and told my dad and my wife’s parents as well who also got visibly upset. As we drove home my wife was livid and said that I’d betrayed her trust. I don’t think that’s fair - I know she’s the one with the IUD but I see it as just as much MY secret as hers and lying to your loved ones just isn’t right in my opinion.

Our pastor just called me and said he’d come by in two hours. My wife i saying that she’s ready to pack her bags and leave town for good which I think is much too excessive. We both know that we aren’t coming back to our town after we move in august as the pressure of living how our parents want us to is 
to much for us, but I don’t want to estrange my whole family in the process.

AITA?

Edit: guys, please be respectful about my family and their beliefs. Yeah, they’re much more conservative than we are but maybe don’t call me/my family lunatics/crazy people. Thanks.


UPDATE:

Thank you for all of your replies. I fully realize that I am the a-hole and that I shouldn’t have shared this information with anyone. However, I wouldn’t say I chose my mom over my wife as many of you are saying. Me telling my mom about the birth control was in panic rather than an active choice. I would always prioritize my relationship with my wife over anything as SHE’S the one I want to spend my life with, not my parents. I certainly screwed up though, I’m aware that my actions haven’t reflected my intentions.

Some more info: out of all my siblings, I have two brothers that are no longer on speaking terms with my parents due to leaving our religion, although I keep in contact with one of them. The other one chose to cut ties with all of us except for one of my sisters about 10 years ago and I only very occasionally hear about how he’s doing (according to my sister, he’s doing ok and got married a few years ago) but my other brother has been struggling immensely. That’s definitely why I’ve been so willing to give into my family’s expectations even though I disagree with so many of their beliefs.

My wife and I had a really long conversation after getting home last night, the content of which I’ll try to boil down:

I started off by apologizing for this major screwup. She then said a lot of what y’all have already said, that I need put first her first no matter what, that she’ll be the one who’s blamed for us not having kids even though we both made the decision etc.

In the end, she said that she forgives me which was the world’s biggest relief. However, she also said that she does not ever want to set foot in our church again. This hurt me a lot, but I also know that leaving the church will ultimately be for the best as the only way we could ever be accepted again would be to change our beliefs according to those of our parents.

I have a job starting August lined up in the town we’re moving to but my wife and I have agreed that we’ll both look into opportunities to find work up there immediately so we can push our move as much forward as possible. Shouldn’t be too big of a challenge for me as I work in a field with close to no unemployment.

All in all it looks like we’re leaving our community asap which is scary but hopefully going to be good for us.

UPDATE #2:

Our pastor didn’t come by last night. I called him up and told him we’d be leaving for a while to get some food and talk things over and while he initially said that he thought we could benefit from his spiritual guidance, he did back off after I declined.

He called me up about a half our ago and said he’d come over when I was home from work but I once again declined. My wife is currently at home packing our stuff so we don’t really want our pastor at our house right now. That’d probably mean that people from church would show up at our doorstep within the hour.

As for our parents, my mom sent me a really long text earlier talking about sin and how she didn’t want me ending up like the two of my brothers who abandoned our religion. Haven’t replied to that yet.",328,636,0.9
1144,Not the A-hole,"In our living room there has been a bookcase there. It was quite big, about 5 or 6 shelves high. There was plenty of room as others hadn't put much stuff there. A few weeks ago I started using one of the shelves for my books and plan to keep expanding, within reason

Today I go up and the living room has been rearranged. One of the things I noticed was the bookcase was gone, a desk was there instead, and my books were on the windowsill.

I asked my housemate ""what's going on?""

She said she took the bookcase to her room and has filled it up with various possessions, and moved the desk that she didn't want into the living room. And she said the windowsill thing was temporary and she was going to move them on to the desk she moved in.

I said to her that was already being used for my books, and a few things from other housemates, and ""could you move it back please?"" She said the desk was there now, and that I can quite easily put my books there. 

I said firstly: I don't want to use a desk, I want to use the bookcase for my books, it belongs to all of us not just you. Secondly you didn't even ask anyone before doing it.

She just can't see my complaints at all and thinks I'm being petty over not wanting to use the desk. She also said my books weren't so many that they can't fit on the desk. But I will be buying more...and other people might want to use it at some point.

So in the end I said ""if you aren't going to move it back, can you buy a new bookcase for the living room please?"" She doesn't want to. This is frustrating as we are generally on very good terms.

Haven't spoken to other housemates yet, don't know if they've even seen it.

Is it an arsehole move to ask her to buy a bookcase considering they're generally pretty expensive?

I can't force her to buy one, and it would probably be problematic if I went and physically moved it back myself so how can this be resolved without being an arsehole?",15,33,0.91

(2) blocked my wife into a parking spot and bombarded her for 30 minutes with “guilt”. (3) Her older brother physically assaulted her.

1153,Asshole,"I'm 17f. My little sister (8), our first cousin (7m) and his neighbor (8f) are best friends.

Those three are obsessed with an Australian show about mermaids on Netflix. The main characters are also three mermaids and they like to take on those roles when playing together.

My mom thinks it's cute, so she ordered them matching mermaid-tail-like leggings off eBay, which can be worn in water as swimming costumes.

Fast forward to this weekend and my sister's birthday party. Besides her two best friends, she also decided to invite half of her class to our summer house for cake and a swim at a sand beach nearby.

I was supervising everyone with my older sister and grandma for a good 45 minutes while our parents left to pick up the birthday cake.

The trio wanted to put on their mermaid tails and try them out on the beach. But I was specifically anxious about my cousin getting flak from the other kids for wearing what's technically a girls costume. He's been bullied before for liking ""girly"" things and there was a group of boys at the party known for teasing their classmates and giving mean nicknames.

I didn't want my cousin to get harassed and for the celebration to get ruined by bullying.

Therefore when cousin came to me asking for his mermaid tail, I made up a lie on the spot about our mom forgetting to take it out of the trunk of the car when leaving to pick up the cake. As expected, the girls didn't want to wear their tails without their friend, so although he was disappointed, they all got over it pretty fast after playing on the beach with the other kids.

Also, seeing as our family was in charge of driving the cousin and his neighbor home, the two stayed for a bit longer than the other invitees while we cleaned up, so in the end they got to try out the costumes alone. Essentially, no one got hurt.

Still do you think I was the asshole for telling a white lie? Kids can be cruel and I wanted to keep the peace, but maybe my reaction wasn't the best. I'm not sure.",148,494,0.92

1155,Asshole,"My daughter Molly (13) plays football (that's English football/soccer btw) for a team and they train every sunday. She has been playing for years but has only been with this team for a few months. Molly loves football and is very talented and her coach Chelsey is very pleased with her. 

However, on the team there are a group of five girls who don't like Molly. They all go to the same school and their parents all know each other, and as often happens with teenage girls it gets quite clique-y and territorial. This group see themselves as the ''real'' team and pretty much only work with each other during matches and don't support anyone who isn't in their group. Molly has been told by this group that she isn't welcome. The worst of them is a girl called Amy. A talented player but really dislikes Molly for some reason. She has made Molly cry before and has only gotten worse after being told by Chelsey to tone the mean girl stuff down. 

Today was a big match, and Molly scored what turned out to be the winning goal. What should have been a happy day turned bad when Molly came out of the locker room in tears saying that Amy and her friends had hidden her stuff, and that Amy had told her she was useless and only on the team because Chelsey felt sorry for her. Chelsey found the stuff, and had a word with Amy and her mum, saying that anymore bullying would result in her being kicked off the team. 

This made Amy cry and Amy's mum then had a go at me, saying Molly needs to grow up and accept what she calls typical girls ''teasing'' each other. I know the difference between teasing and bullying and as an adult she should too. 

The thing is that if Amy gets kicked out, her gang of bullies will still be there, and I can't imagine it would be much fun for Molly if it was there. Chelsey has said that she'd be willing to kick out Molly's group as well if they cause trouble, as there are enough girls trying to get a place on the team to replace them. But I feel like that would cause problems down the line especially with the other parents. 

Molly spent most of the day crying and due to that I am thinking of pulling her out of the team. She loves football and is good at it but if she's leaving something that she's supposed to be having fun in tears then we have a problem. We can find her another team since there are loads out there. 

The only problem is that I feel like if I pull her out she may come out feeling like she was the problem and that's she's being punished even though she's the victim, especially since Chelsey is willing to deal with the bullies once and for all so it feels like we are letting them and their parents win. Molly does have friends on the team and would miss them if she's made to leave by me.",316,2443,0.97
1156,Not the A-hole,"Ok so this happened yesterday with my family, and I told my friends and they are pretty split about whether we were in the right or not.

So I want to preface with the fact that I am not a picky person and not uptight about the service I get and neither is my family. We were coming back home from vacation and decided to go to Buffalo Wild Wings for a quick meal. 

We got sat down fairly quickly and waited for 15 minutes. Nobody had come to greet us so we called over a waiter and asked what was up. She said she’d get someone over right away. No worries, we were in no rush, we were having a good time. We wait another 10 and finally someone comes to take our order. My father, mother, and brother all order alcoholic drinks; everyone else gets water. The drinks take awhile to come too, but whatever. So, at this point we’ve waited over 30 minutes and haven’t gotten our orders in. 

At roughly the 35 minute mark we have to flag down our waiter and ask to take our orders for food (it wasn’t that busy, 75% full house would be my guess). Hallelujah we are hungry and about to gorge on some tasty ass wings. Wrong. We wait 45 minutes. Nothing. We flag down our waiter again and ask whatsup with our food. He says he’ll go check on it. ANOTHER 15 minutes he comes back and says for some reason our order never got put in and it is now in. At this point we’ve become annoyed, my dad has a really short temper and is visibly angry. However, my family combats this by making light out of any and all situations, we’re used to it. 

So, at this point we have been at Buffalo Wild Wings for around an hour and a half (all these times are guesses but pretty close because we started counting). Now, we expect since our waiter messed up our order that he would put it to the front of the line and rush our order. Wrong. We reach the hour 50 mark and now ask for the manager. 

The manager says the food will be right out in the next five. We say ok. We wait five. No food. We wait a few more minutes. No food. The waiter obviously sucks as you can tell at this point and never asked us for refills so in total we got three drinks for the table. 

My dad starts going on a tirade about how BWW sucks and people are looking. The rest of us are fed up too and everyone is hangry. We decide we are going to leave without paying. So, essentially we stole three drinks but got the worst service in the history of food ever. We go over to the next door restaurant which is a nice steakhouse. We were in and out in an hour and twenty minutes and it was delicious.

We believe that this is compensation for our two hours of lost time and the most egregious service we will ever experience. This is Buffalo Wild Wings where at lunch you get wings for free if they aren’t out in 15 minutes.

1158,Not the A-hole,"I live in an apartment building with my girlfriend and I have a neighbor across the hall that I'm friendly with.  

I dont really know her that well but we do say hi when we see each other.
One thing I do know about her is that she has a son (late 40's?) and a granddaughter (14?) who seems very intelligent just based off having small conversations with her when she sees me with my dog.
The son, however, has given me and my girlfriend weird vibes.  I've never spoken to him but I did hear him tell his mom to shut the fuck up one time.

Anyways, here's what happened last night.  It was around 11 pm and I heard a bunch of loud bangs.  Like heavy enough that it woke my gf up.  No sound came after so I chalked it up to someone falling in their apartment.
5 minutes later I hear another big bang and a quick scream.  I go outside in the hallway to listen and I hear nothing so I walk up to the level above and listen and nothing.  All of a sudden some arguing starts up from somewhere on my floor so I go down to my floor and listen and  I hear another loud bang and I hear my neighbor telling someone to please calm down.
I didnt even think and I knocked on her door.  She answers hiding behind the door and I asked if she was ok and she said yes but it seemed odd. All of a sudden the son comes running to the door laughing saying everything is ok blah blah but I didnt buy it and I cut him off without even looking at him and asked her again "" are you sure you're ok?"" And she said yes once again.
Now I'm in just my boxers, I'm a big guy (6'3, 240 lbs) and I have a lot of tattoos on my arms and torso so I was TRYING to be as intimidating as possible when I looked her in the eyes and said "" if you have any problems, I'm here"" and then I went back to my apartment.

So at this point, I pretty much assume this guy has/is abusing his mom or granddaughter.
Fast forward to today and my neighbor knocked on my door to explain that her son and granddaughter were playing fighting etc and the story makes complete sense   I apologize for being nosey and she said thank you for being a good neighbor.

So, I'm a classic worry wart so I'm now stressing out because I feel like the biggest piece of shit in the world for just assuming and labeling this guy has an abuser but my neighbor and girlfriend think I did the right thing.

1160,Not the A-hole,"Okay so this happened today and I still feel bad about it.

My gf and I decided to go see Brightburn this afternoon. At my local cinema that have a ""gallery"" section that has nicer seats and free popcorn and drinks. Due to a discount I get, I tend to go here and always book tickets in advance so I can pick what seats I get (the gallery is the very back of the cinema but different screens have slightly different layouts, meaning sometimes the ""end"" seat is directly in the middle of the screen).

Anyway I picked some great seats - at the end of the row, but knowing the layout I knew they would be centre screen and perfect.

Unfortunately we were a little bit late to the cinema, getting there just as the film had started. When we got into the screen, there was a couple in our seats.

This happens occasionally and I don't mind, but hey I had the tickets for these seats so I asked them politely to move. The lady rolled her eyes at me and the guy started packing up all their stuff to move to the next seats. She just sat there the whole time looking annoyed. 

I felt a little bit guilty, but not so much - all these seats are allocated for a reason and these were my seats after all. I thought her attitude was a bit shitty, but it happens.

However, the guy then picked the lady up to move her to her new seat. It was only at this exact moment I realised that she was, in fact, disabled. 

Now that this has dawned on me, I realised that the wheelchair I walked past on the way into the screen must have been hers.

I missed the first 10minutes of the film because I felt so bad and so guilty.

1163,Asshole,"Throwaway account. 

For context, my daughter is turning 16 in a month and has a clear obsession with how she looks. She’s beautiful, of course, but she takes hours getting ready everyday just to look presentable. She wears tons of makeup, and she loves it. She also get her hair re-dyed black every six weeks. (which my mother despises, but personally I could care less about the color of her hair) My family and I have hated how much she wears makeup, it was never a huge thing growing up to wear as much as she does, especially to school. 

She’s very talented, however, and from what i’ve learned from her, her makeup skills are fairly high, especially for her age. She does makeup for her school’s theater program whenever they have shows, and she’s also learning how to do SFX makeup. 

Recently her hours spent getting ready have gotten in the way of doing things, if she doesn’t have time to put on makeup, she will cry and refuse to go somewhere. I’m getting really fed up with it and I’m sick of her constantly needing to wear tons of makeup to feel pretty. 

My wife and I never buy her this makeup, unless it’s for her birthday or another holiday, she buys all of her makeup with her own money. She spends all of her allowance on makeup, and it drives my wife and I nuts. She has so much, it takes up majority of her desk space. It’s what she loves, and what she’s good at, but she doesn’t need as much as she has. 

Another issue with the makeup is it makes her look a lot older. She already looks around 18 without makeup, so with it she looks like she could be in her 20s. Older men prey on my daughter a lot, it’s even happened in front of me. She tells my wife stories about men who try to get her attention in the mall, or other places that she goes. I hate it. 

So, I recently had the idea to throw majority of her makeup in the trash. I’m hoping that it will prevent her from needing it as much and will stop her from buying so much of it. High end makeup (which is a majority of what she has) is expensive, but I don’t know what else to do at this point. 

WIBTA?

Edit: After seeing everyone tell me I’m the asshole, I agree. 

I’ve talked to my daughter about it, she didn’t really wanna hear it but I told her this has to get better. My wife and I told her about how she’s beautiful and doesn’t need makeup to cover it. This is definitely a deep rooted self-esteem issue and I’m hoping if she starts going back to counseling (She was heavily bullied by her peers in the past and had to attend it) she will get better. 


Also many have been seeing this as a “shitpost” but I can promise it’s not. I just didn’t know what to do at first but I’m hoping this situation will get better just by talking about it.

My mother, however, spit the words ""You wore a suit!"" under her breath when she thought no one else could hear so I knew I had upset her.

My rationale was to dress up as much as I could for the occasion without having to buy a dress I would only ever wear once.  I felt that what I wore would have been perfectly appropriate for a man to wear and so I would not stick out unduly in the wedding photos.

1169,Asshole,"I was brought up Catholic like the rest of my family but left after I was confirmed. I was pretty disgusted with the church's views on LGBT issues and unfairness of not allowing any women leaders. Once I came out as bisexual in college that solidified that I was obviously never returning. I got married in my ex-husband's far more liberal Lutheran church and both of my kids (now 9F and 7M) were baptized in it even though neither of us were particularly religious. After the marriage ended I realized a big part of why it didn't work, I'm not really bisexual, and decided that I wouldn't have a workable marriage with a man. My ex actually became very supportive and understanding of this in time and eventually had no hard feelings, he even invited me to the wedding when he was remarried. Since then I've occasionally taken the kids to a Lutheran church and enrolled my daughter in a youth program per her request, but I'm fine with it as the church is pretty accepting of LGBT relationships and has many LGBT members. 

Last week my current girlfriend and I planned a little getaway to a lake resort up north and she requested that it be just us with no kids. I contacted my ex to see if he would take the kids that weekend even though it wasn't one of his visitation weekends with them, but he and his new wife were also busy. So I asked my sister to babysit. She was thrilled at the idea and loves my kids, so she readily agreed. We went on the trip and had a great time, and the kids seemed to have a great time with her as well. When I talked about what they did my daughter mentioned she took them to church but it was a little different from what they're used to. When I confronted my sister she admitted she took them to a Catholic Mass as she starting regularly attending again a few months earlier. 

I was furious. I was wondering how on Earth she could think it'd be OK to submit her niece and nephew to a church that teaches that me and their new Mommy are going to hell and during Pride month to boot. I gave her some angry calls about this. My sister remained unphased and said she didn't understand the big deal, it's not ""that much different"" than the Lutheran church I sometimes take them to and there was no condemnation of same sex relationships there nor has there been any time she attended. I then threatened that unless she promises to never ever do that again she won't be babysitting them ever again...or visiting us or being invited to any events in their lives and she should probably let the rest of the family know that anyone who takes my kids to Mass will be cut out of our lives for good.

My stepsister is used to running around the house butt naked, and it makes me really uncomfortable.

Typically this doesn't happen in the morning on a Friday, as my fiance also works Friday mornings. So when I check it, I notice that there are people in my back yard, taking down the privacy fence that borders my neighbors yard. Now, the posts are on my side of the fence, and the owner before us left items attached to the fence to make the ambiance of the area feel more rustic. From what I can tell, the people doing the (de)construction destroyed all of the items in the process and threw them into a pile in my yard.  


I called my fiance after I got home to see exactly what kind of damage they did and she was livid. We've been at her mother's since for plans we made months ago, but we brought it up with her mother, and I said I'm considering calling law enforcement to file a vandalism claim and/or sue them over the 40' of fence they replaced, to which she replied was a little overboard.  


The neighbor never once came and asked us about getting the fence replaced, nor was it on disrepair (on our end at least). They also put the panels up with the posts now on their side instead of ours. Where I grew up this is considered theft of property, which is why I'm considering suing.

However, I also have a job caring for my severely disabled brother and sister who are 17, both severely autistic nonverbal. They need constant care, brother is not even potty trained. I have always helped to watch them my whole life, but now I can get paid through the state for a certain number of hours to watch them.

&#x200B;

Last summer she asked me if me and my gf would stay 5 days as paid caretakers, while she went away with my aunts. (I only have a set amount of hours, would only be paid for part of the first day). Either way, I was really uncomfortable with this but she guilted me hard so I just lied and said my other job needed me that week and we couldn't. Dad ended up taking a week off from work as a vacation to watch them so she could go away (his job is very demanding, lately been working 7 days a week).

Fast Forward to right now, she asks the same question of me. However, coming off of two semesters worth of counseling from school, I had the right tools to handle this. This time I was able to tell her with a firm ""no"" that I was uncomfortable taking on the responsibility of being full-time caretaker for 5 straight days. I said I would only be willing to do days, not overnights. She tried to barter with me but I held my ground, so naturally, she asks my dad who cannot because of a huge project at work. For the past month, she has been occasionally bringing it up, trying to find a way to go. She has guilted me every which way, from saying ""Oh I barely get out its a one time thing"" (She has gone on a multiple multi-day vacations every year for the past 5-6 years, even I haven't done that. Also, my dad has bro and sis every other weekend, and sometimes she goes away then, too ), to ""Well Grandma is getting a lot older I did want to go on a family vacation with her this summer"" (Grandma is old and has been suffering from leg injuries, however, she lives 5 min away and sees my mom 3-5 times a week.) Today, she texts me and asks "" If dad agrees to JUST the weekend, and their helper through another program Agrees to put them to bed Monday night, would you stay over Monday night?"" Now, that's an awful lot shorter than what originally was proposed, but my dad said no already, and just the fact that she keeps trying to ask makes me feel more uncomfortable. I know she wants a break from her hard life but I feel like it's not fair at my expense, I'm 20 and they're not my kids. I'm starting to think maybe I could just do one night, in the event my dad does somehow say yes, but the whole principle of the thing makes me want to say no, and as practiced with my therapist, I'm supposed to tell her no and not give in to the guilt trip.

1180,No A-holes here,"Throwaway just in case.

Some backstory: A little over 5 years ago my mom remarried to my stepdad. I was pretty young when they got married, 13 going on 14. Once he moved in after the wedding, though, it became immediately apparent that he and I weren't going to get along. We're on opposite sides of the political spectrum and opposite sides of the personality spectrum. He thinks I'm naive, lazy, and irresponsible. I will conceded that I have contributed to our animosity over the years. He also has a very pessimistic outlook on life. I think he treats my mother poorly, expecting far too much from her in terms of housework while not chipping him himself very much except for exterior work like mowing the lawn. He was raised in a very traditional family where the woman did the housework and the man didn't and I suppose he carries that expectation. I don't find the way he treats my mother fair at all, but if I ever dare to bring it up, I'm immediately met with him telling me how hard and exhausting his job is (my mother ALSO works full time, by the way).

Last August I FINALLY moved out. I moved to Phoenix from our home in NJ to go to college. Only problem is, I lived in the dorms, so now that it's summer I am back home until the new term starts and I'm over my stepdad's shit. My mental health was terrible in high school and improved exponentially once I got to college, but I'm back to a very low place in my depression now that I've been home. I spend a great deal of time in my room outside of work because I don't like confrontation and every time I leave my room I either get made fun of, told I should be doing something or other, or get excluded from the conversation and told I'm ""interrupting"" if I try and talk. 

This morning I just snapped. My mom confronted me and said she could tell that I was upset about something but she didn't know what, so I told her the truth. I don't want to be here. I'm sick of being made fun of and constantly berated every time I leave my room and I'm sick of being ordered around. I told her that it's not her fault but that my stepdad was really getting on my last nerve. She started to cry and told me if I didn't want to live here I could go move in with my dad. I really, really don't want to hurt my mom. I love her very much. But living with her and being around her means I also have to live with and be around my stepdad. I don't want to force her to choose between her husband and her child because that's hardly fair and I really feel like a major asshole for making her cry and potentially creating that dilemma. Despite my misgivings about my stepdad I know that my mom loves him and I don't want to be selfish or unfair. So AITA?

TL;DR I hate my stepdad. I'm back for the summer from college and he's gotten on my last nerve, so I told my mom that I don't like living in our house and she cried. I don't want to hurt her.",20,41,0.89

1183,Asshole,"Last fall, my husband and I went to my cousin's wedding in another state. 

In the months leading up to the wedding, my aunt (cousin's mother) griped about how unconventional the wedding was going to be. She was happy for the couple of course but she didn't like that the wedding wasn't going to be in a church or banquet hall. The wedding was going to be a small and intimate affair in a scenic national park and then the reception was going to be in a nice rental house in the woods. I thought it sounded cool and unique but my aunt hated the idea of it. She didn't tell the couple tho. Just complained about it to us behind their backs. 

We traveled 600 miles to the wedding. We treated the trip like a vacation. Spent some money on lodging, food, sightseeing, etcetera. 

The day before the wedding, my aunt rounded up me and my family members and told us that she just found out that the dress code for the wedding was casual. Not gonna lie, many of us were stoked. I hate dressing up so I was all over the idea of a casual backyard bbq wedding. 

My husband and I had already packed nice clothes so we wore them to the ceremony. A few of my family members showed up to the ceremony in t-shirts and baseball caps. Immediately after, we changed into comfortable clothes for the reception. I wore a hoodie, daisy Duke shorts and cute sandals. 

I noticed that the bride's family members were still dressed up but I figured they didn't get the memo. The bride and groom and the wedding party were dressed to the nine's which I thought was weird for a casual wedding. The reception was awesome. Nice dinner, fancy lawn games, a bonfire. We had a blast. 

So we just found out that the bride and groom were very upset with us for wearing casual clothes to their wedding. They thought it was very disrespectful. Apparently my aunt lied to us because she wanted to sabotage their wedding and they were upset that no one checked with them about the dress code. This explains why my cousin and his wife have been standoffish toward us since the wedding. 

TBH we think they're overreacting because we all had fun at their wedding and it's not our fault we got bad info about the dress code. And they never specified the dress code in the invitation. But I still have to ask. AITA?",1148,18317,0.88

He apologized to me. He didn't know the UAE is a country he thought it was Dubai.
He knew nothing about the middle East(he thought thought the middle east was a country).
He did some research and said sorry and he didn't mean anything he said

I am from the middle east a lived there my entire life I moved to the states for a job in Chicago and me and a couple co-workers are going to the UAE for a business trip.

I went to the Emirates before but I never lived there(I lived in Syria, Palestine, qatar,Jordan and turkey) and I am pretty sure its not as accpeting of gay people like Middle Eastern countries like Jordan,Lebanon or turkey (or even Qatar and Bahrain) and it leans more toward the Saudi side of things.

One of my coworkers is gay and very open about it. For instances when pride month starts he wears pride shirts to work and he embraces it Alot and pretty much tells everyone. I have no problem with it but I am afraid for his safety in the UAE so I told him when we go to the UAE he shouldn't tell people he is gay.

He got mad at me and called me a homophobe I told him I am looking out for him and he told me I shouldn't of trusted you people and blocked my Instagram and number and ignores me at work.

I didn't mean to offend him I was looking out for him

1185,Not the A-hole,"I work at an airport and days can get rough without and extenuating circumstances like weather or flights. 

I'm currently in a newly developed zone where pushing the flights out is a daunting task because of how small the alley is and how close to the terminal you have to get while pushing out. The push is also an irregular one that not many people have done. 

My other coworkers have said that they are not comfortable pushing out which means I have to do it every time. 

I dont like doing it anymore than anyone else but I am able to do it. Just because I can doesnt mean I should have to. They should go back to training and learn how to push. We are three man teams that all have designated duties to accomplish in every position. 

My coworker also doesnt do other thing because she isn't comfortable doing them. And I want to tell her to find another job because what she ends up not doing gets put on other people like me causing us to have to do extra work. 

I dont mind helping out when needed but constantly having to pick up their slack is unneeded and tiresome in this line of duty.

Edit: I would talk to managers or supervisors if it would make a difference. The problem is there is no rigid structure to go up. Different managers every day make it nearly impossible to have a complaint heard let alone taken care of.

1186,Not the A-hole,"So I am going to give you some background on my friend who we'll call Debra.  I am gay male and she's a straight Asian female.  

Debra moved to a new city about a year ago after getting a divorce.  She's had trouble meeting a new man because she only hangs out with gay men.  She goes to gay bars, gay sporting events etc.  I honestly don't get it, but hey you do you.  Well she finally met a guy and he wanted to go out on double dates.  The problem?  She's not only hanging out with gay men but hanging out with ones that like to party.  So the new boyfriend suggested she make straight friends too, she was offended by this suggestion but I honestly understood where he's coming from.  He doesn't share the same interests as her group.  I told her that and she got upset with me but we worked passed that.  This was in January of this year.  

So fast forward to this weekend.  The stonewall kick ball tournament (gay sports league) is in the city I live in.   Sure enough Debra is coming up for it as she plays and is going out to all the gay bars.  Well she asked if I could do brunch on Sunday, and I said I could if it was early.  Sure enough she makes plans for 12:45 and I have places to be at 1:30.  I asked if she  could bump them up and the response I got is ""well my gays wanted to do this time.""

I hate when she says that and I have said so before.  I still haven't responded yet, but I honestly want to respond with ""oh okay that's fine but my Asian's are meeting up later and I can't reschedule that either.""  Obviously I am not meeting up with a group of Asian's but I do have plans I can't reschedule.  

I feel like this is an ESH situation, but I will take whatever the crowd says.  If I am an asshole for it, I can see it.

Edit:  I responded that I couldn't go and that we should hang out soon one-on-one.  I will bring it up then and see if it changes.  I guess part of me is just annoyed with the entire ""fag hag"" routine.",117,1119,0.95
1187,Not the A-hole,"Background: 
My mother has always been an anxious person and she is extremely paranoid about many aspects of life, especially when it comes to her children. I am the youngest child and usually the most tolerant so I often bear the brunt of this. One worst way it manifests is in driving - she is the worst backseat driver ever. When I first got my license, she always insisted that I am not allowed to drive alone and she would always have to accompany me (in our family car). It became very stressful for me as she would continually cry out in alarm over EVERYTHING: a large truck passing by in another lane, another car cutting in front of me, hitting a pothole etc and she would continually yell that I was going too fast or braking too hard and even grab my arm or leg while I was driving. For a long time I thought I was the worst driver ever and would be afraid and upset whenever I drove. Note, I never got into any accidents but did have a few minor scrapes (e.g. bumping into the kerb).

Fast forward to now, I have lived in several other countries for some time and driven there (road trips etc). Friends who have been with me have had no issues with my driving. I have confidence that I am not a bad driver (but neither am I the best one). Recently we went on a road trip with family and drove my aunt's car. My aunt drove the entire trip and towards the end my sister (who also has a license but hates driving) suggested I take over to give my aunt a break. I said no, and when asked why said that I would never drive with my mother in a car because she is too paranoid and I would make mistakes.

My aunt said nothing but now my sister is calling me an asshole for making my aunt drive 100% of the rather long trip and my mother is upset that I said I would never drive her anywhere even if I had a car of my own.

&amp;#x200B;

After nearly 7 years, I (24F) quit the contraception pill about half a year ago, because I don't have a solid reason for taking it anymore. My hormone balance is still all over the place and things are not back to normal yet. However, I feel alright and I know that this takes time (up to a year or more), so I'm trying to just be patient with my body. 

&amp;#x200B;

A big downside on this chaotic hormonal situation is the return of my teenage acne. I never had great skin even while on the pill, but I'm looking not so fresh at the moment and people notice. Oh, do they notice... It's getting to the stage where I'm actually considering starting with the pill again, which I know would put my body through even more stress. (Btw - I personally think it's no comparison to the skin I had when I was 15. Nothing I can't cover with make-up, I'm still able to leave the house)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm quite open about it when friends and family want to know what is up with my skin and actually expected them to be a bit supportive, but most of them get really annoying about it, especially my mother and grandmother. I'm constantly getting ""examined"" by them, like they look at me to see if it's improving or not. Although I appreciated their concern for my health in the beginning,  I now don't want them to comment on my skin at all.

&amp;#x200B;

This morning I finally snapped at my grandmother when she suggested that it might be an allergy. I reminded her of the reason (me not taking the pill) for the 100th time and told her to finally shut up about it. People that have problems with their skin do know about it (surprise!!!) and don't need other people pointing it out to them a million times! I know it isn't pretty, I know it's not really improving,  I might go and see a doctor about it, but I won't die from it and just need more time! 

While in the midst of my outburst I mentioned that I'm also not constantly pointing out that her or my mother are gaining weight or wrinkles, because I would know that this is something they would feel insecure about. My grandma is now pissed and told my mom who wants me to apologize. I don't really see any reason to and decided to react like that whenever someone mentions my pimples again and again. (Honestly, it's isn't even that bad, why are people so interested in my skin???)

So.... AITA?

UPDATE: Hi everyone! Just wanted to say a quick thanks for all your answers, sorry that I can‘t respond to all of them individually!

You‘ve been all very helpful. I want to let you know that I had a good talk with both my mother and grandmother. I apologized for lashing out, but explained myself and how it makes me feel when my skin is being discussed and judged out of nowhere... as if it‘s the only and most important thing involving my person at the moment. They understand (at least they said so) and agreed to be more sensitive. I guess they were more shocked at my tone than what I said about them, as I‘m not someone who normally argues and gets loud. Especially not to my grandma (I love her a lot, but she can get annoying, man...).

I‘m also trying some products now (salicylic acid, niacinamide, a good face wash from Kiehl‘s and zinc tablets) and hope it will get better soon. If not, I will see a doc! So thank you all for your recommendations and advice!",45,97,0.9

Wow, this blew up! Firstly, I wanted to address a couple of comments:

1. He doesn't have any allergies - obviously I wouldn't have ordered the burger if there was a chance it might cause him harm.

2. This isn't part of some grand scheme to turn him vegan. I respect his right to eat meat, and I don't bother him about this. In fact, he's generally the only one to bring up my veganism (usually in the context of making fun of my food, which can get pretty exhausting).

Anyway, after reading lots of the comments I apologised for giving him vegan food without asking for permission. He said I should apologise for making him look like an idiot by letting him brag about the ""beef"" burger when I knew it was fake. I said I was sorry about that, but also mentioned that he doesn't make me feel great when he makes fun of my food all the time. He's seen the message but he hasn't replied, I'm honestly kind of pissed off but I'll wait and see what he says.


ORIGINAL POST:

I really don’t think I’m the asshole here, but his friends are saying I am so I wanted to get some opinions.

I’ve been a vegan for the past 2 years, whereas my boyfriend is adamant that he would never give up meat. He always complains about how vegan food doesn’t taste as good, isn’t filling etc, and he’s normally not willing to try new things.

Anyway, last night we were on a date at a burger chain. The chain lets you order with an app. He was busy on his phone and told me to order for him, and he wanted a beef burger. I asked which one and he said “I’m busy, you choose.”

I noticed that the restaurant sold the Beyond Burger - if you don’t know, it’s a kind of “fake meat” burger which is designed to be realistic. I’ve heard it’s actually really similar to meat, so I order him one mostly out of interest to see if he’d notice. I got myself a bean burger, so he wouldn’t notice we had the same meal and get suspicious.
The meal arrives and he really loves it! I kept subtly asking him how it was and he said it was great! He even boasted about it being tastier than my “lame” veggie burger.

After we’d paid up, I told him the truth and he was pissed, saying I tricked him and violated his trust etc. But he loved the burger?? I think he’s just feeling sensitive about being proven wrong, but he asked his friends and they’re saying I’m trying to control his diet and stuff. So AITA?",2560,6576,0.91

1192,Asshole,"It's always been my dream to be a film director. Two years ago I basically was inspired by Christopher McCandless and did a solo trip across the US and Mexico. In a tiny little town on the border I met this old guy named ""Birdman"" who's life story was so fascinating I wrote a screenplay based on his life freehand in about a week. 

It took me two years but I took out tons of credit cards, my family invested an so actually have a few hundred thousand to work with. We are presently shooting across New Mexico and  I have a somewhat professional film crew, actors and film equipment I've rented. It's cost a fortune and at this point we are so over budget it's not even funny. 

Well I'm realizing now ""Birdman"" is a fucking liar. And almost nothing he told me two years ago happened. He insisted on playing himself which I agreed to but he argues with me about the way things happened and whether things happened (for example he claimed he was in the first Iraq war and won the Medal of Honor, truth he wasn't even in the military).  He has almost zero camera presence so I have to carefully ""shoot around"" him even though he's the focus of the movie. He also ""accidentally"" walked in our lead actress changing several times so she quit (reshoots=$$$) and now her replacement is probably sleeping with Birdman creating more potential drama when he pisses her off. 

This morning is typical. We were supposed to start at 3AM so we could get establishing shots of the sunrise over the mountains. Birdman got everyone drunk last night (all his pay, he's going to want an advance when I see him) and no one showed up. We lost a morning or shooting and I still have to pay for food and hotels for today. Like I said, typical for this shoot.

I want DD the cast and crews pay up to today, take my credit card off the hotel and just drive the fuck away today. I'm so frustrated. I can give my family back whatever money of thiers is left and say I'm sorry for the loss and I can look into bankruptcy for the credit cards. I can't bear the thought of dealing with these people again.

UPDATE : I have to spoken to J again regarding MIL asking for a ‘mother, son visit’. He has offered her the dinner plans I tried to make to see how she responds to that (In a chat I am not a part of). He is also going to speak to her and find our what’s going on and where she is at, and if it does result her refusing to include myself and our son he’ll be letting her know ‘She will have to get used to seeing a lot less of me then’ (His quote). Thankyou for the validation, love and advice. We both appreciate it so much.

This could be lengthy, bear with me.
I (24F) am engaged to a (26M) man (J) who was raised in Catholic faith but no longer practices. I am also bisexual and a huge advocate for the LGBTQ+ community. This has been a flag for J’s mum our whole relationship. (I had a ‘love is love’ banner on my facebook profile picture when we met and she asked about it the first she heard of me). 
Months ago after sharing yet another post in support of my community she proceeded to send hateful and hurtful articles into our family chat. I asked her to please not do this as it hurts me, that I respect her opinion and feel it will be best if we don’t discuss it with each other. J’s father later comment hate speech on this post and I removed myself from the family chat while J spoke to both parents and let them clearly know this was absolutely unacceptable. MIL apologised profusely and asked me to please come back to the chat. Once I calmed down I did so and we continued on as normal with some anxiety on my side.
About a month ago I again, posted another photo supporting my community to which MIL decided to comment hate speech on again. (Along the lines that gay people already had enough in Australia being able to have civil union ceremony’s and they don’t need to take over marriage). In anger I replied straight to her comment. Respectfully, but with anger and frustration in the tone. She deleted her comment, so I messaged her and again asked her not to do this. We have been here before and it’s not fair for J or any of the family. I told her I understand her views, admitted to being bisexual myself to explain why my stance will not be changed and pleaded with her to just not talk about this specific thing with me. She replied that she isn’t a ‘Sunday catholic’, posted some things to her page about ‘Satan being after her soul, God being more important than relationships etc’ and we really haven’t spoken since.
J hasn’t been in touch very much since it happened and they haven’t talked about it at all. Last he seen her she asked to do dinner plans (We used to do dinners monthly all together). On that note I reached out and tried to arrange a time everyone would be free so we could catch up, dinner, brunch, whatever. She was completely unresponsive and cold so I left it with her and said nothing further. J tells me today she has been asking to see ‘her sons’ clearly excluding myself from the plans. To make this worse, I also have a 5 year old from a previous relationship who she has previously accepted and loved deeply, but now he is no longer invited to their plans either. 
Am I the asshole for not tolerating the shit, or should I have let it go for the relationship sake? I feel guilty my son has been put into this divide too and like I am to blame for that.

So last weekend I  [25M] was watching my niece [3F]. I have a daughter [5F] myself and she loves when my niece comes over to play as she doesn't have any siblings yet and it's fun for her to have another kid about. On this particular day, the girls were playing outside and decided to make mudpies. Okay cool, my kid does that shit a lot. What was *less* cool was when they apparently decided to *become* mudpies. Seriously I went inside for like a minute to answer the phone and when I came back they were both head to toe covered in mud and finding it hilarious. I immediately whisked them both inside and threw them in the shower together. I helped them wash their hair, made sure they had a proper wash and then gave my niece some old clothes of my daughters in her size to wear while I washed hers. 

I thought this was the best course of action in the situation - honestly I didn't even think twice about doing it. My SIL does not agree. She keeps saying that it's ""weird and creepy"" for me to have showered her daughter as a man who isn't her father and that I should've called her to okay it first. That mindset is kinda confusing to me. Like, she's a 3 y/o toddler, she's in a shower with my own 5 y/o kid who I always supervise at bathtime lest my bathroom turn into the lost city of Atlantis. Plus, what was I supposed to do? Let her sit covered in mud til somoene could come get her? However, my brother and both her mother and mine seem to agree that it was at least a bit weird for me to shower her when I'm a man and not her dad. Are they right and I'm missing the point or am I right that there's nothing weird about it?

ETA: some things that keep cropping up in the comments so I'll address them. 

1. My daughter's mother is dead and I'm single, so no there wasn't a woman about who could've done it instead. 

2. Idk if my SIL was abused. Will throw out there though that I was abused by an older guy at 16 and we had a family friend who wasn't quite abusive but definitely exhibited some creepy behaviours to my siblings and I as kids.

3. I was *NOT* in the shower with the girls and idk why so many people think I was. I never shower even with my own daughter and certainly wouldn't with anyone else's. 

4. Yes they're fine with me taking niece to the toilet and wiping her and that.

1208,Not the A-hole,"A cocky metalhead guitar player in our band acts like he is gods gift to music - he plays harsh, loud, and oftentimes incorrectly out of key. As an exercise, I asked him to use his ear to figure out twinkle twinkle little star, and he got offended. I asked why he wouldn't attempt it, and he says he's already an expert and it's beneath his skill level. 

So if that's true, why wont he at least prove it? Is he too badass and epic to play a ""little baby nursery rhyme"" (his words, not mine.)? Fast forward a week later, and were all having another rehearsal. Everything is going great - until it's time for break. That's when he brings up the incident of me asking him to do that simple nursery rhyme exercise, and he got angry about it, like he was trying to start something. we start arguing, and the fangs come out. It became 3 v 1 when the rest of the band took his side. I believe it was only to protect his ego.

They said I was being an asshole because I was asking him to do something he didnt want to do - which in my view was an exercise to improve his ear instead of just fast sweep picking craziness. But they took it as an attack on him, to which they used on me, by asking me to play the melody to Iron Man. Well I played it by taking my time to figure it out, which was the whole point of the exercise in the first place.

Finally, he says he'll do it. After all the anger and animosity and arguing, he picks up the guitar, and what we all hear is twinkle twinkle little star, except 75% of it is wrong. Two more attempts and it's still barely recognizable. I look around at everyone who turned on me to protect this ""expert"" guitarists feelings, and said fuck this, I'm going home.

1209,Not the A-hole,"I am home from university for the summer. I’ve been home for about a month and living on an air mattress in my older sister’s room.

My sister stills lives with my mom but it is more of a roommate arrangement. My sister pays a little less than half of rent and all of the utilities. My mom pays 200 more in rent but and no other household bill.

When I first got back, I noticed that my sister had a sign on her door saying “please knock” and “if you didn’t pay for it, don’t take it.”

The only one who does not respect the notes is our mom. She tends to just barge in and take whatever she wants. She mostly takes stationary supplies because she refuses to buy her own and she’ll eat whatever snacks my sister has stored.

A few days ago, she barges into the room while my sister was getting ready for work and I was reading a book. I told her “there is a thing called” and then I knocked on the wall so that she will get the hint.

My mom then goes on a rant about how she is the head of household and she doesn’t have to knock.

Yesterday, I went out with my sister. When we got back home, my mom told my sister “I ate your chocolate.” It wasn’t my sister’s chocolate. It was my chocolate that my sister had bought for me as payment for making her spam musubi. I had stored it on my sister’s desk which is probably why my mom thought it was hers. 

Later during the night, my mom barges in the room, waking us both up, to return my sister’s lotion bottle that neither of us had noticed was gone.

I know my mom’s action deeply annoy and frustrates my sister, as she had told me. But my sister would never speak up against my mom. It will cause too much drama and my mom will more than likely start explosively yelling if confronted like she tends to do. Instead of confronting our mom, my sister tends to just overwork herself so she doesn’t have to be home with her.

My question is: would I be the asshole if the next time my mom barges into my sister’s room or take from my sister without permission, I were to say something. I plan on saying something along the lines of: “My sister pays her rent for this room. Even if you are head of household that doesn’t give you the right to not respect her boundaries or rules she set for the room. You have to knock and ask to use her things like the rest of us.”

My sister says it’s not worth it. But I know she is only telling me that because she doesn’t want me to be on the receiving end of my mom’s anger.",44,126,0.96

1211,Asshole,"My housemate and I have been living together for about a year and a half. She suddenly has decided that she does not like my boyfriend sleeping over as often as he does (which admittedly is quite often). They are (were) friends as well, so he is not a stranger to her. She has told me that it is ""disruptive"" to her life, though she has never explained how, despite me asking each time this has been brought up. 

My boyfriend is never in the common areas of the house. Only in my room, behind a closed door, only at night when we are sleeping. We go out most evenings, and only come back to my place to sleep. She also is rarely home in the evenings (she is a barfly), and also only comes home to sleep. He does not leave anything in the rest of the house. They come face to face maybe once or twice a week for less than a minute in passing (now that my boyfriend knows she doesn't like him there, he avoids her as much as possible despite the fact we used to all be friends).

I could understand how he would be disruptive if he were hanging out on the couch or taking up the bathroom, etc. But he literally only stays in my room to sleep, and maybe take a piss in the morning before leaving. I don't think we are loud as that has never been brought up in the complaint.

When she initially brought it up, I told her that I don't think she has a right to dictate who is in my room or when, if they are not affecting her or getting in her way, and I would give her that same respect of her room as well. 

When asking her HOW his presence behind a closed door of my room bothers her, she says I'm ""arguing semantics"" (?????).  I have offered to compromise if she could explain what the issue is, but again, I haven't gotten a direct answer about that.

Now, my boyfriend and I mostly avoid her, but she has just gone to the landlord and it has created this big drama, and she's telling me she wants me to move out because I am ""not living civilly"" with her by ""brushing [her] off.""

Am I the asshole for thinking and telling her I should be allowed to have whomever I want in my own room whenever I want, especially when she won't explain WHY or HOW it is ""disruptive"" to her?? I don't think that the only way to ""compromise"" is to have to obey her...?",149,213,0.87
1212,Not the A-hole,"My Aunt Celine was my Mom’s older sister. She was married to my Uncle Ben but they did not have children. Ten years ago they sold a property that was inherited by Uncle Ben for a large amount of money, and they decided to get life insurance policies. They are each other’s primary beneficiaries, and as I was Aunt Celine’s favorite niece back then, she named me their secondary beneficiary. 

About two years ago, Aunt Celine and I fought and stopped talking. I know she loved me and she helped our family financially, but she was very pushy with her ‘traditional’ and ‘conservative’ views as one of those people who thought that they get to be right just because they’re older. I tried to be as respectful and understanding as I could, but when she told me that I should only give my dad $100 every month to buy his food and medicine and I should stop buying him ‘luxuries’ like clothes and shoes (from outlet stores) because he and my mom are estranged and he needs to be taught a lesson, I snapped and told her she had no right to dictate what relationship I want to have with my own father. She was enraged at my disrespect. Since then, we have not spoken. A few months ago, she and Uncle Ben sadly passed in an traffic accident. 

In their wills, they left money to their nephews and nieces except for me, the niece who talked back, and my sister, the lesbian. Both of us don’t really care. However, there is the issue of their life insurance policy. The payout is a substantial amount, and apparently, since Aunt Celine never removed me as the second beneficiary and she and Uncle Ben passed together, the money is mine. 

When Uncle Ben’s family (his sisters and their children) found out about the insurance policy, they called my mother and told her that I should give them the payout. They said it was unfair that I would get the money since Aunt Celine made it clear that she didn’t want to leave me or my sister anything and their source of wealth is the sale of the property that Uncle Ben inherited from his parents.

My mother talked to me about it, but I’m thinking that this money is legally mine and I am under no obligation to give it to anyone. I didn't force Aunt Celine to name me the beneficiary then, and my mother even pointed out that maybe it would be better if she also named one of her nieces from Uncle Ben’s side as co-secondary beneficiary, but Aunt Celine just said that one secondary beneficiary is enough. It’s not my fault that she didn’t remove me as the beneficiary after we stopped talking. Also, Aunt Celine and Uncle Ben left money to my cousins, the children of my mother's other sister, so clearly they wanted to leave them something, but Uncle Ben's family wants me to give the money only to them and not to my cousins. How is that 'fair' if I go by their definition of fairness?

I have a 17 year old son who I love dearly, I've managed to save 15,000$ for his uni, when my wife found out she told me that we could split it and give each kid half. I've refused because I have been saving this money for 5 years and I did it before I met my wife so I see the money as my sons.

1216,Not the A-hole,"So, I started back at work from being on maternity leave for 11 months this past Monday. In my small town we have dayhomes and daycare centres. My older sister takes her 4yo to a dayhome, so I wanted to take my son there so the cousinz could be together, and my sister really likes her. 

We did a meet and greet sort of thing a couple weeks before we started him there so we got to know the woman a bit. She revealed to us that she has 20 kids in her dayhome. For context, in our province the maximum amount of kids per unlicensed dayhome is 8 per 1 worker. Lots of them were school age but she still has quite a few under the age of 5, the youngest being 2 (besides my son who is 11 months). This threw up a red flag but we were desperate for someone and we just  took the plunge.

So the first day comes and all is good. I check in on my lunch break to see how he is doing and she says that hes been good. My boyfriend picked him up at the end of the day and he had a dirty, poopy diaper. It was his first day so I didn't address considering it might be a one off sort of thing. 

Everyday of the week he was picked up with a maximum of 3 diaper changes in 8 hours, dirty clothes, despite me putting 3 changes of clothes in his diaper bag. Thursday my boyfriend picked him up with a smelly, wet, shirt covered in puke. 

Now, the opportunity for a new dayhome has arised and we are pouncing on it. The lady is a long time family friend who recently lost her job who lives near us. We are going to pull our son out of his current day home and take him to our family friend. 

My sisters think I am being irrational and disrespectful for taking him out so soon. While I agree i might be over-reacting a bit, I pay a decent chunk for him to be taken care of and 4 out of 5 days we have had issues. The sister that takes her son there said I am making this stuff up and  she is going to tell the daycare worker that I am trashing her name.

Back story: I’ve known this friend since kindergarten. We were inseparable until 9th grade then didn’t speak for 12 years. She became popular in high school and I didn’t so we lost touch. It always hurt my feelings, but I never told her that. During those 12 years she made a new core group of friends that did everything together. Since 2014 our families have spent every thanksgiving together. She and I would hang out once a month or so and Snapchat/ Instagram stuff regularly. 

In January she got engaged. The night she got engaged her fiancé had a surprise engagement party planned with what she described as all her “close friends.” I wasn’t invited...

Also in January my boyfriend and I decided we were going to utilize my Christmas vacation to go to Europe. We didn’t have tickets booked, but we had plans to go 12/20 to 1/4.  I requested the time off of work and everything so the plans were in motion. 

In February she sent out the save the dates for her 12/28 wedding in Florida (we live 1,000 miles north of the wedding location). That’s right in the middle of our planned trip and inconveniently close to Christmas and New Years so flights are outrageous. 

We booked our tickets to Europe instead of to Florida for her wedding. 

I priced it out hotel and flights for a long weekend in Florida is the same as two weeks in Europe (hotel and flights).

 I’ve felt like a secondary friend to her for the last 5 ish years. I didn’t think she’d be upset. 

I was wrong. I told her in person and she joked it off saying she was just going to go on an exotic vacation when I get married. Later that night she text me how I hurt her and that this damaged our friendship. Complete with a broken heart emoji.

1220,Not the A-hole,"Background:

I got a dog on the advice of my therapist a few years ago. He isn't an ESA, although he does help me quite a bit. I am a veteran that has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and severe anxiety, he has helped me immensely since we've been together.  I try to take him on walks daily to get both of us exercise, we walk the same route most days.  He means the world to me, and is in my post history.

A few weeks ago a kid in a car threw a pizza crust out of the window of his friends car while we were walking down the street on the sidewalk. He said ""Hey man!"" a second before he threw it and I looked up and bonk, right in the forehead!  Nice aim really.  No worries, they are kids, I'm kind of mad but I will get over it. I keep walking, and don't think about it for a few days.

A week or so goes by and I'm walking my dog again and the same car rolls around and the same teenage kid yells out ""Hey man!"" except this time he throws a bottle of diet coke on the ground in front of me and it explodes. I stop and just glare in the direction of the car because there really isn't much I can do. The kid hangs out the window laughing and pointing. A random person comes up an says they saw the whole thing and I get their information. Apparently useful in a bit.

Last week I was walking down the same road, it's a main road in my town with a sidewalk, and the car shows up again. I bring my dog close to me so I can protect him if anything gets thrown out of the car. It turns out to be another coke bottle and this time it hits my dog in the head. He doesn't care, he's a dog and it's not that big of a deal to him. However I yell at the car to ""GO F\*CK THEMSELVES"". The car stops and the person who threw the bottle and a friend from the back seat climb out.

An altercation ensues in which I ""win"". One of them is unconscious on the ground, the other is hurt and back in the car, I have a cut above my eyebrow and some bruises.  The police and ambulance show up, take the one kid to the hospital, the other is checked out and is fine. I get questioned as to what happened as do other witnesses and released a few hours later (my statement is corroborated by the witnesses, like the one from a little while ago). They are both charged with assault charges and left to go home with their parents.

The kids parents have found me and said that they are sorry and want the charges dropped because they are just kids and don't want this to follow them in the future. I tell them no. I haven't spoken to the prosecutor yet, but I think they should face the penalties for what they did. I will not back down and want them to suffer the consequences of their actions.

1222,Not the A-hole,"This situation is really blowing up my personal life right now, and it’s causing a lot of heartache. I (19F) live with my dad and stepmom (50s M/F). When I was 10, my mom died of pneumonia brought on by autoimmune issues. It was a shock, especially because my parents had a traditional marriage. My mom was my dad’s “helpmeet,” and she and I did all the housework and women’s tasks (I also have two older brothers). My dad got remarried really quickly, and I think it’s because he was kinda lost without my mom. 

Now, my mom always made clear that I was to have the same type of life as her. After high school, i would marry a strong Christian, have a large family, and become a helpmeet. I would remain under my husband’s umbrella of authority, and I would teach my daughters to be good mothers and my sons to be warriors for Christ. I went to Christian high school, and I didn’t question that stuff for a long time. 

Now that I’m an adult, I’m losing my faith, and I’m starting to feel that this lifestyle is kinda sexist and not for me. I want to be a nurse and work outside the home, but my dad is pressuring me to start courting a boy from our church. He and my stepmom say that going to college and staying single would betray the dreams my mom had for me.

1223,Not the A-hole,"I'm a college senior (21F). To save on housing costs I moved back home for my final year of college. My household/family is me, my mom, stepdad, and two brothers. My biological father is/was an abuser; I left when I was 18; because I'm the oldest, my younger brothers still see him regularly, per the custody schedule, but they aren't treated nearly as badly as I was, being the oldest and only girl. Everyone agrees on everything up to this point.

What is disputed is whether my needs are actually being dismissed, or whether I'm being unreasonable. I moved back home, as I said, and my room is in the basement. I'm taking summer classes online and will be commuting to school in the fall and spring to finish my degree - I'm a full-time student and also work 15-20 hrs/week (from home right now, although that may change depending on internship opportunities).

While I lived away, my younger brother (13) - we'll call him Winston - developed a game he calls ""QWA."" The game is throwing a yoga ball around the basement. He does this for hours. He broke several things that I left outside my room, has put holes in the walls, etc. but my family generally laughs it off like it's a totally normal thing to do. And I ignored it until I moved back home.

But now I'm back. And the first issue was that it's very upsetting to my cat, who lives with me. He's developed stress-related health issues and Winston locks him in my room for hours to play this game, and often forgets to open the door when he leaves.

The second issue is that, obviously, I am working in my room in the basement. I simply cannot work while he is throwing a yoga ball against my door, and I don't think I have to defend that.

My mother gets really upset with me when I suggest that Winston shouldn't be allowed to play this ""game"" now that I'm back. The only argument that holds any weight (imo) is that this is clearly a coping mechanism for dealing with his issues with my dad. What I would add here in my own defense is that when I was 13, I was being really, really abused - had developed an eating disorder, depression and anxiety - and she explicitly told me to just take it to ""protect my brothers."" So it's difficult for me to accept her argument that he should be allowed to do whatever he wants because my dad is sometimes mean or controlling to him. It's also relevant that I have repeatedly suggested other activities like basketball (we have a hoop) or tennis (we live near courts) which (a) would resolve this conflict and (b) probably would be better coping skills bc they are normal games and could be played with others in a healthy social environment.

Clearly I have a lot of resentment towards my mom, and clearly all of this is bogged down in decades of unhealthy dynamics. I just need people who aren't in it to tell me - am I being totally unreasonable and prying away a coping mechanism from my younger brother, OR is this a reasonable complaint to have in light of all the extenuating circumstances and possible solutions?

1224,Not the A-hole,"Hi reddit.

&#x200B;

So I was with my now ex for about 6 years, and of that time, we were married for about 3. We have a 2 year old together. She had a difficult pregnancy, was sick a lot, and fell into a depressive state that got much much worse after the baby was born. Think full tilt PPD. She refused to seek any help despite the urging of me and a tiny handful of close friends she let in on how she was feeling. Everyone else got a fake happy face which made her even more miserable. I stood by her faithfully and helped her through the worst of it. About a year and a half after the baby was born she started feeling better, but she seemed somehow, changed? She engaged in more risky behavior than I'd ever seen her do before. Weed went from a once in a while thing to a multiple times per day routine, she'd drive under the influence, and the like. She had this hardened, standoffish edge that replaced the goofiness and carefree demeanor that I fell in love with.

&#x200B;

The whole time she was pregnant, and into the time after we went through these rough cycles where she felt super anxious about sex and didn't want to be touched, and asked me to let her dictated the pace and flow of our sex life. Naturally, I would respect that. That would turn into her getting upset because she started feeling insecure because I wasn't initiating frequently, and if I told her that I was only following through with her request as best I could, I'd be met with the suggestion that I was shifting the blame on her because either I didn't want to admit I wasn't attracted to her anymore, I was cheating on her, or I was gay (???). This took a huge toll on our sex life and that made things worse across the board.

&#x200B;

Finally she told me she wanted a divorce, that she'd been seeing another guy and that she didn't see me as a partner anymore, more of a roommate and caregiver. I was devastated. Our divorce was messy because she wanted full custody of our child and I had to fight tooth and nail to get 50/50. She told me that she felt that the custody fight was just an attack on her. I just really like being a dad and want equal time with my kid. 

&#x200B;

She's made a habit of telling people that I was terrible, abusive, etc to anyone that will listen. Yesterday she made a long facebook post dragging me through the mud and slandering me all over the place. To this point i've grinned and beared it, but I snapped and replied letting her have it and laying it out similarly to how I did here. I followed up with some screenshots of our texts to validate what I was saying. She didn't deny any of it, rather she claimed I was just being abusive again by calling her out. In the last 24 hours i've had a lot of people jump on me not so much for defending myself but for outing her mental health issues which she'd done a lot to try to conceal from general view. In my mind I was just \*finally\* defending my good name.

So first of all, thank you so much for your replies and advice! I’m writing an update post because things ended up working out well, and because I want people to see my friend isn’t actually a horrible person like people were saying she was.

I texted her asking if we could work things out over a phone call (we don’t live in the same state, so our relationship is over phone and text). It turns out a lot of you were right and my friend was being pressured to ask me to wear a wig. Her future mother in law found out about my shaved head and pitched a fit. Like I said in a comment, my friend can be a huge pushover, and this woman is apparently a nightmare. She’s also paying for vast majority of the wedding, so my friend felt even more beholden to what she wanted. That’s why she told me she couldn’t pay for the wig: mother in law refused to. Neither of them knew how expensive a good wig can be, my friend only found out when I told her over the phone. That’s also why our dresses, shoes and makeup weren’t covered. It turns out my friend is mortified by what she sees as her mother in law making her look cheap and greedy, but she didn’t want to tell us that because she’s already embarrassed to be relying on her mother in law’s money. (Apparently it’s her fiancé’s family insisting on a huge extravagant wedding.) 

That’s why her reasons didn’t ring true to me as well. She didn’t want to hurt my feelings by telling me that her mother in law was being so judgmental of me, so she basically blurted out the first things that came into her head. She assured me she thinks I look great with short hair and apologized for making me think she thought I look bad. 

I know people will question how I can believe her, but I’ve been friends with her for nearly ten years and I give her the benefit of the doubt. We’ve been there for each other through a lot and really care about one another. 

I’m still side eyeing the plantation wedding but I didn’t tell her that because she seemed so stressed out by essentially being bullied by her fiancé’s family I didn’t want to pile on. I do know for a fact that she only wanted that venue for the big oak trees all over the property, which are admittedly beautiful. I went to the plantation’s website and they do acknowledge slavery’s evils and even have a memorial to everyone who was enslaved there, so that makes me feel slightly better. 

I did tell her that asking me as a mixed girl to wear a blonde wig could be seen as racially insensitive and I explained why. She was horrified and apologized over and over sincerely. She wants to stand out from her bridesmaids in pictures, and she didn’t even consider the racial implications of asking me because most of her bridesmaids are blonde. She’s kind of oblivious to things like that (so are a lot of people!) but the few times I’ve had to point out something she said could be hurtful she’s always been understanding instead of defensive. 

I decided I’m going to grow out my hair as much as possible for the wedding just to help her not get grief from her monster in law. It’ll still be pretty short, so that’s okay. She’s fine with that too except she was worried I’ll still have to deal with snide remarks from her fiancé’s family. I reassured her that after nearly a decade with short hair I’ve pretty much heard it all. By the time we hung up I felt way better not only about the wedding, but about our friendship.",528,20499,0.92

So I moved to another country recently, to be more specific, another continent. And it's very easy for local people to tell that I'm from a different race. (Important background information) Very often I would go shopping in a big supermarket nearby, and each time I would get some oranges. The thing is, I would pick up the orange and check if it's bruised, if it is I would put it back and take another one. It is totally okay to do this where I am from, and I've seen quite a lot local people do it in the new country I moved to. So I guess it's fine to touch the oranges. I don't touch the apples though.

One day I was shopping in the supermarket, while I was picking oranges, I heard a lady saying ""That's not how you do it in [country name]"". I said pardon and the lady basically said what I did is wrong and dirty. I explained that other local people do this too so I thought it's okay to touch them. Then she said ""If you touch them other people will get infected"" and then left.

I was really upset and thought I was wrong for doing it. I asked some of my local friends and they said that they touch the fruits too in the supermarket, and the lady only said those things because I'm a foreigner.

1231,Not the A-hole,"Ok, strap yourselves in this is a long one. 

My freshman year of college (I’m now in grad school), I met a senior from a neighboring school (let’s call him Will) on a dating app that I thought was very attractive. We went on a couple dates, but I actually ended up dating a guy in my grade from my university for about 2 years. 

Will was respectful of that, but still kept in touch. He was originally from a suburb of Detroit, but now lives in Nashville. Coincidentally, I interned in Detroit last summer. He randomly came home, and went to a baseball game because my home state team was playing. I thought this was a coincidence, but he later told me he bought last minute tickets to the game after seeing the stadium on my Instagram. 

I am now going to grad school in Nashville, which is where Will lives now. I stayed with him when I came for my interview, and we’ve still stayed in touch. He keeps asking me to send naked pictures, and saying I used to be more playful when I was younger. It bothers me because I just have matured and no longer want to send those photos. I’ve explained this to him, but he says he “wishes we could go back to before”

My brother is going to a military academy tomorrow, and we had a party this afternoon to say goodbye to him. Will keeps texting me despite my letting him know I was busy spending time with my brother since we will have no communication for 6 weeks. Every time I don’t reply “quickly enough” he will text me “please don’t go now”. 

It’s a bit frustrating and to be quite honest, annoying. I feel like an asshole if I block him... especially because I’m moving to the same city as him and may see him. But at the same time, it doesn’t seem like I’m getting through to him. 

So, WIBTA if I block him on social media and his phone number? Or should I give him a chance once I move?

She’s been planning flying across the country to meet me and my family next month for a while and yesterday she told me she wouldn’t be able to make it. When she called me to clarify why she wasn’t coming, she said she was thinking of getting married during that time. She explained why she loved the guy and why she wanted to get married so quickly (she’s religious and can’t wait longer than that to have sex). I told her I would support her normally and that she’s an adult, but that 2 months was really quick. I told her I already had a vacation planned with my family and would prefer to do that.

Some other key pieces of info are that she told me about her plans on my dad’s birthday and that she has been a pretty absent grandparent (never talks to my kids and doesn’t remember their birthdays and never asks how they are doing).

1234,Asshole,"I am on a two week business trip to Orlando (sorry throwaway for obvious reasons). I am here with my best work friend meeting potential clients. For the most part we are exhausted after work and have had one drink at the bar then passed out to wake up and do it again. 

Last night we decided to cut loose just a little bit and we went off the resort property to a more local bar down the road. We were minding our own business when this group of guys started clearly hitting on us. They were Fun and funny and my friend dances with a couple of them (she's single) but between the two of us we more found it amusing that these guys probably got in on fake ID, we were 29 and 31 and looked like we'd been put through the ringer after making 5 brutal sales calls that day. It was even funnier because there were girls their own age all over rhe bar but apparently these guys thought the ""Cougars"" were a sure thing.

I'd had a few drinks (buzzed) but I'd promised my husband I'd call him at 9 to check in. I told him about my day, he told me about his and he'd had a miserable day and said ""please cheer me up."" I told him how funny it was that these 19 year old group of 6 guys was hitting on us and how ridiculous it was. He got sternly serious and said ""what are you talking about?"" I said no it's not a big deal at all, just silly. We were leaving to the hotel by 10. He said ""just show them your tits Bailey, you know you LOVE the attention."" And hung up. I tried to text and call him 1000 Times but no answer. I was heart broken that he spoke to me like that. 

I went back in the bar and just started hammering back the drinks. Maybe an hour later I grabbed the ""cutest"" guy and told him to come outside with me. In the parking lot I told him ""my husband said i should show you my tits and i don't want to let my husband down."" So I grabbed up my shirt and bra and flashed this guy my breasts. He said somthing like those are Amazing and better than his girlfriends. I said cool and we went back inside. Nothing else came of it. We continued to drink and dance until closing and I was so hung over today that I'm just now coming to reality. My husband has not called and I have not called him so I have no idea where we stand.

But back to the issue, please help me clear up my head...was I the asshole for flashing this guy? Or can I say I was in weird spot and did a weird thing and not an asshole?",124,63,0.68

She went into labor this morning but things weren't going well so we took her to the ER. $5,000 later and only one of two kittens survived and the surviving is very weak with a bleak outlook, OC still isn't out of the woods either and I'm a wreck over it. No good deed, right?

UPDATE: Cat is around 6-7 months old, got shots and tests today, healthy but pregnant... Poor thing!

I seriously just joined Reddit super recently and this my second post here so I'm sure I'm TA...

Last week a cat came up to me while I was on my porch smoking. I tried to shoo it, but I live on a main road in my town and it almost got hit right in front of me, so I took it in for the night. The next day the owners were walking around with fliers, I was at work, so my brother verified and gave them the cat. Four hours later she was back. The next day I went to the street they said they were on, knocked on 5 doors, nobody recognized her. Three days later (brother is home all day and we were waiting for owners to return) we waited until traffic was light, walked to her side street, and let her go find home. Someone else posted the next day (yesterday) that they found her. I messaged her, cat was not ok with her dogs, she brought cat to me.

Cat is sweet, nondestructive, and I have a vet appointment to get her fixed, updated on shots, and chipped this week.

I ended my period Friday, and boiled my diva cup this morning. I put it on about 10am (after my shower where I washed it). After, I turned the heat off, poured out the water, and left the pot on the burner so the cup would cool down before i put it away - to avoid burning my fingers.   
 

 I ended up forgetting about my cup.  (Not that I was trying to hide it from boyfriend anyways)
 
My boyfriend came over. First thing he does it goes to the kitchen to get something to drink. He took a while in the kitchen so I yelled at him to ask what he was doing. He yelled back “uh ... what’s in this pot?”. 
 
I explain and he just seems disgusted. He asked if I ever cooked him a meal in this pot and I said I wasn’t sure but probably. We go back and forth. I pull up the website to prove it says to boil the cup after use. He said that if a TP company told him to boil his toilet paper after use he’d just ignore it. He said I put him in danger by possibly contaminating his food with period blood ... mind you I clean the cup out before boiling! Boiling is just to kill bacteria, I guess?   
 
 
I can kind of see his point, but I don’t think boiling the cup contaminated the pot. I can’t find anything about it online either.
 
Anyways, AITA for not having a separate pot to boil my diva cup in? 
 
Edit: I also clean the pot after boiling. 
 
Edit: I’d also like to clarify that when the cup goes into the pot, it has no blood. It’s already been cleaned. Like it’s just clear silicon. I wanted to mention that because some people seem to imply otherwise.

1238,Asshole,"Some backstory: my husband and I recently made a bunch of bad investment and pretty much live paycheck to paycheck supporting our 3 sons and adopted niece (story for another time). 

We recently moved to a larger town (from a small one) as my husband found a better higher paying job. Don’t have any family or friends here. 

My husband got invited to a charity gala for work, which although was optional would not have been a good look if a new employee sat it out. We were not expected to donate any money, but it was a black tie event.

I had nothing to wear to this event, but he was insistent that I needed to come. I tried rental agencies but I’m a larger girl and nothing fit me right.

I went to a plus-size bridal type store and found a dress that fit me properly and looked stunning. I looked at the price tag and had a mini mental breakdown because it was so expensive. I’d been looking for so long and this was the only dress that fit. 

One of the sales assistants (a larger woman herself) took me aside and asked me what was wrong. She was so kind and offered me so much sweetness. She said that her manager would kill her, but she understood my situation and without outrightly stating it told me that the store had a 30 day full refund program. She implied that I could buy the dress and return it. 

I went to the gala and I looked amazing, my husband looked amazing and it was the first good day I’ve had in a while. I tucked the tag into the waist of my skirt, everything was going well until 

one of his coworkers said hello to me and whispered: u/itcarriesonman you left your tag on and she proceeded to pull it off. I felt my heart drop and I felt awful. I didn’t say anything right away, but I was devastated.

I took her aside later in the night and told her that I wasn’t planning on keeping the dress, I needed to return it and that our family was in financial trouble. I asked if she would be willing to pay for the dress. She refused. 

She was incredibly offended that I asked and so was my husband. He thought it was incredibly inappropriate for me to ask, but I thought it was even more inappropriate to pull on and tamper with someone else’s dress. So reddit AITA?",279,678,0.92

They will drink, scream, yell, sing, whatever in the backyard until 2 in the morning. I have to wake up at 2:30am for work, so trying to sleep through this isn't fun. I have asked her to please keep it quiet plenty of times or at least take it inside, she responds with just close the windows so you don't hear it. I have went to my slumlord of a manager and ask them to do something about it but yet they never have and I don't think they care to.

1241,Not the A-hole,"Quick backstory

I'm a single mom of an 8 year old. My brother (42) recently separated from his wife after a 20 year marriage and since both of our parents passed away, we are our only family left. So while going through the separation and divorce process, he is renting a room from me in my house.

Now AITA

When he moved in, he was a mess, pretty sad, was blowing off work, wanted to talk a lot etc. he was just really emotional, I think most people get pretty emotional during a marriage breakdown. About a week after he moved in, my ex husband had a major work issue that caused him to not be able to take our son for his scheduled visit that night but would pick up the next morning, this has happened in the past but is rare, maybe about once or twice a year. Of course, my son was really disappointed and cried that he couldn't go to his dad's so I decided to try to make the best of it, I got him a pizza, we watched Ralph Breaks the Internet and let him stay up late. 

Unfortunately, I had plans with my boyfriend so I had to cancel. When I say plans, I was going to go to his house, we were going to make ramen and watch Netflix, so we weren't going to a big event or anything. Just hanging out plans. 

Anyway, I canceled and my boyfriend blew up and told me that my brother was selfish for not offering to babysit and that I should have made him since he's staying here. 

I was miffed because my brother pays rent, he pays for his own food, he's like a roommate and babysitting my son is not his responsibility. Plus, he was pretty emotional and watching my son was a last thing he wanted to do thing. 

I also felt that since his dad was busy with something really important like his job, I felt it was my responsibility to try to a disappointing night into something that would make it a little less disappointing and that includes spending time together.

When I told my boyfriend this, he said that was unfair and that it's obvious that I don't have my shit together because I'm not making him a priority. And that since my brother is staying with me, I should be able to come to his house more because I have ""a live babysitter."" 

I think this is skewed as fuck.

so it was my wife's 29th birthday last week and I took her to a fancy restaurant and covered the bed in rose petals and you can geuss the rest. 

she then told me that she also wanted to have a girls day with her friends and go bar hopping, this was going to be her birthday gift from her girl friends, I told her that it would be awesome and I hope she has a great time. 

now to add, we had a talk a while back about boundrys and we both agreed that strip clubs where a no go. especially strippers. 

she gets home at around 3 completely wasted and proceeded to pass out so I decided to wait until she wakes up to find out what happened, I then realised that I'm friends on snapchat with some of the girls she went out with. I went to view the snap story and was shocked, they had decided to head to a strip club and they got my wife a lap dance. she was clearly enjoying this guy swinging his hips at her. I was pissed off and decided to head to bed and talk to my wife about it in the morning. 

when we woke up i questioned why she went to a strip club and got a lap dance and she refused to answer me. 
I just felt so betrayed because all I could see was a guy grinding on my wife. 

so I kinda let loose and told her how disrespectful she is and that I feel so betrayed and unhappy, I explained that I cant look at her now withought seeing the guy who grinded on you. 
she never said anything throughout the whole speech, and it looked like she was not even listening half way through so I got up and told her I would be staying with my mum   

that caused her to start crying and apologizing, I refused to listen to her and went to my mums. 

my mum is happy to have me but thinks I overreacted, and most of my family/friends agree.

1244,Not the A-hole,"First time poster, using a throwaway. Sorry for the long post.

**Background:**

My mom is a corporate lawyer, my dad is a diplomat. My parents weren't really ever around when I (18F) was growing up because of their jobs. Neither of my parents even took parental leave when I was born - my mom was back at work within a week of giving birth. I've never felt close to either of them.

I don't think it's unfair to say that I was raised almost solely by my nanny / housekeeper, Adola. Adola was hired when I was nearly 2, and she lived with us until I was 15, then she moved in with her sister who had just moved here (Canada) from their home country (Croatia). Adola still comes around once a week to clean and meal prep, and she is essentially like a grandmother to me. She is at all major holidays and family events.

When I was a kid I used to act out because of lack of attention from my parents. Adola recognized this, and always made sure to tell me that my parents loved me and that I should be proud that they were so successful and that they loved their work so much. I used this sentiment to comfort me as I grew up, and even became proud of their dedication to their careers as I grew older.

**The situation:**

Yesterday my parents hosted a party of about 40 family, friends, and co-workers. At one point my dad called for everyone's attention, and my mom announced that she is retiring at the end of the summer. Everyone was really happy for her, but I was really taken aback. My mom is only 45.

When the crowd dispersed from the announcement I pulled my mom aside and asked her why she would leave her job. She told me that she never really liked her job / working in general, and with their savings and my dad's salary, she felt comfortable to retire now. She also said that it was good timing now because I just turned 18 and am going to uni in September, so she doesn't have to spend her retirement ""cleaning up after me"". This felt like a huge slap in the face. I feel like she was basically saying that she would have quit her job earlier if she didn't have to spend time with me by doing so. I also feel resentful that she never spent any real time with me growing up, because she was always working at a job that she didn't even like.

I silently left the party and went up to my room to cry. Adola saw that I was upset as I was leaving, and followed me. She asked what was wrong, and I told her what my mom said and how I felt. She comforted me but also told me again that my parents love me and that I should be happy for my mom's success and ability to retire early. I guess after we talked she talked to my mom to let her know that I was upset. My mom came to my room after the party and told me that I was ungrateful and spoiled, and that I should be happy for her instead of thinking about myself.

AITA?

**Edit:** I just wanted to address some of the repetitive questions / comments here. Seems that for the most part I'm NTA. Thank you for all your judgements, even the not so nice ones. I want everybody to know I've read every comment and direct message, even if I didn't respond (sorry if I didn't, this has been pretty overwhelming).

1. *""Your parents don't really love you / cut them off as soon as possible""* \- I know people who said this meant well, but it hurts a lot to read. I still love my parents, I just wish I knew them better and spent more time with them.
2. *""If you want to mend the relationship, talk to them, lay it all out""* \- I think I might. I don't know when though. Maybe shortly before I leave for school, if I get a chance.
3. *""Go into therapy!""* \- I've been in therapy since I was 11, because of all the 'acting out' I mentioned above.
4. *""NTA get a job to become independent from them"" / ""YTA get a job to learn the value of money and hard work""* \- I have a job for this summer. I've held a summer job every year since I was 14. Sure it wasn't because I need money, yes it was for résumé purposes, yes sometimes it was abroad and more like a vacation - but still, I have worked. However, I would not be able to work enough hours at any position I could land during the school year to cover my tuition and living expenses at school.
5. *\*Insert any comment about my school situation\** \- I can't pay for it on my own and do the degree I want. I could minor in English for 2 years, but my parents want me to transfer into commerce (which I didn't get into for this year) so I need mostly econ-class pre-reqs to transfer, and once I'm in commerce I wouldn't be able to take English. I spoke with an academic advisor in May who told me about all the requirements to transfer. She basically told me I wouldn’t be able to do English along with commerce. Honestly at this point I might just take it easy with school and not try to meet the requirements for commerce. If I stay in Arts I can do a double major probably.
6. *""YTA, you're spoiled, you're probably the 1%, your parents are paying for your tuition, you have never wanted for anything""* \- I'll accept my judgment, but it seems all these comments are coming from a place of bias / jealousy rather than a thought-out judgment. I've only seen one YTA comment that really gives valid reasons for calling me an asshole.
7. *""you're not being abused so you have nothing to complain about. stop whining""* \- This isn't the Oppression Olympics. Complain-worthy content is different for everyone. Some people may unfortunately complain of violent and abusive parents. That's not my case, but it doesn't make my complaints any less valid or any less impactful in my own life.
8. *""Your parents clearly never wanted children""* \- The fact that I was planned (years in advance actually, they knew exactly when they wanted to conceive and have a kid) has come up in conversation in passing. Although I suspect some of you may be correct about them having a kid to check off a box / for the sake of appearances.
9. *""Keep in contact with Adola""* \- I certainly will! I can't imagine my life without her.

1246,Not the A-hole,"Hi. I work at a bridal store that works on fixed appointments. Our breaks are scheduled around those appointments. Today I have an 8 hour shift, so according to company policy I'm supposed to get one half hour break. We had a walk in bride come who's wedding was in 2021 and she straight up said she wasn't going to buy, she just wanted to try dresses on. That's fine, however we do work on commission and it's kinda sucky when that happens. 



At this time, I was finishing up with my bride who's appointment ended at 4:30, and I was supposed to go on break after this. There's also one other stylist here who was just about to get off break who could have taken her once she came back from break. My manager asked me to skip my break and take this walk in, and I asked why the other stylist wouldn't be able to when she got back, because I wouldn't be able to take my break if I took her. My manager got visibly irritated at me for this, and said she'd just take her herself. 

I'm on break now but feel guilty for not taking the bride. I also dont understand why the other stylist didn't just take over once she got off break. I feel like I should have just taken her to avoid conflict, and now I have to close with a manger who's mad at me lol. AITA?

I generally like dogs, but I do know a number of people that are allergic to dogs, afraid of dogs, etc.  My feeling is that people taking dogs where they shouldn't are abusing the general non-confrontational behavior of people, staff, etc, while stepping on rules.  

I see a couple in line at a food court restaurant in the mall. It's something the size of a German Shepherd, and on a leash. I say to the guy holding the leash, ""Dogs aren't allowed in the food court.""

He looks at me and just nods. 

So I say, ""That is a dog. This is a food court. Your dog is in it.""

He just nods, smiles, gives a ""yep."". The woman he was with says to me, ""You need to step back.""

So, I leave. 

My issue -- the mall is apparently dog friendly. Indoor food establishments in California don't allow dogs, but there doesn't appear to be a sign. 

So, am I the asshole?


Edit:

So, good news!

Thanks to everyone saying I shouldn't try to enforce the law, and instead find someone in authority, I found out that I could get a reward of up to $100 for reporting just this one incident.  And if they find it's a common occurrence, I could end up with $5k!

If that happens, r/RandomActsOfPiizza will have a very good day.


Edit:

For the record, I did get a note back from the department of health:

""I am at the mall conducting inspections at least once a week and have noticed the same issue. The only dogs allowed in the food court and dining area/terrace are service animals. Per ADA service animal law, no identification or vest is required to indicate proof of a service animal. The only legal questions may be asked:

Is that dog a service animal?
If so, what services does the animal provide?
Emotional support is not considered an approved service for service animals. I have included some handouts on service animals. Unfortunately, when I ask the above questions, majority of the time the public states the dog is a service animal and gets very upset when I try to ask the second question. I simply provide the information to those I see with dogs and let them know only service animals are allowed and no pets. There are signs posted throughout the facility, however I have told mall management to provide bigger signs or have security monitor the food court more. Anytime I see an animal and it has been confirmed that the dog is not a service animal, I report it to mall management to have security handle the manner. If you would like to put in a formal complaint, I will be happy to take care of the complaint and sit down with mall management.

I'm only adding this update to answer the people who were saying, ""Oh, dogs are probably allowed.""",199,209,0.87
1249,Not the A-hole,"So, for some backstory, I’ve known this guy (We’ll call him S) for years. He was my brothers BEST friend, and he practically lived with us. He went on vacations with us, was always sleeping over, etc. Point being, he was basically family to us. Another point to note is that I am a crippling nicotine addict, and at the time that this happened, I had no access to any kind of nicotine and S was letting me borrow one of his two vapes. This will be important later on.

S and my boyfriend had been getting pretty close as friends, since they work in the same place together. Him and my BF decided to play a game of Never Have I Ever (the card game, its similar to Cards Against Humanity) since S had never played the game. S had placed down a card that said “Been a peeping tom”, which BF had found amusing and asked what the story behind it was.

S had admitted that he’d been creeping on me when I was getting undressed, changed, and showering for the past 5 years, roughly (For context, I was a minor at the time of him peeping on me, he was not). Needless to say, my BF was PISSED. I felt violated, and hurt that he would do that — but I had no proof, so I couldn’t do anything about it.

Maybe three days after that, BF, S and I were playing the card game again. BF had went to bed around 4AM, and it was just S and I. He and I tried to play the game, but he admitted that “It was boring with only two players”. I agreed, and said that I was going to go to bed, and when I got up, he told me to sit back down. I did. Big mistake. 

He pulled the vape that he’d been letting me use from his pocket and said that he’d be “willing to give me one for free”. I was intrigued, but I asked him what the catch was, because I knew there would be one. He asked me to see a private area of mine. Obviously, I declined, and said that I would never cheat on my boyfriend, and it was creepy of him to suggest that. He shrugged and essentially said “Okay, just don’t tell anyone”. I felt violated, disgusted, and immediately went to bed. My boyfriend could tell that something wasn’t right, and I told him everything that happened. 

Long story short, my BF told their mutual friends and they dropped him immediately. BF also told their co-workers what happened, and S was put on blast in front of the entire restaurant. I told my therapist what happened and CPS was contacted (S lives in a house with five sisters, three of which are younger than he is), alongside the police.

I feel terrible. My family, disregarding my brother and BF, are pissed off at me for deciding to open my mouth and tell my therapist. They don’t think he deserves what he’s getting, and my family is practically shunning me for telling people about what he did. 

So, AITA for ruining S’s family dynamic, job, and social life for creeping on me for five years and asking me to cheat on my boyfriend?",399,2238,0.94
1250,Asshole,"Ok so I’ve been with my boyfriend about 2 years now and I’ve met his cousin quite a few times. She’s really sweet and always talks to me a lot when I see her. When I saw her a while ago she started talking about a purity ring at one point and saying that she wouldn’t have sex until marriage, I changed the subject quite quickly because I didn’t really know how to respond. 

It was on my mind a lot after we left though. I know her family are very conservative and religious  and I obviously support whatever she wants to do but I wondered if she needed some other advice from someone who wasn’t her family. I said to my boyfriend shall we give her some condoms and say she should obviosuly wait cause she’s too young atm but she doesn’t have to wait until marriage? He was like nah, I’d just stay out of it. Tbh, I didn’t listen to him because I feel like she did need advice, so when I saw her recently I pulled her into another room with me and gave them to her and said to her ‘look you’re too young to have sex atm but I don’t know what you’ve been taught by your school or your family but I just want you to have these in case you do ever need them’ I said, ‘it is ok to have sex before marriage, it doesn’t make you dirty or impure. You should definitely wait until you find someone who respects you, but I just wanted to tell you this.’ And I gave her my number and told her if she needs to talk about anything I’m always willing to listen and won’t judge her. 

I told her to go get her bag and put them in there so she did, and that was that. 

Well, we get a knock on our door yesterday from her parents going mad at me for giving her underaged child condoms and telling her to have sex. I was like...woahhhhh I did not tell her to have sex, I wanted her to have them in case anything happens. They were like she’s a child why are you trying to persuade her into doing stuff. I was like this is ridiculous. My boyfriend told them to leave but he apologized to them which made me mad, but they were like I don’t want her near our child.

1253,No A-holes here,"OK so I start grad school in September, across the country from where I currently live. I lived in an apartment until June 15, when my lease ended. My parents invited me to live with them, rather than subleasing, so I could save more money which I happily accepted. I have a GREAT relationship with both my parents so I was looking forward to spending more time with them before moving away.

My parents recently downsized from the house I grew up in to a smaller condo. In our old house, my parents room and my room were on opposite sides of the house so I never heard much of anything. In the condo, my room is directly next to my parents room. Also, my parents both retired early (they're in their mid-50s) so they don't have a set schedule or anything. I still have a 9-5 job that I'll be at until mid-August.

Since I moved in on Sunday, my parents have had loud, screaming sex EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. I'm happy they're happy but it's a little much. I've tried earplugs and everything but they're just so loud. I think I've slept maybe 4 hours each night since moving in. I worked from home yesterday because I was so physically exhausted that I couldn't make it into the office.

I love my parents and I know they're doing me a favor by letting me stay with them rent-free but I don't know if I can handle this for two more months. WIBTA for asking them to keep it down?",17,40,0.94

Most their friends have social media, a couple of my older daughters friends have dealt with cyber bulling on there and there’s old men in their comments sections saying disgusting things.  I don’t want my child having to deal with this yet especially because she’s a very impressionable child. She’s dealt with an eating disorder and I think sites like Instagram could really trigger it again. I just think they’re at a very fragile age and I’m not comfortable with them having yet. 

I know I can’t shelter her from the world forever but right now I can to an extent, of course she thinks I’m really mean for this, my younger one isn’t so bothered but does still ask for it

1255,Not the A-hole,"My husband John and I have two kids: Sarah and James, twins, age 3 (all fake names).

Sarah recently got into having her nails painted. John wasn't totally comfortable with it because he thinks make-up is weird and adult-looking on a toddler. I argued that she just likes the colour and it's fairly normal for a toddler to have painted nails. He asked what I would do if James wanted his nails painted. I said it would do it if asked but I wouldn't push it on him. James did ask to have his nails painted, but after one nail was done he decided he didn't like it and we took off the polish.

A week or so later, Sarah was getting her nails painted and James asked to get his done too so I painted them. He really liked it this time.

John freaked out and demanded that the polish was taken off. We argued a few points and his main arguments were:

1. It's a slippery slope from nail polish to a full face with foundation, lipstick and eyeliner

2. Women only wear nail polish to make themselves more attractive to men, therefore I am trying to make our kid attractive

3. The other kids in the creche would make fun of him 

I argued back that the slippery slope argument is bullshit, women paint their nails for many reasons and we should not teach our son to care what other people think about his appearance.

He accused me of not understanding where he's coming from. I do, I just don't agree with him. I think there are other issues behind his discomfort but that's another conversation.

In the end, I told John that he could remove the nail polish and in the future he could tell our son no when he asks for his nails to be painted.

John said that I was forcing him to be the bad guy and he wasn't going to do that, so our son has pink fingernails and my husband is not happy.

AITA for making my husband the (potential) bad guy?

Edit - thanks for all the responses, plenty to think about here. I've always been aware that I'm more liberal than my husband but our differences are deeper than I thought so we have a lot of talking to do.

Regarding the nail polish, we are taking it off tomorrow. Our family will visit my FIL in the hospice and he will definitely make homophobic comments about it. He's got dementia and will never change. My husband adores his dad and doesn't want to fight with him.


Edit 2: The amount of anger in many responses is peculiar and the suggestion that only people with the right attitudes should have kids is... disturbing.

Many thanks again to those who responded thoughtfully to an internet stranger, I really appreciate it.

My husband has a fucked up understanding of sexuality, passed down from his abused, oppressed and repressive parents. They had him late in life so they are closer in age to the grandparents of my generation than the parents. We are not going to change them but we can and will work on ourselves.

Final comment, I am happy with my understanding of misogyny. I used it in responses, not in my original post. That was deliberate. That said, I

1259,Not the A-hole,"UPDATE: there’s a lot of you asking for an update, so here it goes, although it’s not much of an update. My husband went along with the dress request, as he already had clothes that fit the bill. I didn’t explain or consult her and wore what I had already purchased. 

She didn’t say anything (honestly I don’t think she noticed). Her wedding party matched; her family sort of had a color scheme...maybe 50/50. I didn’t stick out at all, and I only needed to be in two pictures anyway. She was super stressed before the wedding (it was an outdoor wedding and it poured rain before the ceremony), so when the ceremony and reception went off smoothly I think she was able to relax. She was a beautiful bride and her reception was well done. 

Thank you for all for helping me feel much less guilty about possibly contributing to a bride’s stress on her big day! 


Tl;Dr AITA if I don’t wear my SIL’s wedding colors, because she only told me I had to 3 hours before her wedding?

My sister-in-law (husband’s ex-step-sister) is getting married today. She got engaged in December 2018. 

We need to leave for the wedding in about 3.5 hours, and she just texted my husband to ask what we both planned on wearing. He told her (both nice outfits, nothing casual or over-the-top), she said no. She told him he needed to wear khaki pants, which is no big deal, as he has some. She then told him I needed to be wearing purple or tan. She’s never mentioned that we need to wear anything specific before today, or anything really about the plans of the day other than what time to arrive. My husband and her are close, so information isn’t hard to pass between the two of them. 

I don’t own anything (literally nothing) in either of those colors. I’m also not in the wedding party (neither is my husband). I don’t feel like going shopping and rushing to find something, especially as I live in a small town where there’s not a lot of options to begin with. 

Am I the asshole if I show up wearing the outfit I already bought, but isn’t a part of her color scheme? I don’t want to ruin her photos (which, am I even going to be in them? I didn’t think so), but this seems ridiculous to me. AITA?",166,1969,0.96

b) kill her with kindness.

Things she has done to me since it was announced that Evelyn is getting engaged: 

1. Said that I shouldn't be MoH and stand beside Eve for 'aesthetic' reasons, I would look best ""at the end""
2. Said in the group chat that she doesn't think asian features are pretty (I'm asian lol) 
3. Asked why I didn’t have a guy to buy my dress (I guess her boyfriend bought her bridesmaid dress) 
4. Called dibs on not sleeping in the same room as me for our AirBNB for the bachelorette party
5. Said I wasn't a real friend to Evelyn because they've known each other for way longer
6. Asked what clothes I'll be packing for our bach party weekend because she doesn't want our pictures to look bad

My brother recently invited me to play dungeons and dragons with him (turned out to be a thing with multiple of my siblings and their SO's) and initially I was excited because every other time I've ever played I've ended up being stuck being dungeon master (which I accepted because I got our last group together) and I wasn't good at it so I mostly used premade campaigns and let my players do whatever. So needless to say I was excited to be a player for the first time and started coming up with character ideas, only to find out that he wanted us to play character that he had made for us. When I tried to argue with him about how creating your own character is a huge part of the game and how I didn't want to skip this part on my first time being a player character, I was basically told that I could ""choose"" (in quotes because everyone else either has already chosen their character or will definitely get to choose before me leaving me with whatever is leftover) my person out of the premade characters or not play at all. He did say I would eventually get to make my own when later after our character die but he says that will be 9-10 sessions in and we only plan on meeting twice a month so this would be almost half a year into us playing. Which is a whole nother can of worms. I don't like because by then I would have been playing and leveling a character for HALF A YEAR. I basically told my brother that dealing with your players decisions is part of being a dungeon master and that the game is supposed to allow more freedom than me being forced to be a specific character.

1266,Asshole,"Throwaway because I'm sure some people will find this controversial and I don't want it tied to my main.

When my wife and I got married we agreed that we would have 2 kids unless both were girls, then we'd have a 3rd to try for a boy. I'm a guy's guy and I grew up with only brothers so I feel strongly that I want a son to bond with. That's not to say that I don't love my daughter equally. I just want to raise someone to follow in my footsteps with sports and girls and stuff. After some convincing, my wife agreed to this but said that if the 3rd kid was a girl, we'd stop trying. Anyway, we ended up having one boy (8 years old) and one girl (5 years old). This background is important because you need to know that having a 3rd kid was something that was on the table.

Last month, our son told us that he likes boys. This is totally fine, I'm not a homophobe, but I'm starting to feel like I want to have a 3rd kid so we can try to have a straight boy. I love my son more than anything and I wouldn't love a straight kid more than him, but at the end of the day I wanted to be able to bond with one of my kids over traditional masculine stuff, which includes women. 

My wife doesn't think that this is a good reason to have a 3rd kid. She said that she would be open to having a 3rd kid but that she finds my reasoning disgusting and she doesn't think she can go through with it knowing the reason for me wanting one. I don't think she understands how special it is for a father to have a son who can follow in his footsteps. Am I the asshole or is she overreacting?",487,12259,0.74

1269,Asshole,"I (21m) was hanging out with my cousin (7f). She asked how many siblings I had and I said 1 sister and 1 adopted brother, where my brothers is my dog. It’s been a long running joke in my family that my dog is an adopted kid bc of how we treat him. We can’t be the only family...

Anyway, she started making fun of my dog which kind of upset me since I don’t see what’s wrong with being adopted. My mindset is that love is love and you don’t need to have the same blood to be family. So I asked her what if she’s adopted? She said she’s not because she had baby pictures to which I responded that how can you be sure that that’s you as a baby? I didn’t mean anything negative about it, I just wanted to make her question things and figure out what to believe instead of believing everything she hears. 

Once I said that she made a face of terror and ran away to her parents. I haven’t seen her since but my mom said I was TA for saying that. I was expecting to have a conversation with my cousin. If she gave me the time I would’ve reassured her that she’s not adopted but also make her see that there isn’t anything wrong with being adopted. 

As it stand I feel bad for what I said but I think it could’ve been a good opportunity for her to see different perspectives. So let me know what you think. Is she too young for this kind of conversation? Is that just a topic that I shouldn’t ever mention?

Edit: Forgot to mention that when I asked my sis and her boyfriend about the situation. They said I wasn’t TA  since she’s a bit spoiled (which she is) and can stand to not get everything her way

Edit 2: Its not about her making fun of my dog that ticked me the wrong way. It was the fact that she was using being adopted as a bad way. I pictured her acting that way to another kid and thought it wasn’t right but from what I’m reading I definitely handled it the wrong way. As I feared she’s too young. I’ll apologize to her when I see her again and explain that I was kidding and there’s nothing to worry about.

Final Edit: As I do feel horrible about this whole situation I wanted to update for those who are invested. I talked to her parents and she’s not traumatized or hurt about it. She just got frustrated with me bc I didn’t accept that her parents were biological and got bored so she dipped.

1270,Not the A-hole,"Hi reddit, 
I’ve been working at the same store ( small team, 3-5 workers) for over 3 years and one of my new co-worker has been hard to work with. I never had a problem with a co-worker but I feel I won’t last the summer with him. He makes generalising statements about everyone and everything and he’s always right, trying to have a discussion is like speaking to a wall... An exemple of this would be when I was speaking to another co-worker about my ex-girlfriend and the fact that I date girls who tend to be chubbier. He exclamed I must be doing this because “fat girls are easier”. Told him very seriously to stop talking shit about stuff he knows nothing about( called my ex easy?!? Wtf?!?) and he kept going “ You could get hotter chicks you just need to be confident”. Like I said, talking to a wall. 

One of his many statements is that bisexuality doesn’t exist and its simply teenagers rebelling againt whatever. I am a bisexual man but few people know about it, never wanted to deal with everyone's reaction. So after a few of these annoying conversation I went to my boss and told her I can’t keep working with him and she asked for a list of things he has said to make an official report. Most of the things he has said would probably resort in a warning but I feel the homophobia alone would make it much easier to fire him. 

My conflict is that another of the employee is also somewhat homophobic and makes regular comments but i’ve never had a problem with it because it always seemed somewhat innocent. Like a childish disgust over 2 men together. Apart from that he is incredibly respectful and sort of a mentor to me since i’ve been working with him. 

So my dillema is that I’ve reported one type of homophobia but not the other. It makes sense to me since one is a juvenile disgust which seems to come from his background (underground rap) more than an ideologie, like he’s never been confronted with a person close to him being gay. The other one seems like an outright rejection of someone's sexuality, like those people thinking you can “pray the gay away”...

 I’ve been thinking about this and feel its hypocritical to report one and not the other. So, am I the asshole?  

PS :This is my first reddit post so sorry if the formating is weird :/

Edit: re-reading my post I just want to make something clear. I didnt make a complaint to talk about the homophobia, it just came out during the meeting. Later I realised it sounded hypocritical to let it slide for 3 year but complain about it when the new guy does it. Didnt want him to be fired, just to not be put on shift with him.",23,26,0.85

Emotionally/physically abusive sometimes although physically stopped when I was eighteen and threatened to call cops if she ever did touch me again. From there the emotional section just got way worse. Basically her verbal punching bag for when she’s angry. It’s odd but I see through her, I know what her childhood was like and therefore mostly know why she’s such a narcissist like this, it sucks the life out of me- but i know the place it comes from.

Not to mention the fact that it’s a minute walk from my house. It’s almost too good to be true. I fill out the online application I found and get a call for an interview. I told my mom excitedly and she seems happy but then goes “I almost applied there years ago”. Okay, didn’t think much about it. Interview goes swimmingly and I get the job at this point literally crying happy tears cause I really thought my anxiety would get in my way on this one. 

Like two days before I start the job i’m talking with my dad about all the forms, and my mom comes and looks at this training paper, takes a picture, and is like “perfect! Now I can get a job there too like I wanted years ago” My first reaction- “Why on earth would you do that...” 
I know that seems very rude- but read the first paragraph again. We can’t even function as mother daughter- she would be a lead teacher and I would be working FOR her.

1274,Not the A-hole,"Hi Reddit,

This week has been a doozy. On Sunday after noticing I was late I took a pregnancy test and saw that it was positive. I went to the doctor on Wednesday to get bloodwork done which confirmed I was pregnant. On Thursday night I started to have some cramping and spotting and panicked that it might be a miscarriage since they’re quite common early on. After work on Friday I went directly to the emergency room and was there for over 10 hours while they performed a million tests on me and told me that I was indeed miscarrying and not just that, I have a rare blood issue that can cause me to potentially mount an immune response attacking future pregnancies. It was an incredibly rough night. My sisters bridal shower is at my parents house today and I had told my mother I would come home on Friday to help set up, obviously I did not anticipate being at the hospital for over 10 hours and didn’t make it home and got a few angry texts from my mother asking where I was. I felt ashamed and upset and wasn’t ready to let people other than my boyfriend know what was going on. I decided to head home early this morning to try to help with the last of the setup. Knowing that I’m still in the process of miscarrying and it may cause issues today (needing to lay down because of the pain/nausea) I decided I should sit my mom down and explain why I had been MIA and why I may not be as present today (since I am my sisters maid of honor and should be there all day). I explained to her what had happened and she looked upset/disgusted with me. She didn’t ask if I was ok. Didn’t offer up a hug or support. And basically told me to go upstairs so I was out of the way until I was ready to run errand and help. She lied and told everyone I had food poisoning and people started coming up to me with concerned looks asking if I was ok. I figured she told and in private I went off on her telling her to just stop talking about me and just stay out of it. 

I can’t decide if AITA for choosing to tell her now when she’s about to host a bunch of people?

Edit: she came to check on me while I was upstairs handling a work emergency. I blew her off because I’m hurt and honestly didn’t want to deal with it and really did need to handle the work emergency. In my eyes waiting 5 hours to finally check on me at a point where the house is full of people I don’t want to broadcast this to was unacceptable.

Of note my mother also is contributing money because she’s southern catholic and hates that we’re living together “in sin” and wanted to push the process along.

So at our high school, we have three different dances every year. For one of the dances, instead of the boy asking the girl, the girl would ask the boy. It makes for a nice mix up. Everyone is the same age in this if that's important.

&#x200B;

So to provide some background to the situation, I've been seeing this girl I really like, I'll call her Abby, for a few months. We haven't been super public about our relationship so not everyone in the school is aware, mostly just her and my friend group and a few outsiders. I knew she was going to ask me to this dance soon. (because she told me she was working on a sign/poster for me). I couldn't wait. She's amazing.

&#x200B;

Now the situation begins. Enter another girl, I'll call her Emma. I guess I'm friends with Emma, she's more Abby's friend than mine really but even she isn't that close with her. I've talked to her a few times. On the first day people start asking someone to the dance, Emma comes up to me with a very large crowd of people and a very elaborate sign and asks me to the dance. Normally, I would have told her no and apologized but she had really brought this whole crowd of like 30 people that stood around us in a circle. I was put in a spot. I didn't want to embarrass her so I told her 'Yes' to the roaring applause of all her friends. After the situation had died down like ten minutes later, I quickly pulled her aside in private and told her I couldn't accept her invite because of Abby's invite coming and that we were a thing. I told her I didn't want to publicly embarrass her in front of her friends by saying no. She gets all pissy and calls me an asshole.

1280,Not the A-hole,"My girlfriend of 3 years is deeply into makeup both as a hobby and as a side hustle. She is in love with the cosmetic industry and not only does she ‘keep up with the tea’, she also has had a moderate amount of success being sent makeup to review on her YouTube channel and the ability to monetize her videos. 

I deeply love and care for her, and I have also gone from being a man with 0 interest in makeup to a slowly passing interest solely to support her hobbies. I only do it so I can show her I love her and pay attention to her because it’s 90% of what she talks about. 

Lately my girlfriend has been seeing more men in media wearing makeup, like a full face of drag, and she wants to put makeup on me to just ‘try it out’. I have declined her requests maybe 6 or 7 times now and each time she gets more and more flustered. I’ve explained that whilst I support it and also have no problem with men wearing makeup, I personally don’t want to wear any. She first accepted it but lately she’s been ‘calling out my homophobia and transphobia’ and nothing I say is satisfactory to deter her from thinking that I have some sort of issue when the reality is I just want to not wear makeup. 

When I sat her down to try and seriously explain that whilst I loved her, I didn’t want to partake in this, she asked me if we ever have kids would I let them put makeup on me. I said yes I would, and she said there was no difference and that I’m in the wrong.

The ONLY reason why I don’t want to wear it is literally because I just don’t want to. I feel like that should be enough but it seems like it’s not. AITA?",314,968,0.96

1282,Asshole,"A while back me and the husband were invited to a party for a friend of mine. We had the next door neighbor’s 13 year old daughter lined up to watch the kids (we have 5 boys). It would have been her first time with all of them. Originally, her parents (and our good friends) had plans but would be home shortly after we left to help her out if needed. 

This past Wednesday her dad got into some big trouble and ended up in jail. We have been supporting his wife and daughter with dinner for the past few nights, and my husband and I both did not go to work on Thursday following the incident to watch their dog and be there for support. 

I wrongly assumed it was understood that she would be not obligated to babysit this Saturday (today) because of the stress going on. She offered to still watch the kids, but I told her not to worry about it and I would get ahold of her later in the week for a date night (we share custody of our older boys and so later in the week it would just be our two younger boys—more manageable). 

Last night we had some friends over and I said something about going to the party for a couple hours while he stayed home with the kids. He had no idea I had cancelled the sitter and was upset that I wanted to still go by myself. I realize that I should have talked to him first, but I didn’t realize it would be that big of a deal to him since it was my friend’s party, and he doesn’t particularly like her. 

For context and to try and be neutral, him and I don’t get out much alone, so I know he’s disappointed, but I feel like there should be some understanding given the situation.

1283,Asshole,"I am getting married in 7 months. Invites aren’t out yet but the guest list is almost done. 

My side of the family is not what most would call “classy”. Instead they are like Canadian rednecks. They’re from a small town with minimal exposure to POC. 

On the other hand, my fiancee’s family is quite cosmopolitan and wealthy. She is also half-Chinese. When I first introduced her to my family, they were nice but didn’t seem to know how to act around her. For many of them, it was their first time seeing an Asian person in real life. Of course, dumb questions were asked and some comments made, but overall they liked her a lot and were welcoming.

I am very close to my uncle, who is my mother’s brother. Ever since my mother passed when I was 12, he has always been there for me. He can be a bit rough around the edges but overall he means well and has a good heart.

Yesterday, he and my aunt came down to the city to visit us. My fiancee and I went to dinner at a Chinese restaurant. My fiancee, who is fluent in Mandarin, ordered things for us. After the waitress left, my uncle joked, “Did you tell her not to put any dogs in our food?”

My fiancee was quite annoyed and replied, “Why should I ask that?” 
My uncle mumbled something about how it was a joke that “Chinese people eat dogs” and my fiancee replied, “I suppose some do. But how is it any different from eating cows or pigs?.” 

The conversation was quite awkward after that. My uncle apologized for his joke at the end of the meal, said that he loves Chinese food and was just trying to lighten up the mood. 

After in the car, when it was my fiancee and me, she said, “Well I’m seriously reconsidering letting him come to our wedding.” I was aghast and said he just made a stupid joke, like it’s pretty tame compared to the things his peers have said. She said that many of her guests will be POC, and if he can’t behave himself around them then perhaps he shouldn’t come. 

I said he’s basically like a second father to me, no way I would disinvite him over a dumb joke. He even apologized at the end.

1284,Not the A-hole,"So last night I was walking to the train going home from work. I live in a fairly large city so the homeless population is quite sizable here. While they are isolated usually I have to walk past a few corners where they will sit out and beg. Yesterday I was a pretty good day so as I stopped to wait for a light to change I saw a youngish looking woman sitting on the corner begging and thought I would be nice and give her some money. So I walked up to her and pulled a 5 out of my wallet and handed it to her. When I gave her the money she looked me dead in the eye and pointed to my wallet and said ""Give me the 20"". I had a 20 dollar bill in there and she had seen it and just stood there with her hand still out. 

&#x200B;

I was honestly shocked and just turned around and walked back to the light when she yelled ""fuck you cheap piece of shit"" and threw the 5 i gave her on the ground. I turned around, grabbed it, and walked away while calling her a bitch. When I took the money she started following me saying I stole from her and began making a scene. Others started looking at me and she didn't stop following me so I flagged down a police officer. When I did that she stopped following me and went back the her corner but I told the cop the full story. He seemed pretty annoyed at her and told me that he would ""take care of her."" At this point i ran into a shop to grab a drink and when I came out the cop and her were gone. When I asked a passer by what happened she said she saw him take her with him to his car.

1287,Not the A-hole,"I've moved from home the other side of the country two years ago. This year, at the end of March, I moved home and had nowhere to stay. My sister and her fiance (let's call them S and F; also not engaged yet) have a spare room and let me stay with them in F's house. I was paying rent to them weekly. While there, I was living my own life - managing my own groceries, laundry, etc. If we decided to eat out, we would take turns paying.


A few days later, SF got engaged. S asked me to be her maid of honour for March 2020 after telling her that I didn't want to be part of another bridal party. I decided to do it for her even though we aren't close but she's family.


I gained my permanent residency around mid-May (a very big deal to me - been working towards this for the past 10 years) and decided to celebrate. I invited SF, my work mates and their respective partners to come for dinner. Everyone came along but SF. S said she didn't want to go because it will be so awkward for SF not knowing anyone.


Two days later, SF have their engagement party. My parents are based overseas and I'm the only immediate family member she has there. F has his parents and three sisters. All of them invite their friends along while I was not able to. I attended for S knowing that I will barely know any of the 100+ people there. Needless to say, I left after starting to feel uncomfortable when the familiar faces I knew retired early for the night. Hours later, I picked SF up from the pub (the afterparty) and dropped F's mates home as well.


Last night, I drove S to pick up F from the pub. F may have been drunk. On the way back, I took a turn too sharply and the rear wheel mounted the corner of a curb briefly. F proceeds to continuously carry on about how I'm a dangerous driver. I pull over and said if I was such a dangerous driver then he can get out of the car. F brings up the fact I'm currently staying at his house and where else would I be if not there. I said I have people who I can stay with which he then proceeds to threaten saying it will be my last night there. He gets out of the car and walks the 500m back. I call out to him to get back in the car but he kept on walking, so I drove off. On his walk back, he texts saying I am to be out of the house next week. This wasn't this first time F has threatened me with this. I was sick of constant insecurity of not having a place to stay and the lack of support from S that I packed a bag and left last night. I get a text from F to come back as I was packing the car to leave, but nothing from S. Made the hour drive at 11pm to a colleagues place to stay until I can find a place of my own. They stayed up waiting for me and was welcomed with a very warm hug. 


As for today, only received a text from S asking where I was and nothing from F.",21,157,0.95
1288,Not the A-hole,"For some time now, there has been gossip in our office about two of my coworkers (I’ll call them Allen and Alice) who, for some of our other coworkers (I’ll call them Susans) are too close for comfort. Both Allen and Alice are married. I stayed out of it because I personally thought that they’re just more comfortable with each other since they come from the same home town, plus the things they do that my coworkers find suspect honestly seem harmless to me.

We all used to be part of the same team, but last year our team was split into two, with Allen leading Team A and Alice leading team B which I and the Susans are part of. Allen and his team transferred to another floor, but he continued to be close to Alice. When one of his clients gifted him a weekend stay for his team at a resort the client owns, he invited Alice to go with them. Alice said that our team mates might feel hurt that she was invited and they were not, so Allen extended the invitation to our team as well. The Susans happily accepted and we all spent a fun weekend at the client’s resort.

When we got back to the office last Monday, the Susans were talking about Allen and Alice again, and the gossip was a lot worse. Apparently, some people saw some things happen during our stay at the resort. This made me angry because we had just been to a vacation thanks to Alice and Allen, and here are these people gossiping about them. I spoke up and told the Susans that if Allen and Alice were having an affair, then why would they do anything during a vacation with coworkers when they could just meet up somewhere without anyone knowing.

I don’t know what I was thinking, but before I went home I decided to talk to Alice and finally told her about the gossip about her and Allen. She looked surprised and saddened, but she thanked me and said she appreciates that I told her.

On Tuesday I learned that she filed for a two week leave and will not be back until July. The Susans don’t know what I told Alice and are talking about possible reasons for her leave. I sent Alice a message saying that I hope she’s doing fine, she replied with thank you but asked that I not contact her until she is back.

I told my husband what happened. He said that I should’ve stopped at telling the Susans off and that I shouldn’t have gone to Alice. He said that my anger at the Susans made me insensitive to how telling Alice about the gossip could affect her, and her relationship with everyone in our office. He said that telling her just made the situation worse, regardless if the gossip is true or not. Now that Alice knows that her coworkers are talking about/have talked about her and Allen, there is no chance that the issue will just quietly go away on its own. She will always be conscious about her friendship with Allen and her relationship with us, her coworkers.

1289,Not the A-hole,"I was going to the movies with a mate but he could not turn up for medical reasons so I had 2 seats. I then see a group of people and one of them is in one of my seats. I think “we’ll ok, whatever” and just sit down. These people were chatting it off in the ads which I didn’t mind but when the movie started I politely asked them to stop. They stopped for 5 minutes and started again. I asked again and they talked again. Annoyed, I plotted my revenge. I waited until about midway through run time, got my second ticket, out on my phone torch and told the guy to leave my seat or I’m gonna tell staff. Annoyed he gets up and actually sits almost all the way up the front where it’s really hard to see the screen because your so close, he must have booked late or seperate idk. I pull up the arm rest and sit in between 2 seats and tell the rest of the group “maybe you should listen next time”. I was satisfied with my revenge. I tell other friends as I was impressed with myself, not gonna lie and they called me assholes saying I shouldn’t have done it mid movie. I’m still laughing at the dirty looks they gave me at the end.

Edit: I feel like some people think I literally stood up and banished this dude. We were sitting in the back row and I was on an aisle seat so he only had to squeeze pass me anyway.

1290,Everyone Sucks,"I work in a fast food restaurant and am experienced enough that I'm responsible for training some of our new recruits. As anyone who has worked in fast food will be aware, we have people of all shapes and sized and from all walks of life working here, but one of our new recruits is being a bit of a pain. Her name is Megan. 

I could see she wasn't our usual type as soon as she walked in. She was very pretty and very well spoken, and seemed fairly nice on her first day. However, within her first week she proved to be very lazy. She was constantly at the back chatting to some of the other girls or flirting with the guys in the kitchen. She was OK with the cashier work but if I asked her to do something like sweep/mop the floor she'd ''Ugh'' and give me a dirty look, but she had no choice but to get it done. 

I did some digging on her. Googled her name and the first thing that came up was her linked in profile. She's been to one of the best unis and had a job doing financial stuff for some big company. I wondered why someone that smart with a career like that would end up working here. 

I chatted to one of the other girls to see what she knew about Megan. Apparently she was fired because she turned up to work blatantly under the influence of drugs. She was tested, and as a result was not only fired but also blacklisted from the profession with her specialist certifications voided. According to Amy (the girl I spoke to) her parents made her get this job by threatening to kick her out.

Yesterday Megan kicked off at me in the crew room for making her mop the floor again. I didn't understand what the problem was but she kept saying that I only made her do it because I was too lazy to do it myself. That isn't true at all and I kept trying to tell her that I had to both do my own work and ensure that she gets the right training. She then tried to get at me by saying that in a few months she'd be gone and I'd still be here. We argued for a bit until she said that she wouldn't apologise for being prettier and smarter and more successful than me so I should ''get off my high horse''. I responded that if she was so smart then she shouldn't have gone and ruined her own career. 

Once I said this she got upset and went off to get changed. Her shift was over but when she stepped out she was clearly crying. When she was gone some of the others in the room started to get at me saying I shouldn't have brought up her previous job and that she's new so shouldn't be thrown in at the deep end. 

I don't regret standing up for myself against her but I think bringing up her last job was a low blow?",18,44,0.98

1292,No A-holes here,"I had a past relationship where my ex went through my old phone and found messages from 4 years before we even met. He woke me up with a knife to my throat and accused me of cheating for messages that were to my boyfriend at the time... which was 4 years ago before we had met... it was an old phone and I didn’t even know they were still on there. It was an extremely toxic relationship to say the least. 

Anyways, current boyfriend and I have been in a pretty healthy relationship for 3 years now. We have our ups and downs just like everyone else but we can work through things I feel like. We don’t live together and we both work a lot though, so the time we spend together is very limited. 

A few months ago he told me that he’s had suspicions of me cheating because I’m always on my phone. I am really bad about being on my phone all the time, and I know I need to stop using it as a crutch for anxiety. 

So with me always being on my phone, I’m typically browsing social media or reddit and I see things that i like so I show him. But every time I show him something, I hold my phone out in a way that he can just look at what I’m showing him without grabbing it.  But every time I do he grabs my phone and looks at whatever I’m showing him for at least a minute, even if it’s just a meme with like 10 words, he supposedly “can’t read it with me holding it.”

It just makes me really uncomfortable and I’ve told him about my ex and the phone situation. It just makes me really anxious when anyone has my phone. I’ve told him this and he still does it. 

I don’t ever touch his phone. I don’t know his password, I don’t read his messages, etc. because I trust him enough to not go through his personal conversations. But he has tried to read mine before and tried to get in my phone. It really bothers me. I’m not cheating and have nothing to hide but I’m afraid he’s going to actively try and find something to get mad about, whether it’s messages to close friends, something out of context... you get the idea.",163,409,0.94

1295,Not the A-hole,"Alt, obviously. 

I had a dog. A pitbull more specifically. Her name was Tora. She passed away peacfully last year. I've had a small tattoo of her face on my wrist for at least four years. Tora was the love of my life. I poured everything into that dog, her being the first pet I've ever owned. She was great, amazing temperament, just an all around good dog. 

About two years ago, my sister and her 6 year old were over at my house. Six year old was playing with my dog in the front yard, sister and I were sitting on the porch talking and watching. I had forgotten to put on Tora's shock collar, the one that kept her in the yard. Now she was usually great at staying in the yard but I got it so when she saw a rabbit or other small animals, she didn't run across the street to get them. Well, seeing as I had forgotten it, she just so happened to see a squirrel and bolt across the road. Unfortunately, the six year old ran after her. It all happened in slow motion and honestly, it was horrible. A car pulled out and slammed into the six year old, nearly missing my dog. I don't want to go into depth but he was pretty badly injured, not enough to still be effected in the future, but enough to rack up a costly hospital bill. I helped my sister pay it and apologised proufously. Ever since that incident she has despised Tora and wanted her put down. I told her she was ridiculous and I refused. She basically cut ties with me. 

Well recently, she's been slowly coming back into my life. Which is great, I adore my nephew. But she constantly makes remarks about my tattoo and how I should get it covered because it brings up horrible memories for her and she hated that I was remembering a dog that put her son in harm's way.

1296,Not the A-hole,"I hate flying to the point that I will gladly drove 10-15 hours to avoid a 4 hour flight. It's not that I'm scared of flying, I just hate everything from the security theater to the cramped seats that leave me sore for days.

So I only fly if I can buy a second seat (or third if I'm flying with my wife). It lets me stretch my legs out if needed, not feel trapped mentally, and not sit next to annoying people etc. Also a second seat is almost always cheaper than business/first class AND for some reason they refund you if the flight isn't full. I'm a big guy but I 100% don't need two seats, gate agents are constantly baffled and one even said ""you're not nearly big enough to need 2 seats"".

On multiple flights I've had to argue with flight attendants and randoms that no I bought the second seat, and if they oversold the flight/some 400 lb guy didn't buy the second seat he needs and is killing his seatmate it's not my problem. 

AITA for never backing down in this scenario that has happened 6-7 times at this point? If I was willing to fly with one seat I wouldn't have bought a second seat.

1298,Not the A-hole,"My grandmother passed away Thursday night and she left a few things behind. One of those things was a ring that was passed down from her grandmother to her mother then her because she is the oldest granddaughter. My grandmother had the same rule. The oldest daughter gets it then passes it down to her oldest daughter.

Everything was fine and I was looking forward to this because it really is a beautiful ring and I’d occasionally pick it up out of her jewelry box to look at it when I was over at her house. The ring means a lot to me and it’s the only thing I wanted of hers. Back when I was 14, my aunt adopted a 17 year old girl. At the time everything was discussed prior to the adoption (when I was 11), my aunt and her husband only had 2 sons. She told my mom that even though she was the oldest, she wanted my mom to get it then pass it down to me, as she didn’t have any daughters. **My grandmother agreed it was the sensible thing to do and told me I could have the ring.** My mom doesn’t wear jewelry though, so she didn’t care much either way. My mom told me she’d just give it to me when she got it. For reference, I am 21 now and this adopted “cousin” is 24. I am the oldest biological granddaughter.

While everyone was cleaning out different rooms yesterday after my grandmother’s passing (She had Alzheimer’s and was moved to a facility but her home was still cluttered, that’s why we were cleaning out her house so soon after her passing. She also wanted to be cremated and has no living relatives other than her children and grandchildren so we weren’t concerned about planning a funeral), I heard my aunt and her adopted daughter in the pantry talking about how she was going to sneak the ring out of the jewelry box before I could get it since *she* is the oldest granddaughter. I was upset because my aunt promised me I could eventually have it but she changed her mind.

We all went out last night to eat after finishing up some work (we plan on doing a lot of cleaning today too) and I left early and told them that my manager texted me and asked me to come work for a few hours because a co-worker had called off sick and they were swamped. I went straight back to my grandmother’s house and took the ring out and left before anyone could come back. I took it to my apartment and hid it just to be safe. I have no idea what will happen today when my aunt realizes it’s missing.


Edit: My grandmother never said otherwise after the adoption.

**EDIT:** 

**Alright folks, here is what the will says now that I have seen it:**

I bequeath the following items of tangible personal property to the beneficiaries listed below:

Diamond ring inherited from my grandmother: My eldest daughter who is to then place it with her eldest **biological** daughter. *If she should not bear daughters, it shall be given to my youngest daughter instead who is to then place it with her eldest **biological** daughter.*

**There you go. It belongs to ME. Apparently blood ties were important to my grandmother as well since step and adopted grandkids aren’t included. The will was made several years ago after my grandfather passed away and she wanted to have it made just in case something happened to her, before my aunt and my mom had children. It is likely my grandmother simply didn’t remember the will since she had Alzheimer’s.**

Edit: Maybe this edit will make you all chill out. I didn’t know there was a will. I based it off words that had been said to me. That’s why I took it. My grandmother and I were **EXTREMELY** close. I felt it was mine since it had been promised to me and was offended that there was an attempt to actually take it away from me. My mother called me and told me that we were meeting up at my grandmother’s house once again to look over the will she made several years ago. I showed up and my aunt and her daughter (I took *adopted* out since that seems to trigger a lot of you) did as well. They looked very tired and annoyed. When we were reading the will and it came out that my mother is the owner of the ring, my aunt and her daughter began screaming at us and admitted that they were there from 11 PM until 2 AM looking for the ring thinking it had gotten lost somewhere but couldn’t find it. Since my aunt has no biological daughters, it immediately transferred ownership to my mother and she said it now belongs to me because she does not want it since she doesn’t wear jewelry. I told my mom that I already took it and she was upset until I said I overheard my aunt talking to her daughter about how they were going to snatch it up before anyone else got to it. My aunt got pissed with me and told me to never talk to her again. She and her daughter left in tears and told us to finish cleaning up on our own. The ring was the only thing left to me and it was truly the only thing I wanted, so I’m happy I got it. So here I am now, cleaning up the house again with my mom.

**LAST EDIT:** I didn’t fucking come here to be judged about my opinion on blood ties. I came here to be judged about my ACTIONS - whether or not taking the fucking ring was an asshole move on my end. 

It seems most of you don’t realize how simple it truly is the execute a will. The lawyer who helped her was there with us with it in hand - she wanted to ensure it wouldn’t be lost so she kept it stored away. It doesn’t take a year and a half after the death of someone to look at the fucking will to see what the deceased is giving to someone else. My god. 

The ring that is now mine has currently been in the family for 5 generations. And yes, that does matter. Why the hell should someone who was adopted into the family at 17 (my aunt and uncle have had her since she was 16 and my grandmother already had Alzheimer’s) who has no blood ties to the family get the ring instead of the biological descendants??? Explain to me how the hell my “cousin” and I are equal in this instance. She and my grandmother were *not* close. **I** was the one who visited her every day before she entered the facility to help her with chores around the house, not her. And no, I don’t treat her differently but I do view her differently. 

And no, my aunt can’t have any biological children now. She had a hysterectomy several years ago.",346,903,0.92
1299,Not the A-hole,"FYI, English isn't my first language, and I'm not from the US.

Two months ago, my father passed away in an industrial accident (he was a factory worker). My mother, sister, and I managed to survive for a while on some charity money given by our extended family, but that money is running out. We have virtually no savings, and my father was the sole source of income. I'm 18, and my mom arranged with my dad's boss at the factory to give me a job. I put off accepting or rejecting it because I was waiting for the results from the Army.

A few months ago, I tried out for the Army officer cadets. Every year, the army cadet program (where they train new recruits into officers) had open tryouts for people 17-20. They show up to the nearest army base and are out through a rigorous testing process that includes physical testing, an IQ test, and an interview. The latter part is almost purely luck- the interviewer could ask anything, and based on their personality, they could hate or love your answers. If you're accepted, you get trained and then are an officer in the Army. I decided to try out. I have no strong feelings towards the army, but my reasoning was this: I have ambitions of getting out of poverty and becoming rich. However, to do so, you need either money, an education, or both. Even before my dad died, my family didn't have much money, not even enough to send me to college for an education. So the army's my only option: it's highly respected, and after 4 years I can get out. Former army officers have high rates of matriculation at top schools,and there's a education pension for former officers. That sounds like an overall win-win to me. So I tried out.

I decided that if I got accepted, I'd accept the cadetship. But if I didn't get in, I'd take the job. Just two days ago, I received mail that I had been accepted as a cadet. My mom urged me not to accept, because if I didn't work, the family supposedly would have no money. She asked me to just work for a year and then try out again. But I don't want to do this, because of these reasons:

- There's no guarantee I'll be accepted if I try out again. As I mentioned, the interview is pure luck. And in factories, accidents are common. So what if I get injured and can't pass the physical?

- I'm not the only person in the house capable of doing work. My mom's 39, hardly elderly, and perfectly healthy. My sister is 20 and not in school anymore. And there are work opportunities for them- not great ones, but there are opportunities

1300,Asshole,"My 6 year old nephew is adamant that he wants to wear a flower girl dress and be a flower girl for my wedding, which is happening today in about 11 hours. He also has shoulder length hair which he’s planning on wearing flowers in. 

He’s being raised my my younger sister, who is a single mom. She came out as a lesbian about 4 years ago and I feel like she is overly encouraging about a lot of the clothes he wears and activities he does. He regularly wears rainbow tights, sparkly shoes, and a two piece bathing suit when he goes swimming. He also wants to be a make up artist when he grows up. 

I’ve never once said anything negative about what he wears or doesn’t wear, but I asked her to dress him and my other nephew (my other sister’s son) in similar outfits (dress pants and dress shirt/tie) for their special ring bearer roles (which they asked for). My sister lost her shit and was extremely upset that I would ask him to wear something he’s so uncomfortable in. My fiancé wants to empower him and she bought a flower girl dress for him to wear. 

AITA here? I understand what he likes to wear/not wear, but he’s 6 and we’re paying a lot of money for this wedding. If I was going somewhere fancy when I was younger, I wouldn’t get to choose what I was wearing. I realize it’s 2019 and I don’t know if my thought process is just archaic or if I’m really just being an asshole, but I feel like it’s my special day as well and I’m not asking for too much.

1301,Not the A-hole,"I have been with my wife Maria for five years. There is a big age gap between us. I am 31 and she is 48. She is very beautiful but has never been married or had children before me, since she never found anyone who she really felt a connection with. 

Due to her age we knew that the chances of children were slim, which is why we haven't bothered with birth control. Imagine our shock when we found out that Maria was pregnant at her age. 

We announced it to everyone, and while all our family and friends were happy for us, lots of them began pointing out the many risks involved with being pregnant in your late forties. We are of course aware of these risks and are taking every possible precaution.

Whenever I speak to someone over the phone they will mention ask if we are staying safe or whatever and will never fail to remind us that pregnancy is dangerous at 48. 

Yesterday evening I had a go at everyone at my sister's garden party, and told them that while we appreciated their concern, we are well aware of the risks involved and don't need to be continually reminded. 

The reason I'm posting this is that some of their concerns may not be age related, and may have been the same if Maria was a younger woman. I feel like if that were the case, then I've now made them feel guilty unnecessarily.",68,354,0.95
1302,Asshole,"Note: We're Punjabi and live in California. My kids were born & raised in the SF Bay Area.

My daughter is 21 and despite growing up fairly privileged, having all the resources in the world, great grades, good major, etc. has decided to marry a loser.

She introduced him to us a few months in, and my husband & I expressed our disapproval but didn't worry because we figured it would end soon enough. My other daughter and nieces all went through a similar phase and ended up settling with educated young men with good futures. No cause for concern.

This boy is not educated, does not have family values, always partying, gets blackout drunk with his buddies, zero ambition. I have friends who know his parents and have heard negative things about his family as well.

My daughter went to India last month and married him. They are not legally wed in the US, but in our community it's only the religious ceremony that matters so they're considered husband & wife in our social circle.

She's 21 and has 3 more years left of school. She's moved out to her in-laws (it's customary in Punjabi culture for the girl to live with her husband's family). She says she's going to wait 3-4 years before having a big wedding party in America and signing an official marriage certificate for two reasons: (1) to finish school & save up money (2) so she can stay on our medical insurance while she's in school

She said she can pay for her phone, car note, everyday expenses, etc. with her husband's pay while she finishes up school. The only thing she asked if we can keep her name on our insurance policy.

My husband & I are conflicted. On one hand, no money is taken out of my husband's paycheck (he's a physician) for our insurance and it's really top of the line insurance, great coverage.

On the other hand, we are heartbroken at what our daughter has done. We broke our backs to give our kids everything we could. All we asked was for basic respect and that's not what we got. What is the rush to get married at 21? We're not so backwards that we expect our daughter to sit at home 24/7. It's fine to have fun with friends, take trips (we've financed several trips to Mexico/Europe for our kids), party, have boyfriends, etc. it's all fine so long as the kids behave nicely and keep their grades up. We're more lenient than 90% of Punjabi parents. But she's embarrassed us so badly in the community, I've had so many people come up to me and say rude things. I know I shouldn't care, but I do. I can't help it. It's so deeply ingrained in our culture and I've rejected 90% of this backwards mentality, but some of it sticks and it hurts.

TL;DR: Daughter married someone we very much don't approve of. She wants to stay on our insurance policy until she's done with school. It won't cost us much money but we're heartbroken at what she's done and feel it's unfair for her to not consider our feelings but ask for our money/resources. WIBTA if we cut her off?",517,805,0.9
1303,Asshole,"My Background : I am a police officer and used to work in a very active jail dealing with junkies. I am also very much in love with my girlfriend and have talked about marriage. 

Background of the issue : My girlfriend and her friend (two females) went to a concert which I have no issue with. I work crazy hours and don’t get to spend as much time with my friends/family,  so I’m perfectly ok with her hanging out with her friends. 


The problem: A few days before the concert she told me that her friend would be the designated driver. One of the first post to her Snapchat was them both with large mixed drinks. This is where I start worrying, my girlfriend says that there is hardly an alcohol in the drinks, that they are over priced, and that her and her friend would be leaving soon. This was around 7pm. Around 8:30-9:00pm she is still posting snapchats about the concert so I ask about it and she says that another performance came on. Then she tells me there is cocaine at the concert. Now I’m maximum worry, as the experience from the job tells me where this cocaine there normally follows other drugs. Not to mention having fought with junkies, I know I personally would not like to be in a situation where people are snorting coke around me as it can be very dangerous. I am also aware that there is only two of them and worried as my girlfriend told me she had been roofied a few years ago. I ask her to leave the concert for her safety. She then tells me if I want to her hide in the bathroom so she can miss the show, I tell her that I don’t want her to separate from her friend and that I’m very much worried for both of them.  She then calls me and says that I need to chill out, and I’m over reacting. At this point she had been rude with me and I told she was being disrespectful.  I never called her any names and was trying to tell that I trusted her, but it was the other people using drugs/selling drugs that I was worried about. She ended up staying the full time, then called me. She called me a dick for asking her to leave and ruining her night. I explained to her that I was on duty and need to focus and would like to talk to her about the issue at a better time but she kept trying to push the issue. I just asked her to let me know when she got home safely and has now ignored me. The time is now 3:30am where I am and I have not heard from her since she left.  I am still extremely worried about her as I have no idea she made it home.  She also stated to that she wouldn’t tell me about it next time and that had she not told me about the drugs she would have a great night. I am not sure if her silence is her being vindictive... 


TLDR: girlfriend went to concert, said she would leave at 7, stayed till 9ish, said there was cocaine, I asked to her leave because of the danger, she stayed till the end, then tried to start an argument while I was at work, I asked to table it till a better time, she didn’t want to, I asked to let me know when she got home,  no reply back.

I rented a Car2Go to run some errands and spent the last 10+ minutes of the rental looking for a place to park. I finally found a parallel spot on the street. As I turned off the car and gathered my belongings, a man on the sidewalk approached the car and started talking to me through the window. I’d seen him on the sidewalk when he pulled up, but it looked like he was waiting for an Über. 

He asked me, “Are you parking here?” 

I replied, “Yes.”

He told me, “I’ve been saving this spot for a friend.”

I’ve never seen someone save a parking spot on the street for another person, so I asked, “What?”

He told me he was saving the spot for a friend. I said, “I’m not sure that’s how it works.” He told me it was. I asked him if he wanted me to move and he said he’d hopped out of his friend’s car to save the spot, because there’d been cars behind him. I said I’d been looking for a spot for a while, my rental was running, and I didn’t want to hunt for another parking spot. 

He said he didn’t want to parking spot anymore and that I was an asshole. His friend pulled up towards the end of our exchange, so they rode off together. 

Looking back, I can see why I was an asshole to them. In my defense, he never asked me to move, and he was annoyed with me for parking from the start. If he’d explained the situation right away and been polite, I would’ve given him the spot. It was the end of a long day, and his request seemed ridiculous to me.

The cake slices were given to me with the statement ""Happy Birthday, here's your present."" And the croissant was referred to as something my parents would share while I ate the cake.  Throughout the evening my dad kept defending the cake from my mom, saying that it's ""her cake and she can eat it"" and to ""wait for her to eat it."" 

I chose to eat the slices when my mom was in the bathroom because I didn't want her looming over me while I wanted to eat the cake. My dad was on the computer doing whatever he usually does in the evening. I made sure to leave a little (about two bites) from both slices so that my parents could taste them both, since my mom said she ""just wanted a little bit"" and my dad hadn't said anything to that effect. 

When my dad came back into the kitchen he said ""wow you're really socially inept, aren't you"" and got really upset that I didn't call them over to share the cake. My mom also made a few statements to the effect that I should have called them over, and that because we normally share the treats from the bakery this would have been the same. My dad then refused to eat the parts I did save for him, saying that if I wanted to eat all of the cake so much I might as well finish it.

For three years it's been romance behind locked doors or in other towns, and if we're in public he very consciously acts only friendly to me.

1315,Not the A-hole,"Today I was at the airport waiting for a long-delayed flight out. Everyone was irritable, and we all just wanted to board. For context (not sure if this works differently in other airports) before other boarding groups were called, groups 1 and 2 lined up early in designated, labeled areas.  The front of the two lines were separated by ropes, but behind the ropes the two lines jumble up into one. I was group 2. 

Now, after the announcement that boarding will begin, I am waiting in line behind the point-of-jumbling. But (to my chagrin) the flight doesn’t actually start boarding for probably another 20 minutes. So at this point, I’ve been waiting in my spot in line for almost half an hour, and an elderly man with his elderly wife come up and he taps me on the shoulder. He asks if this is the line for “Group 1” to which I respond that the two lines have jumbled and both groups have blended together. 

Here‘s where I start to get annoyed. Instead of moving to the back of the line, the couple stayed put. And they happen to be standing a few feet in front of where I had been waiting in line. I wait a bit to see if they’re going to move, but they just slowly inch towards the line. 

I do not like budgers. 

I say: “Excuse me, sir - this is the line for both groups 1 and 2”

Man: “Yes, I am group 1”

Me: “And so is half of the line behind you”

Man: “Well are you?”

Me: “No, I’m group 2, but people behind me are group 1, and you’ve cut in front of them”

I thought that was very snooty of her.

That did not go over well. Others in the line start to catch on that the argument is escalating, and we get more-or-less forcibly separated by onlookers in the line. So, lo and behold, the couple stayed in line and boarded before the other Group 1ers, and I was getting dirty looks for the rest of the boarding process. 

I did not board any slower with them in front of me, because Group 2 only boards after all of Group 1, but the rest of the Group 1ers behind me *did indeed* board later than they would have otherwise.

Obligatory throwaway. My wife \[30F\] and I \[29M\] have been together for 10 years, married for two, and we have a 4 year old, a two year old and a two month old.

We were over at my mother's house yesterday for a family event (it was her birthday last week). After I said happy birthday, she told me she got the gift and the card we had sent her the week before. This is probably where I fucked up, because I had no idea that we had sent her a card, let alone multiple, thinking that my wife took initiative because she personally loves getting cards. I read the card and noticed that at the bottom, she'd signed the card ""Wife, child 1, child 2, child 3, my name"". Typically, the husband/boyfriend's comes first, then the wife/girlfriend's name comes before all of their kids' names, I wouldn't even mind being second after my wife instead of first on the card. It rubbed me the wrong way that she'd purposely put my name after my kids. Then, I noticed she'd done that with every single card she had sent on our behalf (my mother has them on display) for the past few years and I can only assume she does it too when she sends cards to other family members too.

I asked her about it when we were at home, and she didn't see anything wrong with it, saying that if I wanted my name first, then I should write the cards to my family. But I don't think it's about that, I feel like when she's putting my name after my kids' names, she's undermining me as a husband, father and part of my family, and I feel plain disrespected. When I told her how I felt, she apologized for making me feel disrespected, but the offer still stands; if I wanted to be first on the card, I need to write the cards. Nothing really got solved other than me feeling ignored, so I've been trying to work out how to talk about it with her.

&#x200B;

AITA for feeling disrespected because my wife puts my name last, and after my kids' names, when she's signing cards for my family?

Edit: To me, I don't feel ""lesser"" than my children, I just feel like the husband and wife should be paired together, as it is proper etiquette (as a few people pointed out in the comments). Still, I don't think it's right for my wife to be passive aggressive about name order because I've forgotten birthdays, anniversaries and special events for family members on a few occasions.",291,309,0.82

1324,Asshole,"Throwaway account. I've been seeing a woman I really like for six weeks. I can really see myself dating her and having a future with this Potential Girlfriend (PG) . When we started sleeping together it got a bit embarrassing as I could never 'perform' when using a condom. It meant I felt like a disappointment to PG and I was scared she would go with somebody else. We discussed not using condoms as she was on birth control. PG said she wanted me to get tested as she had gotten the all clear the week before we started dating and she hasn't been with anyone since. I told her that I was clear because I was 100% sure at the time that I was. 

I got tested one year ago and I had only slept with one woman after that. We didn't use condoms because she said she was all clear and on the pill too. I thought because of that I was clear too. PG is a bit of a  hypochondriac and said she wanted me to get tested so I said I would but I assured her I was clean and promised that I had used condoms the whole time with the only woman I had been with since getting tested. (I only said it because I was confident I was clear)

I got my results back and I have chlamydia.  Therefore so does PG now. The other person was a liar.  I told PG. She started to cry and she really got angry about the fact I wasnt truthful. She said that if I had been honest about the fact I didn't use condoms with the last person at least she could have taken some accountability for it. I think she's going to ghost me.

1325,Everyone Sucks,"Alright, I am sure being spiteful can be considered being an asshole. However let me give you the backstory here as I think it's justified.

My sister (30F) is getting married in October. I (21F) am her maid of honor. I'm also a lesbian. I dress a bit more masculine than a lot of girls, but I like to be pretty and dress in cute clothes sometimes too.

I had my hair very short for a long time, but I recently grew it out a little below my shoulders. I wasn't planning on cutting my hair, but mt sister made sure to tell me not to cut it short before the wedding. Okay, cool? I wasn't planning on it so its weird she would bring it up out of nowhere.

Then we went bridesmaids dress shopping. Again, I was ALREADY planning on wearing a dress. My sister told me I am NOT to wear a tux, that we are all wearing dresses. I never even brought up wanting to wear a tux EVER in my life. I don't like dresses but I do wear them for formal events.

And now today: my uncle was talking with me. He was asking how I'm supposed to get ripped if I don't eat meat. I brought up that I'll be seeing him in 4 months again (for the wedding) and I'll show him that you can be muscular and not eat meat. 

My sister busted in ""No."" 

What do you mean no?

""You're not going to be buff for my wedding.""

Okay no one can get incredibly defined and massive in 4 months.. I just want to have muscle.

""No.""

With all this said and done, I want to cut my hair off. I won't get jacked enough in 4 months to bother her, and I wont wear a tux because we already have the dresses (and again, I don't like tuxs). 

Reddit, WIBTA if I purposefully cut my hair off before my sister's wedding? 

(My stepmom overheard me upset speaking with my girlfriend and tried calming me down: ""bridezilla"" is a true occurrence, my sister is a perfectionist, she may just have a specific picture in mind for her wedding. And I understand what she was saying.... I would like to add that my sister has never been comfortable with me being gay, and has called me homophobic slurs my whole life. That's the full story, thanks).",220,1519,0.95

1328,Asshole,"English isn’t my first language, I’ll try and make this readable.

Last year I was at a party and I was in a circle of people passing joints around. At one point, a guy swings his joint around while talking and touches a black girl’s arm with it. He apologised and then she said something like “don’t worry, looks like it didn’t leave a burnt mark”.
So I jokingly said “well of course it didn’t, you’re black”.
Everyone was shocked and demanded I apologised for my racist comment.

Now, I come from a country where it’s really rare to see black people, and this story happened when I was abroad in a country with more black people around, so taking into account that I’m not used to interact with them and I might accidentally say something hurtful, I apologised even if I felt I wasn’t being racist, cause I didn’t want anyone to be offended.

But now I’m thinking about it again and I still don’t see how my comment was inappropriate, so if it was please explain to me why, I don’t wanna make the same mistake again.

My rationale is that I didn’t say that “she’s black so she must steal” or “she’s black so she must be lazy”, I just implied that she’s black, so it’s hard to see a burnt spot on her skin. It’s logic, there’s no prejudice or racism in it.
Maybe I said something borderline inappropriate, maybe I could have kept it for myself, but I don’t think it was racist.

AITA?

Edit: Seeing what most of the comments say, I think I need to clarify: of course I didn’t mean that black skin doesn’t burn, I know it burns. That’s why it was a joke, I wanted to say something absurd. I’m probably still the A-hole, but not a total idiot.

Edit: Well, I’ve read enough. The response is unanimous, I am indeed the asshole. I accept it, I’ll work on that and try not to make the same mistake again. I just want to say that I never meant to offend anyone, I just joke around a lot, and I apologise if I upset anyone with this post, it wasn’t my intention.

1329,Not the A-hole,"We've all been to the store and seen people we want to catch up with and that's great.  Grocery stores are the centers of our community and all that jazz.  But one of my biggest nails on a chalk board pet peeve is people standing in the doorways having conversations blocking and impeding foot traffic.  Especially a store like Costco on a Saturday.  When we entered last weekend, there were 2 elderly couples having a conversation blocking over half of the entire entrance with a flood of people navigating around them.  Not 5 feet away from the person checking memberships.  They could easily move 15-20 feet and be entirely out of the way.   

So I looked at my friend and stated loudly that ""the best place to stop and talk is always right in the doorways of course"" and glared at the offending party who had a sort of ""well I never"" reaction and slowly started to shuffle off but I was already moving on.  My friend seems to think I'm the asshole but I mean who stands right in a doorway and doesn't move?

Edit: more info, I looked at the membership checker person first for guidance, but they were obviously frazzled by the elderly couples presence but were too afraid to say anything, probably for fear of being rude.

I've been dating this great girl for about a year now.  I'm a few years older than her and work a full-time job that pays pretty well.  She's currently in law school (a really good one) and graduates in 2 years.

&#x200B;

We've been getting into some fights because she says that, since I'm working and she's living off student loans, she thinks I should pick up the tab the majority of the time.  I'm big on saving money and personally don't see why we shouldn't be splitting things close to 50/50.  She chose to go to law school before we got together, so I don't think it's my responsibility to cover more than half of our date expenses because of a choice she made on her own.

1331,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because the last thing I need is more grief from my family.          
So a little backstory— my father is my best friend and we have an incredible bond. My mother and I have an incredibly strained relationship and she is a textbook narcissist. My wife (we’re both women) also has a narcissistic mother who can’t stand me, and a father who was basically absent up until her adulthood. Essentially, our true family is my father, but we still visit all the other parents (they’re both divorced).           
We’ve been going through ivf to conceive and I am now pregnant with a baby boy. I have gotten so much shit for the baby’s name that I’m wondering if I’m being TA or if I’m just going crazy and having pregnancy brain.             
I am giving my baby a middle name (not first) in honor of my father but it’s not even his actual name— think giving a middle name Harrison but the name of my father is Harry (fake for obvious reasons). My mother and my wife’s parents are livid. They think if we give a name tribute to my father, they need them as well with future kids. First of all, I’m not having four kids, and also I have my names decided for all the children we’d be having, none of which are tributes to them. My wife is on the same page but she’s starting to feel guilty.          
My mother and her mother are both threatening to not be around their grandson if he has a middle name in honor of my father. They both tried to make me promise my next child will have something in honor of them, and I said absolutely not. My wife’s father keeps guilt tripping me with sob stories of how his grandson will always think one grandfather is better than the other.          
They also keep trying to get me to change his first name in honor of them with the excuse that the name I’ve picked is “ugly” which sets me off as I’ve been dreaming of giving my son this name for years. I told them all they are jeaprodizing any chance of a relationship with him over his name. My father was so excited about the baby having a middle name similar to his first name but now he’s upset with how horrible the rest of the family has been. He feels guilt like my wife.            
Am I being a dick here? I have no remorse and I’m about to tell them (with my wife’s permission) that they can’t come to the hospital when he arrives if they don’t stop as they’re causing me an insane amount of stress with the constant texts and phone calls.

1332,Not the A-hole,"My parents separated when I was pretty young and my mom was awarded full custody. My father wanted to stay in my life at first, but the courts ruled in favor of my mom controlling visitation until he found a place to live and got a job. He was really bad off back then, and my mom was at least able to make bills. Instead of getting his act together, my father never tried to get involved with me again until recently when my mom died and he accepted custody. He has a house, a job, a GF, and she has a little boy. All living together.

I didn't have to move out of state or anything, but it's a good distance from where I've lived my whole life and my best friend was still willing to take the time and gas to come see me. When he got here, my dad was very standoffish and when he left I was told I wasn't allowed to interact at with him at all anymore. I'm sure it's because he's a year older, has face piercings and some tattoos, and does weird styles and colors with his hair. My dad went so far as to lock my social media so I can have no contact.

But my best friend is like my *best friend.* We've been through a lot-we grew up poor, we've had our fair share of bullying and family problems. I love my mom, but she wasn't perfect and there was a lot of shit to work through. He is a great guy who's always stood by me, and my dad dismissed him solely on his appearance. I got pissed and told my dad not to expect me to be around in a year when I turn eighteen, and his girlfriend told me I should be ashamed for using that as blackmail.

1333,Asshole,"So I've noticed this annoying and demeaning and rage inducing trend where a public place is packed (Starbucks, library, park, commuter rail), I sit at an empty seat and a lady sitting across says that seat is taken as she is waiting for her friend. Yes, even on a packed train where we're all going home after work, though this one starts off with their purse and bags taking up the seat.

As you can probably feel from the vibe of my post, I feel this is incredibly selfish and uncalled for behavior. We live in a society (America), hoarding a public good (seats) like this leads to anarchy in the system (people must stand, sit on the ground, walk far away to find an alternative) as there is less for everyone else (2 seats for 1 person). The final straw that broke the camel's back was when I was at the university library, it was packed, the same ""this seat is taken for a friend who is coming"", and fortunately someone else was leaving and I took their spot, only to witness the woman 45 minutes later leave with no one ever arriving.

After that whenever I ask if that seat is available and I hear the ""I'm waiting for a friend"" I say ""alright well I'll leave when the friend arrives"", and just sit down. And if the other person arrives, I get up and go. Which I think is a fair compromise. Though at this point it's exhausting trying to change everyone and so I see a girl telling people that open seat is taken and I don't even pick that battle anymore, going somewhere else totally.",781,4868,0.93

1339,Asshole,"Okay so, my son turned 17 Wednesday and we’re having his birthday party this weekend. On the day of his birthday he asked to go hang out with his friends and go camping. It’s summer so we said yes. 

A little back story before I get into the AITA part: 

My son isn’t biologically my son. His father died when he was very young (6ish) and his mother was unfit to raise him. My husband and I took him in and have been with him ever since. He was generally an excellent child. He’s given us endless joy and happiness. Recently though, he’s started to act out. At first it was small. Breaking curfew, lying, hanging out with questionables. We tried talking, because he is a straight A, chess club, football, beta club all around good kid. 

It didn’t work. We tried grounding. Screaming. Listening. You name it we’ve tried it. His misbehavior is only escalating though. He was caught smoking weed. (I know weed isn’t huge and I’ve always been open about that conversation but clear that he was expected to stay away until he was 18 an adult to make that decision.) He was involved in a hit and run. He was caught stealing. 

This catches us up to our story now. In the middle of the night I get a call from the police, again. This time, our son was caught tagging an abandoned house and had taken my husband’s revolver from the safe. 

He was charged for the gun and released to us. The officers were really great to us but I wish they wouldn’t have been so cool in front of son. 

I was livid and screamed at him, took away all of his privileges, anything I could think of and he still is treating it as a joke. He told my SIL that he thought it was all funny. 

I’m really confused and hurt, son and I used to be so close. The three of us all have always been very close. Husband and I feel as if our trust has been completely destroyed and that we’re losing our son. 

The question is, WIBTA if for my son’s birthday I give him a toy gun, plastic hand cuffs, and other gag gifts as a “low life” starter kit to prove a point?",82,52,0.82
1340,Not the A-hole,"When our son was just over a year old, my husband at the time announced he was leaving me for someone he met online and moved to another state. Our son is now almost 4 and has seen his dad on about 10 different occasions, most for less than 2 hours. He doesn't call him daddy and doesn't really know who he is other than someone to play with. When we got divorced, we agreed I could have sole custody in exchange for him not having to pay child support, and the only visitation schedule is that he can request visitation but it has to be at least 24 hours in advance. There's nothing in the agreement about me having to agree to it. 

A few months ago, ex wanted to come see our son and bring his new girlfriend, who he had only been with for about a week (thanks, facebook). I didn't like the idea, but to keep the peace I said sure. She came, it went fine, they broke up the next day. He got another girlfriend the day after, they dated for a week, broke up. Now he's with another woman and he asked if he could bring her to meet son. I said no, it's inappropriate, stay with her for about another 2 months at least and then they can meet. He...lost his shit. Started threatening me, saying he'd take son and run and never let me see him again, calling me names, etc. She sent me threatening messages as well, about taking my son and name-calling. I actually got the police involved on that but was advised to just block her. 

All of that had started to die down again, but 2 weeks ago he wanted to see son and take him to the park. I said sure. He came to pick son up and surprise, his girlfriend was with him. Son was super excited to go to the park and I knew it would cause a fight, so against my better judgement I said he could go with them but after that ex was not seeing/taking kiddo anywhere without me present. After he dropped son back off with me, he started sending me more harassing texts, saying I'm keeping son from him and he's going to take me to court for violating our custody agreement and 'parental interference'. He even called the cops on me, but they didn't do anything once I proved I have sole custody and no visitation agreement.

So, my question: AITA for being strict about ex seeing our son? Should I get over it and let this potentially violent woman, who has been with ex for less than 2 months, around my son?

Soon after our engagement, his brother’s girlfriend reached out to him to tell him that Fall 2020 was off limits for our wedding since she was targeting that date - specifically October 2020 (10/10/2020), and that it would be too much to expect the family to fly to two weddings in the same season. Her’s would most likely be in Alabama and our’s in California. They aren’t engaged, and his brother has not confirmed that he plans to propose anytime soon, though she did give him an ultimatum to propose by the end of the year or they’re done leaving them 10 months to plan if he proposed by December 2019.

Last summer, I had some colleagues approach me about an unbelievable opportunity to travel to Denmark and present our research at a conference this coming August. I immediately began saving everything I could to make this happen, got my passport, and registered for the conference. The conference is only four days, so I decided to make a vacation out of it and travel around Europe for a bit before going to the conference. In all, I will be gone for two weeks. I originally asked my husband to join me, but he is unable to go. I then asked a couple of friends if they would like to go, but they are also unable to go. No worries, I’ll go solo and then meet my colleagues in Denmark for the conference. 

About two months ago, we were at a family dinner and the topic of my trip came up. I mentioned I was going solo and my mom immediately started going on about how she would go with me and she’s always wanted to go, etc. I just kept reiterating I would be going alone. My mom seemed kind of hurt that I didn’t want her to go and has mentioned/joked about going with me every time I see or talk to her.

She also has problems sitting for long periods of time without being in pain. I want to explore the countries and meet locals, she gets nervous in unfamiliar situations and stresses out about being safe. I think she would add stress to my vacation and I would just rather go by myself. 

I know she’s worried about my safety. Also, my dad would NEVER go on a trip to Europe, so she may view this as her “only” chance to go. I know I would be miserable most of the time with her there and I don’t really want to share this opportunity.

Guests include a child who is diabetic, a child who is vegan (personal preference) and lactose intolerant, and a child who is gluten-free (parental preference) and has various random allergies. Am I the asshole for providing standard pizza, cake, ice cream, etc, and inviting those who prefer something special to bring their own? I feel if I cater to one child's preferences, I need to cater to them all, and honestly, I just don't want to spend the extra time to do that when I've already got my hands full with typical party prep.

My wording: "" We will have a small ""lunch"" around 11, followed by cake and ice cream. Since we'll have a few girls on special diets, please feel free to bring your own treat if she can't eat typical cake & ice cream. ""

NOTE: I made sure everyone is aware there will be pizza as well as apples, carrots, chips, and peanuts (surprisingly no allergies to those!), so there will be something everyone can have.  


UPDATE: Party just finished, and went great! I picked up a gluten-free, vegan pizza from the grocery store, as a few had suggested.

Years ago I bought both of my sons homes. I told them both the same budget, go find a house you like and let me see it, and I'll buy it for you. It was college graduation gifts sort of. I promised the same to my stepdaughter: graduate college, get a home wherever you want with a $200,000 budget. I firmly believe you can't get far in life with the current apartment rental rates, so this takes a major load off of shoulders.

Well, she graduated this past April and my girlfriend is bugging me to get the ball into motion on getting her a house. The thing is that when I made that promise years ago, I assumed we'd be married by now. I want to get married, but she doesn't want to. I told her I don't feel comfortable buying a house for someone ""not officially in the family"" if that makes sense.

Now the promise is if we get married, she can have a house, but I did make a compromise I could buy her a house but it remains in my name. My fear is I buy a house for someone, my girlfriend and I don't work out and split, then I've basically bought a house for a stranger.

1365,Not the A-hole,"Snapchat became popular while I was in high school, but it was largely perceived to be a joke at first. After all, it was the “sending nudes” social media. Like many social media platforms, it was never going to survive more than a few months. So, I gave my buddy my phone, and he made my Snapchat for me. That’s why my name is [last name]+”queer”. 

The simple solution would be to change it right? Wrong. Snapchat does not allow users to change usernames. I have emailed Snapchat pleading them to let me change my name because it may be offensive to others but they said no. 

I should add that while many perceive me to be a standard-issue heterosexual [M], my sexual preferences are pretty fluid. At times, I’ll be far more interested in men. Others, I’ll be more interested in women. Only a few very close friends know this. 

So, am I the asshole? Do I need to delete my Snapchat and create a new one?

EDIT: It seems like the general consensus is that it’s not offensive if I’m owning the label of being queer. But what if I’m not ready to admit that to the world yet? I’m comfortable with my inner-circle knowing, and I personally define myself as sexually fluid / queer, but I’m not quite ready for that to be my global identity yet.

1368,Not the A-hole," 

Quick background here. I work in an office with a ten person department. I have one coworker (We'll call her Martha) who is 73 years old, and recently started smoking again after quitting years ago.

I'm (30M) a smoker, and I've cut back from two packs a day to just having two cigarettes a day. We have one other person who smokes, but very rarely smokes during work hours.

I came into work the other day and two of my coworkers had Martha cornered at her desk, and were putting her on blast for smoking again. Going on about how bad it is (which is true, but I've never met a smoker who wasn't already aware) and just generally being annoying about it AFTER being asked by Martha to drop the subject. A day later, they went into Martha's desk and hid her pack of smokes.

I eventually got tired of hearing them go on about it, and pointed out that Martha is an adult, she is fully aware of what she's doing, and that while I understand their concerns, they were crossing lines by going into her desk and harassing her whenever she walked out to smoke.

I was summarily put on blast by them, and was told I was only defending her because I also smoke, that I didn't care about her health, etc.

In my opinion, it's not our business what she does as an adult.

I was talking to one of my neighbours and I mentioned how I had never tried pad thai before and she told me she could cook it for me since she loves it so I agreed. She knocked on my door after work and gave me a massive glass container with pad thai and told me to enjoy and give the container back tomorrow at work. So i ate it all and very much enjoyed it. Heres the thing I gave it back to her the next day and without cleaning the container there was still some stuff left in it and it smelled pretty bad. I told her it was good but she just gave me a blank stare when i handed it back almost like she couldnt believe it. She stormed off immediately and went into the break room and im guessing told my coworkers. I was supposed to play DnD with them tonight but they wouldnt respond to my texts so now I dunno might just play switch with my gf's son. AITA because I didnt clean it? I mean i didnt really ask for it and she gave it to me. Its not mine and its not like I kept the glass container it looked expensive.

1371,No A-holes here,"Throwaway because my sister follows my regular account. 

(TLDR at the bottom)

My sister and I are both in high school and very close with each other. She is more academic than I am, and gets better grades. However, she is also the type to need validation from others, and can be very sensitive to criticism or failure.

 She received a letter in the mail from a foundation/company that told her she won an award for outstanding performance in school. (She gets Bs and Cs, but still higher than mine). It did not mention her grades or what she won it for specifically.  I started to get suspicious, but I didn't say anything because, hey, it was my sister and I was proud of her. 

Then it mentioned that for the low price of $75, she would receive an official membership card. That was the straw on the camel's back for me, and I did a little research about this foundation. The college board forums say not to waste your money/colleges don't care about ""bought"" awards, and that overall, this had nothing to do with her academic performance. Most of them say that these ""awards"" don't have anything to do with grades, they just get your info from the PSAT and SAT.

I was about to gently tell her that she might not want to waste her money, but she had already PAID the $75, and was about to pay more for a T shirt and a ""platinum membership"". I was able to convince her not to buy those 2 just yet, but I haven't been able to tell her how much of a scam it really is...

I feel awful letting her waste her hard earned money on something that won't help her, and I feel awful crushing her spirit and bringing her self esteem down by telling her she didn't really ""win""...

TLDR: My sister paid for a scam out of her own pocket and she's really excited about it. I don't know of I should tell her.

So, WIBTA for telling my sister not to fall for a scam?",15,42,0.9
1372,Not the A-hole,"I'm a CMT, I've been practicing massage for over 20 years. I currently work in massage therapy at a local spa. I also have two kids, a 17-year old daughter and 15-year old son. I massage both of them regularly. On special occasions (customary they always get one on their birthday), when they're feeling stressed or going through tough times, when they report any stiffness in their body, etc. They love it, and I absolutely love my kids, so I'm glad that I can make them feel good in the best way I can.

Recently when my neighbor was visiting she overheard me talking to my daughter about this briefly, and seemed a little weirded out by it, then asking ""You massage your kids?!"" I explained yes, and then she asked (once my daughter left the room) if it's an actual full massage with them naked except for a towel. I thought it honestly wasn't her business but I told her yes, I give the exact same massage I give to my clients. (One a side note unless it's one of those quick ones you can get at the mall in a chair I believe you should always take all your clothes off for a massage, otherwise you're only cheating yourself. The buttocks has the largest concentration of nerves on your body, and thus is frequently the highlight of the massage. I wouldn't ever get a massage myself that didn't include that area unless it was specifically to address one part of the body that needed work.) My ""style"" is also based over long interrupted strokes, and having underwear or a bra in the way doesn't go well with it, I just move the towel to the side I'm currently not working and then move it back doing the other side. I've given literally thousands of massages this way. That said once my kids started developing I gave them the option of leaving any clothes on if they weren't comfortable...and both declined, saying my massages were perfect as is. She then made some comment about how weird it is that a teenage girl would be OK with her mother seeing her breasts that I thought was pretty weird. I offer to drape the breasts of female clients, but do not if they decline (this is not legally required in my state), and always decline it when getting a massage myself. My daughter also has declined. I massage the area around the breasts, but not the nipples.

While I can see out of context that someone would see a mother rubbing her kids naked except for a single towel would be weird, it's still entirely desexualized, it's a legitimate therapeutic practice that they enjoy, and that I enjoy, and seeing the smiles on their faces and feeling the happiness and relief of my loved ones is always a big pick me up to me as well.

1373,Not the A-hole,"Back in 2009 when the economy tanked I lost my job, my car, my apartment, my girlfriend. Basically everything. At first I didn’t want anyone to know what had happened so I stayed at a friends house for a week while I looked for a new job. But his landlord told me guests couldn’t stay for more than 7 days at a time in a 30 day period. So I asked my mother if I could stay with her while I looked for a job. I told her I’d be on the street homeless if she didn’t help me and she still decided to refuse to help me. Fast forward 2 months, I’ve been sleeping on the streets for every night still unable to secure a job. Even something like Safeway or McDonald’s. My dad finds out that I’m homeless and sends me a ticket to come live with him in NJ and I accept. Within a week I have a job and in 3 months I’m in my own place again. It’s been 10 years since then and I haven’t spoken to my mother because of what I perceive to be a betrayal. She attempts to contact me frequently and I ignore it. AITA for cutting her out of my life? 

TL;DR mother let me be homeless and I never forgive her.

Edit: I guess I also have to say that I never asked my parents for anything. I’ve earned everything I have. I am not a drug user and I have never been.

We can't get hold of her, nobody we contact can tell us, and she definitely doesn't reach out to us. I have 2 half sisters on her side, but they are too young (5-6years old) to reach out to for information. About 4 months later she reaches out to us, although I don't remember the details of why she disappeared, but then goes MIA again. This goes on for 2 years, just on-off again phone calls.

Well when my older sister was 14, she was a terror to my father, and around this time...my mom is reachable again. I wasn't speaking to her but my dad was, and before I knew it, my sister was on a plane to live with our mom. I didn't speak to my sister much while she was with my mom, and never spoke to my mom during that time span either. My sister lived out there for about 2 years, and my dad brought her back. Oh the stories I've heard. Drugs, drugs, and more drugs. She'd shoot up or smoke something while my little sisters watched Disney movies, strip naked and chase a snake around the apartment. My mom even left my older sister alone with my 2 younger sisters for 2 weeks without food or money. Shit like that for 2 years.

I didn't click on any of the people, mostly because I knew he fancied them already, but then I did go through his browser history and saw he had been looking at numerous amounts of girls pages, literally going through every picture. I kept clicking on random links of one girl (there were over 100 of the same girl) and it was the messenger link to their chat, and I read it.

I have a Real Job now (I did then too, but like at a coffee shop so I still had the luxury of looking like shit) so I don't dress weird or look particularly 'punk,' but a huge part of my history was playing music, touring, etc. and I'm extremely proud of it.

So, now that my boyfriend moved in, he apparently thinks we're going to take all of those fliers down.

Different tenants have called the police and social services, but for some reason that's beyond me, they can't put her in a home. Maybe it's because some of her family does visit and help her out a few times a week.

The other day I (16f) was coming up the stairs and just taking my earbuds out. Unfortunately that's why I didn't hear the door open as I passed by the old lady's apartment. Just as I did, she basically hollered and called me a filthy criminal. Note: she calls everyone holding any kind of electronic devices criminals, and I suspect the addition of filthy is a racial thing, because being mixed isn't a common thing here and she's called me racial and sexist slurs before. Just to clarify her ""reasoning"".

Well anyhow her screams made me jump out of my skin. When I can expect to get yelled at, I do my best to ignore her and pass by (she's not physically violent) but this time she literally ambushed me. I snapped and insulted her, calling her insane and throwing in some swears about her mother... She only yelled louder and started reciting the names of Nazi generals (yeah this is also occasionally her thing) so after awhile I left for my apartment.

I've been contemplating my actions since calming down. I literally never talked back to this lady, not even when she called me nasty names. The only reason I lashed out the last time was because she appeared out of nowhere to scare me. Oh, and by the way, I know she's got at least enough reason in her to know whom to target, because she never insults physically bigger male tenants or most adults - usually only teenagers and old people.

1390,Everyone Sucks,"Five years ago, my father caused a divorce in a terrible way. He was unhappy with his marriage, but didn't tell my mother so. He just cheated with an employee. The employee was invited to my mother's birthday. My mother caught my father embracing and kissing her in the kitchen. It seems he had been having inappropriate contact with her for months. 

A week later, he was living with her in a rented house. I didn't want to have contact with him for nearly a year. The divorce procedure took a very long time, and the negotiations were pretty hard. There were multiple situations where my father seemed to act harsh and unfair. 

Since the divorce, there have been periods where contact between me and my father has been relatively good. Last year, I had a pretty big conflict with him when he tried to lower alimony for a silly reason. I got angry at him and he didn't bring up alimony again. 

A couple of months ago, my mother got a better job. She earns a bit more now, but she definitely isn't rich. My dad does earn quite a lot. 

Last Sunday, I had planned a day trip for me and my father, for Father's Day. It's the first time since the divorce I had organized something like this for him. He was really excited and thanked me for it. During the day, he told me about all the expensive fun he has been having. He bought a new and expensive car, he has already enjoyed two holidays to exotic foreign locations this year and is planning a third in a couple of months, and he's thinking about buying a second house in a beautiful and expensive area. I was glad that he was enjoying life. 

Literally less than 24 hours later, on Monday, he sent a message to my mom that he wants to lower her alimony because she earns more with a new job, and that she should hand over information about her new salary. In the same message, he said that he regrets the fact that this can't be discussed casually and amicably while seated at the kitchen table. 

At first, my mother claimed that the divorce agreement contained a clause that allowed her to earn more without having to worry about alimony getting lowered. I've inspected the agreement, and it doesn't look like that's true. 

Legally, it seems he's right. But on a moral, personal and emotional level, I'm so sick and tired of it. It has been five years now and it seems like the drama never ends. I don't want to be forced to be my mother's lawyer, and I cannot have fun with my father while he's threatening to take my mother to court. And when I think about the divorce, I think about the way he caused it, with the cheating and inviting her to my mother's birthday. That's just so morally wrong that I don't ever want to be reminded of it. And fighting about alimony does remind me of it, strongly. 

Am I the asshole if I tell my father that he should keep paying the full alimony without drama if he wants to keep seeing me?",253,445,0.93

1392,Not the A-hole,"I have 3 cousins , 1 sister and 2 brothers. They're all smaller than me .We all stay at grandma's house for summer , which is a society. We all play together with other kids who are also small(around 9 years old).Now I am an animal lover. And there's this family of cats which are fed by a woman because of which they are somewhat friendly with humans. I observed them and decided to try and be their friend. So I sat some feet away from them to make them accustomed to my presence. But my cousins and all the other kids ran towards me and the cats , who backed away. Even worse, my sister traumatized them by making really loud noise. I left the cats  as I didn't want to distress them . The next day I again wanted to go to the cats and hence told the others that I'm not playing. Just as I had earned the kittens trust , all of the kids ran and scared them. I got really annoyed as this had happened for the 4th time . I told my sister to stop following me all the time and get a life  . I really don't think I'm the asshole here.

1394,Not the A-hole,"When we got married, my wife and I made a deal that she gets to name our male children while I get to name the females. Our first child is a girl and I named her. Our second child is a boy, so my wife should be the one to name him. However, when she told me that she wanted to name our son Lannister after her favorite Game of Thrones family, I put my foot down.

I'd have no problem if she wanted to name our dog Lannister, but this is our son. I asked her if she really wanted him to be named after a family of villains, but she just reminded me of our deal. She said she liked the Lannisters and it was her turn to name our child, so he would be named Lannister. We've had this conversation countless times and she refuses to budge.

The birth will be a C-section and I'm seriously considering filling in the paper work myself while she's still out. I know this might sound unfair to my wife given our deal, but wouldn't it be more unfair to my son if he was named after a family of power grabbing incestuous wine guzzling villains?

1395,Not the A-hole,"So a group of friends and I were debating where we want to go on holiday. One of my friends has been posted in Qatar for work and really wanted us to come and visit him there. Even offering money for flights and a place to crash. 

After some beating around the bush, I told him I would never visit such a shit hole country which could not only imprison or execute me for who I love but has a virulently homophobic stance on most issues. Furthermore, the general human rights abuses and modern day slavery* issues are the final nail in the coffin. Doubly so for a holiday where I am meant to be enjoying myself. 

Turns out that one of his best friends is now a rich Qatari. Whilst my friend is ""unsure"" how his friend feels about homosexuality, he admits that his friend does have a bunch of house slaves. He insisted that his Qatari friend is still a nice guy citing him giving him Arabic lessons, helping him out with police issues and showing him all around the country. They even share tips on what condom brand to purchase. 

I responded by saying that though his Qatari friend is a shitty person, I wouldn't expect much more given the circumstances that he was brought up in. What I meant was that people are very much a product of their environment, so if you grow up under state-sanctioned slavery is it a surprise that you would hold such a shitty opinion. But I accept that might not have been clear. 

My friend got upset hearing this saying that I hadn't even met the guy and barely knew anything about him. He told me that it was possible for me to visit countries and ""refrain from fucking or discussing his sex life"" like he does. I dislike upsetting people so I let it slide there but our conversations have been a little frosty since. 

Am I the asshole here?

1397,Not the A-hole,"To preface this, I am 20, my boyfriend is 21, and my mother is 53. 

My mother has always been one to seek validation from others. She’ll bring up pictures of her female classmates and ask me or my dad or my 24 year old sister how old they look or she’ll compare herself to her sister (my aunt) and get my dad to say that my mom is prettier and skinnier than her sister. When pretty actresses are on tv she’ll make comments to my dad like “Here’s your woman. She’s a redhead. You can go ahead and leave me for her” and such. I’m sure you get the idea. 

I (barely) tolerated her desperation for approval and validation up until Sunday when she did something awful. 

I am in college and met a great guy friend early last year when we were taking a few classes together. His dad owns a limousine company in my area for special events (weddings, prom, birthdays etc) but his dad was sick so he allowed my boyfriend, his son, to use the limousine to take us to the airport. My sister is in the military and is coming home for the first time in several months so we wanted to surprise her by picking her up in a limousine since she’s always wanted to ride in one but has never gotten the chance to do so.

I asked everyone to please be nice to him because he and I had a few classes together and we are friendly. I didn’t mention that he and I have started dating. I didn’t want to tell them about us dating because I didn’t want anyone making jokes or teasing us about it. He and I are seemingly very compatible and I wanted to get him comfortable with my family if it ever gets serious. We have only been dating around 7 months and date each other exclusively. We are boyfriend and girlfriend.

We (myself, my parents, my 21 year old brother, and boyfriend) leave and everything is fine for a few minutes until my mom starts making awful sex jokes. I can’t even remember them all, but I do recall her saying something to him about paying “another way” and implied sex and blow jobs. She started talking about how her kneecaps are red (she got them from getting on them and cleaning the house) and she said she was going to do it again tonight for my dad when we got home. Even my brother (who is the SAME AGE as my boyfriend) and dad were not feeling it after a while. I apologized to my boyfriend and asked my mom to stop. She didn’t. If you thought it stopped when we picked my sister up, you’d be wrong.

After we got back home, I refused to get out and asked him to take me to my apartment. I was **SO** embarrassed and my boyfriend was visibly uncomfortable. I have since blocked my mom’s phone number and got my sister to bring the spare key I had given my parents so they no longer have access to my apartment. My sister comes here to visit with me because I can’t stand to be around my mother. I have apologized so much to my boyfriend for my family and he told me that he’s sorry, but he isn’t sure if the relationship will go further and needs time to think.

1398,Not the A-hole," My mate's laptop bag (with the laptop inside) got stolen from his locker while he was swimming, he reported it to the police who said they'd look into it but nothing came of it. Three weeks later he finds it on FB Marketplace, knows it's his because it has a distinct scratch mark on the back or formatted it as it was still on the same lock screen. Saw a chance to get it back so he had me message them and arrange a collection somewhere local.

On the day we pick up it's by the shops, he's sat on a bench with my mate's bag that obviously has the laptop in it. While he's talking to me my mate comes up from behind and grabs the bag, begins to walk off - thief tries to get up until I push back against him to sit him back down and tell him we know where he got it and he'd best stay where he was unless he didn't mind getting bummed in prison. He was quite scared of me when he realised what was happening, looked like he was barely out of school/college so maybe not even 18. 

Anyway, got home and when we opened the bag we've found that the idiot left some personal belongings in it, their wallet, a phone and some keys.

Im a 21 year old Brasilian and I have been the boyfriend of a 20yo brasilian woman for about 2 months now, we used to have an active sex life and in general a open view on most aspects of life. About 3 weeks ago she started studying different religions to try and find her ""spiritual calling"" and I was supporting her like a good boyfriend should and yesterday she finally found her calling, she decided to convert to Sunni Islam and was all pumped up by it while I was confused, I questioned her on why convert to Islam and she told me that she agreed with everything she read about it, them I asked about Ramadan and she told me she couldnt wait to try it for herself and them she started becoming really conservative in topics about the ""modern vestiments of woman"" and how she never liked ""western culture"".

I was really confused, like I was talking to someone I didnt knew simply because it was the first time ever she spoke about any of this in such extreme way. When I met her she described herself as a liberal agnostic, but suddenly after a 3 week religious discovery she became a conservative muslim woman. Them she explained to me that islamic relationships work differently from ""western standards"" and that we werent supposed to touch each other no more, that touching is reserve for after the marriage.

At first I thought it was a joke, but she got offended by my initial reaction and I explained to her that Im a 21 year old man and I wasant going to let go of my sex life for years until we married (neither that I was ready to marry or wanted to marry someone I knew for a few months), she got even more offended saying that I dont respect her choice and that she never complained about my atheism. I told her that I was respecting her choice by breaking up with her since she would be better of dating someone that follows her religion and is ready to make those sacrifices. Her friends called me an asshole for hurting her feelings (since becoming a muslim was making she really happy and I was supposed to support it and be there with her during this important part of her life).

tl;dr: I had a normal relationship with my girlfriend, until she suddenly decided to convert to Islam and told me that we couldnt touch eachother until our marriage so I broke up with her on a attempt to protect my sanity.",42,31,0.85

1403,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because, well, I’d rather not announce myself brazenly to the world.

So here’s what happened: my Dungeons and Dragons group consisted of me (DM), my now ex-boyfriend, and two of our friends. We’d play weekly-ish whenever our schedules lined up and had a grand old time. My boyfriend recently broke up with me (and not nicely either) but neither of our two friends supported the idea of me kicking the ex out and either playing with just the two of them or finding another person to play in his place.

I said, fine, I’ll leave then, but friends wouldn’t have that either, they said they wanted to just finish the campaign and didn’t want to find a new DM (we live in a small city/large town and there’s not a ton of D&D action around, all DMs that we know of have their own games).

I basically made it clear, either the ex leaves or I do, they said neither option worked, so I just decided not to schedule any more meetings (I used to be the one coordinating the schedule) because it’s not like they can MAKE me DM right?

(I should add that the ex was on their side, saying we should all play together as normal and not let our breakup affect things.)

Now both friends and my ex are texting me asking when we’re going to have the next session. I told them never and they’re telling me I’m an asshole for ruining their fun, breaking up the gaming group, etc. and that it’s unfair of me to ask them to pick sides.

1405,Not the A-hole,"So to cut a long story short, I’m a Sysop Engineer at one of the Top Ten IT companies in the world. I’ve been working in IT for almost 10 years and started pretty much when I was a kid. So anyway, I met with a few friends recently, both who are currently at Harvard studying Data Science. We were all chatting when my GF suggested that they could both easily be my boss and do my job without any effort. I said “Well in all fairness, my job is not exactly covering the same fields as what they’re studying”. My GF laughed at me, and pretty much made me look like a moron suggesting I had no idea what I was talking about for the next 10 minutes. Both of my friends also laughing at me. At this point I was feeling really quite down and humiliated. Here’s me, having studied for years different aspects of IT, Windows, Linux, DBs, various languages, networking, etc. ( As anyone in the Systems side knows, there’s a huge breadth of knowledge that comes with doing this job ) and here’s 3 people, 1 having no idea about IT, and the other 2 studying IT for 2 years at the very least and with just one subject.  So I looked over to my fiends and started listing different technologies, none of them had a clue what I was talking about. I said “See, they don’t know, they have no idea”. In a tongue in cheek way obviously, I’m not arrogant in the slightest but I’m not going down without a fight. So I asked them what they studying specifically, they said (paraphrasing) “How to create joins without a schema”. I understood, I asked a few questions naturally, and left it at the that. I don’t know a lot about DBs, but I understood the gist of what they were trying to achieve. I don’t pretend to understand that which I don’t understand. 

Shortly after, when they had both gone the toilet, my GF looked to me and said “You know no one likes arrogance, you think that you’re better than your mates studying at Harvard??” I replied back “I don’t think I’m better at all. I never started this dumb conversation! I’ve been humiliated by you, making me look dumb in front of my friends, with them agreeing with you!” 

She later said I’m a big head and reiterated that she thinks that I think I’m better than anyone else. SIGH. I said “Look, I never started this conversation. I never suggested I was better than them, I never suggested I could do what they’re doing. You suggested they could replace me in my job, something that requires a whole different skill set to what they have!”. Am I an asshole?",35,35,0.8
1406,Not the A-hole,"There's this girl in my group of friends... Let's call her Amy because why not. We're both 18f. She's only been hanging out with us since dating another friend's cousin, so we're not super close or besties or anything like that.

Anyway Amy's 157 cm tall (5 feet 1 inch) while I'm 188 cm (6 feet 2 inches). Yes, I know I'm tall. Been tall all my life, everyone in my family's tall, it was sort of inevitable. No, I don't generally care if people bring it up or ask questions, but repeatedly treating me like a freak-show irks me.

Well Amy was like that. Her first reaction upon meeting me was to literally jump up and exclaim, ""Wow, you're like a giant!"" I laughed that off because I thought it was funny, but then she never stopped awkwardly glancing at me. Every time we saw each other, she'd make multiple remarks referencing my height. Like... fine. I get it. I know I'm tall. Can we talk about something else now, please?

And that was pretty much what I told her the last time we hung out in group. Instead of getting off my case, she looked caught off-guard and said something along the lines of, ""But it's just so weird. You're not only tall, you're like a whole another category."" That set off my temper and I became spiteful. The next time Amy faked surprise about how big I am standing up, I looked down at her and said, ""Wow, and you're super short!"" She seemed shocked, though my other friends got a laugh out of it. Probably because I'm normally timid and don't like provoking conflict, but she was really crossing the line.

Edit 2: shit hit the fan, I'm moving out

A couple weeks ago my roommate texted me and told me that her guy friends are coming over to do laundry since the one in their apartment complex ""isn't really working"". Even though she was telling me rather than asking, I was still fine with it. A couple days ago, she texts to tell me that they are coming over again to do laundry. I had planned to do laundry that day but since she didn't ask me I felt uncomfortable trying to speak up so I said okay. Her friends were there for about 7 hours doing laundry. 

So that's the background but I have three main reasons for why I don't want them to come over:

1) They stay way to long and it makes me uncomfortable as these guys totally ignore me

2) When I finally got the chance to do my laundry, I pulled several strands of animal fur out of the lint trap. I asked my roommate if the boys had any pets and she casually said they had a cat and a dog. I am ALLERGIC to those animals. Not life threatening but there have been several times where I have struggled to breathe around cats and dogs. She knows this, we've had fights about it in the past, but she didn't think to tell me

3)  After I finally worked up the nerve to ask her to check with me first, I proceeded to ask when their laundry units were going to be fixed. She looked away and started mumbling before I caught the words ""...it's in their complex but it's stetchy and they feel like their going to be murdered"" So that makes me think she lied and now they are just going to keep coming here from now on, which will not be ideal for me when school picks back up and I want peace and quiet.

1414,Not the A-hole,"Backstory:  I was friends with my SIL prior to dating, then marrying her brother.  I've never liked her husband.  His is a narcissistic, bully that treats everyone he deems beneath him like garbage(which is pretty much everyone). My SIL and I were friends for 7 years, and 6 1/2 of those her husband and I have had not gotten along. He was fine with me, then suddenly he was not, and began saying things about how I'd be prettier if I lost weight, suddenly making fun of me while I was in the middle of speaking, calling me names, etc.  When he decided bullying me was his favorite thing, I stopped hanging out with our group of friends when he was around.  It worked for 6 years.  When her brother and I married 4 years ago, I took on a parenting role at the same time and became a step parent(I hate that term because they are my kids, but its the easiest way to say it what my role is).  She was so excited that I was part of the family, told me constantly how great of a mom I would be.  I prided myself on the strong relationship I built with my bonus kids, who are 13 and 14 now.  

A few months ago my kids were at my SIL home, and her husband decided to insult me nonstop, especially while the kids were in his presence. SIL also made a comment, agreed with him, and never asked him to stop acting like that in front of the kids.  This was the first time we'd let the kids go their house without one of us, or a grandparent with them.  The husband had been acting ok for a few years, so I thought maybe he matured, but obviously I was wrong.  
My kids became upset enough that after 2 hours of nonstop insults, they called us to pick them up early.  They love me, and couldn't stand how he was bashing me for fun, and doing it purposely when they were in the room. They really wanted to hang out with their aunt, but just couldn't take it.  They told us later about everything.  None of it surprised me.  I am very upset about how it impacted them though.  They had tears in their eyes, and one of them was shaking.  The youngest said,  ""I thought you were friends with her?  Why wouldn't Aunt ******* stick up for you?  I thought friends did that? I thought SHE would do that?"".  That was tough.

I decided to call my SIL about what happened, and how it impacted the children.  Her response, ""I'm sorry they thought they heard that."".  I couldn't believe she wouldn't take responsibility, and made her own nieces seem like liars.  I've dissolved the friendship, and we've made changes on how the kids will see her in the future.

She and her husband are obviously assholes here. My husband and I decided it is not ok for the kids to be around her, or her husband, unless one of us is present. This new stipulation had caused more drama, and even though we are trying to protect the kids, are we also being assholes?  Some of the family wants us to just ignore it, but I can't.",62,372,0.93
1415,Not the A-hole,"This is my first post on this sub. I found this place a while ago and KNEW I was going to need it.

This happened just a few days ago. My girlfriend works for an organization that takes people on camping trips. while on this trip, some of the participants were talking about going skinny dipping. She told me this exactly: "" I wasn't sure if i even wanted to go in the first place but then of the participants where asking about going before we came back from yellow stone so i decided to do it. I was only naked for a few minutes before i jumped in. It was dark so the other people couldn't see me nor could I see the other people. I didn't touch anyone nor did i look in any else's direction.""

Honestly, I believe what she says and I believe that she wouldn't cheat on me or do anything to mess up our relationship. BUT its bothering me because SHES IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH ME! I believe that when you get into a relationship with someone, that you shouldn't be naked in front of other people. That's my expectations. I feel like i have that expectation because I've been cheated on before by girls who've said literally the same exact thing that my girlfriend is saying now! I am not saying that i am going to be a stalker bf who will follow my gf around everywhere she goes, but that doesn't mean that i don't have my own insecurities about other guys doing shit without me knowing. I know that i can't be in control of this situation but i feel like you should at least try and be responsible to say ""although i have a set of values that differ from my significant other, i respect my significant other enough to cross their boundaries."" Am I crazy for thinking that? It hurts me to know that my girlfriend is willing to cross my boundary just because she wants to have fun. I just don't believe that fun should come at the expense of your significant others feelings or vulnerabilities. Am I the asshole for believing that?

Update: 

So just from the few conversations I've seen in the comments, it seems like I am trying to be controlling/possessive. That's not my intention at all. I try and tell my girlfriend all that time that anything I say is not to be manipulative or crazy, because (Just based off personal experience) i know what it feels like to be in a manipulative relationship. At-least that's what I believe. I just feel like if I'm in a relationship, i like to know that i'm not sharing my partner with anyone else. Is that really the wrong way to see this?

Update #2 - 

Let me just put this out there to keep the record straight. I didn’t blow up on her. I always try not to yell at her, even if I’m hurt because I know that words cut deep and I never want to be the person to say the wrong thing when I’m angry because (just like I told my gf) I know what it feels like to never be able to let go of someone’s words. 

So I talked to my girlfriend about this whole situation. Reddit, you’ve humbled me. I won’t go into all the details but I’ve had traumatic experiences with women, and to say that those experiences don’t find their ways into my thought process would be a lie. I’ve unfortunately been cheated on, I’ve been played, I’ve experience enough bad situations to know the red flags. This is probably something you all see happen a lot here. But with that all being said, the more that we talked, the more that we came to an understanding about each other boundaries in this situation. She told me that, although she didn’t expect this reaction from me, she was understanding enough to see that there is more of a story behind the pain that I try to hide. I’m not perfect, not even by a long shot, but honestly, to everyone who read this and commented: I sincerely was not trying to manipulate or control my gf in any way shape or form. That’s the absolute truth. I have high hopes of marrying this girl one day soon. But that’s exactly why I brought this whole situation up. My own Insecurities were driving me crazy thinking about all of this and trying to come up with a resolution that works for my gf and I. I was wrong though reddit, I was wrong because I didn’t take into consideration that she loves me and wouldn’t do the stuff that’s happened to me in my past. I didn’t trust at first that she would make the right decision and that I wouldn’t get hurt again. I jumped to conclusions and assumptions and just fell back into my defensive ways just to make sure I don’t get hurt, which I dono if everyone will understand but hey that’s why I am here now trying to explain this. I am the asshole, but the least I can say is I am an asshole with a good enough heart to learn from this and I learned a lot so thank you reddit, you’ve proved me wrong, taken away the little karma I have and made me a better person!",79,56,0.85
1416,Not the A-hole,"The title makes it sound worse than it is. We will not be allowing anyone in, but my in-laws will be the problem, not my family. We are a gay couple that will be using a surrogate. Between my family and his, there would be 20 people in the room and a surrogate laying on the bed.

There’s a couple reasons we talked about doing it this way. When our baby comes, the woman who birthed her will be right there. We do not want to go to another room outside of hers. We want to spend that moment after - instead of saying, thanks for the baby, bye. After the birth there will be 20 people she doesn’t know thanking her and paying attention to the baby. It might also be hard to separate seeing her as the mother rather than us bringing home a child. I’m having a little trouble describing the emotion of what I mean, so please ask questions if this was not clear enough for you!

I know they will be furious. AITA if I don’t let anyone come to the hospital?

Edit: Thank you so much for so much feedback. You have all been great! I’ve gotten a lot of questions about the surrogates situation and thoughts.

First, I am the biological father in the situation. She is not the biological mother. We are going through an agency which does allow myself and my partner there, as well as my family. Also, the reason her feelings about people there are not being questioned is because we will not have anyone there even with her being happy to do so. I probably should have explained this, so sorry!

EDIT2: There seems to be some confusion about the process. When we started working with the agency, we let it be known that we would like the be in the room when our child is born. In this case, the agency would never match us with a surrogate who had a problem with us in the room. Of course we respect her! Which is why we are asking family not to be at the hospital. To respect her privacy. I’m sorry I got defensive to some of you, I just never want someone to think I have no respect for the woman who is doing something this amazing!

This isn’t a validation post. Just because you are doing right by one party does not mean someone else is not allowed to be hurt (even if they understand). My question was to help me determine whether I should feel guilt or understanding about the situation or move on and say, it is what it is.",71,67,0.85
1417,Not the A-hole,"My parents, brother, and I went out for father's day dinner. We went to this Korean restaurant and we always get a grilling table. We were seated in a semi-private area. The ""rooms"" are separated from the rest of the restaurant in that each one has a doorless entry so we still hear a lot of the sound, but aren't surrounded by it. The ""rooms"" are partially separated from each other in that there's a straw-like shade curtain thing that falls halfway to the ground from the ceiling between each ""room"".

Halfway through the meal, another family is seated next to us. Then I can hear someone initiate a FaceTime call. Through the ambient noise, I can hear it very clearly. Then someone answers and the father starts talking really loudly. He doesn't stop for at least 10 minutes. I try to zone him out, and I'm mildly successful until my parents make a comment about the language he's speaking in, wondering what it was out of curiosity bc they'd never heard it before. Then my brother says the guy's being loud.

With other people paying attention to it, I pay more attention to it and then I got more annoyed by it. I lifted the curtain slightly and right as I was doing it, my dad and brother make a face and are basically like stop, wtf are you doing.

I ignore them and say nicely and in a quieter voice ""hi, sorry, would you be able to speak a little quieter?"" And the dad is surprised and looks embarrassed and says ""sorry, yes"" and that was it. We enjoyed the rest of dinner and we didn't hear someone yelling by our table anymore.

My brother said ""why'd you do that"" as if it was wrong of me to ask someone to respect the public space we're in. I said I didn't ask for anything unreasonable and no one got offended.

At a family dinner we were talking about my weight loss, and I spoke freely about it. This included mentioning how bad I felt at my heaviest. I hated the excessive sweating, how easily exhausted I was, that no clothes looked good on me, and that I can't stand looking at pictures of myself from that time cause I look so huge.

The next day my brother calls me, saying that it was really inconsiderate of me to say these things when his girlfriend was present. She is overweight, and bigger than I've ever been. I honestly didn't consider it at all since it was only my own body and self image that was the topic. Apparently she felt bad all night and started crying as soon as they left.

1422,Asshole,"It always drives me NUTS how whenever I want to meet with my boss his wife is at his office. His wife is the “co-owner” but doesn’t have a damn what this company is about and just sits through meetings and nods as if she knows what I’m talking about to him. I think because their company is successful they’re a little over their head and think they can freely break professional boundaries. His wife is useless and doesn’t really contribute anything to the company besides sitting beside her husband looking pretty. Usually I’m annoyed but don’t say anything when she’s there during a meeting. Today was the last straw because as I opened his office door I saw her giving him a shoulder rub. It was enough for me and I said “i want to see you alone and I’m not meeting with you if she’s there” and went home because I was angry. My boss emailed me that he wants a meeting with me tomorrow as soon as I come in. Can I get fired? Was what I did an asshole move or am I justified?

Edit: since I’m apparently the asshole, should I just quit or go in tomorrow to see what he wants??

UPDATE:

What a joke of a company. If you thought I was the asshole last time just wait to see who the new asshole is. Today I went in to see what my boss emailed me about. When I walked in the office I found his wife, and 2 HR managers there and asked her where her husband was. She said she was meeting with me instead and asked me to sit down. So basically my boss didn’t respect my wishes from yesterday and decided to not only have his wife in a meeting AGAIN but he also didn’t show up himself. She told me they were letting me go and that the HR manager will walk me to my desk to pick up my stuff and leave. Notice how she thinks she’s too good that she needs another employee to walk me to my desk. Also, how unprofessional is it that she has 2 other employees with her (probably because she’s nervous to have her first one on one meeting). I felt humiliated because she could’ve done this privately. I tried to explain myself but she kept telling me that this was not a negotiation and this was a final decision. So she didn’t let me have a chance and was being a bitch. I couldn’t believe that my bosses wife was firing me and he wasn’t even here or didn’t care to see me on my last day at work. Every time I tried to discuss it with her she wouldn’t let me speak and said this was not up for negotiation. When I asked to see my boss his wife told me “I can’t discuss other employees with you”. I gave up. When the HR manager walked me to my desk I tried going to my e-mail to talk to my boss but I realized I had already been locked out of all the company’s network. So I couldn’t even send my coworkers goodbye messages. Honestly what an asshole company. Who’s the asshole now?

Update 2: I also want to mention that sometimes her and her husband do things besides the shoulder rubs like touching each other’s legs, hugging, and kissing at work. I know they’re married and all but in a workplace that’s just wrong.",100,79,0.82

***UPDATE 2:*** I finally heard back, about 5 days later. She told me that fiancé wants/expects me to wear it ""out of respect"". I told her I wasn't comfortable with that, and that if she was having any sort of celebration later when I wouldn't be required to wear it, I would like to be there. She told me that that really disappointed her. 

Side note, she has (seperately from this issue) decided to have the muslim ceremony in July, and have the ""official"" wedding in the fall be like any other wedding. She will be wearing traditional garb to the nikkah (I will not be in attendance), but will be wearing a wedding dress in the fall. She has since asked me to be her maid of Honor for the wedding in the fall and I will be wearing a traditional bridesmaid/MOH style dress. 
Thanks to everyone who responded! This will likely be the last update unless shit hits the fan! 
*Case closed!*

**THANKS FOR THE REPLIES EVERYONE!**
**I WILL UPDATE AT A LATER DATE**

Backstory: I was raised Catholic and went to Catholic school, however I am not a religious person. My mom is also Catholic, her fiancé has relatively recently converted to Islam (5 years or so approximately). 

My mom is getting married this fall, just after my 25th birthday. The man she is marrying is Muslim, and while my mom hasn't converted and isn't planning to.

She told me today that they are expecting me to wear a full Kaftan and hijab. My first reaction was that I didn't want to, but didn't know how to respectfully decline. 
I don't want to offend anyone, or be disrespectful. I have absolutely no problems with the religion, and tend to take a live and let live approach to life. However I am not a part of any religion and don't feel like I should be forced to wear one, anymore than someone should be forced to remove one.

In the end I will likely do what makes her happy. 
I tried to keep this short and sweet, but I would be happy to provide more details if you guys want/need them.

Thanks in advance!

1426,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend and I have been together for two years, living together for one. I am 20 and he is 21. I am home most days because I am currently only a student while he goes to work. 

I pay 100% of my fair share when it comes to rent and groceries as well as other home supplies (if you must know why, I have a college fund set aside to pay my living expenses while I’m going to school.)

My boyfriend and I have had a continuous problem with the cleaning of our household. I tend to do 100% of the cleaning but every once in a while due to stress I don’t clean for a few days which results in him coming home and being very angry at me. He says that since I am home all the time while he works that I should be doing the cleaning. 

I would understand this if we had a breadwinner/housewife situation but I am paying my fair share as well as extra when it comes to our animals and vet appointments, food when friends are over, and extra grocery runs. 

We have friends over a lot so I am not only cleaning up after the two of us, but many people and it gets draining to clean up the same exact things every single day with no help from anyone. 

I feel like even though I am home more, I shouldn’t have to do 100% of the cleaning. I’m tired and I want help. I’m not even saying he has to do 50%, I just wish he would help me clean the kitchen sometimes or put his shoes on the rack I bought him instead of right next to it. Or put his trash in the can instead of next to his chair. Or his cereal bowl in the dishwasher instead of the sink. 

I’m one person and I’m tired of cleaning up after 10+ people every day with no help from anyone. I feel exhausted. I feel like I’m dating someone who treats me like his mother when it comes to cleaning. I’m tired and I feel like it’s not fair.

1427,Not the A-hole,"I was at my child's swim lesson. The way the place is set up, there is a pool area connected to a locker/bathroom area connected to a front entry area that is part cash register/offices, part waiting gallery where you can see the pool, and part indoor play area for kids as they wait.

I'm halfway watching my kid, halfway surfing net when I hear this noise of a 4 or 5-year-old: ""Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaahhhheeeee!""

On one hand, it was a sound of glee. On the other hand, it was about the loudest, sharpest, most obnoxious, out of control sound of glee imaginable. I won't say for certain that the little girl was making the noise just to be loud or to get attention, but it was one of those spine-cringing, blood curdling noises, even if it was a preschooler having the time of her life.

I thought her parents might say something as she continued doing it, and then again as she made the noise again, but louder and longer. ""WWWWWWWWAAAAAEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAHHHEEEEEEEEEEEE!"" It was a screech, a long, nails-on-chalkboard-style screech. I couldn't believe no one was saying anything.

I waited, and again she let one out, it grew in volume, filling the whole gallery. I could feel the entire space cringing as this girl's parents did nothing. I finally had it. I stood up, walked over to the little girl, bent down on one knee, looked her straight in the eye and said, ""This is indoors. Could you please use a softer voice.""

Then I went to sit down. She stopped making the noise, but almost immediately after, her father stormed over to me, ""Why don't you let me parent my own child.""

1429,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because coworkers don't need to know about my drama. 

So 6 years ago I came out to my religious, Polish parents, although they moved to Germany before I was even born. 

I knew their reaction was probably going to be bad and my relationship with them was on the line. But they took it even worse than expected.

About the worst thing they said was that homosexuals should never have kids because they would just be abused by their parents. One day they saw me as a wonderful future father and couldn't shut up about it, next instance they act like I'm completely changed and I, their own son, would do something like that. I was speechless and really upset and they followed it up with ""If you ever have a partner or kids, don't ever think about introducing them to us."" At this point I just told them that I'll remember that one and that they'll get their will and left.

Shortly after that I met my partner, down the line we decided to have a kid and his sister agreed to step in for surrogacy. His family is incredibly accepting (duh) and a constant reminder of what I don't have, so this whole thing was the biggest emotional roller-coaster, from her offering, to child birth to now. The biological mother is an angel and with us every step of the way. 

We are the proud parents of a boy who just celebrated his first birthday. While this may seem petty, I held them to their word and didn't introduce either hubby nor grandchild to them. Partially because some months into my relationship my brother decided to drop the news in the hope they might come around, but it was just a big shitstorm all over. This was one of several occasions over the years where I repeatedly demanded an apology, they always said they have nothing to apologize for and eventually I stopped expecting it. 

For obvious reasons after birth my visits became even fewer and the excuses got worse, so I guess they knew something was off, they put my brother on the spot and he eventually caved in and told them. 

They went hysterical, called me to confront me and I just calmly told them I was executing their wishes to the dot of the i, that they are to blame for it and that they also know how to make it right again and hang up. They still can't understand how I could treat them like that by not introducing their grandchild and ever since I've been getting messages from extended family basically calling me the biggest asshole on the planet.

My partner respects my decision, his parents aren't fully in the picture but shocked and so are friends until they learn more. Also I know that I've also put my brother in a terrible spot, but he gets it.

I have had sex with a lot more partners than him. When we first started dating, this was a really big deal to him. He is pretty insecure about it to this day but it doesnt come up very often.

I am very close with a different coworker who works in a different department, and the teen always made jokes about him and I. I repeatedly told her they weren't funny, and then we got a new worker and she proceeded to tell her that I had slept with the coworker in the other department and he had taken advantage of me. This is wildly untrue, as we were just close friends. I had to go to the new worker and apologize for her saying that and explained how untrue it was. I then texted the teen later (its our works way of communicating) saying that I wanted to sit down and talk to her with our boss present. She asked what we had to talk about and I told her how she was talking about me and another coworker was very wrong. About an hour later, she ends up quitting. I honestly don't think she was going to get fired when I told my boss, but that's what she probably thought was going to happen. I feel like the asshole but things had just gone too far.",30,100,0.95
1440,Not the A-hole,"So one of my best friends is getting married in October and I am a groomsman in the wedding. This is my first time being in a wedding and the first wedding of one of my friends to attend. 

Now my best friend is an ex coworker of mine so we don’t see each other as often as we wish we could however we have a great friendship and keep in touch and hang out every now and then. 

The girlfriend has met said friend and fiancé and attended their St. Patty’s day party they hosted. She didn’t really bond with them as she had too much to drink and crutched on conversation with her friend she brought to the party. She also went to an Eric Church concert that I bought 6 tickets for and invited my friend and his fiancé. I thought this would be a great chance for them to click but in reality she really only spent the night doting on me while I was trying to have fun with my two friends and their significant others. 

Fast forward to this past weekend. She knows about the wedding and that I am a groomsman. She already assumes that she is going to the wedding as my date but asks me to confirm. I tell her rationally that I would prefer to go alone and give her several reasons that are logical in my mind:

1). She wouldn’t know anyone there and I, being in the wedding, wouldn’t be able to spend that much time with her
2). I want to give my full attention and time to my best friend on his special day

In the past when I’ve hung out with her and old friends I don’t get to see that often I get caught up in conversation with them and she feels neglected and takes it personally. 

That is why I want to attend dateless. So I can roam freely and enjoy myself while celebrating my best friend getting married without having to worry about if she is having a good time or her getting upset over me not having my full attention on her. 

I told her all this but she is still pissed. After three months of dating I feel like looking at an important event (to me) four months in advance and getting upset about my decision is irrational. 

AITA?

Edit: reason number 1. worded poorly (was not representative of what I told her) so changed “she wouldn’t know anyone there” to current version.",263,396,0.93

1442,No A-holes here,"I (16F) was a complete accident, conceived during a ONS between my birth mother and some dude she met abroad. She didn't really show until much later, and at that point she had no clue who this guy was and even less of an idea on how to find him. She decided to keep me anyways. 3 years later she met Layla, my other mom: Layla legally adopted me, and they got married as soon as it became legal in my country. Although I often call her Layla, she is absolutely my mom, and I love her just as much as the one who birthed me. 

Almost 5 months ago, my aunt bought me a 23 and me kit for my 16th birthday. I was never particularly interested in or plagued by questions about my parentage, but as I am a bit darker than my very, very Swedish mom, I thought it would be nice to know what that extra melanin was. I found out I was a quarter Mexican, which I supposed came from my dad, and honestly didn't think much about it. 

Until 3 weeks ago, when my mom was contacted by my dad via Facebook, and asked for a paternity test. I didn't want to, but I agreed if it would give him some peace of mind or whatever. But as soon as it came back positive, it just became worse.

He really wants to have a father-daughter relationship with me, and has been messaging me nonstop, practically begging. I've blocked him on social media and refuse to give him my phone number, but I know that my moms still have contact with him, and that they also support him. They think that, because I don't have any uncles, I need a father figure in my life. 

I want to clarify that I'm not remotely mad at or blame him. He couldn't have known, and my mom didn't know how to let him know. But I don't want any more parental figures in my life. I have two whom I love dearly, and I'm fine with that.

If you were already married, but someone else proposed to you, nobody would expect you to have two spouses, right? So why should I need to have 3 parents? I'm saturated, thank you. No further applications.",45,59,0.95
1443,No A-holes here,"So, I am wondering if I am overreacting. My husband says I am not, but my brother hurt, so here we go.

We lost our youngest son to SIDS. It was an awful and terrible time, it put me in a dark place. I got unexpectedly pregnant a year later and I struggled connecting with my daughter because of that, as well as taking care of our older son. Things are better now, I’ve gone to therapy and am on medication for my depression. It’s not a magic fix, but it’s been 10 years now and I can say for the most part, we’re all doing better.

My brother and his wife are pregnant with their first. They recently told me that they are having a boy and my brother told me he wants to name the baby after my late son. I found it weird for several reasons, one, being that they hadn’t had a chance to connect (we lived in different states at the time, now we’re closer) and he had only met him once and two, it’s not like an older relative or something. (My son was 4 months when he passed.) It’s my son. I also wasn’t sure that I could handle having another person with that name in the family. His name isn’t extremely common, but also not ultra-rare, so I do have to hear it in passing and it can hurt to see a child with it and think about how old he’d be, all his milestones, etc. And while that's a part of life and moving on, I don't think I could handle it on the basis we see my brother and his family.

I told my brother to please not to do that, out of respect for me, explaining why. My husband agreed. Sister-in-law actually understood and told me in private that she didn’t like the idea, but she didn’t want to hurt my brother’s feelings plus she doesn’t hate the name. She assured me they won’t be using it and that they’ll go with the middle name they had planned instead.

My brother is hurt. He says he thought it’d be a nice tribute and says he doesn't get it, saying that it's an honor. AITA here?",99,514,0.96

1445,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I was raised in a very religious home and always taught to not have sex before marriage, stay pure, etc. However, as a teenager, I was involved in a relationship with a man several years older than me and ended up losing my virginity at age 16. Since then, I have had multiple other partners and am demonstrably far from ""pure"". So lately every time I go home to visit my family, my mother questions me about my virginity, saying ""you're a virgin, right?"" and I always just say yes. She does this multiple times, every time I see her. At this point, the lie has gone on for a long time and I know she will be devastated if she finds out the truth, despite her having me out of wedlock and having been divorced multiple times. However, I am starting to feel immense guilt over lying to her. I know you don't have to tell anyone anything, especially regarding your sex life, but I'm starting to feel just horrible about lying straight to her face every time I see her. Especially because she is now bringing her friends into the discussion and forcing me to lie to them as well. So AITA for lying about this?",35,33,0.85

They buy them gifts and also have made donations to both their college funds since mine was outright paid by them.

My stepbrother is my best friend he’s the same age as me and we basically are the same guy in 2 bodies. Neither of us wanted our parents to remarry but it happened and me and Mike made the best of it. My stepsister on the other hand is an active bitch to my mom, my grandparents, but she’s especially nasty to me. It’s so bad that Mike also gets it and she calls him a traitor etc. She’s 15 btw. She scratches me if she sees me eating out of her ‘bowl’ that’s how crazy it is (it’s not her specific bowl it’s the family China wtf)

My grandparents were very tactful when they told my mom and stepdad and they said that they wanted to show Israel to my stepbro this year and then next year they’d take my stepsister but my mom knows the real reason and isn’t talking to me cuz she thinks I’m doing it to be spiteful. 

My stepsis is apparently jealous that Mike is going and cuz she’s making my mom and stepdads life hard I think they want me to relent but my grandparents have said it’s up to me.

1450,Everyone Sucks,"So context, I've been friends with these two (separately, as they do hate each other) for years. They're my closest friends in the world and we all look out for each other.

We're very open, I've helped them through many bad relationships etc.

Now, it's not exactly a friend zone type relationship. They know I'm married. My wife is gorgeous and popular, and despite these two women being just as attractive, rich, popular. They're both very intimidated by my wife.

My wife doesn't mind I'm close with them for two main reasons. My wife and I have a very special type of sexual relationship, one that we know no one else can really fulfill or satisfy easily. Am I attracted to my female friends? Yes, but I know they'll never sexually satisfy me like my wife.

Ok so here's where the asshole question comes into play.

My wife is very strong minded, and independent. And will behave this way regardless of my feelings. Recently, she's been hanging out with a very attractive guy she works with. So much so that rumours are flying that they're sleeping together. Now I know she isn't but I told her out of respect for me, please try to distance yourself from him. He is crushing on her hard and she is allowing it, enjoying his attention.

That was the root cause of our argument. She doesn't flirt back with him, but I saw her texts to him on her phone. She doesn't ever tell him to stop. Example, he'll send her photos of himself nude, to which she'll tell him he looks great. Then he'll try to push for more, but she'll change the topic or say she isn't in the mood.

I guess that's borderline acceptable.

However, I've told my two female friends and they both insisted she crossed a line, that she is cheating and that I should leave her.

I've explained that, it is inappropriate but I don't think it's cheating and she has since tried to tell him he doesn't have a shot with her. But what I'm still mad at her for is that they're still hanging out after work, at lunch. And people are talking.

So last night both female friends told me I'm being weak, not a real man by accepting her behaviour, saying I need to leave her ASAP.

Their baragement of messages like this was to much and I ended up snapping at them out of anger.

They both tell me I'm being a stupid asshole and one even said, I deserve to be cheated on because I'm too weak.

It's a difficult time, I know they're trying to look after my interest, but this is my marriage and my wife who I still love. I cant just get up and leave over something so minor.

Am I the asshole for telling them to basically STFU and stop pressuring me?

Edit: the reason I've added that I'm not friend zoned by these two women is that they both try hard sometimes to flirt with me (which i never do). One of them has tried to kiss me when drunk twice. And I've heard from a friend of the other that she said if I weren't married I'd be the perfect guy for her. I'm sometimes skeptical of their rash advice.",99,74,0.76

1452,No A-holes here," Ok so one of my best friends of like 15+ years is getting married. I am super pumped for him! His fiance is great and he deserves it. I am one of the groomsmen for the event and its at a venue about 3 hours away from me. This is where the problem starts - He told me our rental tux would cost about 115$ but he was mistaken and they cost 250ish. Then the hotel room costs like 175 a night. So now I have to pay 250+175+175+gas because I have to be there for 2 nights. That is over 600$ just to go to the wedding and I am not THAT upset about it but that 600$ has seriously set me back. In fact, it has set me back so far that I am struggling to put food on my table this month and have basically been starving myself so my kid can eat. So because he decided to have a wedding that forces all the people in the wedding party to pay 600$ just to go I unhappily decided to not get him anything. I would love to get him something but I just legit can't afford it and have honestly been close to saying I just can't go because I can't afford it.

Am I the asshole? I brought up to him when I found out the rental was 250 dollars that this was a very difficult thing for me to afford. It was already hard to afford when I thought it was just 115 but with the price more than doubling I have been put in this spot where I don't want to upset my best friend but at the same time I am kind of out of money and have a little girl I have to support. I will be honest and say that if I had planned a little better over several months this probably wouldn't have been as",50,42,0.9

I agree Even though I'm starving and have to wait till almost 7 for J t arrive. We say we're t a bar but to meet us at the local card shop, to kill Time were playing cards in the car. J misunderstand and drives to the bar, at this point it almost 7 an he's 20 minutes away, I tell S dude I'm starving and Theresa McDonald's right next to us, he says I can wait and it would be rude not too.

1454,Not the A-hole,"So, I‘m looking for some advice here because I still feel guilty about it, but other times when this situation occurs again I get furious.

I‘m F20 and already moved out from my parents home because of university. My relationship with my parents wasn‘t always the best because I did lie about some stuff when I was younger, but as I got older I learned to be more honest and our relationship is pretty good. But there is one thing that still bothers me when I‘m visiting my parents - my mom snooping around or looking through my stuff when I‘m not there. It could be a jacket, mostly it‘s my bag. She always claims that theres nothing wrong with that, she is just cleaning etc. Which pisses me off. Every time she did it I just let it go because she always said the same thing „I only want to help!“ 

The thing is though, I started smoking when I was younger and still do from time to time. They found a few lighters in my bag and angrily asked me if I smoked. I said „yes, i‘ve tried it, but I have stopped.“ Which I did eventually, but when I moved out I was smoking again. I just felt free and did it because I liked it from time to time. Now, a while back I went home to visit my parents and again...my mom was looking through my stuff. Because I just had enough of this bullshit I told her „Mom, please, can you  STOP looking through my bags? Its mine and its none of your business!“My mom looked hurt and felt really attacked, so then I started feeling bad. But I still don‘t want to apologize, even though she wants it.

1456,Not the A-hole,"A few months back I (40M) had this mole sprout up out of nowhere on the side of my noggin.  I thought I should get it checked out to make sure it’s nothing to worry about.

I’d never been to a dermatologist before, but my wife (36F) has.  She ultimately gave me her doctor as a referral, but was reluctant to do so at first.  The reason is because the doctor is female and, in her words, “incredibly hot”.  She said the doctor would do a full body exam on me since I was a first-time patient.  I guess she didn’t relish the thought of that happening too much.  I assured her everything would be fine and booked an appointment.

Turns out the doctor was indeed 10/10 hot as foretold, but also very professional.  She looked it over, confirmed it was benign, then proceeded to freeze it with nitrogen oxide.  That was it.  The whole visit took about 5 minutes and there was no full body exam.

My wife emailed me later in the day asking how it went.  Recalling her insecurity I replied, “Fine.  She told me she had never seen one that big before and I asked if we could just please focus on the mole.”  I didn’t get a reply back, so I suspected this might not have gone over too well.

1458,Not the A-hole,"This happened yesterday. I was walking with my girlfriend and two women were approaching us on the same sidewalk. There was a bottleneck in the sidewalk caused by some bushes on one side and a large tree on the other side (the walkable width of the sidewalk reduced significantly). 

As both parties are approaching this bottleneck, my girlfriend and I walk single file to allow space for the others; they do the same. Both groups walk through the bottleneck at the same time, and as I'm walking through I notice that the leading woman on the other side is not giving us any space. She's walking straight in the middle of the sidewalk and she's not giving my girlfriend, who's in front of me, enough space to walk. She's also making no attempt to be share the sidewalk as she's walking straight forward and not orientating her body to give more space.

This causes my girlfriend to walk very close to the tree -one foot on the dirt one foot on pavement- and partially crouched(to avoid the tree). When the woman was about to pass me, I positioned myself where I had just enough space to walk on the pavement and I continued walking. I gave her ample space to walk on the other end.

Since our bodies overlapped, we bumped into each other. I come from a big city, so I'm used to trying to teaching myself to allow myself enough room to walk instead of swerving and leaning to avoid other people. As a result, we hit each other pretty hard. I kept walking - my body was pretty much unphased(unfazed?). However, she absorbed my blow and her body recoiled quite a bit.

This resulted in a large argument, in which the other woman (who was the first woman's daughter) threatened to ""fuck me up"" and made some racial remarks at me. I kept trying to explain my rationale to them, but I am quite introverted and they were both very verbally aggressive.

The thing that bothers me is that they kept repeating to me that I should say ""excuse me"" and that I should ""watch where I'm going"". I did not and refused to do so. They were also very rude to my girlfriend, who had nothing to do with it. (I acknowledge that none of this is relevant to the question at hand).

My opinion is that it takes two people to make a collision like that - both not looking where they are going. I willingly hit her and she willingly hit me. I think maybe I should have apologized and handled it better, but it bothers me that they were putting all of the blame on me. I accept half of the blame. But the way I see it, she is just as much to blame as I am. If I went back in time, I would have done the same thing. I'd prefer to have a collision where I hit someone rather than conform to another person's lack of consideration. I really don't like people walking over me.

1459,Not the A-hole,"My wife has a friend who I don’t like at all and she’s starting to get sick of as well. They used to have a very codependent relationship which my wife has grown out of now but the friend still tries to cling on to. The friend has a 3 and 1 year old sons, and we have 1 and 3 year old daughters. The friend asks my wife to babysit all the time (for free) and my wife usually says no but every couple weeks her friend’s sob story will be especially sobby (usually another babysitter quit because she rarely pays them on time) and we will end up watching them for a few hours. I do not approve of how the friend parents so she is 100% never allowed to watch our kids, so we can’t like swap babysitting nights.

My wife and I split parenting and house responsibilities really well, and I do a lot of the kids bathing/changing/feeding/etc. But I do not want to do that for the friend’s kids. I don’t really want them here to begin with, and I think my wife is being taken advantage of for saying yes and that any additional stress that causes her should just motivate her to stop agreeing to watch her kids since we aren’t getting any benefit from it anyway. 

I’ll play with the kids, hold them, even feed them, but I draw the line at changing or bathing them. I just do not want to have to do that with somebody else’s kids. I feel like it isn’t my responsibility at all, and I’m not the one agreeing to watch them so my wife should be the one to do it.

She got a little frustrated at me the other night because I wouldn’t give them baths after I gave our kids baths, and I told her pretty much what I said above. I didn’t think it was my responsibility to do that kind of thing for someone else’s kids, and if she’s stressed out about it she shouldn’t keep agreeing to watch them, especially since we get nothing in return. We didn’t get in a fight over it but she gave me the disappointed look which is worse.

So, AITA here?

Edit: adding more details from questions.

We watch them usually about 4 hours, and the times I’m talking about are in the evening. She watches them sometimes while I’m at work but since I’m not there I don’t care. When I say change them I’m talking about diapers (yes the three year old wears pull ups, although he’s basically out of them now finally.) This is the main thing because it comes up pretty much every time they come over, although she’s never really pushed me over my refusal to do it (she does it so they aren’t sitting around in a dirty diaper.)

We don’t bathe then every time they come over but sometimes my wife wants to because they make a mess all over themselves with food or... well I don’t know what else motivates her to do it, other than wanting to make her friend’s night easier, even though the friend never really seems to have the same concern for her. Maybe 1 out of 4 times they are over she wants to bathe them. This last time was because they had smeared Mac and cheese all over themselves.

Also I wouldn’t let them sit in a dirty diaper if the only option was me changing them. If for some reason my wife had to step out and I was the only one there I would change it. The kids aren’t suffering at all in our house.",34,45,0.89

Yeah, we are the kind of family where mom would have a heart attack if she saw *a man doing household chores*. Whatev, that works well for us most of the time.

Yesterday, I was waiting for John (at 4:30pm) after work, as he usually picks me up then. He confirmed by text he was on his way, but time passed and he didn’t show up. At 5:15, I called him to see if he had a problem on the way, but he told me “Oh, I was feeling tired so I went straight home, just take the bus.” If he had told me ahead of time I would have taken the 5pm bus, but now I was forced to wait for the 6pm bus and got home past 7.

He said that she is a part of his life as his friend before and after she was his girlfriend (He lived with her in college and she paid for everything because he was broke from supporting his siblings). He said she does not need to be seated anywhere near the altar where I can see her but he wants her to be there.

Am I the asshole?

1464,Not the A-hole,"So for starters, I run a bar and a few weeks back I announced we’d be running a promo (this Friday) on a specific drink and that there’d be swag to give out and so on. As part of the promo I was told I would be able to get free shirts for the staff so I collected everyone’s sizes. Most of them wanted smalls and mediums but there was one request for a large and one request for a 2XL. I relayed all of our shirt sizes to the beverage rep and she told me she’d see what she could do.

Fast forward to yesterday and the beverage rep delivered the shirts, yay! Except they are all smalls and mediums with one large. So now I am left with one person without a shirt and that person is one who stays until close while most of the others are cut out early. She also has privately discussed with me that weight is a very sensitive topic for her, so I do not wish to upset her at all. Since I do not have a shirt for her I plan on telling my staff there was a change of plans and that the shirts will be given out to customers. I ran this by one of my senior staff and she threw a fit and said that life isn’t fair so I shouldn’t take away the free shirt from everyone else just because there isn’t one for one of them.

I don’t really mind them, they’re a little irritating but whatever. She is ALWAYS trying to pick at my face or arms or legs and it’s really starting to piss me off.

1468,Not the A-hole,"Boyfriend: BF

Friend: GF

So a few months back a friend of mine texted me around 1 am to ask for advice. Her boyfriend had been pressuring her about having an open relationship and she just wasn't comfortable with it so she asked me what to do. Now I also want to explore an open relationship, but my SO does not, so I'm not. I told her this, she thanked me and I assumed that would be the end of it.

Well, he kept pressuring her and eventually she told him she wasn't comfortable with him dating other women, but other men were fine (though she told me she's still uncomfortable with it regardless) so he immediately plans to go to the gay bathhouse in the city the next morning. He told her that he went in the morning and chickened out, but went back after work when it was more empty, and ended up talking with an employee for a while. When the BF left, the employee smacked his ass and gave him his number. (I don't think I believe this, the employee could get super fired for it)

A few days later, she's snooping through his texts and finds he's sexting a few people, and sent a sex tape of GF and BF to a girl. I told GF she needed to break up with him, as he didn't ask if he could send the video and that's a huge violation of privacy, plus it's been like three days and BF has already broken his promise. BF tells GF he was drunk and horny, and it won't happen again.

Shockingly, about week later, GF snoops through his phone again, he's still texting girls, and is expressly saying ""my girlfriend doesn't know about this so it's hard to get away"" along with a ton of gross shit about how GF doesn't satisfy him enough.

I've been telling her since the video that she needs to leave him, but she won't and constantly makes excuses for him. She texted me a few days after this incident and said ""so you wanna know what's going on now with BF?"" and I replied ""no, don't tell me about all of the shit he's putting you through if you don't want my opinions. I think you should leave him, nothing is going to change that."" Am I an asshole for saying that?",93,471,0.94

1470,Not the A-hole,"I took my family out to a sit-down restaurant last evening, and our waiter was terrible. He took forever getting to us and taking our drink orders, then took even longer bringing them out. The drinks he brought out were wrong, so we had to wait again. Then we waited forever to place our entree orders. 

A waitress at the table next across from us noticed us sitting at a table without even water in front of us and stopped by and repeatedly to check on us and covered for our waiter - she was the one who eventually took our entree orders. She also brought out refills for my kids twice while our server was playing on his phone next to the bar. 

The food was fine - but our server never checked in on us after bringing it out. I had to request help from passing busboys and other waiters.

The restaurant was NOT busy that night - it was only half full, and there was plenty of waitstaff - our server was not overworked, and the bar was not backed up. I know this because I repeatedly saw him sitting casually at the empty bar talking with the bartender for several minutes. 

After waiting over 10 minutes for the check, I went up to the hostess to request it again. Our waiter, who had been chatting with someone in front of the kitchen saw me and finally seemed to remember that I had asked him for the check and came over to print it out. 

I left him a $0.01 tip. 

Then I went to the table with the helpful waitress, and said “Our service was terrible, but your waitress helped us out a lot. Could you give this to her?”, they happily agreed, and I left cash for a 40% tip for her. 

My wife was horrified that I did that - she just wanted me to stiff the lazy waiter.

1471,Asshole,"This happened last week. Daughter is 14. 

She came home escorted by a local cop who said she was caught shoplifting expensive chocolates from a fancy grocery store a few blocks over. He said the owner had seen her lift a few small things over the past two years, like makeup or candy and things, and this time he finally caught her in the act. 

Thankfully owners not pressing charges but banned her and us from his store, which is whatever since I never shop there anyways. So my husband and I give her a reprimand. She cries and apologizes and I’m like good. You’ve learned your lesson. This is over. 

Well my husband REFUSES to let this go. He’s convinced there’s something wrong with her and she needs therapy. I think he’s overreacting. I shoplifted when I was a dumb teenager too although no one ever caught me. In fact everyone I grew up with stole something at one point or another. It’s part of being a teenager. It doesn’t mean you’re going to live a life of crime. It’s. Just. Being. A. Teenager. 

However my husband grew up incredibly sheltered and privileged and I’m sure in his circles no one ever nabbed a 50c lip balm from a corner store. I tell him it’s enough that we’ve grounded her, but he freaks out and thinks we need to find professional help for her “stealing habit.” I finally put my foot down and said no, she’s being a normal kid and as long as she doesn’t do it again and get herself in even more trouble she’ll be fine.

For whatever reason there are people who will shave off a lot of their speed before taking the exit. I'm not talking about coasting as they take the exit, I'm talking about shaving about 10 - 20\~ MPH off of their speed before getting on the exit ramp.

I see this action as not only annoying, but unsafe. They are causing what is usually a line of cars behind them to hit their brakes as well. Whenever I see this and are directly behind them, I honk at them. I do not lay on the horn, I do not play a drum solo on my steering wheel, it's a short double chirp. It isn't out of anger, I simply want them to recognize that they shouldn't be doing this.

Its also worth noting i had to have an emergency C section so standing/walking for long periods of time causes me a lot of pain, usually to the point where im actually doubled over in agony. 

I got on and i put the pram in the designated place for it, anyone from the UK will know what i mean when i say it was one of the older Arriva buses where theres only 2 seats to lift up and nowhere for the parent to sit except for the 2 seats that face the front of the bus right next to where the pram goes. As soon as i got on i noticed the bus was packed, some people were stood because they didnt want to sit near strangers. I got the pram sorted and looked at an old lady (60ish) sat on the only seat near the pram, i asked if she would mind moving a few seats behind her so i could keep an eye on my newborn as i didnt want to sit at the back of the bus where i couldnt see her or, god forbid, get to her quick enough incase someone tried to take her because of how packed it was. 

The woman told me i have no right to take her seat, i agreed that i dont have any right to do that but im not taking it im politely asking if she would move a few seats behind where she was right now so i could be close to my daughter. She told me if i wanted to be close to her then i should stand, i told her how i had a 35 minute journey ahead of me and explained about my c section and how standing causes me agony and she still said no. So i stood. I stood there for 35 minutes in agony, tears in my eyes trying not to flip out on this old woman because my emotions were all over the place. During the journey i heard some people whispering how rude i was to ask the old lady to move just so i could sit, saying i have no respect and my generation is filled with disrespectful people. The woman got off on the same stop as me and she walked of with no problems.

1474,No A-holes here,"Throwaway account. This one's a doozy, but I'm trying to be discreet for work reasons.

There's an intern (23m) on my (30f) team who graduates college soon and his last day is coming up. I'm not particularly good friends with him, but he's not a bad guy. He keeps to himself and is a little bit awkward socially, but he's a sweetheart. But what happened the other day in our team meeting makes me feel SO BAD for him.

Essentially, he's not being offered a full time position with our company--hey, it sucks, but it happens. Especially in smaller companies where projects may not always have the funding to keep people on after they've completed their main task. Usually you write them a good reference letter and point them to a new opportunity elsewhere if they're a decent employee. However, the way I found out he's not being hired full time was when our manager announced to the entire team he wasn't getting a full time position after he graduated...with him STANDING THERE.

Now, I don't know if they spoke prior to the meeting (I'm assuming they did), but I feel like going into a longwinded speech about how he's not getting a full time position with us and how we're letting him go in front of everyone was tactless. He could've at least let the guy announce it on his terms.

We're having a ""going away"" party for him this week and the card they got for him just says ""Good Luck"" which doesn't sit well with me after that went down. Some of my coworkers and I want to kind of go over our manager's head and get him a congratulations card for getting his degree as a hopeful note since his send-off is pretty shitty. We also took him to lunch. It's a small gesture, but I feel like it would be nice.

So, in short, WIBTA for implying their idea of sending someone off sucks and refocusing on his school accomplishment rather than him getting fired?

1477,Not the A-hole,"So basically my (19 F) dad (54 M) has this problem of only really showing affection when we’re asleep or in a rush to go somewhere. 

In particular, he feels the need to go in my mom’s room and my room to kiss my mom and I good night when HE goes to bed. Not when we go to bed, when he does. 
AKA at like 1 am or later.

I also have issues sleeping and staying asleep, so when I go to bed early, it’s in attempt to try and get enough sleep since I have such bad issues sleeping. 

But he doesn’t just do it when he’s going to bed,
when he is off to work in the morning he will come in and do it then as well, in which he woke me up and scared me so badly all right before 7 am this morning.

This also affects my mom as he’ll constantly wake her up to talk to her and try to show affection even though we’re just trying to sleep, and she has to be up early in the morning.

1480,Asshole,"Some background:
-My (27m) wife (27f) and I are married 3 years
-She's pretty territorial, private, and ""brutal"", and that's part of why I love her. No one gets a warm fuzzy feeling from her
-We bought a house a year ago and have barely interacted with any neighbors, but the neighbors in question seem to be very nice people
-We're middle class, living in a middle class neighborhood in the suburbs of a major American city

The family next door has a teenage son and a DUI dad (our theory) who doesn't drive. Someone (mom, son, or dad) backed into our 2004 Accord (the car my wife drives) and scuffed up the door panel pretty good, leaving a few dents. It doesn't look like a white trash level car now, but it's pretty noticable. Car is totally functional still. The wife left a note and got in touch, doing all the proper things. She asked if we could handle outside of insurance, which is legal and preferable to her, because her rates are 'already very high'.

If it were up to me, I would have absolutely told her not to worry about paying anything, we'd live with the damage. But that would have quite literally been world war 3 in my house, especially since she drives the damaged car and we can't switch cars. She got an estimate to repair the damage, and it's about 1000 bucks. 

My wife wants me to call and collect the money from them, and she doesn't plan on actually repairing the damage, claiming that it's up to us what we do with the money. If I don't collect, she won't collect either, because of how much she hates interacting with people. It's almost a mental block, how much she is unable to interact with neighbors. But if we don't get that money, I'll certainly be in the dog house for months.

I don't actually resent my wife for her mindset, because her ""us against the world"" mentality is something I love about her and it makes her a great wife in many circumstances. 

WITBA if I actually collected the money, going against my better judgement?

Edit: Not sure if it's against the rules, but I'd also appreciate any creative solutions :)

Edit2: because this has gotten a decent amount of attention, and it seems to be a genuine split down the middle, I figure I could add some clarification. I'm not afraid of confrontation with the neighbor, I just like to practice forgiveness and generosity. Their family, if they are like a normal family, can't exactly swing a $1,000 surprise expense. My wife and I both work and have no kids so we are not hurting for money. I'm not really in the mood to entertain insults towards my wife either, she's a great person who is extremely generous when it comes to gift-giving and donations. She just has principles that are strong and, in this one circumstance, in opposition to mine. also, everyone is saying that I'm the asshole whether they agree with me or not lol, which is kind of funny I guess.",164,303,0.91

I have met the future mother of my grandchild in a very awkward meeting one day and it’s clear to me she’s a lovely young lady. However I found out from her (not even my coward son) that he has broken all ties with her and plans only to give child support and not see this baby at all. 

I have been texting her and trying to assuage her worries but she is also understandably worried that she won’t have any support and that her baby- my first grandchild- won’t have its father. Obviously I am very much wanting to be in this child’s life also.

1483,Not the A-hole," 

In  October, my partner (M) and I attended the wedding of our friends; the  groom was my best buddy at university, and the bride was the equivalent  to M. We've drifted a bit, but are still close enough to be part of the  wedding party - groomsman and bridesmaid, respectively.

Important  to mention that we are Scottish, and the cultural norm is that weddings  are an all-day and all-night event. We've been to a dozen weddings in  the last five years, and generally they last from early afternoon until  the wee hours.

My  partner was part of a sleepover at the bride's house the night before  the wedding. I arrived at the venue at 1100. The event began at 1230 and  lasted until about 1400. Photos and drinks until 1600, then  dinner/speeches until 1800. The reception began at 1900; a band played  until 2200, after which a DJ came on. We left at 2300.

Immediately  after the wedding, both bride and groom began behaving strangely. Bride would rarely reply to M's texts, while groom would outright ignore any  contact from me.

It  came to a head yesterday: M and I received a Facebook invite to their  housewarming party on Saturday, but after checking out the event page  discovered that it had been organised for months, and that we had only  been invited at the last minute. Something about this rubbed us the  wrong way, because all of our extended friend group had been posting on  the page about the party since early May.

So M decided to text bride, saying the following:

""Hi  bride, just got the FB invite to your housewarming. I think it would be  a bit weird to attend when you and groom haven't replied to either of  us in months. If we've done something to offend you, please tell us.""

Today (24 hours later) she got a reply which said yeah, you have done  something to offend us: you left our wedding early, didn't talk to us  enough at the wedding, and didn't seem to be having a good time.

M  has not replied yet because we're looking for advice on how to proceed.  I mean yeah, we technically did leave ""early"" - but I'd still consider  12 hours to be a pretty good shift.

If  I'm being honest, neither partner or I find weddings very thrilling; we're at the age where we attend a lot of them, and they're mostly all  the same. That said, we both did have a good time - it was a nice event.  Neither of us are big drinkers though, so weren't really in the 4am  party rager mood.

Also - and this bit is quite bad but I'm including it in the interest of  full disclosure - about 15 minutes before we left, the mother of the  groom caught M and I in a big ""contagious"" simultaneous yawn and err...  gave us into trouble? for it, I guess. What can I say here? Yes, we were  fucking tired! It doesn't mean that I wasn't having a good time, it  just meant that my mind was reaching exhaustion point. So we left (of  course after saying our goodbyes, we're not savages).

So, are we the assholes here?",376,1902,0.96
1484,No A-holes here,"My husband and I made plans a few weeks ago to take our toddler on a six-hour road trip to visit some good friends in a scenic part of the country. We planned to leave on Friday morning. This is why I canceled the trip:

My husband's car is 15 years old and has 265k miles on it. (He's said repeatedly that he wants to hit 300k.) The check engine and brake lights have been on for several months. A few weeks ago, the car overheated and died while I was driving it, and he discovered a crack in the radiator that he sealed with some kind of epoxy. (He previously said that it probably just needed fluid.) Then the brakes started grinding, and after a few days he agreed to take it into the shop. In the interim, the brakes failed to catch correctly while I was driving our daughter home from daycare, and I narrowly avoided an accident. He had the brakes replaced (although previously he'd said, as with the radiator, that they only needed fluid).

Now the check engine light is flashing, and the car is shaking at speeds above 50mph. Every Google search result says this indicates a misfire that could result in catastrophic engine damage (something about the catalytic converter). My husband says he's narrowed it down to a fuel injector problem, and he wants to repair it himself today and go on the road trip tomorrow as planned. I told him that I didn't trust the car and didn't want our daughter in it, and I texted our friends last night and said we couldn't go.

Now my husband is angry--he thinks I'm being anxious for no reason because he knows cars better than I do and has done ""hundreds of hours of research"" into car repair. (He is not a mechanic, but he is very handy, and he's made successful car repairs in the past.) Our friends are disappointed because they planned a weekend of activities that they won't be able to reschedule for several months. No one seems to agree with me that driving would have been unsafe.

1486,No A-holes here,"A couple days ago I did the ballsiest thing I’ve ever done — I gave a guy my number at the gym. Things started out bland but I figured it was just weird because we didn’t know each other.

Last night, I was talking about some summer courses I’m taking and he said something that kind of rang a bell in my head.

“Well at least now you have some courses so it can be easier when you do go to college.”

I told him I’ve been in college for two years now, and asked him how old he thought I was. He said 19, I’m 20. And I do look young for my age, so I didn’t think much about it. So I asked him how old he was and he said, “17, turning 18 soon.”

Now I know that’s only two years, but I still feel a little icky, as this kid is LITERALLY STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL.

To clarify, he does not look 17, maybe in the face at best but I also look young so I figured that was why. He’s pretty built and from afar I guessed he was 20-21 and just looked young. He’s a nice guy otherwise, hasn’t said anything else alarming and seems decent enough (but it’s only been two days).

So, WIBTA if I stopped talking to him because of his age alone?

UPDATE: I don’t really know if anyone will care, but we hung out for 5 hours, just talking and getting to know each other. It was honestly so much fun. I’d lose my train of thought as soon as I’d look at him, I’d just get lost in his eyes.

I also asked him about my intentions, asked him what he thought I wanted out of this, and expressed my concerns to him. He was an absolute sweetheart about it and no, he did not expect sex because I made the first move, he was just happy I did. Thank you everyone who commented, I’m happy with my decision :)",65,125,0.89

1490,Not the A-hole,"Some background.  I’m a 19 year old girl.  I’m out of high school and i work part time at a sandwich chain.  5 years ago my family drastically downsized from our apartment to this rented house.   The house is small but with all of our huge furniture it makes it feel smaller.  

When we moved it was just me.  My mom.  My stepdad.  And my younger brother all in this 3 bedroom 1 bath.  No big deal.  Whatever.  

I drew the short end of the stick and got the smallest room in the house.  I’m not a brat so again whatever.  

A year into living here I got into a very heated argument with my stepdad.  He tried to punch my door to intimidate me??? And to show I didn’t give a fuck about his angry outburst and I also punched my door.  

I got my door taken away.  

Now I have a curtain.  A thick black curtain.  

My sister (27) didn’t move in with us.   But she moved in with her boyfriend and that (obvi) didn’t and wasn’t gonna work out so she packed her things and moved in with us after 5 years of us being here.   She decided to share room with me.  

I don’t even have a door.  So I definitely didn’t have a say in this situation.  And I was told to stop being selfish when I protested.  

So she’s in here.  And it’s like sharing a room with a toddler. She smokes in here so my room and bed and shit smell like weed.  I smoke too but she can’t even function if she doesn’t smoke.   And I have the decency towards myself to not smoke in my small bedroom.  She leaves trash in my already small space and she keeps her shit in trash bags and a broken clothes hamper.  

I asked her if she wanted space in my small closet and I also offered to get her a new hamper.  But she just wants to act like a fucking hobo.   

She’s a horrible roommate and she’s also put multiple holes in my air mattress that we share for now because she overfills it and plops down on the bed.   I’ve bought patches.  I’ve even bought new beds but she still does the same fucking shit.  Then she snores and I mean like.  She sounds like a grown man with several breathing problems.  She shakes the whole fucking bed.  

She’s been here a year.  I haven’t slept right in a year and I haven’t been comfortable in my room for a year.  I’m about to spaz.  

Am I the asshole if I do so???

1491,Not the A-hole,"Rare poster, on mobile, this is a long story so bare with me. 

I (23 F) ended up unexpectedly pregnant whenever I was 19 with someone i had only been seeing about 4 months. I realized soon after he was not the type of person i wanted to raise a child with. Very immature, expected me to do everything for him etc. So I left him soon after and that's when the verbal abuse started. 

Constant fights with him. Him accusing me of cheating. Etc. It never ended. I didnt cut contact with him only for the baby. I grew up without a father and didnt want that for my child. 

When the baby came he refused to sign the birth certificate until we got a paternity test. The verbal abuse continued. Even after the paternity test he didnt want to sign the bc. Where we were living if an unmarried couple has a child, full custody goes to the mother until the father brings her to court to petition for custody. He never went through with that. We agreed to write out and get notarized a parenting plan. He never followed through with that. 

He saw the baby MAYBE 8 times in 2 and 1/2 years. Never provided anything for the baby. To get free childcare while I was in school I had to take him to court for child support, but in my state child support doesnt equal custody so he still did not have guardianship of the baby. 

With CS I got roughly $300 a month. Which he constantly throws in my face saying ""that should more than cover half of the baby's expenses"" parents you can all laugh with me at that one. 

Anyways enough back story; I got offered by some family who are over seas to let me and my son live with them rent free while I finished up school online and I agreed. This has by far been the best decision I've ever made in my opinion. My son is thriving. He is starting to speak two languages and we have built a fabulous community of family and friends here that all love him, a support system I did not have where we were. I also have several good paying jobs and I'm able to even pay rent and save which is something I could have never done where I was previously. 

Last night the father was texting me telling me how shitty of a mother I was to do this to my child. How he would have helped if I wouldve just swallowed my pride and asked him, even though history has proven other wise. He claims I have taken something irreplaceable from my son, even though I have made and initiated all the contact between them. They only video chat whenever I ask for my son's sake and last night he informed me he thought video chatting with the baby wasn't worth it because the baby doesnt understand. 

My heart hurts for my son. I wanted so so much better for him than this situation I have put him in... so after this really really brief description, I ask you people of reddit, AITA??..

Mentioned to my roommate (27M) that we'd be doing it later today/tonight. He's catholic so I thought it'd be polite to let him know in case he doesn't want to be in the house while it's happening. He went cold and told me that this was not going to happen in his house. I offered to compromise and do it in my bedroom instead of the living room even though it'd be a bit cramped but he was not having it. Demanded that I give it to him to throw it away. I refused saying it's my property and I live here too so I can do what I want with my personal belongings. He implied that if I did it he would take ""extreme measures"".

1493,Not the A-hole,"So I was at this pretty decent sized apartment party with easily 40-50 people. It was my good friend’s apartment. He has roommates who clearly have friends but as these parties generally go, I’m assuming that there were quite a few people that didn’t even know the hosts.

Anyway party is raging, everyone is loud and dancing and drinking. I’m at the point of being pretty drunk myself, and it’s approaching midnight and I’m thinking it’s time to head home soon but as I am going to be walking home alone I figured it would be a good idea to get a sandwich in me, and as all of the local restaurants are closed at this hour, I figured ordering a sandwich to be delivered is probably my best option.

So I get a couple Sammie’s delivered and started eating them. Then this girl comes up to me and is ABSOLUTELY RAGING at me, like seriously mad telling me how incredibly rude it was to order food. She’s really laying into me... like treating me as if I had just shat on the floor.  She won’t relent for like five minutes, and I’m just eating my sandwich listening and thinking to myself... what is her problem? Meanwhile literally NO ONE is paying me any mind. They aren’t even looking at me- just drinking and partying and having fun. No one else seems to care but her.

She won’t stop so finally I’m just like... “are you hungry? Do you want half of this sandwich?”

She gets really angry and finally storms off.

1494,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway cause friends know my account. So hear me out cause it sounds bad. I signed my friend and myself up for a health educational event for some organization one of my dad’s friends told me about and went to the 1st 2 meetings for the event and they went great. It was explained to us at the initial meetings our responsibilities would include making educational posters about various medical diseases and presenting them to people at a educational event, which I was completely fine with and excited for tbh. The issues started at the 3rd meeting. When we got to the venue to scout the area and start making the posters the head of the program “handed” us off to some other dude that made us carry tables and chairs from one place to another and set up the area for a part of the convention that had nothing to do with what we were volunteering for. At that point I was already annoyed because I have back issues and they were asking me to do things that hurt my back but I said whatever and did them cause I didn’t want to cause a scene. 10 minutes after this the head of the program calls us back and says we have to each pay $150 to be allowed into the venue when the event starts. At this point I get angry and say “I will not be paying $150 to volunteer, I have never heard of anyone paying to volunteer” and he tried to make up some excuse but eventually agreed to see what he can do. At the end of this exchange the guy who was making us do the set up comes and asks us if we can stay and help do more labor for 30 min. I said no and walked out. I thought I was in the right and so did the friend I brought as he walked out with me but some people there said we were rash and rude for walking out of a volunteer event regardless of the reasons.

1497,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because very personal. Also english is not my first language, let me know if I’ve made any errors, or if you need more details.


For a little bit of background, I (24m) was born in France, but  have Belgian origins. My grandad is 100% belgian, and had my dad and a daughter. She died young, so my father was the only kid left in the family. I came along, and last year my father and his girlfriend gave birth to a beautiful 1yo girl. (my mom and dad has been separated since I was 2yo)


Now, as life goes on, I am realizing I might not want kids. I love kids, I always have. I love my sister to bits. I know I am young still, but babysitting her, being around her and watching my dad and her mom parenting her made me realize this is not how I picture my life in the future. Now that might seem selfish to a lot of you, but this is not the lifestyle I think I will choose. 


We were recently jokingly making fun of fun my sister or something, and he said something along the lines of “you’ll see what it is like one day to have a kid”. That’s when I expressed to him my feelings about not wanting kids. I told him I loved my sister and didn’t mind kids in general, but I cannot see myself raising a child, and I would rather spoil myself, my partner, my sister, as well as him when he’ll be older, than spend time and money on a child of my own.


(There is also the issue of me thinking about raising a child in our current environmental situation, with climate change and overpopulation, but that's another story).


He calmly said he was disappointed in me, saying I was being selfish. He was disappointed in the fact that I didn’t want kids, as it was my duty to do so. To him, our family name HAS to survive time. We come from a very, very old european family, with a lineage (is that the right word?) going all the way back to the 1000s or something, and our ancestors were knights (there are statues of them all around Belgium). He expected me to have kids, so we could keep our family name from disappearing. 

(My family doesn’t have money, we are not rich. No “perks” come with our last name, except knowing it hasn't changed in a thousand years)


I am torn, as I really do not want to disappoint my father. Even though I mostly stayed with my mom when I was young, we still saw each other twice a month. He was always there for me growing up, and always supported me in whatever decision I made. He is a great father, and I never would change him for the world. I have always looked up to him and definitely do not want to disappoint him. We have a great relationship, and I would never jeopardize it. 


So, AITA for possibly stopping our family’s last name’s heritage at my generation and making it disappear ?",49,29,0.81

this happend a while back but i have always wondered if I was the asshole. 

a while back I decided to finally bite the bullet and get Netflix. 
I decided to give my netflix account to my friend on one condition, I get 5$ a month (its 20$ a month where I live) to help me pay for it, she agreed. 

she has always been late with paying me, this has never been a huge issue as it's only 5$. and I'm normally paid a week later so it's never been a huge issue. 
that was until she decided to stop paying the 5$. 4 months went by without any money in my account. 

whenever I would message her she would tell me that she was broke and can't afford it. 

I then learnt that she would be using my Netflix account to host a Netflix watching party for a TV show premiere. 

I then decided (purely out of being petty) that I would sign her out of the account a few hours before the party so her party would be ruined. 

turns out I did ruin my friends party and I woke up to 20+ messages from people telling me how shit I was and that I ruined her party.

1502,Asshole,"SO. 

Everyone in this situation works in the same pub together. Before anyone says 'don’t shit where you eat' — I know this now. 

I dated this guy, let’s call him Adam, for just over six months. He broke up with me via text saying that he can’t see us being together forever. I was really into him and quite sad about it, and we’ve had to continue working together since then. 

Around two months ago it comes out that he has slept with this girl, we’ll call her Jessica, who is one of my close friends at work. I am upset, but mainly because neither Jessica or Adam told me themselves, I found out through someone totally random. We spoke at the time, they both said it was a drunken mistake and they didn’t tell me because it would never happen again. 

Then I got really sick and had to take a month off work, and when I came back there were rumours flying around that they were now dating. I became paranoid because I didn’t have any real idea what was happening, and eventually asked them both if something was going on, and they told me it was. So I had to push them both just for a bit of honesty which, if I had received in the first place, I wouldn’t have been anywhere near as upset. I just felt lied to. 

So fast forward to today. We do live comedy at our bar on a Wednesday night, in a function room, and I was the bartender working that shift tonight. Around an hour before the comedy starts Adam and Jessica walk in with Jessica’s parents, who Adam is meeting for the first time. Into an empty room with just me and the two comedians. They do not acknowledge me at all. They both knew I was working that night and could have gone anywhere else or even just given me a heads up via text. 

So this is the point in the story where I get quite irritated. Not just because of that action, but because of everything leading up to it. I felt disrespected completely. So I approached the first comedian billed for the night and said “ — so you want to hear a funny story?”

I explained everything from beginning to end and she found it outrageous and hilarious. And then she asked me “wait. Can I incorporate this into my set?” 

Long story short, I thought that was a very funny idea and told her she should do it. She called him out for the situation during her set in front of around 50 attendees and laid into him a little bit. It wasn’t completely savage, but it wasn’t nice. And it was in front of this girls parents. The audience loved it, of course, and at the time I found it hilarious. I find out later on that they were both “very, very upset” by what had happened and Jessica cried (a lot) about it. Apparently Jessica’s parents found the whole thing quite funny. Am I the asshole?

TL;DR My ex and his new girlfriend have done a series of asshole things towards me. After the final straw of these asshole movements I encouraged a comedian to roast them as he met her parents for the first time.

1506,No A-holes here,"Okay so here’s some backstory. I met my friend 10 years ago in high school. We went to the same high school and college and have spoken everyday since the day we met. After college, we parted ways and moved to different states to pursue job opportunities yet we have still maintained contact through text and call. A year after we graduated college, I was in a bad car wreck and ended up a paraplegic. I lost a lot of friends over it and felt like I lost a part of myself. It seemed like all anyone ever wanted to do was pity me for being disabled. I told my friend I was in a car wreck but that I is as fine.

Business as usual. Texting everyday and all that. I continued to not mention I was a paraplegic or in a wheelchair. It was nice having on friend that didn’t pity me or treat me differently after the accident. Having a friend I didn’t have to talk about the wreck with. I was still “me” with the friend. I had originally planned on telling her what happened but a few weeks of me wanting normalcy turned into a few months and then a few years. Then it felt like too late to ever tell her. 

Then one day, she told me she really wanted to come visit me and had a week off of work while she transferred from one department to the other and that she was flying in to see me. I panicked and acted excited but knew I couldn’t keep this from her any longer. So I told her how excited I was to see her and cleared my weekend so we could spent time together. I ended up calling back a couple of days later from guilt and poured my heart out confessing the truth. She was sobbing over the phone because of how upset and angry she was that I hadn’t told her and had been lying to her for so many years. I tried to explain my reasoning behind not telling her but that just made her more mad. She said she was hurt that I thought she’d treat me any differently and that I didn’t know her at all. 

She has been ignoring my texts and calls for a week now and I’m sure our reunion was cancelled. I’m so upset that this happened and so angry at myself for not telling her right away.

1507,Not the A-hole,"We have a 9 year old daughter that likes to play Minecraft on my computer occasionally. I have absolutely no problem with her playing or being on my computer and usually even help her play. However, my computer is also filled with very sensitive data used for work, not to mention several adult photos and videos. 

She is very responsible for her age and I trust her on my computer as she purely uses it for just Minecraft and sometimes YouTube, but I still feel more comfortable supervising her while she's on. 

About two weeks ago I started a new job and my daughter has been spending the day at home with my fiancee. Yesterday I came home and saw her playing Minecraft on my computer. This alone didn't really bother me, but then she told me that ""mommy told me your password"" and then proceeded to tell me what it is. 

I told my fiancee that I was upset that she gave away my password (which also happens to be my social security number) without asking me first if it's ok. She thought that I had absolutely no reason to be mad since she's been on my computer before and thinks I'm being an asshole. Our daughter heard our conversation and got upset with me too. I apologized and said I feel bad for upsetting her because she's completely innocent in this situation. But I still feel like it's justified for me getting upset with my fiancee because she didn't consider if my password was something I wanted our daughter to know.

Edit: Thanks everyone for all the helpful advice. I've created a separate account for her and she absolutely loves it. As for my password being my SSN, I know I'm an idiot for using that as my password believe me. But to be fair, when I first set that up as my password years ago, I was living by myself with no WiFi and it's a huge gaming desktop so the risk it being hacked or stolen was fairly low.

1508,Asshole,"My girlfriend works in a retail setting.  I have not for many years.  Neither of us has ever worked in a sit-down restaurant.  Last night I really wanted to go out to dinner rather than cook, but it was fairly late and we wouldn't have made it to the casual dining restaurant until half an hour *before* their closing time.  My girlfriend insisted that by the time we finished it would be at least forty five minutes after closing and that we were being rude to the restaurant staff who just want to go home on time.  My position was that we'd hardly be the only ones the staff was waiting on and that they have no real expectation of going home at closing time anyway - most restaurant staff are going to be on shift for an hour or two after the customers leave cleaning up and tearing down.  We had a mild fight about it and ended up ordering pizza.

1509,Not the A-hole,"I was never a “good” kid. I always got into trouble in school and this obviously put a strain on my parents. However, by the time I was about 13 I cleaned up my act. I started to actually excel in school and eventually got pretty involved with JROTC. When I was 15 I decided to take Calculus and Physics at the nearby community college the following fall, because my high school didn’t offer them. At around the same time, my mother, who had just returned from a trip to her home state of Oregon, began to talk about moving away from rural Arkansas where I grew up. 

This is where things started to get pretty complicated. Late spring of that year, my mother called me into her room and asked me if she “could leave.” At first I wasn’t sure what she was asking, but she explained her plan was to go back to Oregon to find work. Then, once she was stable, we could all join her. In the meantime, my stepfather would stay with me. However, my parents quickly found out they could not afford rent on two places at once and convinced my older sister to rent the house and take care of me. My stepfather went to go live with my step-grandparents(sgp) down the road to take care of my sick sgp.

Things went fine until winter when my sister decided to move out to her boyfriend’s. I thought that one of my parents would come back and stay in the house with me, but instead I went to my sgp and, along with my stepfather, they asked me straight up, at 16, “What are you going to do?” I had a job, but it could not cover nearly everything. I ended up staying with friends for long periods of time, eventually working up the nerve to ask “Could I live with you?” Unfortunately, a lot of people are taken aback by questions like that and I always felt awkward asking. However, eventually, I was allowed to stay on a sheep farm for $300 a month. I couldn’t afford it because my job refused to give me more hours, but it was the only option I had. I begged my parents to cover the difference and after a bit of back and forth, they agreed.

Thankfully, from there, my life began to change. In my Junior year of high school, I received a full scholarship to boarding school. At boarding school, I found a love for mathematics and have gone on to study math at one of the top private universities in America. Next year I will graduate, and I don’t want to invite my mother to graduation. I am partly still upset that even though all this shit has happened, we have never talked about it. And partly upset because nothing has changed. Recently she has been contacting me asking about graduation, but I am on the fence. I don’t think she has made a good faith effort to get to know me or be present when it mattered and only at the end of college does it seem she might care. She did not even try to come to my graduation from boarding school.

Two years in to dating (my now wife) I was introduced to her Aunts boyfriend. Since that day & everytime we've met  afterwords (barring some occasions) he would make racist remarks towards me, such as Hodji, Mohammad, wet back, beaner, ISIS; basic racist names for a brown guy who isn't black.

Being a POC all my life (38 years now) I have two responses to shit like this, either violence (& I'm not a bad ass as I have the body of wacky wavy inflatable tube man) or I use humor. Making dumb-dumbs laugh is easy and no violence is good for everyone. And because my wife's Aunt is her favorite person/relative (she calls her her '2nd Mom') in these situations I would choose the latter.

Another shitty thing is that on four separate occasions he has alluded that he could shoot me (he open carries) or would ask me how ""fast I am"" and would gesture towards his gun. I grew up in a very abusive household (that is a whole other thread itself) and when presented w/ violence or threats I would confront it head-on. In situations like this I would say ""Try it & see what the fuck happens"" (or something along those lines) and he would of course always back down.

Now here we are 8 years later. He married my wifes Aunt and my wife & I have 6 month old. About a month or two before the kid was a born, we saw each other and he made some shitty racist remark and I snapped. I looked him and screamed at him that I was sick of this racist shit and after several uncomfortable seconds of us staring in silence I walked off. I stopped going to my in-law family functions to avoid him. Outta sight, outta mind. 

But now that we have a kid it gets complicated.This Christmas is going to be at their house. I told my wife that I would sooner leave her then allow my child to be around him. I told her if she wants to go that's her prerogative, but we arn't going. And if she really wants to take him that's fine, but I will pack up and file for divorce.

I feel like an asshole. Giving ultimatums to people you love is the ultimate shit head move, but I don't know what else to do. AITA?


*EDIT* Thank you kind internet strangers for your time and responses. I feel a little better, but my wife and I have some work ahead of us (counseling).

*EDIT 2* Thank you again Internet people. I did a lot of reading this morning through this thread. I really appreciate you taking your time in throwing in your two cents. On a couple of things that I left out:

-Wife hates the racism that she has seen from the Uncle. She has spoken up about it. I do believe that because my response to it has been to 'joke it off' made it seem like a not a big deal. Which I truly believe is my fault for not communicating this earlier. Her response to ""Why are you okay with having our kid around him?"" was that we have both been raised in racist families and that we both came out level headed, why wouldn't our child? Which I understand to a degree. However being a first time dad & I have no idea what I'm doing, I just know I want to do it differently than I was raised. 

-The Wife has only seen one interaction where I was threatened with a gun. Please keep in mind he has never pulled it out, it was only implied. She was beyond upset at that. However I believe it was brushed off as ""well he was drunk and he's all talk"". Which, yes, yes he is.  My issue is that we now have a child in this. If he wants to have a dick measuring contest with me, fine get the ruler. But now there's a tiny person in this equation and that's a game I don't want to play. Even if it is just 'talk'.

-I don't want to leave her at all. I love this woman and cant imagine a life with out her. Since my little outburst I have been freaking out. I've broken out in what the Doctor calls a stress rash and I have had a frontal migraine for the past three days. My body is literally punishing me for my dumb mouth. However if we do go down this route, I do believe we would share custody. She is not an vindictive person.

-I would like the clarify the ultimatum I made. It was that if she would bring our child to their house I would have no choice but to leave. She can take the child anywhere, but not there. I am not forbidding the child to not see everyone in her family. There would even still be interaction with the Aunt and Uncle (she has a huge family, who all like to hang out) at other family remembers homes, but I believe it would be more controlled in those environments. I would *never* tell her who she can or cannot see, I would have no right to. When it comes to this Christmas, I told her she can go and when people ask where I or our child is all she would have to respond with was ""Well there's been too many racist remarks and threats and we don't want our kid around that shit.""

1511,Not the A-hole,"I have been having a hard time seeing the bright side lately, so to help I started to write things I was thankful for every morning on my mirror. (My boyfriend and I have our own bathroom sinks.) I wanted the message to be just for me, just something to help me start the day positive and end the day on a happier note.

My boyfriend though is not thrilled. He doesnt mind me writing on the mirror, but its just a string of letters that makes no sense without a cypher. He treats it like I'm keeping a secret from him and seems to be really upset that I'm changing the letters just to keep him out of it. Like I'm specifically targeting him since he is the only other person that lives in the house.

To me is just feels like I'm exposing my vulnerability and what if the thing that I feel grateful for that day is something thats embarrassing for me? Truthfully just him reading any of them is a little embarrassing and i think I would stop doing it if I had to write it in plain English.

I was an alcoholic when Jack was growing up and when he was eight, I had an affair with another woman and had another son “Daren”. Me and Jack’s mom got a divorce. 

This kind of forced me to sober up and I’ve been sober 11 years now. I moved about six hours away to raise Daren and I married Daren’s mother. 

Me and Jack’s mom aren’t on the best of terms and I saw Jack a few times a year, although I would always send him money. 

I was up to visit Jack’s uncle (we’ve always been buddies) and he asked me how Jack’s boyfriend was doing. I asked him what he meant and he just repeated that he saw some pictures of Jack and his boyfriend and he was wondering how they were doing. 

I mumbled some excuse that they were fine and left shortly after. As soon as I got in my car I called Jack. I told him what his uncle told me and I was pretty upset that he thought he couldn’t confide in me. 

Jack started to cry and basically started ranting about how I “abandoned” him and his Mom when he was young and how I’ve “always preferred Daren” to him and that’s why he didn’t tell me because he feels like he doesn’t matter to me. 

I tried to explain myself and I said that I understand that I’ve been a shitty father sometimes but I love him and I don’t care that he’s gay. 

He told me that he didn’t know if he was ever going to tell me because I’m an “asshole” and I have no right to get upset about not knowing something about him after I abandoned him so long ago. He then hung up on me.

1514,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway.  I’m a female turning 30 this year, and I’m also an attorney. Part of my job is to consult with other attorneys in my office and political offices to help guide policy decision making. I’m the youngest person  part of this task group but I do the lion’s share of the work. 

All of the women on the task group manage to call me by my name, as do the men who are closer to my age. But most of the task force is comprised of middle-aged men, and not a single one of them  uses my name and instead they all call me “young lady.” And it’s not that they forget my name, I have introduced myself every time we meet as a hint to stop using “young lady” and my email signature uses my name. This has been going on for months. Today, I finally had enough of the “young lady” stuff.

I was introduced to a very prominent local leader today as “the young lady who works hard for us,” and then I somewhat aggressively introduced myself with my name. I spent the rest of the meeting being upset and I stayed pretty quiet. I guess the men noticed and asked me what was wrong after the meeting. I was very upfront and told them how I don’t like it when they call me “young lady,” how it makes me feel disrespected, and that I want to be called my name. They accused me of being too sensitive, and I got rather heated and said I shouldn’t have to ask to be called by my actual name in a professional setting. They told me to watch how I talk to my superiors because “we have been practicing law longer than you’ve been alive” and have subsequently disinvited me to the rest of the meetings with the local leader.

1515,Not the A-hole,"In October my partner (2 years, both in college) sat me down and told me that they saw a future with me, but didn't want to give up experiences while they were young and wanted to have an open relationship. I wasn't happy with it. However, they were persistent and assured me they'd get it out of their system so I agreed. We set these ground rules:

\- Always use protection

\- No mutual friends

\- Change your sheets and clean your room after anything

\- Any information was fair game if the other person directly asked, but otherwise no obligation to share

We didn't set any timeline for closing the relationship.

We agreed to see each other as normal during the week, and to give each other space on Fridays/Saturdays. My SO is involved in greek life and they go out every weekend, and it isn't my thing, so we were already sort of doing this.

I tutor young kids for extra cash. On Fridays I spend a couple of hours with a kid and help them with their reading. The parent is late 20s and has split custody with their ex. I come over between 5:00 and 7:00, and the parent's ex comes to pick them up for the weekend right at 7:00. That week after the kid left and I was packing up, the parent asked me if I wanted to stick around for dinner. As you might guess, they fed me dinner and proceeded to put the moves on me and we had sex.

This became a regular thing and would also spill over into Saturday mornings, and after a while, I'd come back Saturday nights after they were back from work. They ""don't have time for dating"" and don't mind my relationship status. It's strictly sex and small talk.

I knew my SO was hooking up on weekends (expected this) because a friend of mine in told me about something they saw thinking my SO was cheating. I never asked my partner about anything directly, and they never asked me anything. It didn't really impact our relationship at all during the week.

We both stuck around for the first summer session this year. This past weekend my SO said they wanted to close the relationship (I suspect because there aren't any parties to go to). I informed SO that I had a weekend arrangement that I didn't want to give up. SO asked for specifics and had an absolute **meltdown** when I told them about my regular hookup.

I asked SO what the big deal was and they said: ""\[Greek life friends\] told me that you weren't hookup material and since you didn't even like to go out that it was a safe bet I would be the only one hooking up.""

I told SO that they were naive, and stupid for not ever asking me if I was doing anything. I said that I wasn't interested in closing the relationship just because their side of it had temporarily dried up. SO huffed and puffed about it for a while, but ultimately relented when I didn't budge. Our sex life has dwindled, but that doesn't particularly bother me. I am going to end it soon, but I honestly feel like it's necessary to assert myself and make a point.

AITA?

Edit: Thanks for the judgements. I lurk this sub a lot and I notice gender bias that goes both ways based on the flavor of the day, so I omitted gender purposefully. It's been interesting watching people guess, but I am male and my SO is female. Her friends basically told her that I was a square and wasn't the type to be able to have casual sex even if I wanted it. They were wrong obviously. After I graduated high school I was a megavirgin, and to people who don't know me I still give off that vibe. The truth is that that summer I went on a trip to a certain European country, read a book on the flight over that changed my perspective a lot of things, and over the course of that trip had my first ""everythings."" Have had 0 trouble with women since. My girlfriend knows all of this, but I guess she heard what she wanted to hear from her friends.

1518,Not the A-hole,"Let me preface this by saying that I fucking adore our pets. There’s very little I wouldn’t do for them. 

So my girlfriend (25) and I (f, 24) live together. She has a dog and I have two cats. I don’t let them sleep in the room with us. My girlfriend is really upset about it. She says “she thinks they’re like family and they deserve to sleep wherever they want.” 

Here are my issues. 

1) her dog (I’ll call him C) has and will chew up my things. My blankets, my pillows, my socks. If he’s in the room overnight, my things get destroyed and she hasn’t offered to replace them. I get that it’s a dog and that’s what dogs do, but I would like to avoid it if I could. 

2) I don’t know what it is, but C’s fur will get stuck in my skin and give me rashes. I can also feel it when I’m laying in bed at night. It keeps me up because I’m so itchy and uncomfortable. For some reason, C likes to lay EXCLUSIVELY on my side of the bed, on my comforter and pillow. Even if I cover them up with hers, he will paw hers out of the way to lay on mine. 

3) letting the cats in at night is all cute and stuff for the first couple of hours. But around 3 AM, they start being, you know, cats. They get into whatever they can, start messing with each other, knock things over, whatever there is to do that can be annoying, they do it. This is all fine for my girlfriend, who could sleep through a jet plane crash landing into our house. I, on the other hand, have a really hard time sleeping and I’m always the one that gets up and kicks them out. I get up several hours earlier than she does, and it annoys me that it interrupts my sleep every single time. 

She’s decided that she’s going to start sleeping in the spare bedroom because (I quote) that I refuse to agree to “any compromise.” She’s never offered a compromise, for one. Two, I don’t appreciate that she seems to think that I love the animals less because I won’t let them into the room?  Occasionally the younger cat (11 months, so technically still a kitten), will cry outside the door because he wants to come in. The only reason he does that is because he knows she’ll cave and let him in. All three of them have multiple beds for them around the house and countless soft, warm, cozy places to sleep. It’s not like I’m making them sleep on cold concrete. 

I’m upset because it hurts my feelings that she would rather sleep with the cat and C over me. I’m also upset because she doesn’t seem to care about the reasons I didn’t let them in, and was very willing to let them in anyways and make my nights hell. I’m upset for the THIRD time (I know, shocker) that she implied in any way that I’m not a good pet owner because I don’t let them in the room. 

She thinks I’m overreacting and I’m an asshole to both 1) our pets for not letting them in and 2) her because she’s upset that the pets can’t come in and I’ve never “made any compromises.”

We then go upstairs and the bedroom doors have cracks down the door frames like someone tried to force themselves into the bedrooms while the doors were locked. They've been unable to get rid of the smell after cleaning etc.

""meAndDearWife, last time you were at sisters place, you said it would be nice to go on a vacation together, that's why I and your sister booked these two cottages for a week. You can come too, but there's one catch: you'll have to share a roof with me and your dad.""

1524,Not the A-hole,"So I (18F) have a friend (20M) who was recently hospitalized for depression and released after a couple days. I saw him shortly after he was out and he was still the same person I knew before- super chill, etc. We share a music taste so I invited him to come to a concert with me and another mutual friend and probably end up meeting some of my other friends there. He agrees and everything seems like a plan. I buy all the tickets with the expectation that everyone will pay me back whenever. 

Fast foreword a few days to the next time I see him, and he is a COMPLETELY different person. Nails painted black (not that there is anything wrong with that, just out of character), insanely impulsive, rambling, super extroverted with strangers and just totally weird. He is in a full blown state of mania, delusional, lacking all social/self awareness and making changes to the way he dresses, and other antics not worth getting into. To put it bluntly; literally acting like a crazy person (Talking with his step brother confirmed that the family suspects this behavior is due to the new antidepressants).

To be honest, this freaks me out and makes me super uncomfortable and unsure on how to deal with him. The mutual friend going to the concert with us hung out with him the other day and was also incredibly concerned and freaked out. We don’t plan to shut him out of our lives at all, but are hesitant to be solely responsible for him in public while he is in that state and maybe even a little second hand embarrassment and we want to enjoy ourselves too. 

He is so all over the place that I’m not even sure he would notice if he missed the concert... he also hasn’t payed me for the ticket or anything yet. 

I assume this is part of adjusting to his meds/they will be adjusted eventually and I totally understand that people don’t typically stay in this state forever, however WIBTA if (some how), assuming he is still acting abnormal, I uninvite him, whether it be directly or a with a white lie, from coming with us?

1526,Not the A-hole,"Little background information: Due to chemical processing, my hair started thinning years ago. I'm very self-conscience about it at this point. Any hairstyle or haircut I get really doesn't look good. It might not look BAD, but it definitely isn't great. It's got to the point I don't even want to go out because of my hair. I don't look in mirrors. 

&#x200B;

For a job interview, I bought a wig, and it was like seeing the old me for the first time in forever. I've never felt so good about myself in my life. I could stand looking at myself in the mirror. I've since bought a wig I love that is exactly how I've always wanted my hair.

&#x200B;

Now, here's where I'm at now. I live in southeast Georgia. It's hotter than a crackhead's crack pipe. I mean, you walk outside and just want to turn back around and go in screeching, ""NOPE."" So, if you consider the hair that I DO have, a wig cap (stocking cap basically), and a wig with actual HAIR... it gets hot as HELL. Scalp sweat SUCKS.

&#x200B;

So, I've been thinking about shaving my head. My husband (who enjoys seeing me in wigs) does not think I should do so. I was talking to him yesterday and mentioned it. He said no basically. Now, I'm really not ASKING his permission by any means, but I mean he has to look at me so I'll ask. There may be times I don't have a wig on sure. But, the point is I want to wear it all the time. Since he enjoys seeing me in wigs, I specifically went out and picked out a color I knew he loved (he loves me with red hair).

&#x200B;

When we were laying down in bed, I mentioned it again, and he said something along the lines of, ""I won't be sleeping with you then."" I reminded him of his receding hairline and two could play that game. Then asked him how it made him feel. He didn't get mad, but he didn't say anything else. But the issue wasn't resolved because I was like ""Fuck it. I'm rolling over and playing on my phone."" I was super tired lol. It didn't make me mad, though. It takes a lot to make me head, but I still want to do it ... 

&#x200B;

Also, since I still have hair, I put it into a small tiny ponytail/bun thing, and stuff it inside the wig which gives it a bump in the back... and actually makes it tighter on my head. And I'm afraid people can notice the bump, which defeats the purpose of wearing the wig to feel confident about myself.

&#x200B;

The only cons to it I can think of are my husband not liking it.

I'm really tired of worrying about what others think and doing what they think is best. I don't want to feel like I have to ask permission to do something with my hair/my body, but I understand it's an extreme move. And I get it. You don't want to sleep next to me with a shaved head and look at it. I respect that totally. But, also you married ME... good hair, bad hair, shaved head, and all. You're supposed to love me for me.

To which I answered: ""You should also thank Hitler since without him my Jewish grandparents would have never met.""

&#x200B;

My mom, who is the daughter of said holocaust survivors, didn't appreciate my comment and called me an Idiot. 

&#x200B;

My mom's comment didn't come out of nowhere. For the last two weeks my family, wife and 2 young sons, have been road tripping with my parents all over the US. They came to visit us from a different country. At some point last week my 9 yo had a meltdown in a restaurant that required me to take him outside where he could play out his tantrum. Being familiar with my son, I know there is no reasoning with him when he is that wound up and that he just needed to calm down on his own terms. My dad felt it was necessary to comment that his kids (aka me and my siblings) would never behave that way because of the way he raised us, implying that I'm parenting wrong.

&#x200B;

That opened up Pandora's box which I was trying very hard, for the better part of the trip, to keep shut.

&#x200B;

My dad was an awful father. He constantly threatened us with physical violence and some times he would hit us over the stupidest shit. He was extremely controlling and made us feel like we can't do anything without him.  In addition to all that, he was, and still is at times,  verbally abusive to my mother. I still vividly remember him smashing a plate of food on the floor that my mom served him because he was upset about what he was being served. He is correct that I would never act like my 9 yo. Because I was afraid of him. But at the same time, I hated my dad most of my childhood. I didn't love my dad and still struggle with it some days. I love my kids and the relationship we have which is built upon mutual respect.

&#x200B;

In my mind, my mom implying that my dad is not so bad because he made me is the same as saying that we should thank Hitler since I would never have existed without his actions.

&#x200B;

Am I an asshole?

EDIT: I’m going to try to further explain the “joke” though I doubt it will change any minds.

1529,Not the A-hole,"so, i’m currently 18 and have an older sister who’s 4 years older than me. around the time i started transitioning into high school, she had found out that she was pregnant. with her boyfriend not being in the picture at the time, i was left as one of the primary people to take care of her child. of course, i was ecstatic, and had enthusiastically helped babysit my niece whenever needed. this usually ate up most of my time, and by the time she got a job, i was watching my niece more than 40 hours a week with no pay.

me having to watch her for the majority of my week got into the way of my academics, and it was really difficult to try to get a job myself or keep up with any extracurriculars. this continued throughout the entirety of my high school career, with me only starting to get paid around $1 an hour for the labor i did throughout the week.

this wouldn’t necessarily be an issue in itself if i was treated okay, especially since i know how expensive child care is. the issue is that she’s grown to feel entitled to my help. she often doesn’t take care of my nieces basic necessities, and will routinely “forget” to feed or bathe her. because of this, i have to constantly step in as a parent and take care of my nieces needs, along with doing recreational activities (painting, playing music, reading) with her.

fast forward to now, i’m about to be a sophomore in college and just got my first job. i was excited initially at the thought of this, but soon became really concerned for my nieces well being. my nieces father is slowly coming back into the picture, which made me more hopeful for her quality of care. unfortunately, my sister instead spends most of her time hanging out with him, not paying too much attention to my niece. even now, it isn’t rare for her not to feed or bathe my niece, and her “forgetting” to feed her breakfast this morning was my last straw. 

i angrily confronted her, claiming that she needs to own up to her responsibilities and become a better parent. this led her to jump on me and attack me, claiming that “i don’t have the right to talk to her like that”. my mom and her boyfriend separated us, and now my face is scratched up and we’re not on good terms. my mom says that way i approached it wasn’t okay, and that i should’ve went about it in a different way. i completely disagree due to my frustration, but i really do want to know if i actually was in the wrong.",42,160,0.97
1530,Not the A-hole,"Okay so I'll keep it as brief as possible...

Around a week ago I(24m) made the decision to shave off my beard. Not all of it though. I went from full beard to light stubble, haven't been clean shaven in years. My girlfriend(23f) has done NOTHING but complain since I did this, telling me how much it bothers her and how she's not nearly as attracted to me. I'm the first to admit I suffer from a bad case of baby face without it, which Is why I dont go fully clean. She tells me my face looks awkward without it and how I shouldn't do it again, she even commented how she's glad she's leaving the country for a few weeks and how that will give me time to grow it back for her coming home.

Anyway, yesterday I snapped when she brought it up for the 3rd time that day. I asked if she wanted to see a movie, she said 'great, I wont need to see your baby face that way!'. I snapped and told her that she'd been slowly putting on weight lately and I wasnt as attracted to her either, but I love her so I dont go on and on about it constantly.  Naturally she started crying, stormed out of my house and hasn't spoken to me since. 

Now while I do think I was an asshole for losing my temper, what I'm asking is was I the asshole for going after her insecurity and essentially calling her fat after she was complaining to me for days?

Sidenote: I had talked to her about this first. I told her that it sucked listening to her talk about how she wasnt as attracted to me, and she simply told me she was just being honest and I cant tell her not to express her opinions.

1532,Everyone Sucks,"So my fiance and I have been together for about 8 years, have two kids and have literally just bought a house - like haven't even moved in yet. We're going to the bank today to work out the structure of the mortgage, and still need to organise insurance and budgets and all that.

Here's the thing: neither of us is particularly good at budgeting. We're on a fairly standard pay packet as a family, though I earn about half again what she does. While I've been working and saving for a house for more than the time we've been together, she's worked on and off because of the children and the cost of childcare, and so never put any savings together. We just bought the house with literally my life savings as a deposit. I'm okay with that because we've always had joint accounts and my money's always been our money, but now my fiance has started working again (since Feb), she's been telling me all these things she wants to do or own, including not one but two horses, three chickens plus a chicken run and organic vegetable garden, a new kitchen, courses that won't have a financial benefit but will cost money to do and leave her with like no time for sleep, yadda yadda yadda. 

My problem is that not only are we buying this house and about to start paying off a mortgage, we're also getting married in April next year and then the year after that we're going to a buddy's wedding on the other side of the planet, which we already know is gonna be mega costly. So expendable income ain't exactly a thing right now. But my wife to be keeps telling me all these things she wants, like the moment we get into our new house, and I keep having  to tell her to be reasonable about time frames.

Last night I lost the plot over it because she was telling me about the latest course she wants to take up half the back yard to do, and all I'm hearing is the sound of money disappearing for no gain other than her own satisfaction. I basically told her to pull her head in and stop spending all our money, because while she thinks her pay check is covering it all, I cover the bulk of the costs with my pay check and I get to do nothing I want because I'm conscious of the cost. I told her I think we should be paying 50/50 for the house and the utilities, which she thinks is unfair because I earn more. She went off to work last night and has been giving me the cold shoulder since. 

AITA for expecting my partner and mother of my children to pay her fair share before she spends her income on hobbies?",44,31,0.81
1533,Not the A-hole,"My 19 year old stepson pleaded guilty to a violent crime and will be going to prison for a very long time, perhaps the rest of his life. I don't want to go into the details of his crime, but he admitted to doing it and is ready to receive his punishment. There were some mitigating factors, but that does not really matter. He did the crime and he pleaded guilty and he won't be leaving prison anytime soon.

When his father and I married, I was much younger than he was and I was naive about the situation. Stepson was 14 and his mom and dad fought over the joint custody of him. His dad is the type of man who thinks that being a parent is more about owning a child than actually loving them, so he would ignore his son as much as possible and would only pay attention when stepson was in trouble. His mom is a functioning alcoholic. Both his parents have high paid jobs that they focused on more than their son.

Stepson was basically allowed to do whatever he wanted and was often in trouble. Drugs, fighting, stealing, he was arrested more than once as a teen. I was pretty much the only one he would listen to and it caused some problems in my relationship with his father. His father and I divorced partly because I could not handle the drama and stress in that relationship. Before I left, I told stepson that if he ever needed me, I would be there for him.

Fast forward a few years and I got a phone call from stepson in jail, saying that he did something bad and needed help. He had tried calling his mom and dad, but they both hung up the phone on him. When I tried calling his dad, he never answered the phone and ignored my calls. I didn't want to abandon stepson, so I helped him get a lawyer and stood by his side during the legal process. Stepson knows he messed up and all he can do now is try to become a better person. 

His father found out that I had helped him and ever since, he has been calling (I don't answer) and texting me about it. He thinks that his son needs to face the consequences of his actions alone and that by helping him, I am enabling him and that he should be left to rot alone in prison. His mom left me a vicious voicemail and read me the Riot Act about being involved and that it wasn't my place to do anything in stepson's life. 

I asked my boyfriend about it and he thinks I am involving myself in a situation where I don't belong and that stepson deserves to be cut off from everyone. That if his hypothetical stepson had committed that crime, he would be so disgusted that he doesn't know how I can look past it to visit him in prison. And I know that what stepson did was awful, but I don't think anything is black and white in this world. He committed a crime, but it does the world no good to throw him away and not give him any chance of redemption.

Redditors, how do you judge this situation? Am I being the asshole (or a fool) for supporting my stepson? Or am I doing the right thing?",29,54,0.94

1535,Not the A-hole,"Might crosspost this to r/nicegirls if it turns out that I'm NTA

Also I'm on mobile and not a native speaker so if there are any formating issues or grammar mistakes I'm terribly sorry. 

But first a little bit of ""pre-information"": My sister(16 F) is bisexual and I'm(19 M) not really sure yet but most of my friends just call me asexual (important later) because I've never had any sexual attraction to anybody I've met/seen. 

Anyway let's begin with the story: This happened just about an hour ago. My sister came into my room to tell me about her day. We start with some pretty casual stuff (grades, tests etc.) but then comes the big bad thing.

My sister just tells me that she is beginning to ""question"" the bisexuality of one of her female classmates. Apparently she felt some real chemistry between her and mentioned classmate and they were kind of playfully flirting with each other.

But after ~ 3-4 weeks of ""flirting"" her classmate went on to try her luck with some of the boys of her class and my sister just told me that she thinks that her classmate isn't a real bisexual because she's ""just chasing after boys"".

I was of course shocked by what I had just heard. Especially because my sister is part of the LGBTQ+ community. I tried to explain to her that bisexuals don't need to prove their sexual orientation. (Just like any other sexual orientation) 

Our argument went forth and back for a little bit and came to it's climax when she told me that she should have known that I ""couldn't understand"" her because I've never even experienced ""a thing like that"". To which I responded that she is acting irrational and is just pissed because she got ""rejected"" (Even though you can hardly even call it rejection, because all it was based on was some ""playful flirting"" and nothing more).

She just started to hurl insults at me (you're an asshole, you're family, you should back me up etc. etc.) and then in the heat of the moment I just called her a ""Nice-Girl"" which brought forth more insults.

At first I was sorry for calling her a Nice-Girl but the longer I think about it, the more justified I feel. But since I could be completely biased I'm asking you dear people of the Reddit world.

1537,Not the A-hole,"Okay, so this may sound silly, but I'm starting to have alot of anxiety about excluding some people through my thoughtlessness.

I go to my local Zen Center alot, and I'm the kitchen manager when we have special events. I frequently (think 3-6x per month) bring homemade baked goods like artisan bread and cakes and such. 

Usually I bake an extra vegan item so that the 3-6 vegans who come to the center have something delicious too. 

Today I forgot... I baked this elaborate cremé patisserie vanilla cake which is filled with eggs and milk and butter, but no vegan option. I don't have time to bake anything else, so if I am TA I'll just not bring the cake so nobody feels left out. It's not a special event, just a regular Wednesday meditation night, but I still feel guilty. 

So, am I an asshole for forgetting my vegan friends?


Edit: Well I tried to go buy some store-bought vegan treats but the bakery was empty. Not closed, just nobody there.

1542,Not enough info,"I co-parent with my ex and we split time 50/50 with my 20 month old son. He is developing along fine, hitting all the mile stones with speech, motor skills, etc. He's a pretty cool guy. 

When my son hit the one year mark my ex agreed to stop nursing. She stopped for about two months and then resumed after he had been fully weaned. She isn't producing milk and it's just for comfort or to delay his rising from bed in the am.

I've voiced my opinion that this is bad. I told her she's doing it for the wrong reason and it's a development and health concern. In my opinion, it is a crutch and it's not serving a purpose beyond comfort. I think it could delay his development and he never follows a sleep schedule for her. At my house, which is a nursing free zone, he sleeps fine and doesn't give me trouble. At worst, she's definitely not on the breastfeeding diet and medicine, alcohol, etc. could somehow hurt him, even though she isn't producing milk like she was when this was a full time thing. 

Her response to my gripe is that it's natural and I shouldn't shame her. Also, she says that he really wants to nurse and is aggressive about it. He's at the point where he can effectively ask for it.

At work, we have a cafeteria. On Wednesday’s they sell nachos. It’s like $5.50 for a container of chips, nacho cheese, beef or chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, shredded cheese, salsa and sour cream.

A few weeks ago I got some and the chips got disgusting because the cheese sauce made them super soggy. I’m This week, I asked the lady serving them if she could put the cheese in a separate container so my chips didn’t get gross. She did, and I went up to pay.

The lady at the register wanted to charge me $5.50 for my nachos plus $1.50 for a side item. I showed her what it was and explained why I wanted it separated. She said that if the cheese was on the chips it would be included, but not on the side. I offered to pay for the plastic container (they charge like .15 for an empty container), and she wouldn’t take it.

I initially said I thought that was pretty ridiculous and didn’t want to purchase them, but she informed me that the food would be trashed and I felt bad. So I ended up paying $7.00 for some shitty nachos and spite eating them.

Was I the asshole to be pissed about the extra charge? I was fairly polite, just told her that I thought the rule was ridiculous and didn’t make sense.

1544,Not the A-hole,"So long story short, my boss had to promote one person on our team to be assistent supervisor for days that the boss is absent. The choice was between me and one of my newer coworkers. The job eventually went to the other person. Of course, I really wanted this promotion, but I totally understand why they went for the other person and they are doing a good job.

Shortly after the announcement of the new assistent supervisor, I was left alone with two entirely new coworkers for a whole day and I was expected to show them everything and teach them how to do their jobs. No supervisors, just me being the only experienced employee for the whole day with two new guys. After our shift ended, the two supervisors (meaning my boss and the assistent supervisor) both showed up for an extra shift to film a promotion video. This annoyed me. A lot.

So I went and told my boss that now that there is an assistant supervisor, I did not feel comfortable being at work for the whole day with two new guys. Especially since both supervisors were available that evening. In my opion, one of them should have taken the day shift to supervise and help the new guys get set up, and not me. I feel like it's their job as supervisors to do so. I also told him that for this one time it was fine, but I don't want something like that to happen again.

Now, my boss said to the assistent supervisor that he thinks I'm being difficult about this, and he thinks it's due to me not getting that promotion. So am I being an asshole about this?

1546,Not the A-hole,"Last year my younger brother (20) stole 3k in cash from me as well as lots of random trinkets and priceless belongings. I caught him red handed and confronted him, which he denied for a while until finally admitting to (some) of it. 

Note that earlier in the year i lent him $400 which he never repaid. I got him 3 jobs (on my good word) all of which he lost. Then he crashed his car, parents bought him a nice new civic and he crashed that. When he crashed the civic I went to the accident, took the weed out of his car so he didn’t get a DWI and cleaned the broken glass off our neighbors driveway for them. 

Instead of berating after catching him stealing I calmly explained how everyone makes mistakes and this doesn’t define him, gave him an opportunity to help me move furniture and do some work I needed a hand with and took the opportunity to talk about life with him. I gave him the chance to confess to our dad on his own instead of having me tell him, which he thanked me for (of course I still gave my dad a heads up). 

Side not, when I told my dad that he stole from me and that I highly suspect he may have a drug problem, probably Xanax, my dad responded by telling me he doesn’t even leave his wallet out anymore because money keeps going missing. He broke down crying and told me he would move out from his wife and son and get a place with me if I needed help (I didn’t need that but the gesture showed me just how cornered he was feeling).

My brother needed to get our step mom a birthday gift the same day I confronted him and my dumb ass lent him $30 to buy her a gift which he assured he would repay me. Of course he didn’t.

Fast forward a few days... Instead of confessing to our dad he twisted the story to my step mom instead and completely omitted his worst offenses. 

I snapped when she confronted me and made it very clear that he is a lying manipulative brat that I highly suspect of being a drug addict. 

Next time I saw him I blew up and told him he was dead to me. It’s been nearly a year since that and the only thing I’ve said to him was “happy birthday stay safe” in a text to which I got no reply, I haven’t talked to my stepmom once and I talked to my dad only half a dozen times. My dad wants me to call him and work things out but I can’t wrap my head around how to even begin that conversation. I strongly feel that he is an adult and he needs to be the one to begin repairing this broken relationship.

So I ask her if she'd like me to call an ambulance she declines but asks I take her to the hospital. Well I concede. If only because our policy states that it's my responsibility.

I could give her the day as a sick day if she had a doctor's note but the doctor wasn't going to give her a note for this.

Well she finds out and is mad that she was docked the day. I explain that if she can produce a doctor's note I'll give her the day. Hell I know clinics will even write a BS note if you pay them enough but she's pulling this woe less me crap and is turning the other staff against me.

OK so all this drama dates back to my girlfriend's (24F) last birthday which was two months ago. 

&#x200B;

So during my girlfriend's birthday I decided to gift her a new high specs laptop, as she was going to pursue her master's degree. Her old laptop was worn out from years of use. As I was already starting to make more from my job, so I did not see the problem in giving her this ""expensive"" gift. She was overjoyed from her birthday gift and loved it. Now in our 4.5 years of relationship I never gifted her anything amazing or special, nor did I took her out for dinner nights. So I did not see anything wrong with gifting her an item that she would regularly use and need.

&#x200B;

Now yesterday was my sister's birthday. Everyone was celebrating. When mid way through the event one of her friend suggested her to open her presents. She opened all her gifts one by one and stopped at my gift with a disappointed look on her face, I asked what was wrong? She replied by tossing the gift to her side that she expected more from me and then continued to open others. At that point I was confused as why she would not like her favourite chocolates. Now while everyone was getting ready to sit and eat, she pulled my girlfriend to the washroom with her and about some time later my girlfriend came back with a disappointed and sad look on her face. She was trying to hold back her tears. So I confronted my sister about this and she said ""*that bitch is trying to use and manipulate you*"", I said her to take back her words and apologize to my girlfriend. So now long story short, she did not apologize and and blew up on me and this escalated into a huge fight and me and my girlfriend ended up leaving midway through. Apparently no one except my sister's best friend, my mom and my dad know about this and rest of the party continued as usual.

Later I contacted my dad as he is the only one supporting me through this. And apparently she was upset because I did not get her a expensive gift as I got for my girlfriend. Now my mom is saying I was an asshole to her and I ""prioritize"" my girlfriend more than my sister and my birth family.

I actually then noticed she was wearing a cross necklace, and got a closer look at her tattoos, she had that Christian fish symbol on her arm just under her wrist, and a pretty large cross covered in thorns on her upper left shoulder (actually looked pretty cool admittedly!) So after the dance I asked her kind of jokingly if she was going to work late and go to church tomorrow because I noticed her tattoos and necklace. She responded that she actually goes Saturday nights, so she went earlier and then came here. I was kind of blown away, what she went to church and then a strip club? I thought that was crazy.

That night I bring it up to Steve and he informs me that she was spending so much time at our place lately  because she couldnt afford her apartment and had to terminate the lease prematurely so she was basically homeless. I kicked my roommates homeless girlfriend out on to the street. AITA?

Edit bc I think Steve is being unfairly demonized to some extent: he didnt ask her to move in and none of her stuff is in the common space. I think she keeps it all in her car. I think he just opened up the house to her to have a place to stay. He probably just said to her 'Hey you can chill here for today.' I'm not sure how many other times  he has extended the same offer but this is the first I saw of it. 

Mods can we lock this post? My roommate frequents this sub and I dont want him to happen upon this and get salty with me.",128,689,0.95

1555,Asshole,"**EDIT: Thanks so much for all the feedback, I had no idea I would get this many responses! I must admit, it has been quite hard to come to terms with being a certified asshole, but lesson learned... communication is key!**

For 2 years, we have both been studying for our degrees and we only have one room in our apartment to share between us (for studying that is, we have a separate bedroom, bathroom etc.). I have studied for a music degree and she has studied law. Whenever she has needed to study or concentrate, I have been considerate enough to not play. If I desperately need to practise, I will always leave the apartment to go and play at the university rehearsal rooms.

Now that our studies have finished, you would think things would be more relaxed. She asked me if it was all right for her to watch a film. I thought to myself ""Why do you need my permission? Do whatever you want!"". I thought she was asking to be considerate, as if the film was going to disturb *me*. What she actually meant was that I have to sit around and wait for her film to finish before I am allowed to play anything.

This is the crucial thing: I play electric guitar through my computer using **headphones**. I have never once played through an amplifier in all the time that we have lived together, and I don't actually even own one. It's just the ""twanging"" of the strings that annoys her, but it is physically impossible to play any quieter than what I am already doing.

Not only that, but I had a very rare moment of inspiration and I needed to record an idea that I had or else I would have lost it. Is it the best idea in the world? Not really, but I felt that it was important enough that I needed to record it right then and there. This just so happened to be around 20 minutes into her film... And here I am.

Her argument was that ""a band doesn't start playing when you go to the cinema"" and ""I just want to relax without you playing for once""... But this was the first time I've picked up my guitar in over a week since my final exam, and I never play when she is studying (which she doesn't have to do any more).

Granted, she is slightly stressed from looking for jobs all day, so I understand that she wants some time to relax. It was just the way she asked ""is it okay if I watch a film?"". The *way* she asked gave absolutely no indication of what she actually meant, which was ""I am really stressed and I would like to watch this film in peace"", even though I gave no indication that I was about to play guitar (as I said, it was a spur of the moment idea that I thought would not affect her watching the film).",199,182,0.89

I recently started selling a new product in my local community and needed some t-shirts made up advertising the new products for when I deliver them and show them off at local markets etc.

I looked on line for a price and could have had them made with Vistaprint which is a large online print  company. Instead I decided to keep my business local and contracted a local company to make them up for me despite them being slightly more expensive than the online alternative. I messaged the company to ask for a price for some other Tshirts, signs etc and she quoted me a price.

Recently other people in my area have started selling the same products, i have no issue with this. 

However I have noticed that the local business that I contracted has purchsed the products from another seller AND is recommending that people use that person to purchase the products from instead of me.

The lady at the print company messaged to ask if her quote was acceptable  and i replied that I have decided to purchase these from online supplier. She then had a go about not supporting businesses... My argument is that she knew I sold the products and decided to go to a different supplier so I owe her no loyalty at all.",23,41,0.87
1557,Asshole,"I have been married for 2 years and my husband had made it perfectly clear for several years that he doesn't want kids, but I did. 

Eventually we agreed that we would have one and one only. My mother had had trouble conceiving and I was concerned that I might too. After a year of no success I was getting worried.

We had booked a holiday and on the day of the flight, I received a call saying that my grandfather had died. I wrestled with whether to cancel the holiday, but my family assured me that my grandfather would not have wanted me to do that to attend his funeral.

My husband also tried to comfort me  and said that we would call the baby after my grandfather, he had a name that worked for both genders.

We enjoyed our holiday and, as it happened, successfully made a baby whilst we were away :)

A daughter was born and we named her after my grandfather. Fast forward a 10 years,  when my sister got pregnant and announced she was naming her baby boy after our grandfather.

1558,Not the A-hole,"My sister is getting married next week. I'm really happy for her but yesterday she told me she didn't actually save up enough money to pay for it all, so now she's sad and upset over her own marriage, which isn't ideal.

Last year,  when she asked me to plan the whole thing, she gave me a budget,  which I stuck to. It wasn't much (because I'm kinda poor and she is just poor) and now she told me she's still almost 2k short because she didn't manage to save up what she thought she would and has dipped into the already existing fund a few times the past year. 

Now obviously, since everything is already planned and it's too late to change things up to save costs, someone has to actually pay for it. So I dipped into my savings to make up for it. 

Now,  usually when my sister needs big loans like this I tell her to forget about it,  because in the past I was a student who didn't have any real expenses. She has a small child and just simply needed the money more than I did. 
This time however I am working and while I still live at home (i do pay my mom rent) ,  the money I was saving up was meant for me to start renting an apartment.

I really don't want to bring money problems into what should be such a beautiful day for her and I know I'm taking away the joy she'll feel that day and I feel like a dick for it.

1559,,"Ok, so this is a throw away because I'm a member of another sub where I discuss my brother/family on a regular basis.

&#x200B;

I have a brother (12) with special needs. He is physically able bodied but has had developmental and behavioral issues his whole life. I grew up helping take care of him and have always looked after him. I am the only other sibling and when my Dad is at work, (parents are divorced) I look after him when it's my Dads week. My brother refuses to do any chores and when I ask him to help clean his room or pick up toys around the house he goes into a tirade. I am a sophomore in college and with my schoolwork and recent breakup I have been physically and mentally exhausted.

&#x200B;

For the last couple months I have been training my brother to do his part around the house and help with basic chores. It basically works just like any other parent would incentive's their kids to do their chores with allowance or whatever. My brother loves to play xbox and I told him that xbox has a new program for xbox live where they let you gain ""X-Points"" by helping around the house and doing chores. So when I need him to help me I just unplug the router and tell him he  ran out of ""X-points"" and that he needs to take out the garbage, clean his room or wash my car. He loves earning ""X-Points"" so much that he keeps coming up to me asking how he can earn them so I've had to get more creative with the tasks he can do so on rare occasions I'll have him do some of the chores I usually do so that I can relax. He seems really happy and I think this will help him become more independent and realize the value of hard work. AITA for getting my brother to finally help out around the house by sort of tricking him into being more independent?

&#x200B;

Edit\* So my brother just asked my Mom for more ""X-Points"" for his birthday. I might be in over my head on this one.

&#x200B;

So my Mom asked me about how to order more ""X-Points"" online. I don't want to lie to her but judging from the mixed reactions on here I'm not sure how she will react to what I've done. I told her she can order more ""X-points"" by sending money to a Paypal account I have set up under a (hopefully) non suspicious name. She is not technologically savvy so this shouldn't raise any red flags. She said that my brother has been doing so well lately with his therapy and helping her around the house that she wants to surprise him with $500 in X-Points. The thing is though, he's only doing better because of me and not his therapist (shes terrible). Since I'm the reason for his drastic improvement I figure I'll keep $250 and use the rest to take my brother on a shopping spree. He really wants Cyberpunk 2077 and a few other things. He will be ecstatic so Win-Win.

Edit* OK so I think I’ve made a HUGE mistake. I realize now that I shouldn’t have lied to my Mom and should not keep her money. However I don’t know how to give it back without making it obvious that I lied. things are starting to spiral out of control. My brother has been telling his friends about “X-Points” and basically all of them have told him that they don’t exist. He told my Mom and now she’s googling it and asking me what the hell X-Points are?! Looks like my Goose is Cooked.",370,1244,0.89

&#x200B;

Yesterday (Tuesday), I went to hospital - husband drove me in his car - for a procedure that requires that I limit sitting up for at least a few days, and ideally, a week. Major abdominal pain, but life has to go on, and, being the UK, I was discharged the same day. Came home in pouring rain last night and went straight to sleep. 

&#x200B;

Husband left for a night away for work early this morning, and I continued to sleep. At 9am my doorbell started ringing frantically, and when I finally stumbled downstairs to open the door found a tradesman from the local water company demanding that I move my car to ""facilitate his day"" (note that it wasn't a necessary move, just would make it easier for him to do something that has absolutely nothing to do with me). I politely but firmly said no, and that I was on bed-rest (from whence I write this post) and unwell and to please not disturb me. A few minutes later my doorbell was being rung again, and the door knocker was getting a bashing. A woman in her 40s told me that I HAD to move my car as the work on her new house needed to be done and it was making the tradesmen take longer to go around my (legally parked) car. I reiterated that I could not drive, and her response was to demand my car keys and that she would ""park in a couple of streets away"". Insurance for cars in the UK is by person, so had she driven my car with my permission and something had happened she wouldn't have been covered in any form. I refused as politely as I could and told her I was returning to rest and recuperate.

1564,Not the A-hole,"I’m (M26) currently back at school getting prerequisite courses done for teaching programs. One of these courses is a first year biology course. This is where I met Danny.

Danny (M20) is 20 years old and very clearly autistic. I guess you would call him high functioning, but it honestly doesn’t feel like it. It sounds like he’s pretty book smart, as he has a grasp on what we’re doing in this class, but he has absolutely zero social skills. Absolutely none.

The first thing he ever said to me was that I must be attracted to children  because I want to teach elementary school. He called our TA stupid TO HIS FACE because the projector wouldn’t work. He wastes every bodies time in every lab and is disruptive in lectures.

I’m stuck in a group with him for lab work this semester and I’m honestly through with him. He sits around and reads anime on his phone while we do most of the work, is argumentative about everything whenever he actually does pay attention and routinely fucks up our experiments. He isn’t careful with anything in the lab, which is honestly terrifying as I don’t trust him operate scissors safely, let alone chemicals.

I’ve found it’s easier to simply not acknowledge his existence. Anytime he asks me about anything not biology related, I just don’t answer him. Anytime he asks something related to the class, I don’t answer him. Anytime he tries to copy my lab sheets, I close them and take them away. It’s so much easier than trying to contain or control his bullshit behaviour.

I told a couple of friends about this and they said that I was acting like an asshole. I’ve dealt with difficult people before, but this is next level. I didn’t pay close to $1000 to listen to this autistic guy try and be funny.

EDIT:

Some clarifications.

1) The lab work is not marked. It’s meant as a means of applying our lecture material and to be used as study material for our lab exams.

2) No, I don’t think all people with autism are assholes. No I don’t think being an asshole is a symptom of autism.

3) Yes I know I’ll have to deal with kids on the spectrum as a teacher.",191,858,0.96

1566,Everyone Sucks,"TLDR: My sister was supposedly having a kid-free wedding, but now some relatives are bringing their 2 toddlers to the event and my sister wants me and my boyfriend to sit at their table. AITA for asking to switch tables to sit with my dad instead of sitting with my mom, stepdad, and those relatives?

&#x200B;

Hey guys, you may call me Maid of Honor-zilla if it's fitting. I don't know if I'm being an asshole or if my sister is kinda blowing this situation out of proportion. It feels like a little of both, considering the backlash.

My sister's wedding is coming up soon and I'm the Maid of Honor. Although we've always been super close, we lead pretty different lifestyles and have very different core beliefs, but we are both very accepting and understanding people. I'll summarize by saying my sister is very traditional, has always wanted to be a wife and mother. I'm more the child-free type, don't care to marry, and am overall just kind of anti-Life Script (I promise in the quietest way possible, I've never shamed or guilted anyone for living differently, and don't actively hate kids or anything but won't be having them myself and am pretty awkward around them).

The table issue: My sister arranged seats at her reception so my mom and my stepdad are sitting at one table and my dad and his girlfriend are sitting at another table. Totally understandable, they get to sit with their respective blood family members. We just found out that my stepdad's oldest son and his wife are coming from the other side of the country to attend the wedding, but not only them, they're bringing their 3 and 4 year old kids. Obviously, my sister has added the 4 of them to the table with my stepdad, mom, me, and my boyfriend.

I feel bad; we don't get to see them too often, but I felt immediately disappointed to hear I'd be sharing a table at this event with two very small kids. This is a late night party type reception and I don't particularly want to worry about my alcohol intake or accidentally cursing in front of the kids if I don't have to. My dad's table isn't full yet, so I asked my sister if my boyfriend and I could be switched to my dad's table.

Cue hysterics. My mom said she can't believe I'd pick my dad over her on such a big family-centered day (they've been divorced 10 years but there's still bad blood between them) and can't believe I'm so ""disgusted"" by kids, especially family kids, that I'm asking to move. My sister is acting like this will ruin her reception because people are going to wonder if my mom and I are fighting or something. The last thing she said to me after we discussed this was ""we'll see,"" but her tone made it seem like we're definitely *not* gonna see.

&#x200B;

Am I the asshole for asking to switch tables? Should I just drop the subject? I want to confirm to her that my preference is still overwhelmingly to sit with my dad, but at this point I guess I'd accept if it just can't happen logistically.",191,491,0.94

He had been BLARING music with a heavy bass, which is normal for London but absolutely NOT normal in my corporate environment. 

As he was in front of me this guy sped through the parking lot and took the last managers car parking bay, which is closest to our offices and bigger than the usual bays. 

I was gotta admit I was pissed off so I approached him after I parked up as he was still in the car and I asked him if he had clearance to be here and to show me ID. He was a 30’s black guy in a suit, and he just said he was a visitor and showed me a German passport. I told him he was parked in a managers spot and told him to move his car as well as to report into reception immediately because usually the guards at the gatehouse give visitor passes straight away but this guy didn’t have one. He didn’t look happy but moved his car and really sarcastically said before he moved ‘I had no idea I was meant to report to reception, thanks’ after that I walked in to work and forgot about him.

Next thing I know, later that evening, mom called me and said that I need to come immediately and she found him dead when she went to bring him some food. 

This has hit her hard and I worked through everything I could with her. Took charge of the funeral and speaking, paid for most of it and also started donations to help pay everything else. 

For about a year or so previously he and I would record our phone conversations and do skits in person to work on a project together. Mom never knew of this. 

After he passed, I grabbed all of his electronics, backed them up and wiped them of things mom shouldn't see. His private photos and videos he and an ex made, writings where he was down....private stuff that I never even looked at and I put on am external and just set it aside. 

While in my therapy I got to talking about that night and it was like I was slapped with a brick. He went to go hit up his dealer for his normal bag of pot and they talked about doing heroine and he did some. 

Which showed up on the report as what contributed to his death but until this conversation I forgot he asked me to promise him that I wouldn't tell mom and I did promise him. We always assumed he got ahold of some bad stuff. 

After therapy, I brought up the recording and I was remembering correctly. It was great to hear his voice. I miss him so much.

Mom took his death really hard. She is just now starting to do better. I'm afraid that if I tell her it will hurt her all over again and I don't think any good will come from it. 

It's already bad. She created a new Facebook page to use solely as her's but the name is my brothers and it freaked myself and everyone else out when we seen it. But that is a different battle. I tried to talk to her about that and she broke down about how much she misses him and ignored the fact it was a gut punch every time she likes or replies with something.

1575,Not the A-hole,"Backstory: I’m currently 22 and live with my fiancé (also 22) in our own apartment. Both of us were raised Christian although we had very different experiences. Neither of us identify as Christians anymore and religion isn’t something that either of us really care about or enjoy talking about.

My mother on the other hand is a devout born again Christian and has a tendency to ask me really direct questions that I don’t enjoy talking to her about (example: in high school she used to ask me if I was a lesbian just out of the blue from time to time since I didn’t have a boyfriend). Well, a few years back this lead to her just asking me if I still believed in god to which I told her that I didn’t really know and that I didn’t want to discuss it further. She freaked out and started crying and has occasionally tried to convert me ever since.

Well, this weekend she came to visit me for my birthday. It was the first time I’ve seen her in about a year so I was pretty excited. When she got here everything was fine but on the second night of her stay she says she has a birthday present for me and then proceeds to hand me my old bible (which I told her she could keep multiple times). Then she tells me to open it. When I do, there are two $100 checks- one for myself and one for my fiancé. She told me that we each need to read the book of John and then we can cash the checks.

Now, I have nothing against any religion. I am a firm believer that people should be able to do or practice whatever they want as long as they are not harming others. But personally, I want nothing to do with this. I feel offended that she would bring that book into my home and then try to pay me and my fiancé to read it. But I also don’t know what to do with it. I can’t just throw it away so now I feel stuck with it. I still want the $200 so I’m also probably going to read it despite feeling like I’m going against my own beliefs by doing so. So Reddit, I’m not really sure where I stand with this. 

AITA for being upset with my mom for doing this? It seems petty to me when I read it back so I feel guilty being bothered by it. My fiancé was pretty excited at the possibility of an easy $100 but I’m upset about it.",63,42,0.89
1576,Not the A-hole,"I am F(35). Since I was in high school I have always been very clear with friends and family that I do not want to have kids. I even divorced my ex because of it ( he thought I would change my mind after marriage). Now my younger brother (27) and his fiance are pregnant and my mom hasnt stopped with the comments. Saying things like ""I always though you would be pregnant first"" and ""you are running out of time"". She also says that I just havent meet the right guy yet and when I do I will want kids! This really makes me mad because I have meet the right guy we have been together for 5 years, he also does not want kids. 
     Well we found out my brother is having a girl (yay) and I am beyond excited, I am planning the baby shower and getting my own home ready to help and babysit on occasion. I am really looking forward to having a little friend! So my mom has taken this as a sign that I am confirming that I want kids and will not stop asking me about it, I finally got fed up and just kinda yelled at her that I am never having kids and to leave me alone about it (this was in private). She immediately started crying and said I was being ungrateful,mean and cold-hearted, so now I feel bad. Am I the asshole in this?

Update: Went to my moms last night to have a sit down talk (brought her some dinner too). I explained calmly again that I dont want kids and how it feels when she continually questions me about it. Mended the fence, hopefully it will stick this time.

Also I am 100% sure lying about not being able too will back fire as she would spend so much time researching fertility treatments. If I were to get sterilized with out telling her that would be even worse as she would want to know about it even if she didnt agree.

1577,Everyone Sucks,"So a bit of backstory, I knew this guy from college, I was on a two year course and he was only there for the first year. He dropped out and, as I understand it, is now pursuing a career in music.

The reason I mention his career is because that was what he wanted help with, he messaged me after not being in contact for close to two years he messages saying he wants to use some prop guns I have. I know through mutual friends that he is into drugs (mainly weed) and I know through personal experience that he isn't very responsible.

Now these guns are a mix of black airsoft and deactivated revolvers that I got when my grandad passed away, and wouldnt be legal to take outside (I live in the UK). 

When he asked me I was so annoyed that I completely ignored his first message. He then messaged me again asking the same thing to which my response was to block him on all social medias.

Edit 1. Many people are commenting on how I should have said no, simply for the legal issue. A tad mor context for this, the course we were on was a public services course (mainly for police), and I would have thought it was common knowledge for anyone within the UK, especially if they are attempting to use them as props, that it us not legal to just walk around with weapons that could be mistaken as real.",29,59,0.9
1578,Asshole,"My husband and I are in our mid thirties, we've been married a year, together for 4ish and have a newborn son. I have another 15 year old son from a previous marriage. When we met he was overweight, but in a kind of cute/husky way. He overeats, a lot. We're now in obese territory and it's bothering me. A lot. 
I feel like I've exhausted all options: I cook healthy food, suggest we exercise together, etc. I'm a former ballet dancer and have ""skinny genes"", but of course, I watch what I eat and do yoga and dancing. 
After finding a mountain of fast food wrappers in his car and in the trash for the millionth time I announced that I was taking his wages. Here's some snippits from the conversation:

Him: How will I buy gas? Me: We'll fill up your tank together on Sundays
But what if I get hungry? I'll pack you more healthy lunches
I work really hard...I've earned that money. Yeah, man, think how much you'll save not buying 10 tacos every day.

.....

I pack his lunch every day, he gets takeout on the way to work and on the way home every single day. I love this guy, I don't want him to feel shit. I've been married before, my first husband died when he was 30 from brain cancer, he never got to see his son grow up, I don't want that to happen again. 
He's on some medication for bipolar disorder, he blames that for his weight gain. But I just don't buy that because he eats sooooooo much crap. He also has some self esteem issues as he is a cop but had to take on different duties after getting diagnosed with mental illness. This happened just before we met and I supported him, he's been stoked becoming a dad and getting married. 
He's American and I am Australian so we do have some mild cultural clashes. I haven't told him I'm finding him unattractive but I am. It's unhealthy and gross. 
He's not interested in our finances, I pay all our bills out of our accounts and run the household, I also work full time but am on maternity leave with pay till September.
Of course if he needs or wants anything that isn't food related I will buy it for him, I just feel I have to dish out some tough love here to help this drongo lose some weight.
AITA?

1579,Not the A-hole,"So long story short, I was with a girl for a few years and lived together with her. But she ended up cheating so obviously we broke up and she moved away.

It’s been a few months now and we talked a little bit (but never talked about dating/what happened to us)
As time went on she kept sending me more photos of her. At first she would take selfies with pets and send them to me which I didn’t have a problem with at first. But that kinda evolved into her just sending me selfies. Nothing sexual. Just selfies.

So I told her I was uncomfortable with this. I said I am glad we are talking again (a lie but I didn’t want to be too mean) but that I was uncomfortable with what she is doing. And that is 100% true. It kinda made me feel like I was “the other guy” so I wanted to put a end to it. And obviously part of me was just being petty giving the situation... but I truly was uncomfortable.

Well after this she doubled downed and sent me screenshots of other guys (that she wasn’t dating) she sent the same selfies to saying “they don’t mind”. So I explained to her how I am uncomfortable because I know she has a bf, and she is my ex. And I said straighfup “I think it looks bad when you send selfies to your ex bf” (and yes she is dating the guy she cheated on me with if that means anything)

Now I admit there was probably a million different ways I could have handled it, but I wanted to be straightforward and put a end to the behaviour quickly. But AMIA because of it?

Also besides being uncomfortable I really just didn’t want to see the pictures... I mean that’s fair right?

Edit: I thought I should address this as well.
We dated for a long time. We got pets together and lots of mutual friends. It isn’t always easy as “just block her”
I can insure everyone that there is 0 intentions of me getting back together after what happened.

Update for anyone who see’s this. I took everyone’s advice and completely cut all ties with her. And I want to thank the people who were telling me to do that because it was very unhealthy behaviour on my part and I didn’t really think anything of it until reading the comments. Everyone’s comments helped me a lot so if anyone ends up reading this thank you!",87,247,0.87

Background first. My boyfriend and I have been together for 8 years. We have a 3&5 year old. We live an hour apart. I take care of the kids solo basically. He works 2 days a week stocking and generally brings me $30-$50 on a good week...but for many weeks now he hasn't given me anything. He recently quit cigarettes for vaping and it appears that vaping(and getting nug fronts) and the expensive gaming rig he built and has to pay off is draining the funds before he even gets his paycheck.

Now for the question. Yesterday he sent me a text  with a picture saying he brought me a PS4 for $120 and happy birthday. My birthday was in May and I never said anything about wanting a console (I had actually just spent several months saving up  for a gaming PC so in my very tiny amount of off time I could do something i enjoy, but I also homeschool so I rely heavily on the PC for schooling needs as well so that was worth it) and my response was ""I will never touch it.""
He got really upset and said that I'm always going on about wanting a PS4 (I've actually said I will never play a console again because pc is all I need) and that I switched up on him and he can never get it right.
I feel bad, but rejected his gift. Letting him know that things like school supplies, and things for the kids is what we need.

1581,Not the A-hole,"Normally there’s more than two people on duty at my department at work, but on this specific day only myself (M32) and my coworker (F50) are working. Due to the nature of our work, it’s important that at least one person is available in the office during working hours. I’m working at the office when I get a call from my coworker that is out in the field on an assignment. She tells me that she’d fallen, landed on her wrist and need me to come pick her and the company car up. No problem, she’s not far away and it’s lunch time any minute so there’s time. When I get there I’m told by a nurse that her wrist needs to be x-rayed. The nearest hospital is in the neighboring town, and my coworker asks me to drive her there. Alright, there’s still time on my lunch break and we live in a country with free healthcare. Everything will be fine.

We stop by at the office so I can grab her personal items along with her computer, and we head on a 20 minute road trip to the hospital emergency room. On the way I ask her to call her friends or family to arrange transport home. She tries some friends and after unsuccessfully yelling at her father on the phone she doesn’t have much luck.

We arrive and I get her things out of the trunk and this is when she notices that I accidently grabbed her work laptop instead of her personal laptop (she described it as the computer in the black case, which there apparently were two). She demands that I head back to the office and grab her personal computer which I decline. She calls me selfish and unsympathetic. I won’t lie, I’m not particularly fond of this coworker but I treat her with the same respect as my other coworkers to keep the peace. At this point I’m tired of this and tell her that I’m heading back to the office.

It was like turning on a switch. She went from angry and annoyed to puppy eyes and sobbing in an instant. She asks me if I’m not coming inside to wait with her in the emergency room, to which I tell her that she’s at the hospital, she’s an adult and that I need to get back to the office.

She shoots me a long angry look and puffs away into the hospital. So I head back and I really thought that would be the end of it, but a few days later I get a call from my coworker on my personal phone. She tells me that her wrist is broken and that she had to wait alone in the hospital for 4 hours before she could go home. She tells me that she feels hurt that I left her there. By this point I’m pretty angry with her and I tell her straight that I’m sorry that she got hurt, but that we are coworkers. I am friendly, but I am not her friend. I am employed to do my job, not to be her moral support. She hangs up on me. Because of the injury my coworker was away for about two weeks and has not said many words to me since.

I am not ashamed of how I handled the situation, but I’ve gotten reactions from both sides. Some friends agreed with my actions and some of my friends tell me that I should’ve stayed and kept her company. So AITA here?",26,29,0.89

So last night there was a post Malone concert in my city and one of my sisters friends was selling a last minute ticket for a lot cheaper than the standard rate. She wanted to go and since she wrote her last exam yesterday and didn’t have any important commitments today she figured it would be alright.
 I was sitting in my room when I heard her and my mom arguing.

Sis: I’d really like to go to the post concert tonight

Mom: No, I don’t know the friends you’re going with and also I said so.

Then I stepped in and had a brief argument with my mom saying that she should be allowed to go because she’s 18, has no obligations the following day and you not knowing her friends and because you said so aren’t valid reasons to give to a young adult.

at this point my sister had gone back to her room and I figured she was over it already, but then my younger sister beckoned me into other sisters room where she was busy putting on makeup and told me she was going anyway. now I didn’t have a problem with taking her as my sister can legally (in my country it’s age 18 not 21) make these decisions for herself and I didn’t think my mother was being reasonable and fair so i told her my friends (they we’re coming over shortly) and I would take her in my friends car so that we wouldn’t use my dad car which he has given me the keys for. We took her and me and my friend made sure she got into the venue safely.

When we got back to my house my mother and father came and spoke to us telling me and my friend how disrespectful it was that we went against their wishes of her going out and I told them once again that they are being unreasonable and that if she was underage, had an exam in the near future, had obligations early in the morning or she wasn’t going to a huge concert that I wouldn’t have taken her. After saying that my dad said “I’ll show you unreasonable, get your friends out of my house and give me your car keys (keep in mind we didn’t even use my car).

Anyway we packed up and left and basically drove around the suburbs talking about it until we had to fetch my sister at 12.

TLDR: took my 18 year old sister to a concert after my parents said no even though she had no exams and no obligations the next day, now my parents are angry at me for undermining their (unjustifiable) decision for her to stay at home even though she’s of legal age to make the decision for herself.

Edit: my friends and I asked her multiple times if she was sure she wanted to throw away her whole school vacation for this one night and she was adamant that she was fine with it, so keeping to my beliefs of she’s 18 she can make her own decisions, we took her.",377,599,0.95
1583,Not the A-hole,"Hello fellow young adults,

Recently I find myself upset almost all the time about my parents. Quick backstory: We were extremely poor all my entire life, barely any good, no warm water etc. We’re still struggling a lot nowadays but I finally landed my first job. I’m still living with my parents (at 21).

Now I just started my drivers license (here it costs around 2.3k) which I of course pay for it by myself. I only make 1.4k a month which is overall really amazing. This month I need to pay roughly 510€ for the license. My education is still being paid off (around 290€ a month), my parents want me to pay it off. Don’t get me wrong, I love them and yes, I get it, I should pay it of course. But lately it feels like my parents guilt trip me into giving money. For example: I tell my dad that I’m proud that I can finally think about moving out (when I got the drivers license) and build my own life. My dad usually replies with „yeah really? You know you have to pay for your education, another 10€ for food (which is fine) and because of your decision of that education we have no money at all.“ 

What I’m trying to er across is, that my parents seem to blame all financial issues on me. When I’m upset my mom often tells me how my father went to jail for me (money issues) and how I’m the most money draining person (I don’t buy new clothes at all, I often get them from friends, I don’t go out etc). My parents also bought two damn restaurants out in the middle of nowhere and are now in extreme debt. After the first one failed miserably, they decided to get another one for unknown reasons. I’m still mad at them for that. We still struggle a lot with that. 

I love them so much, but it feels like they blame it all on me. They don’t listen at all (Please don’t buy another restaurant, please don’t take onto a credit you can never pay back, please stop buying so much food we can’t and won’t eat, stop buying garden stuff that’ll never be used etc) and just... I don’t know man. I guess I’m upset cause I was so damn proud of getting a job after a year of unemployment and thought about moving out, building a life and all. 

TL;DR: Am I the asshole for being upset about my parents for wanting my money and making me feel bad?",11,59,0.9

Shortly before I began my transition we caught up online, started talking again, which eventually led to hanging out on a regular basis. During this time he was dating someone and I came out to everyone, including him. He seemed really accepting, so we contiued to hanging out, even more so because I had quite a few friends I loss when I came out. Little less than a month later, he and his gf broke up because they wanted different things in life (she wants kids, specifically soon, and he doesn't want kids at all) shortly after that we started dating.

The other night we were talking and the topic of sexuality got brought up and he stated that he is a straight dude, always has been always will be, and that (besides me) he's only ever dated cis women. That led to me asking if he'd stay with me if I had bottom surgery, which is a definite thing I plan in my future, and he more or less shrugged the question off and talked about how it's something that is potentially years away and he'll cross that bridge when it arrives. Feeling a little hurt, I asked him if he would ever date me if I was born a dude, and was exactly the same as I now beside being born with a penis, and it was a hard no from him.

In our first jobs in this industry we worked alongside eachother. It wasnt too bad. My only complaint for the year we worked together was that she told a manager I'd cover her shift without asking. Once the manager found out she hadn't actually asked me they always checked with me first.

When I got a job in a great company as a manager she applied and was soon working in my team. We worked together just fine. She didnt cause any drama but at the same time, didnt show the level of respect that other team members did. 

It's been 3 years since then and shes now a single mother living with our parents. She has a job but she doesnt enjoy it very much. In comparison, my husband and I have 2 kids and are very secure.

My husband and I recently brought a business in the industry and we inherited some staff but some chose to leave. Trace has asked me if she could come work at our company. 

There's no solid reason not to employ her given that we have worked together just fine before but I don't really want to. Shes always the center of attention at family gatherings whereas I am more reserved. I don't really trust her not to gossip about work to our mother, who she is very close to while I have a strained relationship there.

1595,No A-holes here,"My parents had me (now, 32M) young, then had my little sister when I was 13. My mom passed 2 years later. My dad, while present for most of my life, had never really contributed and my mom took him back despite a lot of bad stuff he did. It was no surprise that a lot of care fell to me when it came to my baby sister. I was juggling school and her, eventually a job because Dad lost his. A little after I graduated from high school, my dad got arrested. I was 18, so I was fine, but my sister was obviously too young. She faced being put in the system and I had a choice. I knew I’d never get to see her and I had to give it a shot, so I got legal guardianship. I had already pretty much been raising her.

It was just us after that and of course it wasn’t easy. I couldn’t go to college and I worked two jobs at a time to keep us afloat. My sister was a good kid, but obviously she struggled with not having traditional parents (even when our dad got out, he never came back for her and that was hard). I did everything I could to make her feel safe, secure and protected, but half the time, I felt like a kid too, because I never really got to be one.

That lead to another thought in my head. While I wouldn’t change raising my sister, it did take away my youth and chance to be a free young adult like my peers at the time. I decided that she would be my only “kid”. Which meant I had to find a partner okay with that. When my sister was in her teens, I met my now wife. She was great with my sister, who didn’t need a mom but loved having a female figure. We got married the year before she graduated from high school and assured her, our home is always open to her, and she stays with us during breaks. She graduated from high school last spring and goes to a school out of state. I miss her a ton, but it was time for her to spread her wings. We talk, text and Skype.

Since she left, we’ve traveled and I have plans to go to college in the fall, a lifelong dream. The only thing that’s changed is we’ve discussed fostering in about 10 years but my wife also doesn’t want babies around. My sister recently started poking around asking when we’d make her an aunt, and I said we had no plans to do so, explaining our plan. She got curious and I explained for myself, I raised a kid and now I felt like I was an empty nester, ready to live my life a bit. I knew instantly I had hurt her feelings and tried to explain that I wouldn’t change raising her. She said she understood and hung up, but later admitted that around the time the wife and I got married, she felt guilty for being around so much. Now, she feels like she ruined my life. Not true!

My sister told my best friend who is like another brother to her (my only friend who didn’t abandon me when I got custody) and he is pissed at me. I feel awful that she’s so sad, but I didn’t think that was so wrong. Was I an asshole for saying that? My wife says that I could’ve worded it a lot better, because she would’ve been hurt too.

&#x200B;

ETA: People have said I should reach out to her, I have tried to, several times. This did just happen yesterday so she's naturally still hurt and not willing to listen, but she will be coming home from her roommate's (she was on vacation visiting) on Friday, so I do plan to have a sit down talk then if she won't answer my calls or texts before then. Considering just writing an e-mail.

Edit 2: People have been calling my sister ungrateful and that's seriously bothering me. She's not. She is very much grateful and aware of what I did for her. It's \*why\* she feels this guilt. I think if she didn't...then I might even think she was ungrateful.",60,203,0.95

1597,Not the A-hole,"To start this off, I love my sister. I support her 100%. 
When she told me she is trans I got behind it immediately. I referred to her with the correct pronouns privately and used her chosen name for a full year before she came out. I fought for her when members of our family rejected her and I would and have immediately cut anyone off if they are in any way hateful towards her. 

When she came out she was embraced by many but rejected were loudly by enough people for it to be absolutely devastating. As a result we became very close and spend much more time together than we did before. 

Now, for the shitty part. Ever since she came out she’s been getting progressively more annoying. She FAKES stupidity, like will actually put on a 2000’s style Paris Hilton ditzy act. She’s taken up cattiness that she never ever had in her before and just recently I caught her pretending not to know how to put windshield wiper fluid in her car. Like, she actually created this whole scene where she was confused and needed help doing a task I know she can do because she taught me to do it when I got my license!

A cousin eventually said something to her which resulted in a lot of tears and her calling that cousin transphobic (i know he’s not but he did come on really strong telling her that she was being fucking annoying) so I know that I have to tread very carefully.

Now I’m wondering if this is just kind of like her going through the same self discovery I went through as a teenager and it will pass? I don’t know if me breaking down for her how her new found identity is irritating as shit is any help if this is something she grows out of herself. I honestly don’t know what to do.",551,9448,0.93
1598,Not the A-hole,"Well the title basically says it all. 

In 2012 I bought a small house and my gf at that time helped me furnish it. She worked for a big upscale furtniture company so she got me some pretty good discounts on otherwise very expensive, luxury furniture. Things like couch, dining table, bedroom set were all stuff I bought using her discounts. 

We broke up in 2014 but stayed on good terms though we haven’t spoken since 2015 or so. My current girlfriend and I started dating in 2017. She knew about my ex and how we split on good terms and was slightly upset about it (she is on extremely bad terms with all her exes) because she thinks it means I’m not “truly over this ex if I don’t hate her.” But that’s a whole other issue.

Anyways she’s moving in with me in a few months. I tell her she’s free to decorate as she wishes since it’ll be her home too, so she drops a bomb on me. She wants me to throw away or donate ALL the furniture that I had gotten while I was with my ex. This means I’d have to throw away 70% of all the furniture in my house. I tell her no, I’m not throwing away perfectly good furniture and she accuses me of not letting her feel at home. She wants me to throw away all my good furniture and replace it with cheaper, flimsier things from IKEA (since we wouldn’t be able to afford the expensive stuff without discounts).

I just think it’s an absolute waste to throw away all that furniture. My gf thinks we should start “anew” which means nothing left over from my ex days. Even things as small as a coffee table would need to go. Granted she has offered to chip in on the new furniture but I just genuinely don’t want to downgrade from my current stuff to cheap IKEA stuff which would look worse as well. 

This has caused a huge fight and she accuses me of going back on my promise of letting her decorate. I meant she’s free to paint the walls, put up pictures, rearrange, buy new things, etc. not gut my existing home. AITA?",72,79,0.91

1600,Asshole,"I have been married for 25 years to an amazing woman. We have four sons. Back when we just had our oldest two about 16 years ago, we hit a rough patch and legally separated for a bit. We honestly thought it was heading to divorce. During this time, I entered a short-term relationship with a woman we’ll call Miranda. It wasn’t anything terribly serious and I regret that I didn’t tell her that I was married or any of that. I was younger and a much different person at the time. Doesn’t make it right, I know. Anyway, we did sleep together during this time. Eventually, my wife and I reconnected. I was honest that I had been in a sexual relationship, but we worked past that. Miranda and I broke it off and I didn’t hear from her. She didn’t seem overly upset when I explained the situation, but I wasn’t stupid and knew I looked like an ass. I went to therapy with my wife, our marriage has been stronger than ever and we had our two other sons. I nearly forgot all about Miranda all together.

Fast forward to now. I started hearing from a few people that Miranda had a daughter. I didn’t think much of it, until I heard the age. I spied on Miranda’s Facebook page and she looks a lot like two of my sons (who I have been told are clones of myself). I noticed that in this time, Miranda has remarried, though she did that when her daughter was 5. I decided to contact her and she asked if we could meet. 

She was honest and told me that her daughter was mine. She felt like my situation was so complicated and she worried about ruining my marriage and possibly losing the baby to us (which we never would’ve done). Miranda explained that she had the baby alone, then a few years later met her husband. Her daughter is aware that her step-father is not her bio dad, but she considers him her father.

I was pissed, hurt and a fury of emotions. I did ask for a DNA test and she complied, this is my child. I explained the situation to my wife and sons, they’re taking it a lot better than I expected. 

The only issue is my daughter. She has no interest in getting to know me or my family. We met once, just us, and it was awkward of course. I wanted it to be slow and I said I get I’m not “dad”, but I want to be something. She turned me down. I don’t blame her here, but I do blame her mother and I told her I will be pursuing custody, because I wouldn’t be in this situation if she had just told me. Miranda told me that I am partially why we are here.

My wife thinks that’s a mistake and I need to let my daughter come to me. She said it sucks, but this will cause resentment. I still want to get to know my flesh and blood. Now, I have the step-dad trying to reach out to make peace and I told him he could talk to my lawyer.

AITA here?",408,696,0.89
1601,META,"Now that this sub has gotten popular, there is a larger number of toxic comments here, and I want to say this clearly: CRUCIFYING ASSHOLES MAKES YOU AN ASSHOLE TOO.

Yes, there are posts here where some people are clearly assholes, and they need to be notified as such. But there are a few ways that people are typically replying to these assholes:

1) (The best way) A person comments YTA and provides a breakdown of how the other person (or people) is experiencing the issue, making it much easier for the asshole to logically cope with the situation and accept the truth. This is the most objective way to help assholes understand how they were assholes in the situation and show them a better way of NOT being an asshole.

2) (A subjective but still better way) A person comments YTA and shares their own experience/perspective on the situation. The person might give a few emotionally worded lines in this response, but it's driven by their desire to help the asshole understand that they're an asshole in the situation. It subjectively helps assholes empathize with the truth of the situation and work towards fixing their mistakes. 

3) (THIS WAY MAKES YOU AN ASSHOLE) A person comments YTA and treats the asshole like they're human garbage. Brace yourselves, because I'm going to discuss a lot about method #3:

The person will tell the asshole how they're complete garbage for what they're doing in a very emotionally fueled way. This way is usually getting lots of upvotes and probably gilded. But here's the problem with this: When the ""asshole"" responds to this comment (or even other ones in the thread), regardless of whether the response is flat out disagreement (or just responses that show that they're not getting the message), then people start commenting shit like ""This is why your SO is a saint for being with you and should've left you a long time ago"" or ""I'm not surprised that a piece of shit like you would respond that way"" or ""You don't deserve to be a parent and I hope your kids get taken away"", etc.

This is EXTREMELY hypocritical! You're taking ONE post on reddit about ONE situation and blowing that up to generalize someone that is an asshole in this situation? Yes, I understand that some people are just inherently assholes, but that's not always the case here!

I agree that the majority of the time that people are being assholes that they should be informed as such, but not in a way that treats them like they should be miserable for the rest of their lives.

This type of behavior is demanding perfection or assuming that the person is ALWAYS an asshole. And DMing them disgusting and vile things, and acting like they're the pinnacles of perfection themselves only makes it worse.

**PSA: THIS SUBREDDIT IS ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW THEY'RE BEING ASSHOLES AND HELP THEM IMPROVE, NOT TREATING THEM LIKE SHIT AND TELLING THEM TO KILL THEMSELVES AND MAKING THEM FEEL LIKE THEY SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THIS FUCKING PLANET**

To all of you that immediately decide to write an emotional + rage-induced comment to someone's post because of what you've read without giving someone the benefit of the doubt, I want you to think about your own life and the mistakes that you've made. I want you to think about the times that you've TRULY messed up. How would YOU feel if an army of people on reddit started telling you to kill yourself and talked down to you in such a disgusting way that is meant to sting? It sucks, doesn't it?

And that's the point. I'm willing to bet that EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU are assholes at some point in your life, so stop demanding perfection out of every asshole that posts on here. This is what turns people off from here to ask advice and makes them nervous about the impact on their mental health.

And MOST importantly: JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE IS AN ASSHOLE IN THE SITUATION DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY ARE AN ASSHOLE ALL THE TIME. People make mistakes! You, me, all of us! It's part of being human!

The whole point of this community is to help each other become better people. And I know many of you are going to say ""the internet is a tough place"" or ""there's always toxic people on reddit"", but that doesn't mean that this behavior is justified. 

Just because one of the windows in my house gets broken doesn't mean that I'm going to leave it that way or beat the shit out of it for being broken until my hands are bloody. I'm going to see what caused the break, fix the window, and take measures to help make sure that the window doesn't get broken again.

We need to help the assholes, not crucify them. That's how we help them turn into better people (and in many cases ourselves too).

EDIT: Holy cow, I have to admit that from the start, you all have been really awesome and provided valuable input! I want to give a huge thanks to the mods for the effort they put in helping me trim this down and convert it to a more constructive post. I'll admit my own fault of being emotionally driven in parts of this post, and I had great feedback from them on how to fix this to make it better and make the message stand out more. I'm glad to hear that I'm not the only one that has felt this way, and I'm sorry to those of you that wanted to make posts like this but were afraid of being treated as a callout. I don't think there's ever just one post like this, there's a common behavior around most of them, and we as people are better than the toxicity that some of us may show at times.

Again, thanks for the feedback, and let's keep on enabling ourselves and others to be better people :)",221,1309,0.88

1605,Not the A-hole,"My husband sets his alarm for 5:30 am for work. He is a pretty deep sleeper, I am a light sleeper, so when the alarm goes off I usually wake up first. We share our bedroom currently with our 2 month old son (he is in a crib across the room). 

Sometimes my husband is not very quick to silence his alarm (but he thinks he is.), and its also set to be very loud so that he doesn't miss it. For instance this morning when it went off, I had time to wake up, grab my phone in confusion, panic swipe at the screen a few times (I thought it was my alarm), set my phone down, and then nudge my husband with my foot to get him to turn it off before it woke up the baby. 

When he woke up he yelled (literally, yelled.) ""Its only been a few seconds!!"" and I angry whispered ""shut up!"" at him (which is an asshole thing to say, I apologized to him already.)  

He also has a habit of hitting snooze 2 or 3 times, so we repeat this (me waking up, nudging him to get up or turn the alarm off, him being grumpy at me) several times, every morning. 

Anyways to the point- he is upset that I kick him out of bed. A few mornings ago I got really fed up and stopped letting him snooze (everyone he fell asleep I shook him awake again). I also started slowly pushing him out of the bed lol.  I feel like if he needs to sleep 10 mins more he should set him alarm 10 mins later then. 

Before baby I did not really care, but since I do 100% of the feedings and night wakings, sleep is very precious to me. I don't get to go to bed until after 11pm, and my husband often goes to bed at 8 or 9. And day sleeping when your baby sleeps to catch up is a myth; unless you can ignore the never ending dishes/laundry/groceryshopping/everything else that needs to get done. So basically if the baby wakes up early I get to be a sleep deprived zombie. This will be solved once we move him to his own room but we aren't ready for that yet.

When he passed away suddenly in September, it was a major shock for our whole family, especially my aunt. Recently, I've gotten engaged and began sending invites around. We're having a low key ceremony at a friend's barn, so the guest list is not necessarily a problem. I sent my aunt an invite, and I got a call from her a few days later.

1607,Asshole,"**tl;dr: we own four houses: our own and our three kid's homes. We're going to lose a lawsuit and need to sell. WWBTA for selling two of our kid's homes instead of one, just because the one has children?**

My husband and I (56 and 55) used to be petroleum engineers and retired young at 35. We have three children: 30M, 28F, 27F. We bought each of them houses, but some are worth more than others:

- 30M received a $180,000 home bought in 2010
- 28F received a $130,000 home bought in 2011
- 27F received a $340,000 home bought in 2016

Numbers aren't exact but almost there. Why did our youngest get the most expensive? She at the time was pregnant with our first grandchild and today they have two kids. These are our only grandchildren.

My husband and I are in a lawsuit right now and things are looking dire. We're not at fault but we're against a larger company. I'd say there's maybe a 5% chance of us coming out of this ahead. I don't know if I should get into the details of this as it's irrelevant, but I want to reiterate we're not at fault.

In the chance we lose, we're going to have to pay up a pretty penny. We've already given up hope of winning and are going to sell our house, but this isn't enough. We're thinking of selling 30M and 28F's houses and letting 27F keep hers, even though the first two could stay if we sold the third. We're prioritizing the home in which our grandchildren live.

We've made mention of this to all of our kids and all three incidentally are upset. 27F wants to give up her home for the sake of her siblings but all the houses are in our names solely so we have final decision. Our other two children haven't spoken to us since, and it's been two months.

Are we the assholes for prioritizing one child over our other two, solely because they have children of their own? 30M has expressed zero interest in ever having children, 28F had her tubes tied already and is proudly childfree. This is irrelevant but it shows through 27F that these are the only grandkids we'll ever get.

1608,Not the A-hole,"My wife Mandy and I have two daughters. Katie, 20 and Abbie, 17. We love them both dearly but they are polar opposites. 

Katie, to put it simply was the child most parents dream of. She has always been confident, outgoing and eager to make new friends. Throughout her childhood and teen years she had lots of friends and was also a very high achiever academically. She did very well at school and got into a very good uni on one of their most selective courses. She is a huge party girl and loves being the centre of attention. 

As for Abbie, she is the total opposite. She is quite an introverted person, which is fine, and she has a very small - but close - circle of friends. She hated school and left at the first opportunity, and chose to do an apprenticeship, which she really enjoys and we couldn't be happier for her. She is very pretty like her sister but doesn't have the same kind of glamorous personality. She hates being the centre of attention and prefers to do her own little thing.

We love both our children equally, but Abbie is also close to Mandy's sister Ruth, and they've had a few heart-to-hearts. Ruth took us aside last weekend and told us that Abbie has opened up about how she feels overshadowed by Katie. We are always praising Katie's achievements or talking about things that Katie has said or done. Abbie said that we haven't openly praised anything she's done for years and sadly that's true. According to Ruth, when Katie is away at uni we are talking about what she's up to, while when she's home her louder personality means she gets most of the attention. Ruth said everyone noticed that Katie gets more attention than Abbie. 

Mandy was upset and I was close to tears at the fact that we treated our own child this way. She feels unloved and unwelcome in her own home. Mandy and me sat Abbie down and she admitted she did often feel like we don't care about her.

Abbie's birthday is a while away, but I suggested that this weekend we organise a day in which we just do things that she likes. Let her be take charge for the day. Abbie likes the idea and so does Mandy. 

Katie is home from uni, and I asked her if she was free this weekend so we can have a ''family day''. She kept trying to suggest things to do, but I explained that we were going to let her sister decide the activities of the day. Katie said that the stuff Abbie is into is ''boring'' and I said she doesn't have to take part if she doesn't think she'll have fun. She kept trying to suggest things to do but I bluntly told her that the day wasn't about her it was about Abbie. 

Katie stormed off sobbing and I regretted it straight away. In trying to do something nice for one daughter I've gone and made the other one feel excluded.

He told me he had a achy tooth earlier today, I can go on and on.

He was whining when he asked me **why** for a second I thought our 3yo niece was talking to me. I told him he was more than capable of going on his own, his mom gave him a picture of the items to pick up, and he didn't need me to go with him.


He then said, whining like a child again, ""oh come on come with me. I don't want to mess it up.""

M is quite angry with me, and says she might as well not come at all if I was going to pretend she didn't exist. I told her it was my wedding and my right to choose who the bridesmaids were, and that it was naive of her to assume everything would be fine when half the guests are most likely open transphobes.

Names: Rose-Biological Daughter Emily-Stepdaughter 

My wife wanted to make one of our rooms a guest one. In order to achieve this, we had to force our respective daughters to share a room.

Both of them objected, but ultimately, they “agreed”. This led to the fight that I’m asking you about.

Rose put a sign on her wall. The sign read “As a libertarian, I support legalizing same-sex marriage. As a libertarian, I also think that people shouldn’t have to service weddings that violate their religious beliefs.” 

This opinion is obviously controversial, as I’m sure many disagree with it. However, I didn’t consider it that offensive. Then again, I’m not homosexual, and haven’t ever faced discrimination based on my sexual orientation. 

Emily’s friend found it offensive, and said that she was uncomfortable with it. Because of this, Emily said that Rose should have to remove it. Rose refused, saying ""I won’t silence my opinions just because they’re controversial or offensive.” 

My stepwife sided with Emily, which prompted Rose to say “If you want to avoid this, how about you give up the guest room? Then we would have separate rooms, and we wouldn’t have this issue.”

My stepwife says that she shouldn’t have to give up the guest room just so that Rose can keep a sign on her wall, but I disagree. Ultimately, that seems like the best option to me. Then Rose could have signs representing her opinions, and Emily’s friend wouldn’t be uncomfortable.

1615,Not the A-hole,"Long time lurker, and on mobile. English is my first language, so I have no excuse.


I'll be referring to her as BFF from now on because BF makes me think boyfriend, and I don't want any confusion.

So BFF and I have been inseparable for years. We met in 7th grade when she helped me after this entitled b**** was picking on me for my glasses, although the frames WERE awful lol. We found we had a lot in common and just started hanging out. We're both bisexual, I lean towards guys and she leans towards girls. She was the first person I came out to.

Starting about 4 years ago, BFF would ditch me all the time for her SO. She left me hanging at the cinema at a very sad movie so she could go to the same one with her girlfriend at different cinema. And that's only one instance.

BFF was really big part of my support system when my depression was really bad. Although, whenever I really needed her she wasn't there. When she was in a rough place, I was always there for her. That ended up being a common theme in our friendship.

Senior year, BFF stopped coming to school for about a week. She wasn't answering any texts or calls and I was crazy worried. BFF texted me once, and 5 AM on a Wednesday morning, to tell me she was air lifted to the hospital because of TSS (Toxic Shock Syndrome) and she ghosted me for 3 weeks afterward and ignored me every time I tried to wish her well or see how she was doing.

Everytime BFF was in a 'rough place' (her words, they meant anything from a deep depressive episode to the flu) she would ghost me and I sometimes I didn't know if she was alive or not because of the TSS incident.

This would happen all the time, sometimes for months. She ignored me when a close friend died in a boat accident, she ignored me on my birthday, she ignored me when my father started drinking again after 5 years sober, yet she expected me to drop everything for her.

It was after a long and hard semester at college that BFF wanted me to drive home, about 3 hours, and be at her side and doing things for her that I snapped. I told her how mad I was that she never apologized for anything and how she was never there when I needed her. BFF told me she would be driving up a few weeks later and we could talk and clear the air, and then she stood me up.

I told her I didn't want to see her, or have anything to do with her, because she was selfish and rude and I couldn't handle it anymore.

But I can't get over the good times. BFF bought us tickets to our favorite band for my birthday, supported me when I came out, got me a beautiful purple bracelet that had a stone just the right length for me to fidget with because it helps my ADD to mess with things when I work. There were times when she was a great friend and we could just hang out and talk for hours, but I don't feel like it makes up for all the times she was a bad friend.

1616,Not the A-hole,"This year, I \[20F\] lived with my best friend \[20M\] who was dating a girl \[19F\] on the autism spectrum. She is clearly a high functioning and intelligent person, and in our one-on-one interactions, was quite pleasant and a good conversationalist. From what I understand, she struggles most with social nuance. 

I enjoyed her company for the first two months she and my roommate dated. I considered her a friend. However, she started tracking his phone, needed to have his Google calendar, and had to text him constantly. She would have meltdowns and stage crises to get his attention if he left her alone for twenty minutes or more. She would also text me at two in the morning asking where he was if she didn't get an immediate reply.

I spoke to my roommate about my concerns with some of her possessive behavior. She found out that I said these things and began spreading nasty rumors around the school about me. She was in theater and left her mic on at a rehearsal--so it picked up her saying some extremely harsh things (ex. that I was a bitch, clingy to my roommate, and had issues.) Those who heard it addressed it with me and I was able to dispel them since I generally have a good reputation among my classmates. I stopped talking to her completely.

She noticed and asked me what was wrong. I said that I knew she had been saying unkind things about me and didn't like how she treated my best friend. She apologized and asked if I wanted to be friends again, and as politely as I could, I let her know that it wasn't a good idea for either of our sanity to stay close to each other anymore. I fell out with my best friend because of it and we're not talking anymore. I moved out at the end of the year.

He's pretty adamant about it being a flat earth and he will probably launch into some diatribe about his beliefs so I think I already know the answer, but hey that's my sense of humor and I also could see it as hilarious. Thoughts?

Edit: This is absolutely 100% not a troll or s/post whatsoever. I'm sorry some people have nothing better to do than to Spost or troll people, but that is not the case at all. If I didn't care about his friendship I would link to his FB so you can all see for yourself but I am not going to do that. I am friends with him because I know his whole family, I am friends with all of them from his mom to his uncles, brother, cousins and even his kids are friends with my kids. Our friendship is strong and he's not going to be butthurt and in his feelings over this he will tell me to Foff, maybe punch me in the arm and then move on. Anyways it's a small minority that think I shouldn't do it and that have no sense of humor, I am going to get him a real gift, not just the gag gift globe. And thanks for all the support and the people that still have a sense of humor in this day and age. It will be done and I will update, so click that save button or use the remind bot, party is Saturday so check back on Sunday. Peace, love and chicken grease, I'm out for now.

Update: I didn't video the unveiling, but it was funny AF! He was a little bit irritated about it, but he took it with humor he said who the F got me this a couple times to the crowd, I couldn't keep from busting up laughing and fessing up to doing it, he was like fuck u bud, lol'ing, then I gave him some wax and a blunt as the real gift, his mom gave him shit about being FE, and we all kinda clowned on him for a few mins,he took it great, talked shit back & his one conspiracy theory cousin was on his side, they pushed back a little bit but we all just joked and laughed and got on with the party. 10/10 highly recommend it to anyone who has a FE friend who has a sense of humor.",1042,7766,0.95
1618,No A-holes here,"My family (Me, my wife, and her brother and his wife),  took a beach trip last week to celebrate the excruciating heat and beginning of a grueling summer. We were having a fun day, it wasn't too crowded and we found a perfect spot away from too many people. A couple hours in, my wife and I had to use the restroom and took a trip together to the public bathrooms. 

Now I'm not sure about her, but I'll be honest with you all and say it bluntly. I had to poop.

Once we got to the restrooms, she went into the women's room and I went into the men's. I immediately noticed something weird. There were four stalls, and none of them had a door. Three of them were empty and one man was sitting down staring right at me as I walked past. We made eye contact. 

I don't even consider myself a private person but I did NOT want to poop with a bunch of other dudes able to stare at me. 

I walked back out and when I saw my wife I told her what was up. She thought it was weird too that there weren't any doors on the stalls and said that there WERE doors in the woman's room. Then she said I should just go into the woman's room and while I was hesitant at first, nature was calling and I had to do what I had to do. 

Cut to me walking out and washing my hands, a woman with two little kids is standing at the sink and gives me a dirty look. Obviously I knew why but I tried to be quick and run out since I knew I didn't belong. 

Later in the day the same woman walked past out blanket area and said loudly to who I assume was her husband ""that's the pervert"". 

My wife and I could only laugh about it but I still wonder if it makes me an asshole to use the women's restroom simply because I was being a baby about not having privacy while pooping.",219,473,0.96

The kid is limping pretty bad but there's no blood and he's not screaming so probably a sprain. The kid takes out his cellphone and starts playing some online game with the volume on full blast. People are in pain, feverish and exhausted and trying to be as comfortable as possible but this thing is loud! I'm there with my wife who's broken her hand. I ask nicely and get ignored. So I flip out and threaten to flush his phone down the toilet. As I'm yelling the duty nurse finally heaves her ass out of her desk and tells me to quiet down, oh and Sir?

1621,Not the A-hole,"Last year in October, I brought a guy home from a party and we had sex. 

When we left the party we were going the same way, but when we reached the busstop, the guy said that he didn't want to go home and that he would rather just find a place to sleep. I understood the hint and offered him to sleep at my place which was close to the party. 

I just want to make it clear that I was fully aware that he intended to have sex with me and I consented to it.

The day after he left early because I had plans with some friends and we agreed that we would text each other.

We flirted a bit over text, but I soon realized that I wasn't really into him, so when he asked me out I would make up some sort of excuse. Then, in December he wrote in a metaphor that he would really want to have sex with me again, and I told him I was not interested.

After that I didn't hear from him in quite some time and kind of hoped that he had forgotten about me. But then he wrote to me this May, and I made friendly conversation, because I don't want to be rude and ignore him. He then turned the conversation back to the time we had sex and asked to see me again. I then told him that I was kind of confused about what he wanted from me and that I'm not interested in seeing him again.

I thought I made myself clear, but he's been texting me on/off ever since and I've kept telling him that I'm not interested. Today, however, he wrote that I owe him see him again and that he kind of expected me to give him a kiss and a hug, which I really don't want to do.

I've talked to my friends about this and they all think that I am in the right, but I want an unbiased opinion, so am I the asshole for not wanting to see him?",38,56,0.8

1623,Not the A-hole,"I (29 M) met a girl (19 F) a couple months ago, and we hit it off instantly. It turned into a sexual relationship halfway through our first date, and we were both into rougher stuff, so it was amazing. Quickly we started staying the night with each other, and one morning waking up at hers, she asked if I'd like to take some acid with her and go to the beach. Now I hadn't done anything outside smoking cannabis for the last 11 years or so, but she honestly made me feel so great and I didn't have work or my son that day, so decided to do it. During that trip, she began to touch me sexually, and I was really too far gone to comprehend what was going on, but knew it felt great and just went with it. We did not use protection that night. *This is where it gets to the drama.*

Long story short, she had lied and told me she was 22. She definitely gave me no reason to think she was lying. Up to this point, we had gone out to bars, restaurants where they checked her ID, and had some stay in nights where she brought the booze and cannabis, and I made dinner. No red flags telling me she was three years younger so far. This went on for about six weeks until she started getting late night phone calls. We agreed we were not boyfriend and girlfriend or in a relationship, so I never pryed into knowing what was going on. That is until about two and a half weeks ago, where she out of the blue tells.me she needed her stuff back from my house, and that she was going to get back with her ex boyfriend. I just kinda felt it sucked because we were having a lot of fun together, but I sucked it up and just told her farewell and take care. Well, she had asked me during that phone call if her coin purse was anywhere at my house because it had her debit card in it. I look and find it behind my dresser. I peer inside to check if her debit cards are inside, and I find her set of IDs. Her real one showing she was born in 2000, and her fake saying 1997. 

She came by to pick it up, and I confronted her wanting to know why she'd lie about her age like that. Her response is what made me not care about not seeing her any longer: ""Why the fucks it matter? I'm done with you anyway and we both got what we needed."" I didn't retort and just let her leave. 

Fast forward to yesterday. I get a phone call after not hearing from her for almost three weeks. She's pregnant. I told her it's been long enough where it could be her boyfriend's, and she is adamant that it could only be mine. I ask what she wants to do (her body her choice 100%), and she says she doesn't know. I explain to her there is absolutely no way I would want to be with anyone who acted the way she did, but I would support the child of it's mine, and also go with her for an abortion if that's also what she chooses, but in no way will we have a relationship together. She got upset, called me an asshole, told me I was a dead beat, etc. My friends are divided saying it was one mistake and she was just being stupid, and half are saying that's life.",89,199,0.9

1625,Not the A-hole,"Couple months ago my sis-in-law announced a 3rd child on the way.  Her kids are two and six.  She is currently working as a nurse with a 3x12 schedule.  Her husband works a normal 9-5 with all the bells and whistles and even has the ability to work from home.  The two of them together earn at the top end of middle class income.  They have three cars on the newer end which are all financed:  SUV, Van, and a weekend sports car.  They moved into a larger house last year - 2000 sqft to a 4,500 sqft.  They do NOT cook and eat at home.  They go out on weeknights and weekends to always try the newest hole in the wall that just opened up.  The sis-in-law has crippling credit card debt as she has a pattern of being irresponsible with money, approximately $25K.  She also has an outstanding student loan that has not been paid off that my wife signed for.  Cherry on top:  My wife quit her job at one point to watch her first born because she and the husband were having money issues.  I remained quiet as it was her family and I trusted she knew what she was doing.  Worst part?  I’ve had to deal with this type of behavior for the last seven years where we are always picking up the tab or buying the kids clothes because they NEED it.  We have also loaned them quite a bit of money which we’ll probably never see.

&nbsp;

Last week she and the hubby had some time to kill before heading over to a friend's pool party.  Sis in law immediately begins complaining about money and how she is so tired and hasn't had a moment to rest all week.  I started out calmly by asking her why don’t you create a budget for both time management and money?  It was as if I nudged a ripe pimple.  She blew up accusing me of not knowing how difficult her life is and to stay in my lane.  That was the red button – With the fury of a thousand Ned Flanders I let seven years of built up frustration spear her in the eyeballs.  Short of the long is I informed her of her shit habits with time and money and she needs to lock it up especially with a third child on the way and to figure her shit out because we are not going to be around forever.  It is unfair to ask even family for help when you yourself have not exhausted all options to cut costs and do your best to make do and live within your means.

&nbsp;

Wife thought I was an asshole and mean.  I disagree – no one has ever said anything to her and the underlying behavior needs to be corrected as it’s impacting everyone.  Before anyone asks, the kids were not present.  Sidenote:  My wife and I are savers and try to put away as much as possible for early retirement.  We have a goal in mind.  This has been taking away from it for the last seven years.

&nbsp;

**Reddit AM I THE ASSHOLE?**

&nbsp;

**Edit:**  for those saying no one wants unsolicited advice, she has come crying to us about how to consolidate her debt and hide it from her husband.  Twice actually.

&nbsp;

**Edit2:**  For those wanting to know the aftermath

&nbsp;

Sis-in-law and Brother-in-law have decided to ban me from seeing their children. I'm upset about it but I will move on. They took to social media and I'm now a clown with no love for family. They left out quite a few details and painted me as someone who doesn't understand what it means to be family because apparently you always help family no matter what. Apparently if she has a miscarriage I'm somehow responsible now. I've decided not to fight back. Anyone that knows my wife and I also knows how much we have helped. They are digging their own graves and I'm going to let them.

&nbsp; 

I tried speaking to my wife but she was upset so I decided to hand write a letter to her. I slipped it in her work bag as she was leaving for work. The letter was NOT an ultimatum. The contents of the letter outlined how much we have done in the last seven years with INCREASING frequency. She called me a few hours later and decided to take a half day off work to come home and talk to me. She walked through the door and gave me a hug and said she spoke with her sister. As of today we are 100% cutting them off from any type of help. This means no more money and more importantly... TIME. She cried and claimed it was one of the most difficult things she has done as it meant she had to accept her sister was taking advantage of her all this time. I told my wife lets just leave it as everyone is to blame. I'm sure if we had nipped it in the bud early on this would not have snowballed as much as it has. She felt much better with that explanation.

1626,Asshole,"My wife has gained some weight over the last year, and keeps beating herself up over it. She’s always sadly talking about her sizes and calling herself too big. She lost her excitement with shopping and a few months ago I guess I made a step to change that.

She’s always asking me to get things for her while she’s in the dressing room, new sizes etc. She told me to get a pair of jean shorts for her in a size 6 (this size is too small for her now by a lot. She’s kind of in denial about this and always asks for a size 6 and then gets very upset when it won’t fit at all. She’s more of a size 10 or 12 now. )

I don’t know... I got a bigger size and changed the sticker on the jeans so it said size 6. When it fit she was so happy and kept showing me and saying she’s so proud. She said she must have lost weight but doesn’t know what she did. She bought them feeling very confident with herself. When we got home, I cut the tag off the shorts. 

I didn’t mean to but a few times after that I did it again. I guess it was part wanting to see my wife happy and part not knowing how to deal with the same meltdown happening every time. She looks really beautiful even if she gained some weight. I kept doing this and only recently did she realize that the tags on her clothes are missing. She asked me about it and I said I didn’t know, maybe the store doesn’t use them, but she googled the store and proved they did. 

I had to come clean and now she’s furious. She keeps saying I’m an asshole and treating her like an idiot, lied to her, stuff like that. My heart is broken too. We haven’t spoken in days.

AITA?

EDIT: I can’t believe this became so big and I feel way too overwhelmed. Hard for me not to delete the post because some people are being very cruel to me and sometimes also to my wife. Insulting her doesn’t make me feel better and I don’t know I feel like I understand the mistake I made but not everything I’m seeing here helped me get there.

1627,Not enough info,"Tldr: I'm perceived as mean to my wife's friend's kids cuz i feel the mother ain't taking care of her kids when they stay the weekend at my house.  


My wife has a super close friend.  They grew up together (in a different country). 

Friend, let's call F, has three kids, raging from 4ish to 8ish.  F left her home country to live in our country as her husband was batshit nuts and extremely abusive.

Because my wife lives here now (it is a developed, place), F thought she should move here.

So she did and is making her life here. 

Few things, F doesn't speak nearly any English (yet) kids are learning but still a long way to go.

Oldest kid has a learning problem (obviously due to crazy violent husband), middle kid is fluent already and easy going, the youngest has a behavioural issue and throws crazy tantrums often.

F and kids come to my house about once a month for the weekend.  My wife is F's only real family here so i get it.. She needs to be with her friend and it's basically like being at families house... I understand completely. 

They have a great time together every time.  The kids too,including my daughter.

Kicker is F's kids drive me insane... Im pretty patient but dammit her kids are nuts and I finally realized i get so angry not because of the kids but because F doesn't do anything... Just let's them run wild and my daughter is definitely picking up on their mannerisms, including F's youngest's tantrums. Luckily mine doesn't understand what that is yet but she does mimic that behaviour.

So they were at my house recently and we were planning on going out and the kids were trying to play with my neighbours dog through the fence (i don't know him well and we are not friends)... I told the kids to leave the dog alone and to play with our treehouse etc.  As I don't want the kids getting bit or the owner getting mad... Keep in mind, F is nowhere to be found..

Anyways, my wife said i was being an asshole and that I'm always mean to the kids. 

Edit : I should add that if there is any time i feel my daughter is at risk, thus is when i get involved.  Sometimes, the youngest will take toys away from my daughter or push her so she can have what she wants.  I don't let that go... I get (I feel not mean)  involved just to ensure my daughter doesn't get bullied or taken advantage of. 

Also i will be the tough one if things are getting dangerous or my house is in danger... The kids have already painted nail polish on my couch and it's stained.  They swing things dangerously close to my daughter and i have to interject. 

Again, I'm more upset at the mom but i do understand that she can't handle everything as she would go nuts.

1628,Not the A-hole,"This is a complicated one.

Important details:
I'm 6.5 months pregnant. We moved to a new apartment 7 months ago, and it's still not how I would like it. Husband is dealing with unexpected pregnancy by throwing himself into the family Amway business, swearing he's going to replace my income so I can quit my job and stay home. We're already financially stable, and it would not be the end of the world if I quit. He's nowhere near his goal, with only a couple of months left to go before baby. He's decided to take every opportunity to either ""work on the business"" or catch up with friends before the baby arrives. When he's not doing that, he's ""taking a break,"" spending hours playing PC games. This means he's gone or occupied a lot, and rarely seems to have time for me or the things we still need to do. Last weekend he flew to another city to play games with his former roommate all weekend. Same friend he already sets aside time for every Monday night to play games. I feel like he's finding excuses to run away from his responsibilities as husband and father. The only things I've asked him to research are car seats and strollers. Months later we still have neither.

We've also had a couple of big financial expenditures lately.  Bought a new (used) car for him because his old car was ready to cough out its engine. We also took an overseas babymoon (planned and booked prior to the car troubles). Again, financially stable, so these were okay. But I'm still trying to be cautious with any more large expenses.

HERE'S THE PROBLEM:
Husband's grandpa lives overseas, has fallen ill, and has been hospitalized for several weeks. MIL and FIL are already there to help. It's been slow, but Gpa is improving, and seems to be out of any immediate danger. This whole time, I've been ready to say, ""it's okay, go, you need to be with your family"" in the event of things taking a turn for the worst. Family is more important than a pricey plane ticket. But I feel like his parents have decided that everyone needs to fly in anyway and help out with other things. They decided that Husband should come over first (but not quite yet - they told him to wait a few weeks), and then his brother could come in August. Which makes me think this isn't such an emergency anymore. The red flag for me came last night when Husband told me he'd be able to ""meet people,"" which usually means ""find people to pitch the Amway business to."" His parents have a branch of their Amway business in this country, and I know he wants a part of it. Immediately my entire impression changed, and I feel like he's using this ""emergency"" as an excuse to run away from his responsibilities at home. We had a big fight over it, because now I can't help but doubt his intentions. MIL already told Gpa that Husband was coming, so now I feel like if I keep him from going, I could be the asshole that keeps a dying man from seeing his grandson one last time.",73,163,0.9
1629,Not the A-hole,"Last night my girl and I went to a bar to meet up with some friends. Casual conversation, pool, and good drinks.

Well me and one of my friends got into some philosophical conversation and I mentioned how I recently got into reading, and how you can understand how the author thinks through their wordplay.

More convos and we start talking about books written by evil people. Eventually I mentioned wanting to read Mein Kampf, and then the girl my friend was with came into the convo with ""excuse me?!"" I explained that I'd want to read it to see how Hitler's thought process was, and she completely lost it, telling me how I'm an asshole for even considering to read a book written by a monster, and that you don't need to read his book to know that he was an evil person.

I tried explaining myself but she kept yelling at me (and our mutual friend), and stormed off with a ""have a good night."" I've never had anyone walk angrily away from me before so I didn't know how to react, and laughed nervously.

My friend saw this and said that wasn't cool, and that I mentioned Hitler for the sake of shock factor. I find this really weird, since everyone seemed fine when we were talking about Tex Watson's book (Charles Manson's 1st mate) right before Mein Kampf came up.

The night went on and eventually my friend gets a text from the girl stating that she's not associating herself with a Nazi-lover (irrelevant info but I'm Mexican and proud of my roots, so this caught me off-guard).

He asks me to apologize to just get this over with and I refuse under my girlfriend's advice, stating that there's nothing for me to be sorry about, and we leave.

This morning my gf brings it up again, asking if I really did want to read Mein Kampf and wasn't just being a douche. I said yes and I was not saying it to be an edgelord.

1631,Asshole,"TL;DR: Went on a trip with a friend. Didn't explicitly say I was sharing a room and now my GF thinks it's at a deceit level equivalent to me not being trustworthy. She's ready to end the relationship over this.

&#x200B;

My female friend, whom I met on a trip last year on one of those adventure tours groups, asked if I wanted to go on a trip since we seemed to travel well. I talked to my GF and she was supportive. Before I left, I set up a shared cloud folder of all of my travel arrangements with my GF and I asked her to print off the stuff. 

&#x200B;

At the first hotel and I video call my GF. She seemed off in the call and commented on the single bed. I was confused. I showed her the hotel has two twin beds close together. We were texting as usual. At the next hotel, I called her again. My friend came into the shot, the mood changed and the call ended. We talked again later and she seemed ok so I figured, whatever was wrong might be about something going on at home. For the rest of the trip, I continued to call/message and all I received were curt responses. I took it as a hint that maybe she's forcing me not to talk and to go enjoy my trip (she's told me to do so before). Returning home, my GF is distant. I tell her about my trip, showed her all my photos and videos. Talked about my new friends and the hookups they got into. She then tells me she didn't know I was sharing rooms with my friend. I'm deadpan confused and she tells me not to play this surprised card on her. WTF. The trip took months to plan and I reminded her of the calls to the tour group, organizing and getting on the same flights, tour dates and accommodations. She said booking doesn't mean sharing a room.  I reminded about the docs but she said she didn't want to access them because it seemed like a private. She said it seemed that I was intentionally not telling her, that I was deceitful because I should have known her jealous tendencies would need me to spell it out for her. From her perspective, it led her to think I might be hiding more. 

&#x200B;

After I went to bed separately, she sent me a text to say she thought she was enough. She forwards me one of the pics I sent her while on the trip of me and my friend out at a club and she said it was uncalled for and mean. I repeated that it didn't register to me what she was upset over at the time. I said she should have told me then but I apologized for not digging further. I'm at a loss. This morning she left me a note saying she thought she wasn't enough for me and that she was right. I want to talk to her when she gets home. I'm not sure I'm going to get far when she's this angry.",48,31,0.8

1633,Not the A-hole,"I'll try to keep this short. 

For Father's day, I posted a picture of me and my father for Father's Day, like a lot of people do. He passed away over 5 years ago so I had put in a ""RIP"" at the end of my post. 

My stepmother for years has requested I remove the ""RIP"" from my posts about him because of one reason.... She hasn't told anyone in her family that he's passed away. 

She has explained to her family that he's on a business trip whenever they ask to talk to him or see him on Skype. She also occasionally posts pictures of them seemingly like they were just taken to keep this lie afloat. 

Her reasoning for not telling them is two fold, one is that she's simply not ready to tell them, two is because in her culture supposedly widows have failed their husbands. You see, she is the only one of her family that is in America and she got over here on a marriage visa. So it's not a culture I am 100% used to. 

Also I guess they never told her family that he had cancer since before they were married so any of those posts she wants removed as well.

So when she demanded this time around saying that I just don't understand because I am too young and have never been married... I kinda lost it finally and said I am not ever going to delete my posts about my father and I don't care if her family finds out, they deserve to know.  It's been longer since he's passed than how long they knew each other including the marriage. I really laid into it. 

Now she's crying and called me a bad son. 

Am I the Asshole?",153,1069,0.96
1634,Not the A-hole,"Hello! This is my first Reddit post. My brother(25) is getting married in a few months. His fiancee, who is nice, invited me to be a bridesmaid. This was 100% out of feeling obligated to because I am her fiance's sister, not because we are friends. We have had very limited conversation, so I appreciate the gesture.

So I was invited to the bachelorette party, which they are planning to have in Canada (we live in America, at a distance where you need a plane ride to get to Canada) for FOUR days straight to do a wine tour. They picked a random weekend plus thursday and friday for this, to which I immediately said I can't go because I am starting grad school three weeks prior. Since I am in an accelerated grad program, I go to class twice a week (thursday and friday) from 9am-4:30pm straight. And you can not miss class for this program, they were very clear about that.

So they then asked me if I can go straight to the airport after class friday and hop on a plane and go to canada for friday night, saturday, and part of sunday and then fly home. Plus I need to pay for all my housing and plane tickets and food. Considering I just graduated from college a week ago, have no job, and am going further in debt to get my Masters, I said I don't have the money (which is true, I have less than my rent money that is due in two weeks).

My brother replied by telling me to ask mom and dad and that is will only be like $300 (which I sincerely doubt it will be that cheap). Plus my brother and I grew up together, so he should know they are not going to do that happily. Plus they already gave him $10k for the wedding.

Just to add the cherry on top, my brother definitely was the asshole to me last week and I haven't completely forgiven him, which is making me want to go to this canada thing less. (long story short, he ""couldn't"" make it to my graduation, yet he was able to go to his fiancee's sister graduation a few states over) I know an eye for an eye makes the world blind, but I am seriously upset about that still so its affecting my decision a lot, too.

But I got a text from my brother saying that his fiancee was really upset that lots of people blew her off and to look out for an updated date for the trip that will work for everyone. He told me it means a lot to her that I come and should really try my best to come. He said he would talk to our parents about having them pay for the trip. So I don't know what to do. I don't want to go on this trip much anymore, especially since I am not close with his fiancee and know none of her friends, and don't have the funds. Would I be the asshole for blowing it off and not being appreciative of her invitation into the wedding party? And if I say I still can't go after they change the dates, will that make me a bigger jerk for still not going?

EDIT: Just some extra info, my family is not close at all and I've never been to a wedding so I am not sure what is normal

1636,Not enough info,"So I live in a rural area. I have my own homestead farm that I share with my wife. We have a few acres of land, grow most of our own food, and are not hurting for money.

&#x200B;

My wife and I split our chores for the homestead evenly I like to think. I tend to the goats, pigs, chickens, and ducks. The garden, the field, and the harvest mostly by myself. If we need more hands I hire them. I do all the repairs around the house that I built for us, the electic, the plumbing, the furnace, drilled a few wells, and so on.

&#x200B;

My wife has taken over more domestic duties. She prefers to work more inside the house. She tends to the laundry. She cooks our meals (which are wonderful), she dusts, sweeps, makes all the beds and folds all the clothes. She preserves what's preservable from the garden, cleans the slaughters, makes soap for us and to sell. She is very hard working.

&#x200B;

Recently after supper we were sitting in the living room when she asked me that she would like me to stop drinking. I am not a heavy drinker. I have a glass of whisky before dinner and another one before bed. This is how my father drank. This is how his father drank. I have never been a drunk, nor do I have any intention of being a drunk.

&#x200B;

I asked her for a reason and she said that she was worried for my health. My family is very long lived. All of the men on our side have lived to 90 and more. I topld her this and mentioned that I am not a drunk.

&#x200B;

I like to have a drink at the end of a long day. I am in perfect health for my age. I don't smoke. I just want to have a drink when I'm done with my chores.

Am I the a--hole?  


Edit: I have a shot of whisky in a glass with ice before dinner. Then I have another around 9:30 when we get into bed. I'll drink it while I read my book then I turn off the light and sleep around 10.",240,540,0.97

1638,Not the A-hole,"So I suffer from depression as well, I also do therapy from time to time, but I’ve been feeling better since I stopped overthinking. I used to workout all the time, and that really helps me. I told her that a while ago, my therapist said to see if working out on a consistent basis still helps me, and if not then I should try medication. I told the therapist this is what worked for me in the past so I was going to get back on a workout schedule. 

When I told my friend this she said that is horrible that my therapist said that to me because “working out doesn’t cure mental illness.” I told her that it helps tremendously when you try, but it doesn’t cure everything. I told her that mental illness is a reason but not an excuse to improve your health and life. 

She is constantly depressed that it’s a major topic of conversation, in public she always said she’s anxious despite therapy and medication. I told her “try going on walks, you live right by a bike path, I think just five minutes a day could help a lot.” And then she goes on to explain that people have been murdered (?) on that bike path and that she has “never been an exercise person.” 

I feel bad for even mentioning this. The denial is just so frustrating. Every time I say “oh hey, I went hiking today.” It’s pure negativity and “I hate hiking and walking.” Like good for you? 

She is incredibly overweight and she’s a good friend, but I truly think she would feel so much more confident and happier if she tried. I don’t think working out is a cure, but it’s good to start eating healthier for the sake of your body and mind.

I know it’s not my decision what she wants to do with her life but am I an asshole for what I said?

Edit: this is the first time I offered advice. She complains about her weight and depression almost every single day.",147,143,0.87
1639,Not the A-hole,"So recently my older sister asked me to purchase a Nintendo Switch for my nephew's third birthday. And I haven't replied yet because I don't think I'm obligated to give expensive gifts. My reasoning is that's he's barely turning 3, I don't regularly see or talk to this sister or nephew because they live in Canada and I live in the US, I have never even bought the kid a gift before, nor does he even really know who I am. I told my other sibling that I do talk to regularly and she says I'm an asshole because it's a once in a while thing and I'm supposedly his godfather (I had no idea). However, I don't like the idea of an estranged sibling coming out of the woodworks asking for expensive gifts. I wouldn't mind if it was something appropriate for a 3 year old and reasonably priced, but that's not the case. WIBTA here?",91,120,0.92
1640,Not the A-hole,"I recently moved into a new state and decided to try to branch off into a different field of work. I have been work in health care, but have decided to pursue working with animals. I have always enjoyed working with animals and thought that it now or never. I already made a big life change with moving. So I began working at a Kennel to gain some hands on experience. 

The job is a small, family run business. The kennel is next door to the Boss’ house. There are 3 workers, will call them M, L and J, J being the Boss’ daughter. From the first day of work (I worked there for almost a month), I was to be trained by M. I got rubbed the wrong way by him since day 1. Just got weird vibes. On the 1st shift I worked, I accidentally fed a dog the wrong food because he just threw me into everything & didn’t explain the labeling system for the food. He didn’t want to answer my questions, kept showing off it felt. Wanted to assert his dominance p quickly. Whatever. 

I’m 3 shifts in, and he is still training me. I’m continually getting more and more bad vibes from him. He starts yelling at the dogs to be quiet in a really unnecessary manner, calling the dogs disgusting and making comments about how he hates dogs. 

Finally the breaking point came when we did 11 am let outs. A dog had messed in it’s kennel and he FLIPS. Starts cussing, swearing, kicking at the dogs, throwing buckets and shit. One dog won’t go out and he shoved her out the metal kennel doors. I tell him to go take a second and he ignores me. I left my shift at 11:30 am, and called the boss. I was so furious I was ready to quit. She talks me down, promises I won’t have to work with him, begs me not to leave. Makes excuses for his behaviors, saying he emotional and probably intimidated by me (I was in nursing, this kid is going to school to be a nurse, etc). I end up agreeing to stay.

Flash forward a week and I haven’t worked with him, the boss and J are training me, I haven’t seen M in a while. Then, I find out he left a dog unattended on the groom table & the dog almost HUNG ITSELF. He isn’t fired. 
I eventually had to work with him. I had a morning shift 2 days ago with L and M. The minute the Boss leaves to go back to her house, L and M start acting like assholes. I was being ignored & spoken to like a child. All of a sudden, M pulls me into the grooming room and tells me to get a little dog and put them on the grooming table. He says he is going to teach me something. He goes to grab a brush and he knocks things over. He FLIPS out, starts cussing and getting v angry. The dog gets scared. Luckily I’m holding her. L comes running in, asking him “are you okay, M?” He goes “Just fucking stab me in the heart or fucking shoot me.” He completely fucking lost it. 

I walked out of that shift and haven’t gone back. I can’t believe after everything the Boss was willing to keep him on and not fire him. If he does these things around a brand new person, what is he doing when he is on shift alone???",36,65,0.9
1641,Not the A-hole,"I've been tossing and turning with this and don't know where I sit at the moment. Please forgive me for my formatting sins

Bit of background info; 
I'm a 22f Since I graduated I have worked flat out for the last 6 years saving money, getting qualifications an trying my best to be a good person. Living independently in another state away from family and being responsible as possible.
My sibling 21m on the other hand dropped out 2 years before graduation hasnt acomplished a single thing since. Has been living off dole money, holding a job for a day then quitting. He openly admits he doesn't want to work and money can't make him happy. Yet he asks for things that require money he doesnt have. in doing this he has finiacially burdened everyone who's come into contact with. He's been given so many opportunities to learn or work an shoved them back in people's faces. 

In the last 2 years he's been getting more spiritual he's very involved with crystals and energy healing and related things. He's said he's a prophet, and that he can cure cancer. This offends me deeply as our grandmother is actually dying of cancer and for him to suggest that he can cure it with some rocks makes me upset more than words can describe. 

Now this morning I woke up to 3 different people messaging me asking if I know what's going on with my brother. 
He posts a lot of nonsense about being a wizard and namaste and claiming he's got all these life tips and that he's  special because he's a spiritual healer. 
My brothers posted a video of him doin wild fucked up whale noises in a sewerage drain saying it's frequency healing. 
The video goes for 5 minutes and I couldn't make it past 10 seconds it was such a horrid r/sadcringe moment. 
I commented on it I feel I shouldn't have but I'm so sick of getting messages from people. I just said that this is getting to be absolute nonsense and said anyone who actually believes in this has fried their brain on hallucinagenics. Now obviously this kicked it off. And he's saying before I judge him I should take a look at myself and a lotta backwards talk. 

Now my mum & other family members says I'm the asshole because I should just let him do what he wants and he's happy so why should I put my 2 cents in.
She's also the mum who only answer my calls and messages once a year when she needs something. 

I want the best for him. I can't keep dealing with this and having my mum enable his mental illness is just driving me mad in the process. 
I've blocked the both of them on all social media's to stop me from dealing with daily embarrassment. 

Am I the assholes for saying something to my sibling about his spiritual delusions?
 I don't know how to explain to him that it's not normal or productive to be wailing in a drainpipe on a workday. 
And I've stressed to him that our mutual friends have been messaging me worried about his mental health and asking me if he's on drugs

1642,Not the A-hole,"Our dog, who is a pug and is 12 years old, was diagnosed with a malignant sarcoma on his upper gum about 5 months ago. We visited 5 vets; all have told us that while they can perform surgery and de-bulk the tumor, the tumor will grow back. Chemo is around $450 a month, FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. Surgery would be $1500 - $4500. Every vet has strongly suggested that we humanely euthanize him sooner than later. We reached out to a traveling vet that euthanizes pets at home. He specifically told us that we should think about our dog’s quality of life and to also think about the mental anguish that he will specifically face when he euthanizes a dog in agonizing pain.

With all that being said, we started giving him RSO, THC and CBD versions along with gabapentin, tramadol, and prednisone. One of the cannabis products we give him is CBD companion, which is bacon flavored CBD oil that comes with an eye dropper. The vet has also been gracious to give us 90 day supplies of medications.

My wife and I agreed that our dog would let us know when it was time for him to pass. Before his diagnoses, we planned to visit family out of country, me for 2 weeks and her for 2 months with the kids. I cancelled my trip to take care of our dog at the request of her a month or so after his diagnoses. Everything was going well, until about a month ago.

He stopped taking his pill pockets with his medicine and all but refused to eat. He is constantly panting from pain and does not lie down except when he is exhausted from standing all day due to the pain. He can barely walk up the stairs, and if I try to pick him up he yelps in pain. He has lost a lot of weight. The smell alone from the necrotic flesh is nauseating and it is everywhere in the house, Febreeze only works so much. The carpet continually has new stains where he finally lays down that I clean up.

My wife insisted that we continue to give him his medication, so I started compounding his medication with the bacon oil. That's right, I crush his prednisone pill up, empty the gabapentin capsule, add 3 drops of RSO (I combined the CBD and THC RSO's), with .75 ml of bacon CBD oil. I mix it up together, and then suck it all up in the eye dropper. We then squirt the medicine in his mouth and make him swallow it. We do not give Tramadol this way.

They leave to visit family in less than two weeks. I have tried talking with her about euthanizing him before they go, to let her say good bye, but she refuses. She fully expects him to be alive when they return in August with visiting family. She continually tells me that I am being negative and that if I was more positive that he would feel that and get better, she has specifically said that she is hoping for a miracle.

I wanted to say good bye 4 months ago, when he could still go to the dog park, when he could still eat a meal without being in tremendous pain, when he could sleep through the night. WIBTA if I put my dog to sleep soon after they go on vacation?

Edit: Today as a family we walked him down the Rainbow Bridge. Thank you to all for your advice, both good and bad. Even in insult I found insight and I sincerely appreciate that.",724,2315,0.97
1643,Not the A-hole,"So for background on the argument my girlfriend and I have been together for 6 and a half years. The relationship between her parents and I started off a little rocky when they caught us hooking up in their house when they were gone. However, around six years later, we have since then smoothed most things out and they have accepted me in. 

My girlfriend and I have also recently got a new puppy and we are still in the process of training him. One of the things we have been trying to enforce is not get him into the habit of begging for food when we have some with us. We have been told by multiple trainers to just ignore him and not give him anything. However, while we have been staying at her parents house visiting before we move out of the state, my girlfriends mother has repeatedly given him food and ignored our requests that she not do that anymore. Today she has done it twice and the second time I snapped and yelled from across the house ""Stopping giving him food ""her name"" and don't act like a child about it either"". (She has stuck her nose in the opposite direction and pretended that she didn't do anything when we have blatantly seen her do it).

 A minute or two later she pulls the two of us aside and tries to lecture us on dogs and how she thinks that all dogs beg and that some dogs are more aggressive in looking for food and ours is just like that. I tried to reinforce my point in saying that all we ask is that she respect our rules with our dog. She then leaves into her room after making it very clear she is not a child. 

My girlfriend then becomes mad at me for snapping at her mother and thinks that it could ruin the entire relationship we have tried to build back up. I understand her point but I don't personally see any other way of confronting her that would have made it stick in her head. My girlfriend has refused to talk to me since this happened a few hours ago. I also attempted to try and apologize for being so ""hostile"" as I put it with her mother saying it was alright in a very passive aggressive tone. Things are still attempting to be smoothed out since then but nothing has happened so far.

So am I the asshole in this situation?",29,36,0.89

1645,Everyone Sucks,"Basically, a few years ago my sister (26) met my future BIL (25) and they began dating. The family all met him and everyone loved him. He and I clicked and quickly became close friends. Hunting together, he'd help me with my car, I'd help him with projects in his garage, etc. Safe to say we were great friends.

&#x200B;

Well a little under two years ago, FBIL cheats on my sister. She was devastated, obviously, and left his ass. For over four months, my parents and I helped comfort her and support her, but damn she was a wreck. I love my sister and have never seen her so distraught. Obviously, the whole family found out why they broke up, and needless to say everyone hated him. Our friendship ended the day they broke up and I honestly thought I'd never see him again and my sister would eventually find herself a good man.

&#x200B;

Well that didn't fucking happen. A year ago, Sister announces to the family that she and FBIL are back together. That they ran into each other and got to talking and she's decided to reconcile. Parents were wary but supportive but I was disgusted.

&#x200B;

So now it's today and FBIL has accompanied Sister to every family event since then. It's been awkward to say the least. Everyone is nice enough to him, but it's clearly not as warm as it was back when they were first dating. For my part, I just ignore him whenever he's nearby and kept interaction with him to an absolute minimum. He's definitely been affected by it and I can tell he wants to reconnect and make good but I'm not entertaining it.

&#x200B;

Things came to a head last weekend when it was announced that Sister and FBIL are engaged. They let us know at a family dinner for father's day and everyone was excited. Everyone except me. I don't know how he's tricked her into this, but he's still the piece of shit who hurt my sister and I'll never consider him family. But after they were done, he asked me if he could talk to me alone. He acknowledged the elephant in the room, that he's hurt Sister and our family, but that he'd like to make amends and heal his relationship with us since our families were about to merge.

&#x200B;

I unloaded on him. I told him in no uncertain terms that I don't care how he got back with my sister, that he's a piece of shit and always will be, that my parents and I will never see him as a member of the family and that my sister deserves better than to spend the rest of her life with a scumbag like him. He didn't say anything, just got real quiet and went back and rejoined the others.

&#x200B;

Today, I get a call from my sister crying and cussing me out. Apparently I had  an impact because FBIL called off the wedding, saying he's not good enough for Sis (true), that he loves her but she should spend her life with someone who her family will accept and that's not him. Now my sister's not talking to me and my parents and brother think I crossed the line and are calling me an asshole for sabotaging their relationship. I think they're being hypocrites. Idk Reddit AITA in this?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I shouldn't have spoken on behalf of my parents, I admit my fault there.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: A lot of people are wondering why he left my Sister so quickly after I confronted him. Honestly I'm not 100% sure. But when I say me and FBIL were thick as thieves, I mean it. We told each other everything. I was there for him when his parents were hospitalized (car accident, both survived). I told him my secrets and he told me his. So I don't think it's a stretch to say he valued my judgment and cares a lot about how I see him.

&#x200B;

EDIT 3: idk why I'm defending him rn, but wtf ever. I'd also like to add that prior to his cheating on my Sister, I honestly thought he was one of the best human beings I'd ever known, the type of guy who'd give you the shirt off his back if you asked. I loved him like a brother. That's what made his betrayal so painful in the first place.

&#x200B;

EDIT 4: Okay, I admit it. I'm an asshole and selfish. I shouldn't have spoken for others and I shouldn't have made it seem like the entire family was against him when really only I was. I suppose I'll have to try and undo some of the damage I've done but I have absolutely no idea how to even begin. This whole thing has been pretty humbling and embarrassing.",684,3096,0.97
1646,Asshole," I work at a catholic Hospital as a secretary.  One day one of my co-workers comes in my office and tells me she has brought her daughter (jr high age) into work because her internet is down at home, so if I see a girl walking around its just her. This co-worker has a back office where no one would even know the wiser her daughter would be in there unless she came out to use the bathroom. She could have not told me and I wouldn't have even known. This co-worker also has hundreds of patient charts stored in her office. The child may know better not to peek through them or whatever, but a simple glance and she could see a name, and what if the name was a fellow classmate and she said something to the classmate about it? Huge breach of HIPAA. I called my manager and told her, hey, I'm not trying to be a tattle tale, the employee told me the reason she brought her in and she has her in her office, which is full of patient charts. She made it seem like it was odd for the reasoning, but didn't make it seem like it was a big deal to have even brought her kid in. She also stated that another co-worker has also brought her daughter in as if to make it seem like its a normal thing. I looked through the policies and there isn't anything specifically mentioned about employees bringing in their children to have at work, but I did reach out to HR to get a clarification about it since I couldn't find anything. She stated:

""We have no provisions that would allow this. This would be very hard to manage, because of the variety of circumstances that could arise. Additionally, this would dramatically affect the ability to perform one’s job/position.

Not having a sitter would be a time that PTO would be utilized. That is why we have a generous attendance policy that allows multiple occurrences.""

This co-worker brings her daughter in again, this time so that she can be utilized to help a student shadowing our department learn how to perform Neuropsych tests. I have not told anyone about this, and no one else was in the office at this time either, except the intern, the co-worker, her daughter and me.

I don't want to make a big deal out of this, and wonder if I even should make a big deal out of this, but this just does not sit well with my work ethics and morals. What's the right thing to do?  I'm afraid of loosing a good relationship with my manager if I do this behind her back.",38,35,0.85
1647,Not the A-hole,"My family and I were going to be gone for 2 weeks & roughly 5000 miles away, so I was desperate for a pet sitter. Eventually someone messaged me after I posted an ad. The pet sitter was informed this was a “stay at the house” job not a “checking in” job. 

The sitter informed me the night before our trip that he/she works 3 jobs.  I was a little concerned regarding the amount of time the sitter would have at the house, but did reiterate they would need to come home & let the dog out.

On the 2nd day in, the sitter is gone working/? from 9:00 a.m. until 7:00 p.m.  Does NOT come by the house during that time to let the dog out.
3rd day...sitter sends me text asking whose truck is in our driveway. Unbeknownst to me, it’s the house painter who stayed for 30 min. As a mother, I can totally understand the uneasiness of a stranger in front of a house.  I let the sitter know it was our painter and the sitter seemed fine afterwards. I did not hear back from sitter for the rest of the night.  At 9:45 pm, the sitter leaves the house.  Does not come back to rest of the night into the morning.  My dog has been alone for 11 hours & no potty break.  I text sitter at 9:00 a.m. the next morning to see where he/she is & has the dog been let out?  No answer.  5 minutes after my text, sitter shows up at my house.

I let the sitter know it was totally unacceptable to be gone all night while I’m paying him/her money to STAY at my house and care for our animals.  Sitter lets me know he/she was “spooked” by the painter & the thunderstorms (which I later learned there weren’t even any thunderstorms that night) and left. Does sitter text me to let me know his/her plans?  No.  
Does sitter take the dog with him/her? No.   
Sitter is let go immediately and asked to leave the house that day. Someone else resumed the job. 

To make a long story short, I forgot to send the sitter a check before I left town for the summer. The sitter “reminded” me, in a very less than polite manner, that I owed her for 2 nights & a 3rd day.  Mind you, she was gone from 9:00 am - 7:00 pm one of those days...and didn’t come by to let the dog out.

I let him/her know that they could come pick up a check in our mailbox.  I was then informed that they didn’t appreciate me “bad talking” them.  If talking about the irresponsible behavior of the sitter  is “bad talking” , then I’m guilty. Would YOU want a pet sitter that takes off and leaves your dog for 11 hours?  The sitter had the nerve to tell me “Your dog was perfectly fine”. The sitter then informed me, in the sitter’s own words: “Maybe you should have asked me if I work like every other teenager trying to afford college. We aren’t all as privileged.”  I guess it’s my fault they left my dog home all night because they have to work 3 jobs to pay for college while my family is “privileged”? My children both have jobs & also have the common decency to turn down other job offers if they know they can’t fulfill them.",28,39,0.87

1649,Asshole,"Ok so My girlfriend is an extremly pretty and smart woman. She and I have been dating for arround 5 years and moved in together 2 years ago . We split the chores arround 40% me 60% her. That was because till last year she was doing her PhD in a field in sociology and was home more often than me and didn't contribute equally finacially, as i work as a biologist in an Uni laboratory and the hours are extremly demanding but my pay is also better. 

She started her new job a few moths back. I can not give away too much information, but she has now longer working hours,field and paperwork. She comes home arround an hour before me on most days so we haven't changed our chore routine because she gets an hour of extra relaxation while i still work .

&#x200B;

So yesterday shit kinda hit the fan. My gf came home 30 Minutes before me and got straight to the couch with some snacks and netflix.

When i came home i saw the mess our appartment was in and asked her politley, why she hasn't got a headstart at cleaning . She just gives me that dirty look and basically spits in my face ""can't you see that i am very tired and need to relax a bit?"" 

I just rolled my eyes at that and went to take a shower. 

When i came out the kitchen was cleaned and gf was making some dinner. I went to fetch a new shirt and saw that our laudry was still dirty.

 Now let me make something clear. That day *her* chores were kitchen bathroom and laudry and *mine* living room and cleaning out our trashcans and taking care of the cat litter box.

I went to her and told her that we needed to play by our rules or else this would look like a trashy appartment. 

She just snapped at me and told me that it was unfair to beginn with. She is tired of cleaning after me like my mother and that i should take more responsibilty for the mess and that she is not my maid.

Then i snapped and told her that i work the whole fucking day and that i don't have the privilege that she has to sit most days at a desk and redact stuff. And that i work harder than she does and deserve more time of because of that.

She just blew up at me and accused me of thinking her field is lesser than mine just because its humanities and that that isn't what she does all day and that i don't respect her as a working woman and that i want her to clean all day.

She left and took the cat to stay at her sisters place .

i have tried callig her but i am also pretty mad that she wouldn't just stick to a plan we both constented to 2 years ago.

AITA or is she just overreacting?

Edit 1:wow I thought I would get like 5 responses. 1 thing... I am not a native English speaker this is not a shit post.
Second  I have mild ocd that's why I flipped at my gf not because I don't respect her.
Third I don't think her work is lesser I just think my workload is harder than that of a sociologist. She doenst have to work with chemicals and eye damaging radiation all day she works with minorities or something like that.
Fourth. She usually does the kitchen and cooks because she is a great cook lol. And she doenst like the way I clean the bathroom for some reason.

Update :guess you were right... I am a raging asshole. I see now how I've bee. Treating humanities like lesser because I think I just don't see the necessity of them in our society.

So a few hours ago my gf came home and I apologize for yesterday. She wasn't having it and said that it was just the straw that broke the camels back.

Apparently she has been unhappy in this relationship for a long time. She feels like I take her for granted and don't take her work seriously.
When I tried telling her that that wasn't true she caught me off-guard with the ""well tell me what I do for a living then""

Well I couldn't say it... That's when I realized that I was a raging asshole.
Well she took her clothes is keeping the cat and I have to do 100% of the chores because I don't have a girlfriend anymore.",868,1569,0.86

This plan has been in progress for over 6 months. Headed to the grand canyon with parents, myself and husband and our child. The parents were supposed to be driving and pulling the trailer so that we can stay inexpensively.

 Father has had carpal tunnel for a year or more and has refused to go to the dr. He finally has an appointment this week. Mother has decided that if he needs surgery,  it should be scheduled next week and has decided they will cancel the vacation.

I am angry that they have decided to do this now.  We have planned for months and have changed schedules and taken time off work.  He had lived with it for a long time and kept saying he was fine.  Why now? I asked if he could wait a week or two but she says it Has To Be Now. Mother says I'm just being an asshole and should just accept that we can't go. We will just be out any deposit and just eat the time off and I'm supposed to be fine with it all.

At this point I'm too angry to go with them even if they decide to schedule for a later date. I'm looking  at other places to go next week for just my husband, child, and myself.   So am I the asshole?

 Per friend: 1 no other issues such as heart problems or neuro.
2 Mom has always been somewhat my way or the highway. Dad is pretty passive. 
3 I hadn't considered the driving aspect being worse with carpal tunnel. I'll ask him if that's why he needs the appointment now when I see him  
4 his PCM had diagnosed him with carpal tunnel a few years ago but he hadn't done anything.  He retired shortly after the diagnosis.  He's going to see a specialist on Thursday.  
5 I don't think they have even thought about pt or other options.  Mom usually goes worst case first.  
6 it was their idea to take the camper instead of hotels.  Dad won't let anyone else drive his camper or truck.  Can't even get a hotel anywhere close at this late stage.  I looked.

For background I am a doctor MD and a surgical resident, I recently started dating a woman, and it became disconcerting to me that in the 1 month I've dated her she's had 3 menstrual cycles.
I asked her about this and said that while this concerned her it's the way her menstrual cycle has always been (in our country it's kind of taboo for people to talk about this so a lot of women are not very educated when it comes to their own cycles/sexual health). She also refers to be frequently tired (which is very telling of a probable iron deficiency vinculated to the irrgulararities in her menstrual cycle) I mentioned all of this to her as nicely as I could and offered to tell her what studies she should get and reassured her that either me or any gynecologist could help her with this, being that the treatment Is very simple and not harmful in most cases. She reacted poorly and said that she does not appreciate the fact that I speak negatively about this like there is something wrong with her. She asked me to not bring it up again and left in very bad mood. I feel that I might have over stepped a boundary in our ""relationship"", but I didn't mean to infringe on her privacy, but at the same time I feel compelled to inform her and help her with this issue as in the long run it can be detrimental to her repruductive health.",161,458,0.95

1657,Everyone Sucks,"So I live in this dense suburb full of apartment buildings. On a Sunday about 4-5 weeks ago my neighbor who seems to be a recent immigrant from an African country put this guitar amp (?) out, right in the middle of his driveway at 8AM and used it to blast music all day long while working on his car, until like 9 PM. I could hear it in every room of my apartment, even with the windows closed. I thought, alright, we all want to have some fun sometimes. Next Sunday came along and so did his music. And another Sunday. I started contemplating what to do about it as it started driving me nuts, and I wasn't sure if I should address it directly with him or just call the cops to avoid him knowing who I am and starting a neighborhood war. Anyway, I ended up doing nothing about it. This last Sunday though, I was out doing the groceries with my girlfriend in the AM and as I was pulling into my driveway, I saw that his speaker was out again and the music on full volume. I got out of my car, dropped the grocery bag, walked across the street straight to that guy and told him ""You need to turn off that music, it is super annoying and I can't focus on anything."" He started something about how it was his right to have the music and how he can have it on until 10 PM or something and at this point I wasn't even listening anymore and something snapped in me and I started yelling at that guy like I've never yelled at someone before in my life, telling him about how there's 400 people in this neighborhood and his fucking idiot ass was pissing off every single one of them and how he could go fuck himself. Dude was literally shaking. I turned off his amp and walked into my apartment, when I heard that he turned the music back on. I picked up my phone and called the cops, who pulled up in front of his driveway like 10 minutes later, had a 10 minute conversation with him after which he quickly carried the speaker inside his garage. His family seems to be scared of me now, as when I came home from work yesterday his wife saw me and instantly told her kids who were playing in the driveway to come close lol. AITA?",55,42,0.83
1658,Not the A-hole,"So recently I got a new job at a clothing store after months of searching and one of the first people I told was my housemate/best friend. At first she was okay with it and was very excited about the discounts I could get her but then when she found out about how much I get paid hourly (I know I probably shouldn’t have told her in the first place), she got really bitter about it. 

I’ve only told a few people about my new job and if she’s around when I do, she will complain about how annoying it is that I’m getting paid the same amount as her when apparently “I don’t even need to use my brain to work and all I gotta do at work is fold clothes”. For context, we’re both students and she works as a cashier/pharmacy assistant. 

A few times when I couldn’t make it to some of our hangouts with our friends for work, she’ll say things like “why don’t you just take the time off? It’s just retail anyway!” Or ask me why I’m taking this job so seriously when it’s not even related to the course I’m studying. 

She also gets weird about the way I spend my money. I really enjoy makeup so I’ll buy myself a few items each month and she’d go around telling people how I have no self-control and that I have a spending issue even when I explained to her that I have a budget on how much I’m allowing myself to spend on my hobbies. 

Now I’ve told before her that the things she said about me or my job are really unfair. She just brushed it off and continues making fun of my job and each time I have an early start (we start as early as 7am) she’s mockingly tell me how she feels bad for me and say things like how she’s so lucky she starts at 9am and don’t have to fold clothes yada yada. I’ve also recently found out from another friend that she told people I’m working so hard to earn money because I’m in a “pathetic” LDR and I have to fly to another country just to see my SO and convinced my friend to not invite me to a trip because I’ll be working or would want to fly to my SO anyway.

1659,Not the A-hole,"My brother, sister-in-law (SIL) and her parents are visiting my wife and I for a week because we live in the same city as SIL's brother who is graduating this week from college! They are here a week early just to spend time with us and to visit us for the first time at a new house we bought recently.

We have a pool and the temperatures have been basically scorching for the past couple of weeks. My wife's between some contracts at work so she's been enjoying the sunshine and cooling off more so than the usual. Apparently this is something my SIL isn't comfortable with and get this ... not for herself, but for her parents sake. 

She told me, through my brother once and directly in a heated conversation how some of my wife's behavior is a little beneath her age and disrespectful to our guests. What is this behavior you ask? That she sunbathes, sometimes topless, around the pool which is a good thirty yards away from the house, on it's own corner of the property. That she sometimes spends time in her bathing suit at home when she's hopping in and out. And this is what got me almost to rage at her .. that apparently she has the audacity not to maybe wear an annoying bra when it's nearly 100F outside for a place and a house designed to be getting no more than 70-85F even in summers (yes, we live in coastal CA). 

I lost my cool, called her a perv, then later apologized to my brother and her but told her that any more comments and she's not welcome to stay here anymore. Her parents, being old, and polite through this, can definitely stay.

1662,Not the A-hole,"We had some renovations going on in our home over the course of the last couple of months.  Often times there would be workers in the home at the same time that our nanny was there watching our two young kids.  The last time I spoke to the electrician he had just finished his work and he brought up that his daughter was looking for a nanny for his two young kids on the weekends and would it be possible for him to get our nanny's contact information.  He showed me pictures of his grandkids and everything.  I asked her about it and she said sure, so I sent him her info.

&#x200B;

The work is now finished and a couple of weeks later it turns out that the electrician's only motivation was to ask her out.  I don't have full details of exactly what he said, but it just came across as kind of creepy.  She is much younger than him (late 30s while he could be easily 60+) and is married with kids.  To be fair he probably did not know about that.  Beyond being creepy, he deceived me in my own home.  This is really where my main issue lies.  Had he just been truthful with me in the first place I could have put a stop to it and everyone could have gone on their merry way.

1663,Asshole,"My SO (F27) and I (M28) have been together for 4 years now. I know for a fact that she is not willing to become pregnant herself and I accepted that because I believe we are a good match and I do love her deeply. Afterall it's her body and nobody can force her to put herself through pregnancy. Now even though she wouldn't mind living life without raising a child, I would like to raise one, one day.  So we've been talking about other options.  

As most likely it is going to be one child only, I would prefer to be genetically linked to that child for two main reason. The first is that I would feel more connected to the child and second because I believe my SO and I have a lot to offer genetics-wise.  

My SO, being someone who occasionally hosts stray dogs and cats at our apartment till they rehabilitate and we find them a new home, is looking into the option to adopt a child. She mentioned how children of addict parents have it really tough and even after getting away from their parents their personality is not that easy and untrusting which may result in them changing foster homes multiple times and/or becoming 18 without any. So maybe adopting such a child is something I would consider doing.  

My answer to this was that I'm willing to donate or volunteer in order to help such children but when it comes to raising such a child myself, I don't think I have it in me.  
During the conversation, I mentioned multiple times how a child of our genes pool would probably have a higher potential in my point of view (came out too narcissist, I know) but that's only because I see in myself a lot of what my parents have, intellectual and personality wise (narcissist again?).  
I explained that I'll be putting a lot of time, effort, and money in my child as it's some kind of an investment. It would make me glad to know my child grows up to be a great decent person. And I know that I will accept my biological child as is, no matter what it is like.  
The sad thing is, I can't say that for certain if we adopted a child. And that's not the child's fault, I know, it's all mine. I just can't make that promise. I'm not saying things can't change if that actually happened, I'm just saying it's a risk that I'm not willing to take as the consequences can be too hard to overcome.   
Last thing I mentioned was that if we were to adopt a child, the child's parents (if known) and the environment the child was born into would have a great weight in my decision. I am aware this sounds too much like IATA, but if we're going to raise one child only, I wouldn't make the decision based on which child needs the most help (again sounds like IATA, but I'm just trying to be real with myself here).  

Needless to say, SO did not like my point of view at all. So here I am asking, AITA? And would appreciate if someone who went through something similar can share their story. 

Well, after saying all that I probably should go volunteer somewhere over the weekend to balance out my karma.  

----------------
----------------

EDIT - For the people who didn't like the genetics comments, for all you know I may be the dumbest ugliest person alive, but I am satisfied with my genetics. Whether it is an appearance, personality or an intellectual trait, no matter how good or bad, I would love to be able to say the child got that from me / my SO.  

EDIT - Allow me to try and rephrase my ""investment"" comment. I didn't mean that I'm expecting any kind of return from it. But the opposite, it is an investment in the child's future where the child is the only benefit from it. I merely provide the tools and means in the best way I can so when the time comes to make own decisions, the child will be up for that.",86,62,0.77
1664,Not the A-hole,"My husband has a 5 year old daughter. The first time I met her was a few months ago when she came to stay for the summer. She's a lovely little girl but she has (what I consider) two major habits that bother me:

1) She lies, A LOT. Sometimes about small things sometimes about pretty big things.


2) She cries to get her way, A LOT. I mean screaming at the top of her lungs crying. She'll stop when you leave the room and start when you come back. She doesn't do it to me as much anymore because I won't give her a) the attention she wants or b) the items she wants. She cried so much at one point we had to take her to the ER because her eye was swollen shut for a day.

So the issue is that he'll punish her for lying, but only when it affects him. If it isn't something that matters to him he'll laugh. She literally said ""I told a big lie"" and he laughed at it.

Now when he gets angry over her lying I tell him I don't want to hear it. I've told him she does it because he and her mother let her get away with it and his response is that its normal for a 5 year old to lie and cry this much. I disagree (I also have 2 children). He isn't happy when I say something about her behavior being inappropriate and he isn't happy when I ignore him being angry over that same behavior.

She's going to start kindergarten soon and this behavior isn't going to fly there. I love her and that's why I care. If I didn't love her I wouldn't give a shit.

AITA for telling him that her behavior isn't normal and that it's his (and her mother's) fault she does this?

ETA: I've tried bringing it up gently and offering alternative solutions. I've told him he needs to be consistent. I've told him that this isn't going to work when she gets to kindergarten. I've tried the look of death. I'm kind of done pretending I guess? Even when she put soap in my water cup and I drank it, she blamed it on the dog and he laughed. I don't know what to do anymore.

10 year old daughter is reading the placards out loud, partly so she can ask us about words she doesn't get, partly because her great grandmother is with us and can't really read the rather small text because her eyesight isn't great these days.

1669,Not the A-hole,"My fiance (F) and I have been together about 2 years now, we just finished university and I'm pregnant with our first child. F and I met outside of uni but after being together for about a year we realised that not only was she his aunt, she was also one of my lecturers.

In uni she told everyone I'm pregnant and threw us a baby shower after we told her not to do either thing. The baby shower invites also used the name she wanted, that we aren't using.

Outside uni she cancelled our delivery of baby stuff by ringing the store as me because some of the onesies were for girls and the baby is a boy, and shown up to my medical appointments when we told her not to come. She's also messaged people who offered us expensive baby stuff for free saying that if they weren't for a boy then we don't want it.

She also rang the hospital as me and tried to get herself listed as my birthing partner. As my hospital only allows one person in the room, this meant that if she succeeded then F would not be allowed in. A said when we asked her about this that she intended to be a ""constant"" in our son's life which meant being there from the moment he is born. I told her the only other people allowed in the delivery room are F and medical professionals and she called me selfish.

A has also asked us about writing a will that states that if F and I die, she will get custody of our son.

There's been more stuff but there's a character limit to think about.

Whenever we ask her to stop, she says ok and then she does it again. When we tried to talk to her about boundaries she said ""we're family. F is like a son to me"".

It's worth mentioning here that F's parents aren't involved. When he was 14 they left, and A took over. She looked after him from 14-16. When F was 16 they had a fight, and A said ""my house my rules"". F left and moved in with his friend. F and A patched things up a couple of years later when he was 18, but their relationship has been fragile since.

We weren't planning on moving, but then I got home from work yesterday to find A halfway through putting child locks on everything in our flat, at least a year before we'd even need them. When I asked her how she got in she admitted that before I moved in she'd had the spare key and she'd made copies without telling F or me.

F wants to take this job on the other side of the country, and so we're planning to move to the town that job is in without telling A. I work remotely so I can do that from anywhere. As fiance starts work 1/8, we're planning on moving in July. A's involvement in the baby's life would be whatever we put on our SM and that's it.

I asked M out before but she turned me down. I was overweight and had confidence issues then, and that lead to me getting angry at her. We didn’t talk for a time, I missed our friendship and regretted reacting the way I did. C helped me by becoming the bridge between me and M. M and I eventually started talking again. 

Since then I have gone to the gym, lost weight and gained confidence. I also got closer to M, we talk almost every day about almost everything. She gets me special gifts on my birthdays and always encourages me to continue being healthier (I still have a bit to lose to get to my target weight). I wanted to ask her out again, but I was waiting for the right time. I just needed a sign to assure me that she’s ready to be more than friends. 

Since last year I’ve noticed that she and C have been talking a lot. They have inside jokes in our group chat with our other friends, tell each other things that they don’t tell the rest of us, they don’t cancel lunch or dinner plans if I and our other friends can’t make it, they just go by themselves. I figured their newfound closeness is because they bonded over a new game that they both play. M and I still talked every day, and C and I still talked and he never said anything whenever I mentioned wanting to ask M out again. 

So I was shocked and felt very betrayed when C suddenly asked if he could date M. Turns out the week before, they met up for midnight fast food and when he drove her home they looked at each other and ended up kissing. M told him that they shouldn’t have done that but she wasn’t angry, she just said we’re friends, it’s fine, let’s not talk about it again. C has been thinking of her ever since and he thinks he has feelings for her and wants to tell her. I told him that he’s a backstabber and that from now on we are no longer friends. 

I told my friend R what happened and asked how best to let the rest of our friends know. He consoled me but said it was not right to get angry at C because M is not on object that I can ‘reserve’.

I am a white man married to a Japanese woman (who lived in Japan until she was 25). We live in the United States together with our son (15 years old) and our daughter (4 years old).

I like to think that we have worked hard to raise them with positive values, emphasizing self-esteem and respect for others. We took my son to Japan when he was ten years old because he really wanted to go, and we are planning another trip in the near future as well.

As of late, I have felt that my son has had a radical change in personality. He has ignored me frequently and really just wanted to be left alone to his devices. I figured it was just your average run of the mill teenage blunder stuff, but over time, it began to escalate. A few days ago he called me a ""sexpat."" 

I had no idea how he had learned this term. So, during the daytime when he was at school, I went on his computer. 

I found what I had suspected. While I won't go into details or name names, he was a frequent poster on a board for half-white half-Asian people who despise their white lineage. Generally they are a rotten bunch of people, but the brainwashing on the board was astounding to me. I noticed that my son had been participating for about two months--about the time when his behavioral changes began.

What I did next was something I figured was perfectly reasonable for the circumstances: I unplugged his computer, removed the HD, and put it at my folks' house. When he got home, I confiscated his smartphone and told him that I saw what he had done. He went into a standard spiel about violating his privacy, but I said that he crossed lines that justified my actions when he began name calling me. 

I am currently looking into therapists for him because he has been out of control. When I asked people around me what they thought, they seemed to believe it wasn't even that big of a deal. Some of them mentioned that he was just a confused teenager trying to figure his mixed heritage out, and that he would grow out of the phase.

1675,No A-holes here,"Hi everyone, sorry for this. 

I’m currently pregnant after a very dumb ONS. We did use protection, but I still ended up pregnant. 

Please don’t hate me for this, but I’m really not ready to be a mother. I’m begin 20s, still in college and have a part-time job which is definitely not enough to support a family. Part from that there’s also personal reasons. Because of this I decided to give this baby up for adoption or having an abortion is the better option. I would prefer abortion... 

Here’s the problem. I haven’t told the father, someone I know from HS, that I’m pregnant even. And if he finds out, I want to tell him it’s not his. (We did use protection and he doesn’t know he’s the only one I had sex with recently.) 

I feel awful about it, but if he found out about it I know he’d try to convince me to keep it, as it’s one of his firm beliefs that a child should stay with its parents and especially mother. He has a very strong personality and opinions on things, while I really am not the most assertive person so have trouble standing my ground against him.

I also really don’t want to create a situation where he raises the baby alone, as he’s at the moment also not fit to do so I think. He doesn’t work, has a lot of issues he has to work on, etc. 

WIBTA for having an abortion/giving a baby for adoption without the father knowing?


Edit: I realise now I shouldn’t have put adoption and abortion in the same question as they are so different. Sorry everyone. Personally I would prefer abortion. The reason I’m doubting is because the father is very much against it (murder, etc.) And I feel guilty, even if he doesn’t know. Don’t really know how to explain it. But ofcourse adoption without him knowing doesn’t make it better, I realise now. On the contrary even.

Edit #2: This blew up in a way I didn’t expect, sorry guys. And thank you for taking the time to reply. Few things I would like to say if that’s okay. Please don’t send me private messages about not having an abortion... My question really was about whether or not to tell him, not whether to choose abortion or adoption. I’m sorry. I know you mean well. Also some people asked why I’m so sure he’d be unfit as a father. Ofcourse I can’t be sure I guess...

They were barely scraping by because she wasn't making money and they had little to no money for food and other expenses. I had a little over 700$ saved up and decided that I would give her 200$ of that money. She's also very nice to me and has given things to me as well even when she didn't have to. So apparently my mom somehow figured out that I have her it and she freaked out and started yelling. Apparently my older brother 21m gave her 1k a few weeks ago because she's been having issues with her employer and they haven't given her a full time job yet even though she is fully qualified and has worked for a long time there. My sister told me that she would pay me back when she was more financially stable and I said it was fine.  She was shocked that I would give her it because I am her little brother.

1678,Not the A-hole,"Married 15 years and almost didn't make it this far.  In our second year of marriage my wife went home when I was deployed and slept with Some Dickhead (who I'll refer to as SD from here out) who she was loose acquaintances with growing up.  She hadn't seen him in years but he just happened to show up during my daughter's birthday party because he was the son of one of my mother-in-law's old friends.  SD and my wife hooked up later that week after reconnecting.

&#x200B;

The reason I didn't kick my wife's ass to the curb and eventually forgave her is because she told me herself soon after I got home.  And she didn't try to justify it with the ""oh well you were gone, i felt lonely blah blah blah"".  No she actually said straight up that she was a fucking dumbass (her words not mine, though I agree) and she felt so sick and disgusting for doing it.

&#x200B;

She immediately cut off all contact with SD and it took a lot of counseling and healing but here we are today; feels like non-stop since that time that my wife has gone above and beyond proving that I was right to keep her.

&#x200B;

Well my mother-in-law called yesterday and she heard from SD's mother that SD died in some workplace accident and they're having a funeral service this weekend.

&#x200B;

My wife told me this and that she wanted to go and it was like I got kicked right in the dick.  I instantly felt nauseous and had fucking horrible flashbacks of when she told me about her affair. All those horrible feelings resurfaced along with the shitty memories of me crying my fucking eyes out and my image of her shattering.  The pain felt as fresh as when she dropped that bomb on me.

&#x200B;

I asked her why seeing as she hadn't talked to the guy in over a decade not to mention...you know....she fucked him while we were married.  She keeps saying shit like ""it's the right thing to do"" and ""she just wants to pay respects"".

&#x200B;

I can't stop repeating that I'm so hurt with that decision as he's had no part of her life in so long and I'm re-living all those shitty nights I was sure our family would be shattered and I would only see my daughter 50% of the time.

&#x200B;

After some back and forth I put my fucking foot down and told her NO, she cannot go.  I said it's so disrespectful to me and our marriage and we've been on the silent treatment since then.  AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Seems like people are starting to trip up on me saying ""feels like non-stop since that time that my wife has gone above and beyond proving that I was right to keep her."" as if I'm saying I own her and she's a piece of property to me.  That is not the case, I am simply illustrating that she didn't just say she'll do better, she proved it with her actions and has made me a very happy man in our time together.

EDIT 2: I apologize for nothing and honestly it brings a happy tear to my eye to to see so many people referring to him as SD, because that's what he was.  Fuck 'im.

A lot of people are saying it's her decision to make and it is but that doesn't mean I have to like it or support it, and yes right at this point I can see myself walking away if she insists on going.  We're going to counseling starting tomorrow",4845,19920,0.9
1679,Not the A-hole,"Me and my girlfriend live together and have had the same chemistry B exam this summer. The chemistry exam is structured so that we have time to prepare answers for 10 randomly selected questions.

I began to work on the questions 4 days before the exam. The next 4 days was spent reading up and taking notes. There where a lot to cover and an constantly reminder how badly i actually knew the material.

I had hoped what we could have helped each other considering we should prepare for the same material, and reading together would have cut some time. 

While i was reading my girlfriend was staying up all night watching youtube and sleeping well into the afternoon. I told her it was some hard questions, that she should take a look soon. I was beginning to feel the pressure myself. (I should add that she have had a lot of absence from class the past year. Due to lack motivation and other stuff.)

Days go by. 

The day before the examen, after she gets out of bed at 15 (3pm) she asks me if i could send my answers and notes. I tell her no and understandably she gets upset. I tell her that i will help her, but i'm not going the send my work i have worked so hard for the last couple of days. At this point she hasn't even fully looked at the questions.

In the evening she starts going through her notes. She asks me if i could please send my answers to her. I tell her that she need to take the consequences of her actions and that i of course well help her, but if she have started earlier we could easy have helped each other. I'm well aware that the task is close to impasoble at this point. She starts crying a bit and i feel like a huge asshole, but i still go through with it. My girlfriend only just passed the test.

He then replaces the battery, tests the key to be functional and knods at me to proceed to the check out counter. 
He rings me up and says I need to pay $17. My reaction immediately was,:"" how much does one of those tiny batteries cost?! "" He responded:"" Only 6 bucks if you buy the battery but $17 if you have us change it out for you. 
This did not sound right to me as I was never given the option to buy or have him change it for me, so I started asking him why he assumed I wanted it changed out ? His answer was because I handed him the key. The argument went on for a little while until he finally said: ""screw it, just leave, don't have to pay anything!"" So I demanded he ring me up for the price of the battery which he did with a really bad attitude as his manager was now standing next to him and paid the $6 and left.

Today I was visiting my sister Samantha, Matt's mother. While eating lunch with Samantha and Matt, Matt asked me for advice about life in general, being more confident, getting girls, etc, saying that his mom didn't give good advice. This caused her to frown, but she kept quiet. I listed a few things he should do and then came to lifting weights. I told him exercise in general is good: it obviously helps the body, it relieves stress, and it makes you feel good. For teen guys especially, I'd recommend weight lifting, since it generally society considers muscular/built guys more attractive. Weight lifting, if he sticks to it alongside a good diet, will give him a good body. This will make him look good both in and out of clothes, increase attention from girls, and increase his confidence. 

&#x200B;

This caused Samantha to get really angry, and she angrily said there's nothing wrong with Matt's body and that it's just fine. I replied there's nothing *inherently wrong* with being skinny, but there's also nothing wrong wanting to improve your body so you're healthier, feel better, and look great.

1683,No A-holes here,"Mum insists I videocall or phone my grandma almost everyday. I decided this was way too frequent, and we initially decided on alternating days. After a few weeks, we both weren't really happy with the compromise. Mum wants to return to it being a daily ritual, whereas I now think even alternating days is too much, once a week should be enough.

When my dad was alive, he used to call to his mum everyday. Since my dad passed away, that duty pretty much falls on my own mum and myself. The problem is, neither of us can speak the languages my grandma understands, and her English is extremely basic. Our conversations are almost the same every time: hello, how's the weather, have you eaten, how's great-aunt, repeat a bunch of phrases in Hebrew/Turkish/Farsi that she loves hearing, and pull some silly faces for her to see. I've checked, our conversations usually go on for 10 to 15 minutes, though the last one lasted just 12. She clearly loves it when we phone/videophone her, she cries an little sometimes. 70 minutes a week, every week, just repeating the same things over and over, almost verbatim. It's mind-numbingly boring.

Grandma's not simple, she was an engineer and still mentally sharp in her 80s. I don't think she's particularly lonely either, she frequently hosts tea parties for her friends, my uncle lives near her, and she has a part-time carer. But our chats probably are the highlights of her day, she sometimes cries when we say goodbye. My mum and my dad's mum get along fine, but grandma does not care about talking to her nearly as much as with me.

Mum says I'm being ungrateful for all the things grandma has done, and if my old man could have found the time to talk to her everyday, so can I. I feel mightily guilty, I loved my parents and grandparents, and she's right in saying she has done so much for me. But I decided to put my foot down, and I'm only going to call her once every Saturday or Sunday, and not the first thing I do when I get back home from work. In time, I hope she gets used to it, even if it's making her anxious now.

1684,Asshole,"This is an old story that I know makes me at least partially an asshole but I still stand by what I did. Also I’m on mobile so sorry for the format.

So when I was in my late teens I knew a girl who I was only friends with. She had a kid with a guy that bailed on her as soon as she got pregnant so unfortunately the kid had no father figure at the time this happened. The girl and I were fairly good friends so we used to talk a lot. She started getting into a really bad habit of trying to forcibly make me the father figure to her kid.

She would tell me every little thing the kid did with the most enthusiasm I’ve honestly ever seen regarding kids she would also try to get me to come over a lot to “spend time with me and my son”. I saw pretty quickly what she was trying to do and tried several times to let her down kindly after all we were friends. I felt bad for the kid but I didn’t have any obligation to be a father to him. 

Unfortunately she never got the hint and it started pissing me off and the inevitable happened. I lost my cool. I would like to mention that I’ve always been extremely even tempered and have rarely snapped at anyone and in general I’ve always been pretty friendly. But everyone has their breaking point. So anyway, I bitched her out and told her what she was trying to force on me what not only unwanted but rude. That isn’t the part that makes me an asshole though. I continued and said “I don’t give a shit about your kid. He could die tomorrow and I wouldn’t care.” Obviously that upset her and she stopped talking to me which I was honestly fine with. 

But then maybe five months later despite what I said to her about her kid she started talking to me again as if nothing had happened. I even made sure that she remembered and she said she did but she forgave me. She would still kinda talk about her kid but she never did that again. 

Like I said I know what makes me an asshole and I stand by it even ten plus years later and I would do it again. But I guess I’m just curious if I’m as much of an asshole in regards to that as I think I am.",29,55,0.83

She eventually said it made her feel embarrassed and literally said that it's silly for a 23 year old man to be wearing a neon purple hat saying 'pierce the veil' on it (a band).

1687,No A-holes here,"Okay here is the situation. I am a gay man and since a couple of years back I've joined a circle of friends and we have become very good friends. Among this circle there are two people that this post concerns. One is another gay woman, Bee, and the other is a straight guy, Mike. Mike and Bee goes back a long way (like pre-school age I think). Me and Bee has become very close friends and we are both very physical with each other as in we hugging, playing with each others hair, cuddle up while we watch films and such, in a very platonic way (since we are both gays we have 0 sexual or romantic feelings for each other).   


Now to the issue at hand. Mike came and talk to me a couple of weeks back where he said I need to stop touching Bee, hugging her etc because she does not like it and it makes her uncomfortable. This surprised me because I've never gotten that feeling that this was the case. Natrually I wanted to talk directly to Bee, and apologize if I ever made her uncomfortable. She did tell me that this was not the case, but she had talked to Mike in the past, that she felt that he developed feelings for her and she had told her that him being physical made her uncomfortable, but she had no issues (the opposite in fact) with us being physical on a platonic level.   


Thinking back this explains alot. Mike has expressed a very protective stance towards Bee in the past, and has always percived grumpy in the past when Bee does not sit next to him when we watch movies or stuff like that. This has led me to the conclusion that he still have feelings for Bee, and that us being physical triggers jealousy and makes him angry/grumpy. Natrually  I dont want to cause a conflict or unecessary friction, but I also dont want to stop being physical with Bee.

1688,No A-holes here,"My BF works full-time in the tech industry. I, on the other hand, am a freelancer: I work from home, Mon-Fri (I make the effort to work more on Friday to clear up my weekend). However, even though I'm doing this full-time, I only work for about 2-3 hours a day + 1 hour of liaising with clients.

This means that, while BF leaves a 8.30am and is back at 6pm, I'll be done with my work at 1pm the latest. We have separate finances and I make more than he does (at the moment - freelancing is very unpredictable but it's been like this for a year).

We have an equal split of chores. I'm the better cook so I often cook evenings and I do the meal planning, while he shops groceries on his way back, and washes the dishes. One thing I do more is laundry because I'm at home - I would put it in the machine when I get up, get it out and hang it to dry after I've finished work.

That being said, it was brought to my attention (not by him) that I may be the AITA. I work less hours, work from home (which means no commute), and while my BF comes home pretty tired at the end of the day, I'm well-rested. Should I be doing more things around the house since I essentially have my afternoons free?

So, basically AITA for working less hours, from home, and doing a 50/50 household chores split with BF (even though we make roughly the same money)?

I know I’m probably the asshole but here goes.
Me and this girl have been dating for about 8 months. I met her maybe a year ago initially. She is a very modest person. The closer we are getting the more i am finding out about her. Fast forward a couple of months I notice she has A LOT of leg hair. She was very self conscious about it and would only wear pants in front of anyone. Including me. She never had shaved, so it’s a lot and it did surprise me A LOT. I have never even seen a women past a couple months not shaven. So this was a surprise. However I didn’t really mind. 

Now she is on the fence for shaving or not and asked if I would like it. I said yes it is something I find more attractive than i shaved legs. I told her honestly. She started talking about how I just think that because it’s a western ideology and all that stuff and now she doesn’t want to shave. She doesn’t say if it looks bad or good to her. She just says she won’t do it now because I think she’ll look better. 

I don’t know how to think about this, because honestly it’s a big deal to me. I never thought of a girl having that much hair, she says she has PCOS so it makes her more hairy. I get that and I always offer her help manage her unwanted hair. She says there’s too much and never lets me help. I’m trying everything to help her and make her feel better and also help me feel good when we are touching each other. Her hair hurts, mine is smooth but hers is long and kind of sharp. And she agrees and always hides it. If I’m an asshole I understand I can open my mind more. This is just a lot for me to take in at the moment. I am trying my best to say nice things to her. But it’s hurting my head. I am willing to change, but right now it’s a lot.

Edit: I’ve talked to her. She said she was in the wrong because she said she wanted to shave first and then I agreed and wanted it. She said she will work on either planning out how to handle the shaving/waxing or try to be comfortable with the hair.

1692,Asshole,"Back in Januarry, my brother and his family came to the State as immigrants from Asia. The family stayed in my house with my family for a month and then all but their oldest son (let's call him A), which is 18 years old, came back to their home country. I let A stay in my house until his parent come back here, and during his staying, his parent pay me 1000/month as a ""rental payment"" and asked me to take care of him, which I agreed.

A is hard-working, well-behaved and overall a great kid. The only negative thing about him is that he is very quiet. During his staying, he'd go to work, and then go back to his room, occasionally, he'd go for the gym, and he rarely talked to anyone. Because of that, he did not get along well with my children, which were born and raised in the US and roughly the same age as A. My oldest had a job and an apartment, and my second was staying in dorm. My second told me that he was uncomfortable with A and hence, he didn't really want to comeback home on the weekends, which he had been coming home every 2-3 weeks. Fast forward a few months, A's mom told me that their family would not planning to comeback to the State for a while. Knowing that, combine with what my children told me, I asked A to moveout.

I gave A a week to find a room, sort things out, pack and moveout. He already got a job as a barista at Starbucks so I wasn't too worry about his income, and I believe he had few hundred bucks in saving.

I don't begrudged her or anything, because she doesn't have a steady source of income like I do, but at the same time she's an adult and should be able to manage her spending according to her means.

A few clarifications, yes she is aware of her debt and I make sure that it's clear every time she borrows money. I'm not putting simple groceries for the home on her tab.

Before I begin my story, let me give some context. I have several brothers whom I get along with but don't see that often. However, I happen to see this brother quite often (because we chose the same college), and he has acted rude to me for as long as I can remember with no known reasoning why. For the remainder of this story I will call him IB (intoxicated brother).

I had gone to IB's house one night because we were celebrating the last time another brother was in town after graduating college. When I arrived, I noticed IB was not present, but assumed he had gone out to get some food. Shortly after I arrived, IB showed up drunk out of his mind and carrying in some insanely expensive items. Although I won't be saying what was stolen for confidentiality reasons, let's just say these items are valued around 5k each and he had multiple. I kept going back and forth that night over whether I should report him or not because I didn't want IB's stupid decision to potentially ruin the lives of his current roommates. 

Skip ahead a few weeks, and I tell one of my friends what happened. He got upset with me for not calling the police immediately. The more we talked the more it made sense to me to report him. Well...I did. The very next day I'm contacted saying IB had been arrested and the goods were recovered and returned. I know I should feel bad, but I don't. Multiple years of passive aggressive side comments from IB about how I'm a shitty person, yet he is the one driving drunk, risking people's lives, and stealing highly valued property. Not to mention, I'm being offered a reward because of the report, which I will gladly be taking because college is EXPENSIVE.

1698,Asshole,"I want to ask my BF of nearly three years if I can give him a facial. He’s had mild to bad acne since high school years. Some background: we’re both 24, knew each other in HS but did not date until after we graduated. 

He thinks I’ve had good skin all my life. In HS I had great skin. But as soon as I graduated and moved away for college, my face blew up. Painful painful acne that would sometimes make me miss class because of the pain and the embarrassment. I suffered dramatically and didn’t talk to anyone my whole freshman year if I could help it. I got it handled through changing simple habits and getting on a prescription pill and lotion. I no longer take the pill but I use the lotion daily and give my skin weekly mild treatments. 

My BF does not take the necessary steps to remedy his acne. Other than quitting smoking and probably splashing soap on his face in the shower, I don’t think he does much else. I genuinely suffer seeing him pick at his skin or complain about an oncoming or lingering pimple because I feel for him. He doesn’t get that my wanting to help comes from empathy and experience because when he knew me in HS I had great skin and when we started dating I got my skin back in check. I think he thinks I’m doing it because I’m vain. 

I’ve offered him my lotions, even asking to get my prescription refilled and giving him the bottles so he can see if they help him (it’s a basic antibiotic) he always shuts it down and hates talking about his skin, I’m sure out of insecurity. 

Here’s the thing: he’s THE most confident person I have EVER met. He knows he’s smart, hilarious, and super handsome. He just has this one cosmetic issue. That I mostly view as a health issue. 

His looks DO NOT bother me. It’s the obvious one insecurity that he’s trying to hide that makes me sad. Seeing him in pain makes me sad. And after taking care of my own skin I learned I love giving other people facials and I would enjoy it and think maybe we’d have fun. I also do hope that if he saw the results he’d start taking the steps to better his skin himself. 

But I’m afraid to bring it up because I know that anytime I bring up his skin he shuts down and gets weird about it. I’m afraid to push it further and make him upset even if it may hugely benefit him. 

WIBTA if I brought up the fact I want to give him a facial? Or maybe how do I approach it without being an Ahole? Should I just give up?

Some more background: we are long distance at the moment and don’t live together, I can’t just bring it up here and there randomly, it would have to be when he’s visiting me and I have my things I need. Nor can I just expect him to fall into my routine, since we don’t have one together.",29,30,0.9
1699,Everyone Sucks,"Today, while grocery shopping, I admitted that for the last 2 weeks, we've been having our ""grilled cheese"" nights when he's not there. We have a rule in our house that you need to eat the crust. I back my husband up and do the whole fight with kids' tears even though I couldn't care less. I want us to be a team, so I help enforce the rule.

I told him that we've been having grilled cheese w/out him so I can skip the crust fight. He got pissed and said that he wasn't talking to me and walked away in the middle of the store.

He knows that when he doesn't talk to me, I get severe anxiety. My mom used to use the silent treatment as manipulation. She would get mad, not talk to you for days until you said she was right and she'd forgive you. 

I understand that when my husband doesn't want to talk, it's because he's angry and working things out in his head and isn't using it the way my mother did, but that doesn't stop it from bringing up all that anxiety. At the beginning I would go crazy when he did this- yelling, throwing stuff, anything to get the silent treatment to end. I've gotten a lot better with that and giving him his space and talking when he's ready to talk even though it gives me migraines and a lot of physical and mental stress dealing with it.

Tonight, I said in the car, don't make this a thing. We have a really nice night planned, don't ruin it over something as small as grilled cheese crust. I went into the bedroom when we got home and gave him some space so he could watch TV or play video games or whatever in the living room. This was like 8:10. He comes into the bedroom instead and lays down in our bed next to me.

I give it an hour and make a few repair attempts with funny posts on reddit or whatever. I'm getting nothing. So after another hour and a half of this, I go cry over ice cream and take a drive so that I don't get into crazy mode and start yelling and whatever. As I'm driving I'm just thinking about how stupid this whole thing is that he was trading our evening together to be upset over grilled cheese crusts.

I was getting really upset because I was really looking forward to spending some time with him after a really rough day dealing with family drama with my mom.

I go back and I try to get him to talk about it, no yelling, trying to understand what the big deal was. He told me to shut up and leave him alone and I told him I felt like he was telling me that I wasn't worth putting his feelings aside. It escalated and we were both yelling and bottom line was that I felt like he always takes care of himself first at the expense of my well being and then comes around and finally talks, and I was like, I put my feelings aside to give you what you need, when is it my turn? It turned a bit ugly and finally he took a sleeping pill and I'm awake writing this post.  I'm still really upset and feel like spending time with me should have been more important than grilled cheese.

AITA here for making it bigger than it should have been?",118,31,0.75
1700,Not the A-hole,"\*posting from a throwaway because if I AM the asshole I really don't want that on my page where I mention details of where I work

So, a bit of back story. I work in a HEAVILY regulated industry (marijuana) with a lot of very harsh ID policies. I mainly work reception, so I am the most at risk for encountering fines/legal troubles for letting in a bad ID. The ""law"" says that ""if an average person could not say with complete confidence that that is the same person as the person pictured on the ID they can not be let inside"".

&#x200B;

The area I work in also sees a large amount of trans customers. Before, it was no issue. ""Amy"" shows her ID where she is very clearly still pictured as ""Adam"" but you still let ""Amy"" inside. No harm, no foul, but a few weeks ago we really cracked down on ID's and limited what was considered acceptable.

&#x200B;

So, when we were all standing around before the shift started talking about how the day will go I brought up this issue with management. Asking ""do we still let ""Amy"" in, if her ID still shows ""Adam""'?

&#x200B;

One of my coworkers (who is very openly gay) lost his shit on me. Calling me everything from homophobic to transphobic to a ""trash person in general"". He was in the middle of starting a huge rant on how I ""don't even give trans people basic human rights"" when I just walked away.

&#x200B;

Management flagged me down later and said that they ""didn't really know how to handle this issue"" because of it's ""sensitivity"" but not to worry because ""they're *hoping* nothing bad will come from this"".

&#x200B;

I don't really know how to feel. As a bisexual who struggled with identity issues as a child I go far as possible out of way to show the most respect possible for trans people as I know that struggle must be difficult as hell, but it took me way back to be told (especially by a gay man) that I was disrespecting the LBGT community. Now management is implying I may possibly be the asshole as well? AITA? Help?",45,93,0.89

1703,No A-holes here,"I feel like I shouldn’t need to ask because of course I would be the asshole if I did this but I thought I would ask this sub for judgement just in case.

I have a three year old niece. When my sister went back to work after her daughter was born, the whole family kinda pitched in the help with childcare so they didn’t have to use a daycare. Her mother in law and our mother each looked after her for a few days a week. Eventually, with my extreme reluctance, I was rope in to help babysit maybe a total of seven day a month, sometimes more. Some of those day were super long, like eight hour days and I did this for about a year and a half. Somehow I become my niece’s favorite person during this time.

But I hate children. I’m childfree for a reason. And I’m not exactly big on my niece either but I suck it up because I’m adult enough to play nice with a small kid to help out my sister. But lately, it’s become harder and harder to do this. I’m not her mother so I defer to my sister in every case but it seems like the more I spend time with my niece the more my sister thinks I’m doing things wrong. Or saying the wrong things. I have to police all my actions and my words just in case my niece takes it the wrong way or it doesn’t align with her parents’ parenting plans and I am feeling judged for not knowing better.

Like yesterday we went to the park together. I was with my niece on the jungle gym and we were climbing it together. I got to a point where I wasn’t comfortable going any higher and I said “I’m going to go down because it’s scary” and immediately my niece didn’t want to go up any higher because she heard that and started parroting it. And now my sister is mad because I traumatized her daughter and peer pressured her daughter into limiting her possibilities because the person her daughter looked up to thought it was too scary. Okay, I’ll refrain from commenting about things being scary from now on if it’s damaging my niece so badly.

Things like this seem to be happening more and more but I’m starting to wondering if it’s really worth it. She’s not my kid, I don’t actually have a duty to be around her if anything I do or say is bad. I don’t even like kids and the way my niece is so fixated on me drives me a bit insane but I can suck it up because she’s a kid and I can eventually go home. But lately, I’m starting to wonder why I’m doing this in the first place if it just makes me miserable. So WIBTA if I pulled away?",22,49,0.86
1704,Not the A-hole,"Background: I have a six year daughter, Mary. Her father and I split when she was 6 months old, and we've had 50/50 custody ever since. 7 days/7 days. It was ugly in the beginning, but for the last 4 years, it's been nothing but amicable. We accommodate overlapping vacations, pick her up when the school nurse calls if either of us is at work, etc. My husband loves her like his own and had been in her life for 4 years.

Her dad called me yesterday as I was walking into work and said 'Hey, since it's the summer and I work 7am/~3pm, instead of paying someone else to watch her, would you mind if I paid the money to you and you keep her for me during the day?' I was a bit reluctant, but agreed because I could use the money for extra activities during the summer such as water parks, museums, an out of town trip to the aquarium that she's been begging for, all the extras I normally put off because they're out of our monthly budget. The money is STRICTLY for her. My own decision, not his. We have never had a child support agreement. The extra money certainly would help when an aquarium ticket is $88. 

I didn't get home until 11pm last night from am extremely busy shift. Think prime real estate in the center of downtown during the summer. So busy I couldn't get a moment to check, call, or text from my phone to tell him. I called when I got off, but he was asleep. I didn't think it would be something I would even have to ask. I've missed half of my daughter's life and he's seen me break down in hysterics over it. The deal gets me an extra 80 hours/month with her vs spending that 80 hours in a day care. It's not about money, but time. It's only for 2 months, but this time is so valuable to me and my husband KNOWS that.

He dropped her off at 630 this morning and when my husband came downstairs, he blew up. He said I'm being used as free daycare and now I'm a slave to his every whim and that he's now free to use me as much as he wants. He said he didn't want him knowing our address, but my daughter had told her dad our address when we made her memorize it and you can see our house from the street and she's pointed it out to him multiple times, which my husband knows about and had never had a problem with. Her dad doesn't come to the door, only watched her from the street to make sure she gets inside and calls me when he arrives to send her out. I didn't even get a chance to explain ANYTHING before he stormed out of the door. He hasn't spoken to me since 7am and locked himself in his room when I got home today. 

AITA here? Should I have woken him up to ask him if I could keep my own daughter an extra 80hrs a week? We discuss every decision beforehand, but I feel as though this is something that shouldn't even have had to be discussed. She arrives as he's walking out of the door and is gone before he gets home.

Edit: I did say 80/week. My bad, y'all. I meant 80/month. Watching her during his 2 weeks of custody.

Edit 2: Reading back, nevermind.

Edit 3: I didn't see it at the time bc I was floored by it, but I know why he's upset over it. Thinking back to other times, he thinks he's going to potentially screw me over by using it against me. Commenters asking for left out details made me think way far back. When I said it was ugly, I mean, it was UGLY. He was an addict and an abuser. He would say one thing and do another and throw it in my face, causing me a lot of pain. It took about a year, but he got clean and sober, got therapy (although he isn't currently going), and over time, we were able to effectively communicate. Eventually we could sit together at dance class and discuss upcoming vacations, school plans, basically how we were going to co-parent and split costs. Husband knows for an ABSOLUTE fact there's nothing to worry about with us. I show him our text conversations and don't leave the room when he calls. He doesn't know it's part of our custody agreement to ask me first, and honestly, I don't even think her dad does either. There's not a way to use it against me, as I told him via text as a back up using the money only for her. Husband has always been cautious with him and husband is a man who thinks 5 steps ahead. We have a very loving marriage, so please don't think anything other than that. Thank you guys for your help. Truly. I'm not defending his blow up. At all. That was over the line.",85,185,0.93

A week before I asked one final time if she was ready to move on Saturday and she said yes, so i kept my days requested off.

1707,Not the A-hole,"A couple of weeks ago I was visiting my parents. They have a dog I usually  take for daily walks, so when his treat bucket ran out I decided to walk him down to the local mall to buy a bag of dried pig ears. While trying to find the the entrance that leads straight into the pet store, a girl about 10 years old approached me and asked if she could pet the dog. After a couple of minutes of petting and questions about the dog, her father came over from the parking lot. He didn't recognize me, but I used to be one of he's primary caretakers whenever he was admitted to the psychiatric hospital I worked at a decade ago. I know both his medical and criminal record well, and he has a long history of amphetamine abuse that has resulted in him being forcefully admitted to the psychiatric hospital due to drug induced psychosis almost every other month. He also spent several years in prison for causing multiple car accidents while using amphetamine, and naturally have a lifetime ban on driving.

Now, people do change a lot in 10 years, but not this guy.  He was shaking, face drenched in sweat, excessive chewing and tongue movement, pupils the size of dinner plates, basically all the signs of a large dose of amphetamine/cocaine/mdma. He was stimmed out of his fucking mind. He told me that he had borrowed an old convertible from a friend for the day, and where spending it with his daughter driving around in the area. He continued to ramble on for at least 10 minutes before I managed to leave and go into the pet store. There I got a fucking panic attack thinking about this idiot driving around with his kid in this deathtrap of a car while on drugs. I felt I had to do something, but before I managed to call the police I saw a girl I went to school with for 9 years that I know works as a police officer. Told her what just happened, and since this is a small town with just 7000 people and almost zero crime, she knew exactly who it was. She called it in while we went back outside to see if we could locate the car, which was pretty easy since it was the only convertible in the lot.

I then sat down on a bench on the other side of the road to watch this thing unfold. 30 minutes or so later he came back to the car with his daughter, and he was arrested while trying to pull out of the parking lot exit. The kid was ofc 
having a complete breakdown during all of this, and I feel I am responsible for turning what was probably a ""cool day with dad and his awesome car"" into a fucking nightmare.

A few days later I texted my old classmate on FB asking how everything turned out, but she couldn't tell me anything except that I had made a good call. Still feel like utter shit though.

Note: The fact that I knew about his prior drug abuse, time in prison and no license weighted heavily when deciding to report him, but I never gave this information to the police. I only gave them a description of what I experienced outside the mall.",28,47,0.94

We have been dating for awhile now and she’s always been courteous in asking to eat or use my stuff, she doesn’t eat much so I always gave her the okay. After she had spent a week at my place I told her she doesn’t have to ask me to eat my food on day 3 since she would always ask before she ate, she doesn’t eat much since she’s smaller but I didn’t take into account that a handful of granola, a bowl of yogurt, and a banana every day would stack up after awhile. She left my place after the stay and now every time she comes and stays for a period of time she eats my food. I feel bad for wanting her to start buying her own groceries to keep at my place since she consistently takes me out for food, buys me clothes, contributes to groceries when we cook, and keeps my weed supply full. I can’t comfortably afford to be feeding one and a half me’s so often though since she’s here at minimum 2 days a week.

1710,Not the A-hole,"Don’t get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my mom has a 95-pound shepherd mutt who’s been nothing but problematic... As a puppy, he was great. Social and sweet, but somewhere along the line, something snapped in him. He is friendly to his family, but will growl and bark and snap in crowds. 

Things took a turn for the worse two months after I had my son. We went over for a visit, and before we could even take our coats off, this dog shoved past us, put his nose into the car seat, and snapped at the blanket covering him. We left immediately. I was under the impression the dog would have been put away before we came in, but even after he had been locked behind a gate, he was growling and trying to get past it.

My mom recently moved into a larger home, and insisted we try to come over one more time. She had him behind a heavy duty gate. I was bouncing and playing with my son, and he was squealing. The dog started up again, snarling and barking. My mom told me to... stop playing with my son and be calmer... being calm and quiet isn’t exactly in a baby’s skill set.

A couple weeks back I suggested to my mom that maybe she should rehome him. This dog is taking over her life. She says she can’t be away from home more than two days in a row because it will upset him. The dog will attack her other two dogs if they get more attention than him. She has spent over $1000 on his medicines and psychiatry appointments for him (I kid you not... A dog psychiatrist.)  She previously put him through a $500 training course.

I understand loving an animal, but this is extreme. My mom, sister and father vehemently defend their decision to keep the dog. Saying that no one else would take in a dog with special needs, and that he’d inevitably be put down. But I think if he had a house where it was just him, no other pets and no kids, he would be much happier. And if not... maybe he should be put down if he’s that much of a threat to people.

I don’t want to take my son over to their house anymore at this point. Am I the asshole for telling my mom that the dog needs to go?

Backstory: Me \[53/m\] and my wife \[49/f\] made the tough decision to kick out our adult son \[25/m\]. This is not without reason, and we have given him multiple notices and enough time to sort things out and save money, find an apartment, devise a budget, and figure out what he wants to do. He went to a local college as soon as he finished high school, but dropped out after 2.5 years after switching his major three times: from graphic design, to accounting, to biology. After dropping out, he worked at a local deli department for about two years until he was fired. Our son has ADD, but is otherwise incredibly bright and friendly. At times he gets overloaded and has had many incidents of not properly filling out customer orders or being too slow. Me and my wife sympathized and encouraged him to look for something else. This was three years ago, and our son has not worked at all. He has not put even the slightest bit of effort into finding a job or returning to school. He has become overweight and spends all his time in front of the computer or playing video games. It got to a point where I had to sit him down and explain that he needs to look for a job, because me and my wife are planning on downsizing to a smaller house and will be unable to support him. He never took our conversations seriously. My wife would talk to him several times a week about job applications, only for him to go ""Oh, mom..."" and ignore her. I've sat him down, and tried to reason with him. I was willing to give him a few years to save up money so he would have a safety net to fall back on, but still nothing. He claims to suffer from depression, and while I can see that, I felt that it would be better for him to try and face the world head on. He's seen psychiatrists, has been on multiple medications, and will need his own insurance next year. I became so frustrated with him that I finally felt enough was enough. I woke him up, packed his bags, and drove him to a homeless shelter. I told him that he needs to find a job, and that me and his mom would not let him back into the house until he has one. I gave him all the essentials: razors for shaving, soap, deodorant, toothbrush kit, and etc. I kept his belongings in storage and would unpack them if he came home.

It has been over a month, and we hadn't heard from him or seen him. He has no friends that we know of, so we thought it was unlikely that he would be staying with anyone. I then receive a call from of our neighbors, who then told me they saw our son, with a scraggly beard and unkempt hair, walking around aimlessly near a shopping center, before hunching himself over beside a building.

1715,Not the A-hole,"My father looks after his two young grandkids, my nieces, 6F and 8F. They have a lot of 'friends' in their neighbourhood which is a very poor and deprived area. No parks or good areas for the kids to play. Lots of these kids have large families who have little time for them or parents who are pretty shitty. 

My dad pretty much opens his house to these kids. They wander in whenever, they don't knock and they use the garden when he isn't home. They help themselves to the cupboards, and to my nieces toys. There are almost no boundaries. Up to a dozen 6-12 year old kids are in and out of his house all the time. I'm saying all of this upfront so you understand why this is a debate. 

I don't think he should do this and while I think he's great for trying to help these kids, the cons are too big. 

Reasons why I don't want him to keep doing this:

1. Before he had the girls there was a girl from down the road who was very similar to the friends. She'd come over whenever and there were very few boundaries. She eventually was banned from the house after it turned out she had been stealing money from my father. £10s and £20s at a time which he dismissed due to age and bad memory. 

2. A few of the 'friends' actually bully my nieces in their own home into giving them the best toys and other things. They aren't actually friends with the girls and see my fathers house as a free hangout. 

3. As I mentioned, there's a fair few of these kids and my father is elderly and ill. He can't always watch them even when he is home and they come into his property even when he isn't there. What happens if a kid gets injured on his property? Is he liable?

4. He's an older man whom some of the parents have never even met, who has kids in and out of his house with no supervision. Rumours can be nasty and the estate that they live on is rife with vicious gossip. 

So despite these kids having nowhere else to go, I still think my father should stop hosting them. He thinks I am an asshole for saying this and his sister (my aunt) takes his side. My sisters (his other daughters) take mine.",24,121,0.96
1716,Not the A-hole,"I'm 24 years old, and so is my girlfriend. We have been dating since we were 20.  We are both in different universities with about two years to go.

We have talked about marriage and kids many times, and I do want kids - just not yet. Neither does she. She wants them before she turns 30, and while I would probably prefer being around 32 years old, I'm not totally sure about any of that, as I have no idea what my life will look like in 5 years. Most importantly, I want to make enough money to buy us a bigger apartment and afford all the healthy and organic groceries, and stuff like vacations etc when the kids get older.

Additionally, I have always been scared of accidentally impregnating somebody and them keeping the baby against my will (only the women decide in Denmark), so I have vocally said, several times in the last 4 years, that if she ends up being pregnant by mistake and decides to keep it against my will, I would break up with her, and not act as a father to the child (but of course still pay child money)

Ok. So she got pregnant. I instantly assumed she didn't want the baby, and she said so, and we have been to the doctor together, and she's going to a gynocologist this Wednesday to get a medicinal abortion. Meanwhile, she has told all of her girlfriends what's going on, and they are telling her that I'm an asshole for being ready to leave her in case she decides to have a baby that I don't want.

Other than that, I feel like I'm as supportive as possible (to me, this is actually a really good thing because it means we will be able to get pregnant when the time comes). I asked her if she wants to keep the baby several times and she always says no, but I also have a feeling she sometimes contemplates if we should go for a baby right now. In my mind it's just not worth it to get a baby because we slipped up - it should be when we are ready for it...

Am I an asshole?

edit: Removed a misplaced ""no matter what"" that was bugging me when I re-read it

edit: I should maybe clarify. I haven't made the threats after she got pregnant, but I have several times before. And I know she knows and she remembers, as she has talked with her friends about it today

edit 3: I forgot to mention, one big reason we have had this chat beforehand is that her older brother accodntally got a girl pregnant as a ONS. She told him she had an abortion, but apparently she didnt have it. Now they got two (albeit very cute) twin daughters, is still with the girl even thoigh he clearly doesn't like her, and his software career is pretty much fucked because she's a stay-at-home mom that doesn't give a shit about the kids.

1720,Not the A-hole,"*sorry for any typos or grammar errors, wrote this quickly on my phone*

Me and my friend Grace grew up together, and ever since we were little, both wanted to be doctors. We went to the same college, and both started off as premeds our freshman year. 

Our first year, Grace unfortunately ended up doing pretty poorly in her premed classes. Still determined to be a doctor, she started putting in more time and effort into her studies. I on the other hand, excelled in my premed classes. I offered to help her,and we often studied together, but she really struggled to understand the material. She hired private tutors, studied day and night, but nothing seemed to help. Even though her grades did improve from freshman year, they still weren’t high enough to be competitive for medical school. During our sophomore year, she decided to switch to nursing. She was eventually accepted into our schools nursing program and has been doing great in the program. I’m really happy for her, and am glad she’s found the right profession for her. 

Recently, I was accepted into medical school. To say it was the best day of my life doesn’t even come close to expressing how happy I was. This has been a dream of mine for as long as I can remember. Naturally, she was one of the first people I called when I found out, but her reaction really surprised me. She told me that going to medical school is a huge waste of time, and that the future of medicine is nursing. That nurses are the real heroes of medicine and that doctors don’t really care about patients and only the money. These comments really made me upset, and I just asked her why she couldn’t be happy for me when she knows this is what I’ve wanted for a long time. She said she was just being honest. I left it at that and said I had to go.

The next day she called me again and said that she was sorry for hurting my feelings, but she wanted me to know the truth, which was that I would be better off going to nursing school. She said nurse practitioners learn everything a doctor does in 2 years, and that medical school is a huge waste of time and money. I got really upset and told her that I don’t appreciate her comments, and that she doesn’t know what she’s talking about. That nurse practitioners do not learn everything that a doctor does in 2 years, and to say that is an insult to doctors. I also told her that her earlier comments about doctors being in it for the money  were extremely disrespectful considering most doctors go in to enormous debt, give up 11-15 years of their life to train, and undergo massive amounts of stress all to help people. She called me a pretentious asshole and hung up.

1721,Asshole,"I adopted a two and a half month old kitten three days ago and I’m already regretting it immensely. It wasn’t really a reckless decision, I’ve been moved out of my parents place for four years and it’s always something I’ve thought about. I love animals and adore my parents’ dogs. But I’ve never had a cat or lived with one, and I’ve never really been around kittens. But I’m an animal lover so I thought it would be fine, and I could be a better owner than to a dog because of my work and college schedule. 

Last Monday I moved into my own apartment (no roommates or their dogs) and on Friday I said “fuck it I’m getting a cat.” My kitten is very cute and sweet but I was not prepared for how needy he’d be. He insists on sitting on my face and purring 24/7 and following me from room to room. Also he’ll only use his litter box if I’m in the same room as it because he CANNOT be away from me for a second or he’ll start meowing his head off, otherwise he just pees right next to me. I’ve been cleaning the litter box 3-4 times a day and my apartment still smells like cat. I always thought that cat houses had that smell because the owners weren’t diligent enough, but nope, they all smell like that. I’m quickly coming to the conclusion I’m just not a cat person. 

I always swore I would never be the type of early 20s fucker that recklessly got animals and disposed of them and I feel like that’s what I am. This cat deserves better and idk what to do. He’s so sweet and I wish someone I knew wanted him, but they don’t. 

AMITA if I take this cat back to the shelter?

1724,Asshole," 

Hello Reddit, I was wondering if I am the asshole in this situation:

I have never liked tattoos (I don’t have any). I really don’t mind if my friends, or anyone gets them, but it’s a preference that I don’t date women with tattoos. My girlfriend knows this (because we’ve talked about it before), but lately she’s been pushing me to “accept” that she wants one.

I told her that of course it’s her choice, because it’s her body and her life. I have no control over that, but, since *she asked for my honest opinion*, I also let her know that I find them repulsive. And to be frank, I probably wouldn’t find her as attractive anymore, and would have difficulty taking her seriously as a potential life-partner (call me shallow, but looks do matter).

She got angry, and tried to make me feel bad about not liking them. Arguing that I was too conservative and such a view was counter to progress and yadda-yadda-yadda.

My stance was: look, you asked me for my opinion. I gave it to you. I admit I have no control over what you do, but to try and guilt me into feeling bad for not liking them is silly. Just because you like tattoos and I don’t doesn’t mean I’m evil.

So am I the asshole here?",599,894,0.89

I have an older child who doesn’t go near the garden. But my year old nephew is just starting to get around and get into things. My sister wants me to cut the plant down and dispose of it. They live just a few minutes away so they’re here quite a bit.

1727,Not the A-hole,"About eight years ago I went to a friend's wedding. While I was there I wound up having a drunken one-night stand with an old friend I went to school with.

The next morning I woke up to her crying, she said she was in a serious relationship and our hookup was a big mistake. I instinctively apologized, but she insisted it was all her fault, and I had no reason to apologize. I gave her my word that I will keep quiet about things, and this would just be our secret.

I've kept my word for years. I never said nothing to anyone, I've actually almost forgot about it myself. 

About a month ago, I was scrolling through Facebook when I seen something that shook my whole world up. I seen a picture of my daughter sitting on some random guy's lap. After a doubletake and a thorough inspection, I realized this was not my daughter. I realized that it was my old friend's husband and their daughter.

The resemblance is uncanny those girls are almost twins. The math adds up and, my thoughts have been driving me crazy for a month now. I want to say something, I feel like I need to know the truth. I need to put my mind to rest. I don't want to break a family, but after my mom passed away, I found out that me and my children are at high risk for colon cancer. If she is my child, I feel like this is something she needs to know.

EDIT: If I found out she was mine, I would most definitely want to be a part of her life. What kind of man would I be if I didn't? I agreed to keep her infidelity a secret, I never agreed to let another man raise my child. 

I feel guilty, because the two of them look so happy in that picture. I would hate to spoil the relationship between those two. I couldn't imagine if I found out my daughter wasn't mine.  But at the same time I can't imagine missing out on my child's life.",3144,11369,0.92
1728,Not the A-hole,"A little back story first.  My SO is an owner of a construction company and employs several dozen contractors in about 5 cities around the state.  From time to time he needs help in our city and on those ""one off"" situations where employees of his are driving in from out of town (approximately 1-2 hours away) he offers our place for them to stay since we have an extra bedroom.  I will also say that 9 times out of 10 these employees are friends of his.  There's a few times where it has been a surprise where he just walks in with one of the guys which leaves me running around the kitchen trying to figure out how to adjust dinner to accommodate and extra mouth to feed.  Last week he had to go out and buy his worker dinner because I just didn't have enough.

&#x200B;

Now, I am more than happy to give them room and board for a few days on those one off's.  I get it, business is tough and whats good for the goose is good for the gander.  When business has been rough before there was a time when we had a different worker living at our house free of charge for up to two months.  This went on for about two years.  I felt like I was being taken advantage of.  After I had about enough of that we compromised with a one week maximum.  Now, I will say that after I put my foot down my SO agreed, apologized and then the workers got hotels, stayed at friends' houses, etc...  

&#x200B;

Now to the situation we have currently: Last Monday family came into town to stay for a couple of days.  I heard that my SO's worker, Michael, was in town as well staying at another coworkers' house.  I'm just glad it's not mine at this point.  Wednesday I received a text from my SO as I am driving home from work stating ""Just FYI, Michael is at our house right now.""  I had no problems with that, workers come over all the time to pickup parts.  Nope, it turns out that Michael was staying with us Wednesday night and Thursday night.  My first thought was, ""Why in the hell now that family left does he need to stay with us?""  Apparently he had been sleeping on the other coworkers' couch and it just wasn't ""ideal"" for him.  I was irritated but the week went okay he was one of his friends so it wasn't too terrible of a time.    

&#x200B;

Now let's fast forward to today, the power is out in my office building so they sent us all home for the day.  I pull up to my house and see Michael's car in the driveway and I am fuming.  I want to take back the compromise, I am just DONE with this.  I'm done feeding these guys for free, I'm done cleaning their dishes, I'm done letting them stay at my house for free, I am just done.  My SO is being highly inconsiderate about letting me know in advance when his workers are coming up here to stay with us and I've just had enough.  They all need to grow up and pay for a hotel room for the night.  I am just over this whole situation.

1729,No A-holes here,"Some context, I’m a 15 year old kid, was 14 at the time. My dad always sucked to me, he was overly strict and his upbringing taught him love was earned, not given. For some years in elementary school I wished my parents would divorce so I didn’t have to deal with him.

However, he was actually getting better around this time last year as a father. Until he divorced my mom. I say he divorced my mom because I wasn’t going to make any judgements until I knew the facts. Which I then learned was that my dad just wasn’t feeling it, and he took off to Florida.

We’re looking at a place that’s around 800 a month. It’s a low-income and the reason I’ve been very keen on the place we’re supposed to be moving into is because it is two blocks away from my school and a 5-10 minute car ride to her work vs the 30 minute commute we both make right now. It is a beautiful place and we are very excited. 

To clarify, neither of our partners are going to live in the apartment. It is just the two of us and we’ve established that should either of our boyfriends move in, we’re split utilities given however many people are living there (right now 2, but if the SO’s move in either 3 or 4 ways) but keep rent 400 and 200/200 for those sharing a room.

I’ve been getting down to the splitting of costs with her over text. The place we’re moving into allows pets with $200 deposit and $20 added to rent a month. I don’t have any pets right now, and she is looking into adopting a cat with her boyfriend, who will not be moving in as of right now. I’ve told her that if she is bringing the cat in, her boyfriend and her should split the deposit and I’m willing to help cover the $20 monthly and include it in the cost of rent.

She seemed a little offput and just responded with “me and [SO] will talk about it”

We were in line for the log flume ride when my son asked if he could go to the bathroom. I said yes, and let him go on his own since the bathroom was in my view. Even though there was no line, he took absolutely forever (as he often does), and I was concerned he wouldn’t be back in time to board the ride. When he finally got out, he walked back at a snail’s pace, and I called out to him, “Come on, let’s hurry it up!” When he continued walking slow, I called out again, “Pronto!” and clapped my hands a couple times.

Immediately after I did this, I heard a long, fierce growl from the ride operator/boarder who was standing nearby, and he began muttering all sorts of obscenities (fuck, shit, son of a bitch, goddamn) loud enough for people in his vicinity to hear. After a while of doing this he angrily mimicked my “pronto!” and clapping; which indicated to me he thought I had been saying this and the “hurry up!” to **him**.

I told him politely, “Sir, I wasn’t saying that to you. I was talking to my son.” He gave me an angry look, indicating he didn’t believe me, and kept on grousing. As he boarded my kids and I he continued scowling and muttering, and I said to him again, “Sir, really. I promise I wasn’t saying that to you.” Again, he clearly didn’t believe me. We went on the ride, and when we got off, he flashed me another horrid scowl and gestured angrily towards the exit.

That night, I sent an email to the manager/customer service contact provided on the amusement park site detailing what had happened, and received a response the next day apologizing profusely, and offering free tickets for a day.

1737,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway for professional reasons.

I (24m) am a tattoo artist with quite a large following online. For those of you who aren't really into tattoo culture, a big issue in the community is tattoo copying. This is essentially when someone takes a tattoo someone has, and gets another artist to trace the design and get it on them. This is seen as stealing within the community (as designs for us are sold) and is incredibly disrespectful. Any decent artist will not copy a tattoo. I've spoken a lot about this online, as it happens to me a lot, as well as other artists I know.

Last week I had a woman come in for an appointment with me. She was heavily tattooed (I mention this because I think it makes it less likely that she didn't know that tattoo copying is wrong) and two of those were stolen designs I had done on another client. One of them was meaningful to the client, the other was a flash design I did. She showed me the tattoos after I finished designing the tattoo for her that she was getting that day. The conversation went something like:

""I saw these two tattoos on your instagram and had to have them. They're actually done really well and were a good way to tide me over until I could get to you""

""Uh, thanks? Just for the future, most artists don't appreciate it when you copy their work. Those tattoos are supposed to be one-offs.""

""It's a compliment though, really""

""Haven't you ever heard of this issue?""

""Yeah I've heard all the drama about copying tattoos, but I don't see why it's an issue. I wouldn't care if someone copied mine so, who cares.""

That's when I got quite mad. I told her that not only is she acting very ignorant, she is disrespectful and essentially stealing my artwork (she hadn't changed either of the designs at all). I told her to get out of my shop and not to return, as we don't tattoo people who don't respect the industry. I also didn't refund her £100 deposit as she still spent time in the studio getting a design drawn when I could have had another client.

She left a review saying I'm an asshole. The rest of my studio agreed with me on the issue, but we all agree we can see how someone outside the industry might not agree. AITA?

&#x200B;

Update: just to clarify, the deposit was for the design itself. It was a large design that was going to take up her whole thigh, so it took a long time to draw up. I could have had another client in that time.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you so much for the feedback. There's a lot of debate in the comments so I just wanted to give a brief, general overview of what is generally seen as stealing when it comes to tattoos:

Stealing:

\- Taking a picture of another tattoo to an artist and asking for the exact same thing, with no changes.

Not stealing:

\- Getting a pop culture tattoo. A large corporation cannot tattoo you and you are therefore not taking away potential income from anyone by taking a picture of Mickey Mouse to a tattoo artist.

\- Taking inspiration from other tattoos. Taking pictures of tattoos to your artist and saying 'I like this, can I get something similar/with a few changes?' is fine.

\- Buying a design from an artist (tattoo or otherwise) and asking an artist to tattoo it on you.

\- Getting permission from the original artist AND the client with the tattoo (although finding an artist who will copy another's tattoo is generally an indication of their quality).",901,4249,0.95

1742,Not the A-hole,"A little background: Every year, myself and some good friends (who don't see each other often) get together for a weekend away from work, partners, and for some of us, kids. We all drink and catch up and have a relaxing time. Usually it's the only time the whole year we see each other.

The friend in question (who I've known my whole life) had a baby a few months ago. This year, she wants to bring the baby up with her (the baby is about 8 months old). Now, she's not breastfeeding, and she has her husband to take care of the baby, so it's not like she's abandoning him. My question is AITA for not wanting her to bring the baby, and is there any way I can suggest that to her without being an asshole? For the record, I don't have kids, so maybe I just don't get it, but it feels like it'll upend the whole weekend since none of us will actually be able to relax because THERE'S A CRYING BABY, duh! No one else has said anything to her either, which is part of the reason I'm asking.",61,36,0.85
1743,Asshole,"My wife and I manage our finances jointly. (combine all income and budget together) Thanks to /r/personalfinance, I firmly believe that every dollar I earn/spend has to have a purpose, no matter how small the amount. I also believe that if we were to help either of our parents, it should be not only mutually agreed, but also budgeted for. The emphasis here is that I believe helping either of the parents shouldn't be from just their biological child, but rather from both of us, since we're a couple that manages money jointly.

To allow some flexibility on personal expenses, we give ourselves a fixed “allowance”. Beer night out, football tickets, etc. come out from here. She doesn’t have as many hobbies as I, but she uses it for girl’s night out or non-essential expensive shopping. For the most part she is not a big spender in the first place so often has money leftover.

I noticed that she uses her allowance for her parents. While traveling to Europe, we wanted to bring back some souvenirs for the family. We agreed to cap the gift budget at $50 on each of our parents. After buying gifts that total up to $50, she wanted to buy more stuff for her dad, and said ""I'll just pay for it with my own allowance."" It's her money, so I couldn't say anything, but it didn't feel that great, for reasons I still can't exactly articulate. I just remember thinking “why the hell did we agree to cap it at $50 then?”

Not too long ago, I learned that she's paying for her parents' cell phone bill with her allowance. She's been on their family plan, and her portion of the bill is obviously budgeted for. I learned that she's been paying the rest of the bill out of her pocket. Another time, her dad was complaining about how icloud storage is not enough. She signed him up for the upgraded storage, and I saw her entering her personal card instead of asking for his. I mean, it's like $1/month so not a big deal, but I guess it irritated me a little just based on principle.

It's not like I don't want to spend money on her parents. In fact, when we eat out with her parents, we pay 95%+ of the time. He's yet to pay for the full check once in my 4-year marriage. Neither my nor her parents are that well off, so we try to open our wallet as much as we can. It often causes our food budget to go over, but we sacrifice elsewhere to make up for it. But paying for meals comes out from our joint budget and WE are treating them.

To summarize why I don’t like her allowance being spent on her parents:

* Instead of “hey, we decided to pay for your cell phone bill to help you out”, she’s been paying on her own without telling me.
* This isn’t what allowances were intended to be. It’s so that within a limit, we can freely enjoy/buy things we want.

Her thought is that it's her money to spend freely, and I should keep my nose out of her business. I'm totally open to changing my view if I'm being too controlling. Am I being the ass hole here? Thanks for any input!!

1744,Not the A-hole,"With all jokes aside, I am a vegan. Not by choice though. I have some digestion issues where my body can't process most food correctly. I must have a strict diet and the vegan is a good way to actually eat food without getting nutritions through a tube. 

Most of the vegan stereotypes ain't true. I and most of my friends don't harass people for their choices on what they eat. Your life, your body. Do whatever. Just please be respectful to the animals etc. Most...some of us won't have a meltdown if there a piece of cheese on my food.

With all that said, I do have a few friends who are those hardcore stereotype vegans who would walk into restaurants yelling meat is murder or would block as well lecture people why they're destroying the world and animals are friends while people are trying to get burgers for a 4th of July party. 

I and my friend in question had heated debates to the point we both turn red everytime on what to feed our pets. We both have two dogs. I feed my dogs what is recommended by the veterinarian. I completely understand they have different needs than people. My friend the other hand, feeds them a vegan diet as she believes it can be good for them as well. 

Every time we hang out, her dogs look so sickly. They never have the energy to play even though they both are about a year old. Give or take. For the last three months, they got worse. They walk around looking confused, lost interest in everything and lost so much weight. Last week I called SPCA and law enforcement because the dog would not move even if you push them. The cops came by and took the dogs away. 

The group of friends is split down the middle of what I did. Some say we waited too long and others are saying I'm an asshole. I do feel bad for my friend. Disregard the diet, she loves those dogs and did care for their wellbeing. She hasn't stop crying or said a word to me. I felt maybe I could've done something different before I called the cops. Maybe I could've taken the dogs myself and/or have her talk to medical professionals about dog's health needs but I was so angry when I last saw the dogs I just had too. Now I feel so guilty. AITA?

1745,Asshole,"We adopted a dog two weeks ago, she was only 20wk old and is a Cairn terrier mix. Training so far has been going well, she's already starting to like her crate and messes outside 90% of the time. She's lovely with our son, maybe a little too rambunctious (won't stop chasing, licking, etc unless we separate them). This is all good and dandy but she isn't cuddly at all. She cries when held, doesn't like pets, and generally is antisocial.

This isn't our first dog. We had a Yorkie and a Norwich before this one and they were so cuddly, they just would beg for pets and cuddles and would like nothing more than lay beside you. This new dog is just a completely different personality, not what we were lead to believe (we were told she's cuddly).

Would I be the asshole for returning her to the kennel we got her from? We paid a $500 adoption fee and after the fact got her another round of vaccinations and deworming. We paid the $500 but put another $300 or so into her. Even if we didn't get our money back, the issue isn't the money, it's the dog's personality.",102,63,0.68
1746,Asshole,"so i work for a really small IT firm in Canada, and recently we finally finished a big project so our upper management (who are based in another city) came to town and took our entire office (only 6 staff members) out to dinner, in a fancy restaurant about 2 miles out of town. The Menu there was already pre decided for everyone. The menu was only revealed to us about 2 hours before we were supposed to arrive so I didn't have chance to see it, but lets just say management had splashed the fuck out on this.

but I am a picky eater, like seriously. I only eat about 10-15 foods. and I rotate them within my diet, and cook for myself.

I pulled my boss aside (the one who runs our office) and explained that I would not eat any of the food selected and if I could just order off the regular menu this restaurant has (where I would've been able to get 2 but not 3 courses that I'd eat) he said no and that ""I'll eat what I'm given if I want to show respect""

so anyway, the starter came and it was **Broccoli soup**, I don't like broccoli soup so I just ate one of the slices of bread that came on the side of the dish.

The Main Course was **Lobster fried rice**, I absolutely despise lobster so I didn't touch a single thing on this plate and just sat there sort of staring at it, while drinking my water (which I had ordered to not drink the expensive $200 bottle of wine which i didn't like)

at this point I could see my boss might be slightly frustrated with me so I kept my conversation down to a bare minimum.

When dessert came it was just lots of fruit and a couple bowls of things to dip in (think strawberries and cream) I don't eat fruit so I too had none of this.

When it was time to say goodbye the 2 men from management shook my hand but didn't speak a word to me like they had to everyone else, and my boss simply didn't say a word to me. but I received a text a few hours after saying ""we'll talk next time you're in the office"" (I'm on vacation for 4 days now)

1749,Not the A-hole,"My sister is an entomologist. As such, she takes bugs as pets - currently she has some stick bugs.

Two weeks ago, she asked me to collect them some leaves for food. She knew I'd only be able to go late at night, as I was busy before, and she was fine with it. She told me to look for a bush with thorns in a specific area. 

Well, I went to that area - it's an by intersection of a highway, near our place, but it took me 29 extra minutes to get there otw home. I reached the place she had told me and called to ask where they were specifically - she informed me that I'd have to cross the fucking highway. I said no, but when she hung up, sounding pissed, I felt bad. So, I crossed the goddamn highway in the middle of the night to reach a dark patch of land with grass and bushes. 

I checked every bush I could see - none of them had thorns. I walked deeper in, going through tallgrass that could contain god knows what - nothing. I called her again, she gave me vague instructions, assuming I'd just know, then practically yelled at me to just leave it alone and come home. 

I kept searching for a few minutes until my mom called, asking what was taking me so long. I told her what I was doing, and she said ""At this hour?! Here, let me let you talk to her."" Over the line, I can hear my sister yelling ""Didn't I tell him to leave it alone?!"" Then she picks up and yells at me. 

By now, I give up and I headed home angry. I figured she'd collect the leaves herself later, and all would be fine. 

It's now two weeks later. 

She just came back from her three day trip to find that, unfortunately, all but three of the bugs are dead. She said something like ""Ah shit, I'll get dressed and go out to bring these remaining ones food,"" then she paused. ""I couldn't feed them before I left because I couldn't get to the bush and YOU couldn't find the right one! Like how hard is it to find [specific type of bush]?!""

That caught me way off guard. It's been TWO WEEKS. The place is /20 minutes away/ from our place at MOST. She never had an hour to spare over two fucking weeks?! She couldn't just ask me to go again?! 

I told her, very clearly, ""I went out of my way to go there, in the middle of the night, and you yelled at me for not being able to find it.""

She yelled again for a few minutes, then said ""I'll go out, so follow me and I'll show you where it is"". I just stared at her. ""No. I've been studying all day, and my exams are coming up. I'm not going anywhere.""

""So what, are they supposed to starve?! I'm leaving again soon, what will they do then?!"" At this point, I'm unsympathetic. I tell her to take a picture of the bush and I'll recognize it next time, she looks at me like I smacked her. Then she says ""thanks"" in the most passive agreessive tone and stops speaking to me. 

I'm fucking mad at her since I went out of her way as a favour and she fucking yelled at me for it, but at the same time I do feel bad for the bugs dying.

1755,Not the A-hole,"Hi all. 

Me and my husband Elliot have a a six month old baby, Matthew. For the past four months we have also had my 28 year old niece, Grace living with us. 

Grace is a banker working for one of the big investment banks. She initially worked in the branch in her home city, but as they wanted to further her career she transferred to the company's main base which is a commuting distance from our home. Although the company paid for her accommodation for the first few weeks, she was expected to sort something for herself since it was a permanent position. Although Grace earns a great salary and could easily afford a small place, my sister Claire begged me to let Grace stay at our place since she wanted her daughter to have a ''proper home''. I am only 10 years older than Grace and as such have always saw her as a little sister so I was happy to say yes. 

However, Claire and her husband David spoiled Grace when she was growing up and unfortunately Grace has not grown out of that mentality. She does not help out around the house and expects us to clean up after her in spite of the fact that we have a baby to care for. She expects us to cook for her and clean her room for her and is never grateful for any of this. In addition to this she has not grown out of her partying lifestyle and on most weekends goes out clubbing and returns in the early hours of the morning, and she makes no effort to be quiet which is a nightmare when we are trying to keep Matthew asleep. At times she has even brought random young men home with her which makes even more of a racket. 

Last night Claire phoned Grace and she was crying on the phone, saying that she hates it here and that we don't make her feel welcome. Claire then spoke to me and said that we should be a bit ''nicer'' to Grace. I then retorted saying that if Grace doesn't like the way we live, she's free to start looking for her own place. Claire was furious at that and went mental at me for being ''unfair'' to her daughter. 

I did not tell Grace to leave. All I suggested was that she either get used to being treated like an adult or find a place of her own, since we won't baby her like Claire and David do. 

Grace is at work and so is Elliot, but I'm wondering if I was a bit too harsh and maybe should have spoken to Grace before I dropped that on her?",331,2352,0.94
1756,No A-holes here,"My domestic partner requested that I make this post to gauge the opinion of uninvolved third parties. In the past few years, as my grandparents get on in age, they’ve been telling me, and now us, about how I stand to inherit their home once they decide to move into a retirement community or in the event of one of their deaths. Since we were all over for Father’s Day the subject came up once again. 

She and I are in agreement over one part, my mother expects that even once the home is in my name that it will continue to be the sole location for any and all family events; my partner and I have already agreed that we will set hard limits on which events we host and that it will not be the same type of open door policy to extended family. However, we came to a disagreement when discussing how we’d decorate one of the rooms. 

What my grandparents currently use as the living room is divided by a brick wall, and above the couch are nicely framed portraits and collages of our family, aunts, uncles, adopted siblings, myself and biological siblings, my grandparents family from where they emigrated, etc. As we’re discussing turning that living room into a recreation room she says, “We’re getting rid of all the pictures on the wall, right?” To which I replied, “Excuse me, you want me to put away all the pictures of my family?” Fortunately we have a very good rapport, that’s why I wanna marry her, but we were not seeing eye to eye on this issue. 

She is of the opinion that since she hasn’t met most of the people pictured that there’s no reason to have them up. I explained that my intention would be to rearrange the wall of portraits, adding photos of her family, our adventures as a couple and eventual family together. She persisted that she thought we should remove all the photos my grandparents have in the house and then populate it solely with photos of our own. I said that I would never dream of doing the same to the home her parents intend on willing to her so how could she expect me to do the same? Eventually we settled on the idea that if/when I inherit the home and pictures that we’ll only leave up the ones I’m “actually” related to.

1758,Not the A-hole,"I have been married for 10+ years and my wife's good female friend is an alcoholic. My wife is not an alcoholic but is a binge drinker when she goes out drinking. Her guard is down when drunk and between her and her friend there is very little responsibility taken because both can egg each other on.

&#x200B;

Years ago we went to visit her friend out of town and her friend brought back a man to her apartment after bar close. It was awkward.  The next year my wife went alone to visit her and I just found out the friend brought back a different man and ended up sleeping with him while my wife was there. My wife said she didn't do anything and left the next morning but it was uncomfortable to hear. The friend is since married and cheats on her husband.  She thinks her husband is an asshole (he is very controlling) but instead of working through it she resents him and goes out to have fun however she wants.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to now. We have a few kids and my wife is stressed out a lot. I'd like her to do anything that helps relax her. Her friend wants to go to New Orleans on a girl's trip just the two of them and my wife is debating if she should go.  I don't try to be a controlling husband but based on the friend's past choices and my wife's inability to stop drinking when going out make me a bit uncomfortable. I don't think my wife would proactively cheat on me but I don't think her alcoholic friend who brings random men back would be a good influence on her, especially when she admittedly gets way too drunk.

Recently they asked if I would be OK acting as a semi-absent babysitter for the girls over the weekend, as they were going on their first trip leaving them home alone for one night (they are a bit young for that though right?). I of course said no problem, and even said I would go over and check on them overnight to make sure they hadn't vanished.

Ordinarily, I would tell her to go to hell and to drive herself, but I decided against that approach this one time.

1760,Asshole,"I'm not American. Pardon my English.

I had my eldest daughter at 16 with my high school girlfriend who was 19. I wanted to have a family anf yes, I was really dumb.

We  got married really young, but we got divorced because I found out that she was sleeping another man who was much older. He had the money, I was not financially secure. She got custody and I got visitation. This continued for a while, but he had the money to pamper my daughter and my finances were not that great. By the time she was 14, idk what happened, but my daughter opted for optional visitation. It simply meant that I could only see her if she wanted to see me. That never happened. 

Around that time, I was just starting to do well for myself and I decided to move away because I could no longer take it. I had to accept the fact that she didn't want to see. I tried to contact my ex for information and pictures but I was simply told that I was infringing on their privacy. Eventually I gave up and I moved on.

I just understood that I had to be financially strong. I concentrated on my real estate business that and I did really well for myself. It's been years now and I'm really happy. I own a very successful real estate firm and I'm married now with a daughter. I owe everything to my wife and my best friend who were really supportive. 

When my eldest daughter was starting college, my ex contacted me and told me that she was divorced. She asked me if I would help with my daughter's college expenses. I gladly helped because I no longer had any financial woes. I also gave her a graduation present ( a lump sum to get her started ). 

So she surprised me with a party yesterday. And she was there. She's 25 now. 25. We had a chat. She apparently missed me so much. She was sorry and she never knew that the money came from me. I call bullshit on that. I told her it was not an attempt to reconcile and I was only doing my duty and walked out. 

Wife tells me that my daughter deserved a chance and I had to take the high road. But it's just too much for me. It's beyond repair and serves no purpose. AITA here.

1764,Not the A-hole,"Not sure the title fits, couldn't think of something better.

My stepsister(18) was asked to give a talk at an autism conference kinda thing, and I talked to one of the organizers and let her know that I was uncomfortable with this decision as my stepsister was planning to just advertise her book in her talk, which is essentially about ""the hardship of growing up as the sister of an autistic child"", which I find inappropriate and insulting. As a result, my stepsister was asked to step down. Now my family is livid at me.

&#x200B;

I am all for advocating the struggles of the left-out siblings,  and their voices need to be heard. But my stepsister is flat-out lying about her experience, which doesn't sit well with me.

I was diagnosed as on the spectrum in my childhood, but found the diagnosis to be virtually irrelevant later in life. I rarely let people know about it, and nobody has ever suspected I could be autistic. My parents divorced about 5 years ago, and my father remarried quickly after. So when I met my stepsister for the first time, she was 13 and I was 20. We are not close at all, and I am not close to my father. We never lived together. We only saw each other a handful of times in the previous years, only for a few hours at a time. I tried to bond with her initially, but she wouldn't shut up about how ""crazy"" I was and how strange it was for her to know somebody with autism. She compared being autistic to being a serial killer and all that fun. My father is an a-hole, so she undoubtedly got that from him. I didn't blame her, but stayed distant after I realised that her weird fascination with my ""craziness"" didn't lessen as she grew older. She kept telling me that she wanted to become a therapist to ""help people like me live a good life"".

Last month, my father let me know that she was publishing her first book. On autism.  He was incredibly proud of her accomplishment and told me how she wanted to give a talk about it at a conference, to ""reach the right audience and give expert advise based on first hand experience"". I thought it was a joke at first. When I found out it wasn't, I was horrified and finally decided to talk to the organizers of the conference, after all attempts at talking to stepsister failed.

I tried to be nice about it; I didn't want to come out and be like ""hey she's a fraud and full of bullshit"", so I worded it carefully, something along the lines of ""I'm uncomfortable about my stepsister using me as a reference in her book, as I don't agree with some of her points and fear that the audience would take offense."" The decision to ask my stepsister to not speak was not made by me.

To be clear: the book is all about her, whining about how hard life is when you have a ""mentally ill"" sister, and how hard it is to cope. It's complete fiction, save for the fact that she's clearly referencing me as the sister throughout.

1765,Not the A-hole,"I'll start by saying I'm not an overly social person. I have never been. I don't enjoy going out with friends or family. I'm a home body, I enjoy being alone and reading books. Lol. 

My husband's family has recently started calling, texting and messaging me on social media trying to spark conversation and invite me to things since I'm a SAHM. I always decline... Frankly because I just don't want to go. I've been with my husband since I was 14, I'm now 30. I've been this way my entire life. He is fine with my introverted personality. *note: I take my kiddos to play dates and parties they're invited to, because my disdain for socializing isn't going to thwart their lives*

My in laws have started talking to my husband, being upset that I never want to chat on the phone or go to their outings. When my husband is off, we will go together to see them and spend time. They see the kids at least once every two weeks, sometimes once a week or more. So it's not like they're not seeing their grandkids.

AITA for not going to hang out for lunches and chat all the time, when I just don't want to?


ETA:

They have come out and said it, but they're giving the vibe that... Since I've known them for so long, I should have gotten over my hate for socializing with them and just suck it up and enjoy time with them.

Hubby doesn't care, other than that they're bugging him about it and he feels pulled in the middle. I've tried telling them myself that I just don't want to be a social butterfly all the time... And when I do, they don't take no for an answer and call him to complain.",205,640,0.95

1767,Not the A-hole,"My neighborhood is adjacent to a large cemetery, and my home's backyard backs right up to it. There's no fence, wall, or anything separating the cemetery from the neighborhood.

I walk my dog through it daily because it is a quiet and grassy space, and I frequently see other people do the same including my neighbors and others who drive with their dogs to it. I keep my dog on leash, don't walk through the spaces with the actual graves unless  I have a reason to like an oncoming car, and pick up after my dog and occasionally other trash I see such as beer cans and other stray trash. I also purposely avoid people mourning and ongoing funerals to the best of my abilities.

Yesterday, a gentleman probably in his 50's or so pulled up to me and my wife in his car with his window down. This happens occasionally since the cemetery is easy to get lost in so I slowed down too. He immediately told us to not walk our dog through the cemetery ever. He was irate from the start, saying things like there are families here, etc. At first, I told him to ""Mind his own business,"" which led him to tell me to, ""Go fuck myself."" I kept walking in the opposite direction of his car to catch up to my wife. He stopped his car, stepped out, continued to tell us to fuck off. I told him to do the same and my wife and I kept walking back to our home.

I understand the sentiment to a degree, but I was not doing anything disrespectful in the moment he accosted us. It was Father's Day, so I understand too if emotions were high for that reason.

AITA for my reaction? And AITA for walking my dog through there in general? I'd like your ideas in case I run into him again or others.",91,58,0.94
1768,Asshole,"Throwaway account.  We were at a local restaurant last Saturday evening. This is a locally owned establishment, not a chain. There was a 30-45 minute wait for tables.  There was another family waiting in the wait area, and the ""mom"" went to the bar and came back with three drinks. A beer for ""dad"" and a margarita for her and one of the young women. There was another young woman there who looked of college age, and had on a college sorority t-shirt, but no drink was brought for her.

But as I watched I noticed that the mom was sharing her margarita with the 4th girl, who I assumed was under 21 as she had no drink of her own. In fact, I'd guess the 4th girl consumed MOST of the mom's margarita. I mentioned this to my husband and he said so what, forget it. Full disclosure that I'm a non drinker myself and certainly don't approve of underage drinking, not to mention that this behavior might put the restaurant at risk. So I mentioned it to the hostess. A short time later a manager (I assume) came and asked to see the girls' ID's. The girl with her own drink produced one. The second girl who had been drinking from Mom's drink did not.  I did not hear the exchange, but the family left thereafter. I assume they were asked to do so. 

My husband said that it was a crappy thing for me to do. I feel like I was protecting the restaurant. Was I the Asshole?",1212,20657,0.77

1770,Asshole,"I know the title sounds bad but just hear me out pls.

This happened about a year and a half ago during my first year of university. I had gotten into a bit of a relationship with this girl and she was super into me. All was well up until about 2 months in and I realized I no longer wanted to be with her. 

I had arranged a day in which I would break things off in person because that would’ve been the right thing to do, right??

Fast forward about a week before doing the deed, keep in mind I chose a day that was after exams as I didn’t want to bring extra stress into her life. 

She texts me asking if everything is ok (I assume I was subconsciously stand-offish as per me no longer sharing feelings. She was suspicious of this). 

That day was also the morning of one of her exams. I was torn because I didn’t want to have to end it with her during exams (let alone on the day of an exam) and I didn’t want to lie and say it was all ok only to break it off with her a week later. 

I decided to respond and say “can we meet up and talk about that?” to which she said something like “I can’t handle face to face. If you’re breaking up with me i’m gonna break up with you first.” and then tried to guilt me about it being on the day of one of her exams. 

Keep in mind I still tried to make her less upset by asking if she had any questions or anything that would help her clear her mind. 

Recently (A YEAR AND A HALF LATER) she’s been telling people that I am and arsehole for doing this. I wouldn’t even have known but she told my current gfs friend who told her who told me. 


I’ve been told that I’m TA and that I’m NTA from varying parties. So I’d just like to know once and for all AITA?

edit: I’ve received a few comments saying that I could have just said something like “I can’t talk now, good luck with the exam!” I’d like to clarify that I got the is everything ok text at about 9am and her exam was at 7pm so I couldn’t just say that because what could I be doing for 10 hours straight that would require me to avoid that question. 

If I had said that it would have caused more of an issue as she would just be wondering all day, thus making it harder to focus on the exam that evening. My bad for the lack of clarity.

Also people saying I should’ve waited one day. How would I have responded to her asking if everything is ok? I would’ve said ya everything’s fine and then the next day just switch, I have trust issues now because of a girl I went out with before her did something like that to me, in my eyes that would just do more bad in the long term.",95,398,0.93
1771,Not the A-hole,"So I (M29) and my partner (F26) split up a few weeks ago, we had been together for 5 years and I know I've loved it and have been really happy for the most part, I would like to think the same for her.

Ever since we got together I have told her I don't want children, not joking in passing but during serious conversation I have made my view's clear and asserted my position that I don't want children of my own.

Let me be clear, I don't hate children, I have nephews ranging from 18 months to 7years old and I love them all and would do, have done, anything for them to help and protect them. I just don't want any children of own.

A few weeks ago my ex and I are sat talking about life, talking about moving somewhere new to live and move on up in life when the conversation about children comes up again. The whole conversation was amicable and there was no yelling or frying pads flying round the room and I tell her my view's and that I don't want children.

I made it clear it has nothing to do with her and I love her and still do but I just don't want children, I have known this since I was about 15 and nothing has changed for me. In fact watching the world as it is that's just been re-enforced.

Come the end of the conversation she is very upset with me, telling me that I should have made this clear from the start as she wouldn't of wasted 5 years with me and then walked out.

TL:DR W were together for 5 years, I don't want children, she did, she feels I have wasted her life for not being clear from the start when I was.

Edit: Thank you for everything you guys have said, I do still really care for her and I do wish her the best. I don't feel that I've wasted any time with her and I believe that what she said was in anger/frustration. Breakups are shit, but I'm British so I'll have a cuppa and carry on.",156,525,0.88
1772,Not the A-hole," My mom runs a summer camp for kids. Every year since she started her business, she has asked me to teach some of the students ballet for two hours a day. This basically means I have to go with her to the school everyday at 7:30 am, teach dance from 2-4, and help out with the kids all day until 6. My mom has never paid me for this, and I have always just done it to help her out. This summer, I have the opportunity for a ""distance internship"", which is basically working with a professor on a project without going to the lab everyday. I would have loved to work in the lab directly this summer, but I knew my mom would need my help. The project turned out to be a lot of work, so I haven't been as involved with the kids at the camp. This really angered my mom, and she complained about me ""wasting time on the computer"" everyday. I tried to tell her I was coding, but she wouldn't believe me. She finally told me she was sick of my behavior and didn't need me anymore. Fine by me, I could finally stay home and be productive without crazy kids all around me. Today came around, and she told me I had to come with her again. She woke me up and yelled at me when I lingered in bed, saying I was so tired because I was always watching TV. I was pretty upset, but then she yelled at me again for being lazy at the camp. My mom has a habit of going off on tangent after tangent, so it eventually got to me being very selfish. I finally told her I didn't want to go with her and told her why - I had work to do, she didn't pay me, she had just berated me pretty harshly, and honestly, I just didn't want to spend my summer chasing after crying kids anymore. She exploded. She told me if I didn't help her, I could never ask her for anything again. I already pay for my own piano lessons, but she wouldn't pay for any of my ballet classes or performances. She also said I could never ask her to pick me up or take me anywhere again, including taking me to my tutoring job since I can't drive. When I argued that other kids don't have to work for free for their parents to get rides and take classes, she told me they all did and I was the only one who was so selfish. There was a lot said, but the worst was it was useless having a daughter like me. I can tell she's serious about everything; my mom doesn't say things like that lightly.

I know this is long, but I feel really hurt. For some background, my mom and I have a good relationship, but we fight fiercely. We are both very stubborn and hold grudges. I really don't help around the house as much as I should, which is one of the things she brought up. I am selfish and lazy, so I can see her point. My dad and brother both basically took her side, so I guess I wanted to know if I really am in the wrong here. I love my mom and I want to make up, but I am very angry and sad. I never considered our relationship would be so transactional.

EDIT: thank you all for the good advice. i apologized to my mom for not helping around the house and told her i couldn't help out at the camp everyday. she basically just yelled at me again lol. the gist was if i wasn't willing to help her, why would she help me? I told her i thought that wasn't the right way to handle this, and she used her favorite arguing technique where she says ""ok, I'm the worst mom in the world. I don't care. go away if you're so good."" basically, she doesn't think she's in the wrong or refuses to admit it. hope to try again tomorrow. thanks again.",27,45,0.93
1773,Not the A-hole,"So pretext: 

She moves up here to get away from her boyfriend of 2 years that have been getting into bad arguments and finally ended up spitting on her. She texts me later that night asking if I know anyone with heroin for her friend/roomate. She was withdrawing super badly and she felt bad and had never seen it get this bad before. I told her no but get a medical card and take high doses of weed and it won't be as bad. Completely ignored that. She comes in the next day saying she was up all night vomiting from food allergies. Then asks to go home bc she doesn't feel good bc she's vomiting still. End of shift comes and her drawer is missing $20. So I tell mg hey spa lead asked me for this shit also there's $20 missing from the drawer she opened this morning. After talking with mg and another associate about how much they know about her they all say she lives with her mom and brother when she told me she lives with a roommate. Me and mg talk more and she lets me know that spa lead had had problems with heroin before according to former associates at the spa she relocated from. So time goes by and they don't say anything to her until now and today she is suspended for 5 days and knows I told mg. She asked me why I would do that and I just asked her what her friends name is, bc I honestly don't think she's real and fuck heroin and I'm not dealing w a drugged out bitch shooting up in the bathrooms and calling an ambulance for narcan. Am I really the asshole here? Sure I shouldn't get involved with work drama but c'mon


Update: me and three others are gonna simultaneously quit bc of how the owners treated our mg for handling the situation, as professionally as she could basically not telling until she knew it wasn't just drama, aaaaand spa lead was relocated to our spa like 200 miles away to get her sober bc she had already been using and selling at the spa she relocated from.

1776,Not the A-hole,"So I was in a a stall bathroom at work, and there are three other stalls beside the one I was in. I have a kinda embarrassing health issue so I take a little while in the bathroom to fix stuff. I was in a stall for maybe ten minutes, and was almost finished when someone knocked on the door. The conversation went something like this:
Them: are you alright?

Me: I’m fine! 

Them: you’ve been in there a while

Me: yeah I’m fine. I’ll be out in a bit. 

At this point I get irritated because the stalls next to me are unoccupied, and like,
Leave me alone, I’m busy. I’m praying they’ll just leave. 

Them: Are you here for the training course?

Me: no! I work here! I’ll be out in a bit! I’m fine!

Them: it’s been a while-

I get really annoyed and instead of being like “I need more time to fix my jacked up body” I say 

“I’m fine. Just a little nauseated. I’m ok.”

Them: are you-

Me: LEAVE ME ALONE


The two of them then basically scurried out and sounded shocked. I feel bad because they were clearly just trying to make sure I was alright and they probably had good intentions. aita for yelling at them?

UPDATE: the girls went to my boss. This morning my boss called me out of work and said that a woman came to her office yesterday saying I was crying in the bathroom. I’m furious. Not only was I very clearly not crying, I repeatedly stated I was fine. And she decided to go to my boss? She doesn’t even work with me! She doesn’t know me! I can’t sniff slightly in the bathroom because of a minor cold without being interrogated, disbelieved and reported?

1778,Not the A-hole,"So, I’m currently in college and have two older siblings who have their own families. My mom lives alone, although she lives near my sister, so she visits them very often.

Last Friday, my brother invited me to go with him, my sister, and a few other people to a spring near his house. You have to get to the spring early if you want to get in, as they only let in so many people. This meant we would all be staying at his house overnight and then getting up early to get to the spring.

After I get there, my brother told me that he didn’t invite my mom for a couple reasons: she’s told him in the past that she can’t sleep at his house as their beds aren’t comfortable on her back, she’d have to drive to his house late at night when she hates driving at night, and she told him she’ll be working on Saturday (the day we’re going to the spring). He told me he didn’t want to invite her when he knew she’d say no and she would feel bad for declining.

Anyways, we all go to the spring and we spend about half the day there. Right before we leave, I see a text from my mom asking what I was doing. I told her we were just leaving the spring. She then messages me saying she’s very sad she wasn’t invited and can’t believe that her family went without her. She also tells me that she knew my brother and sister were going, but she didn’t know that they invited me. Apparently, the fact that they invited me and not her is what made her sad. 

I tried telling her the reasons my brother mentioned for why we didn’t invite her and she said that she still would have liked an invite anyways because she was feeling left out. I also told her that I never get to spend time with my siblings where we can just hang out together and that we should be able to do things without her. She responded with a passive aggressive “have fun” and I haven’t talked to her since.

I’m feeling pretty guilty and it breaks my heart when she’s sad. Should I have invited her in the first place?",15,30,0.97
1779,Not the A-hole,"Slightly misleading title, the asshole in questioning is mainly my friend who wants another look at the situation.

Me, my brother and my friend were at a KBBQ restaurant just chillin and the service started off good. A bit of background, my friend DESPISES tipping, he almost never does it. Before everyone just starts calling him an asshole, hes not from the US so the whole system is just kinda absurd to him, and the rest of us usually leave a good tip. It sounds weird but its generally just a meme amongst our friend group at this point, and pushed enough he will leave something, especially for more expensive food.

Anyways, we were all having a good time joking and he was joked about him being a bad tipper and of course a waiter walks by the moment he said it. He didnt mention it but it was obvious he heard and mentioned it to the rest of the staff because our service went from fine to complete shit, as they didnt bring out certain items, took forever, and even brought out a cooked food that was burnt and borderline inedible. They werent outright rude to us but it was obvious they didnt care anymore since they thought werent getting tipped(We all did intend to leave one for the record).

My brother and I felt really bad about the situation and suggested we leave a hefty tip to sort of offset the comment since the service started off fine, but my friend was adamant about not leaving one. His logic was basically they service became trash so why bother leaving one now, even if they did misunderstand him joking. My brother and I ended up leaving a good tip much to his disagreement and when I brought it up to a friend of mine, he sided with my other friend and agreed we were stupid to leave a tip for the service and basically just wasted money. So basically my question is, was my friend an asshole for not tipping this shitty service and to extend were the rest of us dumb in leaving a tip for it? Thinking about it the best thing to do wouldve been to just suck up the embarrassment explain that it was joke, but hindsight is 20/20! What do you think, reddit?

1780,Asshole,"My (19M) little brother Jack (fake name, he's 14M) asked me for advice regarding girls. He then mentioned a list of qualities that a girl he has a crush on says she wants in a guy- funny, sweet, caring, etc. I told him that when trying to get a girl to like you, pay much more attention to how they act than what they say (if anyone was wondering, I'd say the exact same thing if my sibling was a girl and asking me advice about guys). This is because a lot of people, especially during their teenage years, have no idea what they want or what type of people they're attracted to. Sometimes people take the time to reflect/introspect and do truly know what they want, but most in my experience don't. That leads to people saying stuff that usually ends up being widely inaccurate. Therefore, it's their actions- who they're attracted to/date, who they dislike/aren't attracted to, the way they act around you, etc that you have to watch to get a good picture of them. There are girls who say they like good guys but actually are attracted to rebels, and vice versa. There are girls that say they don't like you, but secretly do. So on and so forth. 

&#x200B;

I think this is reasonable, un-sexist advice. But Jack blabbed about it to our parents, and they're pissed because they think it's assholish and sexist. I don't think it is, because as I've already said, I would repeat the exact same advice were the genders switched.",205,224,0.86
1781,Not the A-hole,"Hello. I moved into a place recently and brought with me a very nice and expensive industrial fan, meant for cooling gyms or offices, but it works just as well for a house if you don't mind the noise (it can be very loud at higher settings). There's a similar fan in the common area but the other day it broke.

A little bit about my roommates: there are 5 others besides me, two of them are a father and his kid (4 years). The living area is pretty big (500sq feet with a kitchen) and contains a play area for the kid. It's a little bit chaotic for me so I tend to stay in my room when I'm not cooking or using the bathroom.

I was asked today by the dad if I'd be open to putting the fan in the living area so everyone can use it. I declined, saying that I like my room to be cool and if I moved it then my room would be uncomfortable. He persisted, saying that his kid has health problems that require him to be in a cool environment but would not elaborate when I asked what they were, saying it was private. Fair enough, but I again declined while suggesting that he get a cheaper fan online. He said that it wouldn't work as it's getting too hot for the room to be cooled by a weaker fan.

Lately I've (23F) been experiencing some symptoms of a brain tumour and it's all been a bit scary. I already have severe anxiety and am under a lot of stress, so it's been a bit overwhelming for me. 

Today I had my MRI and I FaceTimed my boyfriend (24M) to show him what it looked like. The conversation was NOT ""hey i'm really panicked/worried, let's see if we can find tumours before my doctors appointment tomorrow"". But instead, I called to show him what the video of the MRI looked like and how the video/images of my brain was interesting/cool.

While showing him I realised he wasn't paying any attention whatsoever and was distracted by his laptop.

I got really upset because he wasn't paying attention when the topic of what we were talking about was serious, even though the conversation tone itself wasn't. He says i'm overreacting and I should have told him that it was a serious topic so he could give me his full attention.

1784,Everyone Sucks,"This one requires a bit of background.

In the three years that I've dated my bf, I've never met his mother. This isn't on purpose - she just moves around a lot and the few times he's been able to go see her I've had something come up on my end.

Despite never having met me, his mother decided to spread a rumour to anyone in the family who would listen that I'm the reason he dumped his last girlfriend (not true) and that he was moving to a new city to get rid of me (also not true, we moved here together for my work).

I was very upset about this. I expected an apology from her and my bf told me to drop it since she apologized to him after he called her about it. She has also taken my bf's cards and maxed them out and ended up getting him blacklisted a few years ago - which is relevant later in the story.

My bf says his mom is not malicious, she ""just doesn't think"". I strongly disagree.

Fast forward a couple of months from that drama and my parents come visit us at our new place. They tell me they're getting divorced. I get horribly sick at the same time (I'm still sick right now) and I'm overall just having a shit weekend.

I see on Facebook that my bfs mother is planning to move to our city, to be with her sons. (His brother also lives here)

My boyfriend and I talk about my parents splitting today, and he says that my mom takes joy in hurting people. He follows that up with ""my mom is not like that"". I get upset and bring up the stuff she did. He says it wasn't to intentionally hurt anyone, it's just because - and I interrupt him and say his mother is a cunt. I'm horrified that I said it, but there it is.

I then tell him I dont want her staying with us when she moves up here because I don't trust her not to steal my cards. We have a massive fight.

I apologize for calling his mother a cunt and he says ""I don't care, I don't believe you"" and leaves.

1785,Everyone Sucks,"My husband and I have been married for two years. Prior to our relationship, he had been in a 4-5 year relationship with another girl. My husband is very protective of me, and we came to a mutual agreement that we would be mindful of respecting each others wishes in regard to the opposite sex. This meant mainly no contact, which we were both fine with.

A few months into our marriage, I found out that his ex regularly reaches out to him. And then I found out that they had talked on the phone a few times, once for almost an hour. He had kept this information from me, which is what upset me. It made me feel like he had something to hide. Initially, we fought for a while every time she would reach out, because I felt like he was being a hypocrite. He will avoid talking to girls with the exception of his ex? It was odd to me.

Finally after some time, he told his ex that it was inappropriate to keep talking because he's married and that it was offending me. He told her he wouldn't be responding to her anymore, but that he wished her well. About a month later, she reached out again.

This triggered over a year of her making attempts to contact him. His phone, Facebook, Viber, etc. He blocked her whenever she tried a new app. A few months ago she messaged him on Viber from a completely different number (because he has her blocked) and it said, ""I know you've been avoiding me for a while, but I was thinking of you because I had a dream about you.""

I was livid because my husband doesn't see it as a big deal, and he doesn't see that she is purposely trying to get into his life. At this poi t I had already asked multiple times to reach out to her. I felt like I had every right. After discussung it, we thought the best response was to ignore it. But I warned him that she would respond in anger at his silence, because her ""dream"" message was her displaying herself and he would be rejecting her. I was right, the next day he woke up to a message that said, ""Lol I thought it was only women who were faithful after marriage.""

So now it is a few months later, and I know the routine. She is going to try to reach out somehow. Low and behold, he had a message request from her on Instagram. We blocked it without even reading it.

I so badly want to reach out to her to tell her to stop. It has been two years of me being patient and respecting my husband's wishes to not say anything to her. It is really bothering me. And now I am pregnant so I am taking everything so much more to heart. Would I be the asshole if I reached out to her to kindly tell her to f off?


EDIT: Since there was some confusion due to my poor description of the boundaries my husband and I have agreed on, I figured I would provide some more context to clear up any misunderstanding. We are a couple from two different cultures, and his is more conservative. I did a poor job when saying the blanket statement, ""not talking to the opposite sex"" as we both have guy and girl friends, coworkers, acquaintances, etc. In his culture, men and women do not spend time alone together. This is not a problem for me since I only see my guy friends in group settings, and we rarely text. The same thing goes for him. If either one of us had a very close friend of the opposite sex, neither one of us would force the other to end a friendship. That's definitely not the kind of agreement we made. It just turns out that my closest friends are female, and his are male. We have established boundaries that we are both comfortable with, which is not spending time alone with the opposite sex, and this is to appease his more conservative upbringing. We both have equal say, and he has been flexible in many ways in our marriage as well. We've worked together to blend our lives in a way that is flexible but still holding true to our roots and core values.

**UPDATE** Thank you everyone for your input. I had a conversation last night with my husband about what needs to happen, what is fair and acceptable to me, etc. I will not be reaching out to her, but he will firmly be putting an end to everything. If she continues, we will take it to the next step as needed. I feel so much better and I am happy my husband was so receptive and supportive. Thanks again, everyone!",28,33,0.92
1786,Not the A-hole,"I only made this account to make this post and I'm not super familiar with Reddit so bare with me re formatting and that. 

Before we get into my potential assholery, some background: I [25M] have a niece who is 6 years old. My older sister [30F] was not in a good place when she had her daughter. Namely she had a severe drinking problem and was heavily involved with a lot of drugs and just some very sketchy people. To avoid my niece being put into the care system after several CPS visits, I took her in shortly before her first birthday. Eventually, my sister gave herself a shake, got her life back on track and got my niece back fulltime two years ago, though she still spends a lot of time with me as my sister is now an ambulance dispatcher so works funny shifts sometimes. My niece is absolutely the apple of my eye and I love her more than anything. Since I raised her for basically the first four years of her life, she and I have always hung out on Father's Day. I'm not arsed about getting gifts or anything like that, but I'll ususally take her to the aquarium or to see a film or something and just spend the day with her. 

So here's the situation. This year, no real plans were made for Father's Day but I'd mentioned in passing about my sister just dropping my niece in with me whenever and she said alright. She was a no show. I tried calling her a bunch of times, to no avail. Eventually, she calls me back at about 10pm last night saying she's sorry she missed me but she'd been super busy. I said it's fine and asked what she'd been up to, and she told me she'd taken a ""Father's Day daytrip"" down to London with her new man (of around 6months) and my niece, our brother and his wife and kids and our parents. I asked how come I wasn't invited and she said because it was a Father's Day thing and I'm not a father. I got a little irritated then and pointed out that I always hang out with my niece on Father's Day, and that it's kinda important to me because I took care of her for four years. My sister shot back saying it's not ""Uncle's Day"" and that she has a stepfather to spend Father's Day with now. I got kinda huffy and ended the call. Later got a text from my brother telling me I'm being a weird entitled tosspot and that if I want to celebrate Father's Day I should have my own kids, and a slightly kinder one from mum saying she's sorry I felt left out but this was a ""dads trip."" 

Idk. I just feel kinda miffed that I've essentially been pushed aside for a man who's been in her life for six months. I'm not like supremely angry or anything and I'll get over it, I just don't think I'm being entitled by expecting to at least be informed of what's going on on a day that's usually my day. Am I being an arse here or what?",71,127,0.97

So it has been 6 weeks since my last post and a lot has changed! The general consensus from people on here was that everyone sucked in the situation, and the best thing to do would be to find a new place. 

After the initial annoyance of realising we would have to find a new place I contacted my employer to ask if my bf and I could move to a new place since they pay for our accommodation, citing some unelaborated ‘challenges’ as being reason for moving. 

However my bf and I were away for a week when I sent the email, and my employer ended up telling Amy we were wanting to move out before we had the chance. 
I received a message from my Amy and apologised for not telling her and we spoke to her about it when we were back. My bf and I didn’t go into any detail with her about why we were leaving due to the fact that we work together, but also in past observations of her she doesn’t take ownership for her behaviour and can’t admit when she’s wrong. 

Now my bf and I are living on our own in a really nice, modern studio apartment that has sea views and we can hear the ocean from our room. So peaceful. I am also now realising our relationship was on the brink before we moved out on our own due to my anger and the lack of privacy. Now I’m the happiest I’ve been in our relationship. 

As well as this since my original post, a few weeks ago I contacted a good friend/ex flatmate of Amy with my concerns about her. This friend then told me she was treated in exactly the same way by Amy, and feels mentally more positive knowing it is Amy who is the problem.
Also (and the reason I posted this today) my boss came to me this afternoon and brought up a huge raft of concerns she is having about Amy as an employee. My boss said she’s always in the office demanding things, she is pushy, expects a lot from them, isn’t doing her job tasks properly and asks to leave work early because she apparently has no work to do - while the rest of us leave late trying to keep up with all the work. 

Since having some space and now speaking to other people about Amy, I am realising she’s not someone I can consider a true friend. However I will remain polite to her while I have to be around her still. 

Thanks to everyone who made me realise this wasn’t a good situation to be in and suggested we move out. 
We are so much happier now.",65,2956,0.98
1788,Not the A-hole,"So, to not disclose real identities, I will be calling my cousin ‘Jake’ for the sake of this post. Jake is the son of my mum’s sister and we didn’t exactly grow up together, but we certainly were around each other a lot growing up. When I was around 8, my family moved across town (1 and a half hours away), so we hardly saw that side of my family apart from at Christmas and Birthdays. 

Now, Jake was always a troubled child. He was constantly abusive, violent, disruptive and disrespectful to anyone he came across. There’s not a time I remember growing up where he didn’t hurt someone around him. I remember when I was 15 I wrote in my journal how unsafe I felt around him... needless to say, at 20 years old, his behaviour hasn’t changed. The kicker of this is that he has never been held accountable for any of his actions. 

Around last year some time, we reconnected at my dad’s 50th. He seemed to have matured as I hadn’t seen him for 2 years prior to this (spoiler: he wasn’t mature). I became close friends with his friend, and Jake started dating my younger sisters friend. This caused us to start hanging out as a group and things were fine for a while. Long story short, the environment became toxic once Jake started dabbling in cocaine and ice. My sister and I stopped hanging out with him and his girlfriend because of this, to which he grew angry about. 

He started abusing my sister and I by sending us texts calling us scum and saying we were c*nts. That was my last straw so I cut him off for good. Now I have my 21st next month, where I will be inviting his mum, my grandparents and my other cousins/aunties/uncles, but will request for him to not be invited. I’m not sure if I will request it formally, or will just invite his Mum without his name on the invitation. AITA for this? Thank you. 

TLDR: I’m inviting my whole family to my 21st birthday next month, except one cousin because of his toxic and abusive behaviour.",14,37,0.87

She told me she can’t stand the smell of cigarettes (I smoke) so she refuses to be around me. We rarely hang out and she always eats alone. Even though I have stopped smoking around her

1792,Not the A-hole,"Yeah, downvote me for the title but hear me out

I'm 15, my friends are 16, including Tara, and one is 17. We're all in the same school, minus Tara, who hangs out with us at a local cafe we all frequent

I have a pretty small friend group. I'm friend that makes jokes to get reactions. I do it less and less as I get older, but my friends have known me as saying some things for shock value. So they're not afraid to toss mean spirited jokes my way.There's never any hard feelings.

There's a girl- I'll call her Tara, that frequently hangs out with, she's been pretty clear about being on the spectrum. That's a nonissue.

Problem is she's blunt- she can be rude and self centered. 

A week ago my friends and I were all sitting, having pretty intimate talks. We're fairly close and we disclose some pretty personal stuff with each other. It's how we are. The conversation eventually turns to the fact that I was born intersex- I have male and female sex organs. You may have heard the term hermaphrodite. The topic of discussion: if I worried about how future partners would react to it, and I shrugged, saying I didn't really want to think about it. Tara says, ""Well, I don't think any guy would ever want to be with you after pulling your pants down. Maybe you should fix it before everyone figures out you're gross down there.""

My friends were shocked. I had to put on a brave face, I just laughed awkwardly.

And then yesterday happened. I was sitting with the same group of friends, and Tara joins in, and starts talking about a webcomic. She interrupted me, but I didn't say anything. Soon, the topic naturally shifted towards something else. Tara pulls the conversation back to the webcomic. The friend who was interrupted makes an excuse to leave. Tara carries on keeping the conversation on her webcomic.

After asking one of my friends about her later, they explained that the webcomic is one of Tara's special interests.

my friend suggests I talk to Tara, and I messaged her. I basically told her I was hurt, and why. I don't know her well enough to joke about her, so I never made a joking comment towards her/about her. Tara messages back after an hour:

""Ok""
""You're being too sensitive. If you'd didn't want me to talk about what's between your legs, you wouldn't have told [redacted]""

I wanted an apology, and she said I wouldn't get one.

I understand that her autism may make her act differently than others in social situations. But I don't think I can interact with a person who doesn't apologize.

AITA here? My friends invited me out and said Tara would be there. I said no, and one asked me if it was because she was autistic. I said no, it's because of how she acts. And now my friend group is split 50/50. Half thinks she can be a bit much, the other thinks I'm being a dick. I do tend to be a bit sensitive when it comes to my gender/sex, and I don't know if I'm overreacting or being unfair.

1793,Not the A-hole,"My brother and his wife popped out a kid almost three years ago. He's working and she's a stay at home mom. I'm not working right now per se. But, I'm working on starting my own business and I'm really starting to struggle for time. (Plus, I have my own problems to deal with which I won't get into.) For the last couple years, they've always used me as a babysitter...but it's never well planned or communicated. It's always some last minute, ""hey, I need to go see a Dr tomorrow"", etc. (To their credit, it's usually not about going out for fun, it's always something like a dr. or some other important thing.) It wrecks havoc on my schedule. And I've told them this before. I've also told them before that they need some kind of babysitter for those situations. I finally got pissed off one night after receiving a last minute can you babysit tomorrow text. (Mostly because I had something planned in the morning that I would have had to cancel.) So I wrote back that fine, but they needed to get a baby sitter or something as soon as possible. I didn't sign up for a kid. (Yes, cold wording...maybe I shouldn't have said it that way.) So I get a pissed reply back that I didn't need to come over and that I don't need to worry about my nephew anymore. I go out maybe once or twice a week for fun. Should I feel guilty about going out rather than shifting work to that time so I can babysit instead? Am I the asshole for not wanting to baby sit my nephew?

1794,Not the A-hole,"Today, one of my roommates texted me a very incoherent message (she was out day drinking) telling me that the landlord was raising rent and requiring two year lease and that she and our other roommate had agreed to these conditions...and signed up their friend to take my room.  We’ve all gotten along this past year so I was completely blindsided by this.  

As a result, I feel pretty uncomfortable, disrespected and want to start preparing for my move. My parents live nearby so I wanted to start bringing things that I don’t use, but the others do, to their house. Would this make me an asshole? I’m worried it will come off as retaliation, instead of steps to make my life easier. 

Context: I’ve lived in this great apartment for almost a year with two other people who knew each other before I moved in (I found out about the apartment via a mutual friend). I wanted to live here another year and never said anything about wanting to leave to either roommate. When I asked why I hadn’t been given a heads up about the change in rent/situation, she said “this is your heads up...”

I wouldn’t have agreed to the two year lease because I want to move out of this city, so everyone would have been okay if I had just been involved in negotiations that directly impact my living situation.

However, when it comes to my brother, she refuses to put me in a position of official power, still telling me to “do my job” but also stating that we are “equal”. Now, my brother is only a year younger than I am, and refuses to believe I am better than him at anything (sibling rivalry I guess). As a result, every time we have worked, he has cut down everything I’ve done, denounced it, told me that I am wrong, and that he can do my job better than I can, and that I am a “hinderance” to the workplace and job site.  Today was another charade after about 3 in the past two weeks and I had finally had enough, I left the job and told my mother that I was still okay with working for her, but since she would not tell my brother that I was the boss, I would not be on the job with him. This caused an outrage with her as I was “giving her ultimatums” and “only people with troubled minds give ultimatums”. I just told her simply that I could not continue working with a crew that actively worked against what I was saying, and that I simply don’t get paid enough to have petty fights in a professional environment.

Her dog has also been in “fights” with backyard critters, resulting in him being injured and needing stitches on his face.

My mom insists that her dog is not aggressive towards people, and has only been sweet and loving towards humans (as most Goldens are.) She is promising me that her dog has been around children before and never acted aggressive in the slightest. She’s upset that I don’t want my child near her dog.

I don’t want to take any chances because I believe her dog could perceive my baby as inferior and bite her. She wants to babysit my child at her house but I am refusing to agree to leave my child at her home if the dog is there and I can’t supervise closely.

So just so you have more information. It is my startup, the whole business model was my idea, the formulas, recipes, everything for the product was my design. I have a job other than this. It's literally just a fun little thing we do together on the weekends. We don't even have an office or an actual shop, or employment contracts.  I pay the other women to help me make the product and to help with marketing etc. We do pop-up shows and sell at farmers markets. Only three of us would be able to cut our hair to donate it. The other three women don't have hair long enough, or it's color treated. Today one of the women whose hair couldn't be donated sent a text and said she's not going to do it, because she just doesn't see the point. The woman whose idea it was got really mad and said she was not going to do it either then. I decided that this was too much stress for what was supposed to be a fun creative endeavor for myself and that I was going to shut down the business, and gift / donate any of the remaining products. So... in the end I did not cut my hair, and nobody else did either. 

&#x200B;

So a few weeks ago one of the women at our startup had the idea that we would all cut our hair off to donate to a place that makes wigs for children with cancer. Everyone is cutting their hair tomorrow, and we have been planning this for about two months. Our startup is a collection of six women who all have day jobs, and our startup is linked to hair products. I really liked the idea, because our community has been really supportive of us and it would be a nice way to give back. We were all set up to do this, advertised on social media etc. and then my  boyfriend proposed to me last weekend. I have really long black beautiful hair, and since I was little I pictured myself getting married with my hair down and a long white lacy veil pinned to it. I told them I didn't want to cut my hair because we haven't set a date for the wedding, and this has been a dream of mine. They are all super super mad at me. I tried to compromise and said we could do it after the wedding date is set. But they don't want to change the date. I really don't want to cut my hair tomorrow. I know it's super vain, but I've look forward to my wedding day since I was little. Am I the asshole?

I liked her back with the sole intention of letting her boyfriend know what she was doing. We hooked up a few times before I finally found out who she was dating by Facebook stalking her.

She told me we were under a tornado warning and that I needed to gather our three year old daughter up and bring her down to the basement.  Around this time, the tornado sirens started blaring.

My wife is  extremely sensitive to storms.  She gets very worried and anxious, and has confided in me that she loses sleep during nighttime storms, worrying about all kinds of disaster scenarios.  I don't shame her for these feelings, but I generally don't pander or validate them.

I got our daughter down to the basement without waking her up and we started looking at the storm tracker.  The tornado warning was in effect from 11 to 11:30.  It was now 11:15,  and the sirens had stopped.  Our house was *barely* within the confines of the warning, and it didn't seem like we were in that much danger; just caution.  Our basement has a loveseat and couch.  My wife was on the couch with our son, my daughter was on the loveseat and I made a decision; I wasn't going to be able to sleep on the floor, and headed back upstairs.

My  wife didn't seem to object to my decision.  As I kissed her goodnight, I made a joke to try and lighten the mood.  I said ""if I get blown away and you find my body, remember I want to be cremated.""

This morning, there were seemingly no repercussions.  We had plans for father's day with my mom and dad, and headed  over to their house.  Not long after getting there and my mom, out of nowhere, goes ""so you wanna be  cremated, huh?""  The comment clicked immediately, and I knew I was in trouble.

They couldn't believe I'd risk  leaving my children fatherless just to avoid sleeping on the floor.  My dad, who I recently started working with, couldn't believe that I'd risk this new venture we've started.

At this point, I'll point out that our area was recently ravaged by an F4 tornado.  It was awful, and a lot of the damage is visible right off a highway, so we're all driving by it frequently.  It's fresh in our minds and I will admit it's chilling to observe.

Every day I enjoy some light reading and a lunch at the same cafe and at the same table. The cafe is mostly empty unless a tour bus has arrived. On this particular day, I arrive a few minutes before the bus and sit in my usual spot - which just happens to be under a large ceiling fan. 

The tourists eventually start waddling in and a woman, probably in her early to mid 70s approaches my table almost instantly and says 'This is where I wanted to sit.' I replied 'Okay', I chuckled slightly and continued reading my book. The woman then leant on the table for what seemed like the better part of a minute until she let out an audible huff and sat at the table adjacent from me.

Her fellow tour friends eventually joined her and she proceeded to complain about how she wanted the table I was sitting at and how I wouldn't move despite being on my own and a younger man. This was designed to be loud enough for me to hear. When the waitress arrived at the table, the woman asked if there was another table with a fan (despite my table visibly being the only one) and then relayed the story of my reluctance to give up my table once more. The waitress came over and gave me a playful scolding - which added to the awkwardness.

It was slightly embarrassing for me but it wasn't all that hot and I felt my principles were more important here. The lady approached with an expectation that I would vacate the seat. This wasn't for mobility but so she could be slightly more comfortable than what she would've been elsewhere. I had no desire to budge.

Her mum can babysit, I have offered to pay for Charlotte's flights, and Emily is allowing her to stay in her hotel room free of charge. 

I have a brother (James). I have never been close to him we are just chalk/cheese. 4 years apart but more like 6 as he repeated Grade 1/I skipped grade 2. We are just totally different people and while we don't necessarily HATE each other, we'd never have chosen to have each other in our lives.
 
He has a 6-year-old daughter (Ava). I am close to her. James’ wife of several years (Kate) has NEVER liked me & is generally unpleasant. Kate looked down on me for being single when we first met, and always does the thing to both my father and I where she makes mean comments and then tries to pretend they’re jokes but everyone knows they are not. She has caused arguments in our family, and they like to live above their means, guilt us for money, and then get angry if we refuse.

I would like Ava to be at my wedding, but I know James and Kate can't afford it. I offered to pay for Ava & James’ flights. He asked about Kate, but I can’t afford to fly Kate over because I'm need to fly Charlotte over to be one of my bridesmaids. I said Kate can come to the wedding, but I can’t afford to pay for her.

James said I should pay for his hotel and and Kate's airfares.

I'm doing decently enough to pay for my best friend and niece to come to my wedding, but not a hotel/flight for Kate. Kate refuses to work despite the fact they struggle and has my brother work 12-14 hour days to support her while at the same time, looking down on people who work in retail or food service. If Kate wants to come to Switzerland, she can get a *job*.
 
My brother is calling me an asshole and going absolutely off at me for this and doing on about ""family FIRST"" and how ""you’re disrespecting Kate"". 

My brother asked if Kate could come instead of Ava if I can afford 2 flights and I said no WAY. I am willing to pay for my niece but I am NOT going to pay for James and Kate to leave her at home and have a free holiday in Switzerland.

I can't stand Kate. I don't care if she can't come, but I know I have to invite her. But even if I liked her, I can't afford to pay her expenses. He is angry I am choosing Charlotte over Kate. My brother thinks that Kate being my sister in law means she trumps my friends, but I believe that a 29 year long friendship with someone who has always been kind to me and has always supported me and is doing the best she can trumps ""woman who has never been nice to me and chooses not to work"".

1807,Asshole,"Throwaway account.

My youngest daughter (18F), who we’ll call K, is going to be a freshman in college this fall at the same school my older daughter (19F), who we’ll call M, goes to (M will be a junior). 

K is living on campus in the dorms. There are several different dorms, and let me tell you, they are NOT created equal. First you have the older ones with down the hall bathrooms and basement laundry- more “standard” dorms; then you have those that are newer and nicer, with laundry on every floors, AC, an elevator, study rooms, etc- more “deluxe” dorms. Of course, the deluxe ones are more expensive than the standard ones. My husband and I told K that she would be living in a standard dorm, just like we made M do her freshman year (she lives in an apartment now).

Here’s the thing- K found a roommate on her school’s “class of ‘23” Facebook page, and her roommate REALLY wants to live in one of the deluxe dorms, something she did not mention when she said she was looking for a roommate. Since K (understandingly) doesn’t want to argue with her, after giving it some thought, I decided that I would be okay with K living in one of the deluxe dorms. While it’s more than what I wanted to pay, we could still afford it.

I told my husband about this and he doesn’t like this idea. He told me that this was not what we had agreed on, and that K could find another roommate if her current one felt so strongly about living in a deluxe one (of course, this would NOT go over well and the current roommate would be pissed if K decided to not live with her anymore, so that’s not gonna happen). He eventually (but VERY begrudgingly) gave in, but he also told me that it was not fair to M because we had told her that she had to live in one of the standard ones that were not as nice. The thing is though, unlike K, M opted to random roommate, so she was never in a kind of situation her sister is in. 

While M says it doesn’t matter, I feel like she’s not telling the truth.

1808,No A-holes here,"First time poster and on mobile, sorry in advance.

When my boyfriend (we’ll call him N) was in high school, his ex girlfriend (we’ll call her E) died unexpectedly. They were broken up but mainly because she moved to another state. He still loves her and her death has haunted him for the past three years. 

N and I started dating two years ago, and I knew E, but I was not as close to her as he was. 

Throughout our relationship I often felt that he loved her more than me. This upset me, but I loved him and I just wanted to be there for him. I often felt that he would compare me to her, and I’d ask him not too. He mostly stopped, but still talked about her in a way that made it seem like he’d do anything to be with her again. It got to the point where I’d feel jealous of E, and felt that N would care for me more if I were gone. 

About a year into our relationship, I got the courage to talk to my therapist about this. This helped me a lot and I eventually stopped feeling like I should be jealous of E. Before today she was the only person who knew of my feelings. 

This brings me to today. I was physically feeling like shit (migraine, heartburn, etc) and I had been struggling mentally also. Our relationship has also been in a rough patch, leaving me feeling anxious and like I am not good enough. We were at N’s house. I did some homework and N picked up a book. He said it was E’s favorite. I asked him if he knew my favorite book (which I had suggested he read numerous times) and he said no. After I finished studying, I told him I wanted to go home. He asked why, and I cited my physical complaints, and said “I also feel inferior to a dead girl.” 

He flipped out and started yelling, saying that I should not have called her a “dead girl” We fought more about how he talked about her and how that had upset me. He said I had crossed a line and that he needed space, and I took my stuff from his house and walked home. 

My question is, AITA for telling him how I felt about his ex girlfriend? I am willing to apologize if I am in the wrong, but I have been upset about this for much too long and I don’t think I’m thinking straight.",33,36,0.84

1812,Not the A-hole,"So my older sister is 24, and since she was about 19, has worked with people on the autism spectrum. I myself have very minor Aspergers, and she acts like the stuff she learned applies to me as well. 

We had gone to a grocery store and on the way back, she was telling me how the film Inside Out is great for autistic people, and how I should watch it because of this. I’ve told her repeatedly how I don’t like for her to bring up my condition with me or others. She’s never respected this, I have her on audio telling others about how the reason she got into her field is that her younger brother is on the spectrum. 

So after she mentions the film, I ask her why it would apply to me. She then goes on to say that it would help me express my emotions more clearly. I explain to her that I’ve never had an issue with people understanding how I feel. She then goes on to say that I do have trouble with this, as that’s was autistic people have. 

I’m naturally offended by this, and I told her that just because I’m on the spectrum, it doesn’t mean that I have the same issues that others on the spectrum do. I ended my message by telling her that just because she has a degree, that doesn’t mean she knows everything about every autistic person. 

She then flips out and calls me an asshole and a smartass, I tell her that I’ve asked her nicely multiple times to just treat me like a normal person and to not mention anything about autism or my Aspergers, and every time she’s said yes and never respect my wishes. She then says that nobody actually cares about what I talk about and that because of my autism I’ve never noticed. She then goes and tells me that no matter how hard I try, I’ll never be able to not be this way. 

When we got home, I went to my room and just cried for so long, and almost had a full breakdown, I had always been told that I was very independent and emotionally clear for someone on the spectrum, and to have her, a person with work experience and a degree, tell me I’m no different, just caused me to question all this.

1813,Not the A-hole,"I'm a PCA that gives medications at a nursing home. 
I mainly work in the dementia ward and I love it.  I love the different personalities and the one on one's, the group activities and just the atmosphere. You'll love it or hate it.  

The general rule for the dementia wing is to keep everyone calm and happy and that can mean telling some white lies. 

One particular resident is constantly imagining scenerarios that his family needs him and that his mother and wife are still alive from time to time. 
Nothing new but this man's particular family is sick of telling him again and again about his situation and have asked us to reinforce his actual situation which leaves him heartbroken and angry. 

My choice is valued by some and frowned upon by other staff. 

I go against these wishes for a number of reasons.

1- he will always forget anyway and creating a fake reason leaves him feeling better and not fretting.  
(I say he's staying with us for a couple of nights to make sure he's fit enough soon to go back home to his family and wife and nothing is urgent for him to be there) 

2- when we tell him,  he gets upset and angry,  forgets the reason behind it and gets frustrated and aggressive because he can't remember why) 

3- he tries to break out of the flywire windows if the doors aren't locked to get out and walk a couple towns over to his home. (he used to before we started locking doors) 

I know I'm in the wrong in some ways by going against the wishes of the direct family but his behavior, like everyone else's, is much much better. 

My choice in doing this is because of his first and foremost and everyone else's safety. 

Also not a throw away account, I risk my karma for fair but firm judgement.


Also to note, my bosses in private and direct nurses agree with my opinion. I've  also told the family of my reasoning even if they disagree or don't understand.",162,714,0.97

As a result, she held up the security line for a long time. I finally had it and told her she should have been aware of the rules about liquids before getting in line and should have prepared for security screening before getting in line. I suggested that she step aside and let other travelers through and my suggestion was met with a few cheers. 

She seemed really embarrassed but didn’t apologize at all. After I passed the screen I mentioned to the TSA agent he should manage the queue better.

1817,No A-holes here,"I became unintentionally pregnant a few months ago, once I told my boyfriend he was over the moon once he got over the initial shock. I felt like a fucking monster when I interrupted him in the middle of his happy babbling about buying baby stuff and telling his parents, I told him I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep it and the mood quickly did a 180 from there. He sat me down and told me that it was up to me to decide what to do about the baby because I was one the carrying it and he'd support me no matter what. While sweet it somehow managed to make me feel even worse.

We both agreed early in our relationship that we wanted children when we got our lives sorted out and were financially stable, but my boyfriend simply adores children and is always at his happiest when playing with his niece and infant nephew. So he clearly wouldn't mind having children a bit earlier and I feel like a shitty girlfriend for depriving him of that.

I spent a full week thinking it over but in the end I decided to get an abortion. We're both only 21 and still studying in university. Along with that while we're both financially responsible we still only barely get by on our rent, working part time and going to university full time wouldn't leave us with enough time and money to properly raise a child together.

I told him my decision and while he clearly had a hurt look on his face he agreed with my decision and said it would be the smart thing to do. Two weeks later I had the the abortion. There was a *lot* of mutual crying and we both took a few days off to cope with it. My boyfriend -sweetheart that he is- tries not to get upset around me, knowing how guilty it makes me feel. But it's obvious from silent phases he's become prone to and the fact that's been distancing himself away from his niece and nephew that he's not coping well with it.

I've tested the waters to see if he's willing to go to my therapy sessions with me but he's insisted that there's no need. Which clearly isn't the case considering how miserable he is with the whole thing. He's slowly getting back to his old optimistic self as time passes, but the lingering regret is still clearly there and I feel like shit because of it.",82,40,0.88
1818,Everyone Sucks,"
Brief overview: my ex and I had a horrible falling out, she accused me of domestic violence and took my son away from me. I fought tooth and nail to be award joint legal/physical custody. She made the process harder by marrying into money and law enforcement, but in the end I got what I wanted. The problem began when she forced our son to call him “dad”, which I was fine with, but I started not being included in appointments, school events/ emergency contact lists as his father, it was his stepdad. Meanwhile, my ex brainwashed our son to think SD is more important than myself because of money. My son is 8 now and he doesn’t care about me and frankly treats me bad. 

The problem: part of our agreement is that we get him for respected parent holidays ie mothers/Father’s Day. On my school day he told me he was working on a Father’s Day gift for me. He went to his moms for her days and he was returned to me today with no gift. Now, it’s not about receiving a gift, but when he saw me I got no happy Father’s Day, instead I was greeted with a “I forgot to make you a gift”. I asked him what happened I thought you worked on one in school. He replied claiming he made nothing, which was a lie. I confronted about his lie, which he denied twice before admitting he gave it to his dad (SD). Again, it’s not about the gift it’s about the lie. This isn’t the first time he’s lied to me and I’ve talked to him about how bad lying is. I’m not going deny, my feelings are hurt, mostly because he feels like he has to lie to me and that he prefers SD to me because of the lies his mom is telling about myself. He’s told me he doesn’t love me/ not suppose to love me because his mom threatens to take her love away from him; and has to love SD or no gifts/vacations. 

I’ve given so much for him financially, emotionally and physically. I have given so many opportunities up, and I’ve tried so many different ways to understand his thought process and to be honest and truthful to him, but still nothing back. I’m at that point that I’m no longer happy because he always looks miserable around me and he doesn’t appreciate anything I give him because to him it’s always a comparison (SD/mom got him something better). And as much as it pains me to say, I regret fighting this hard for him. People say it’ll get easier, but it’s not. AITA for wanting to give up the fight.

EDIT/UPDATE: Honestly I didn’t expect this post to get this much traction. I want to thank everyone who commented, who took the time to read what I wrote, that what you wrote didn’t go unnoticed. I apologise I can’t respond to everyone since this was so overwhelming. 

I just want to express that i read every comment, I understand and accept the judgement given to me. I do want to clear a few things up. First and most importantly, I tell my son everyday I have him, every time I see him and every phone conversation I get with him that I love him. Second is that I should have expressed this was a feeling and not actually going through with it. Third, the domestic violence was on me not her, I had witnesses who testified on my behalf and it went to court. Lastly, my son is in therapy, he has a court appointed one, a personal one and he has a weekly meeting with his school counsellor.

Again, thank you for sharing your thoughts, i know and understand this is a controversial and sensitive topic. I appreciate all of those who gave advice and suggestions in what I could do to help my son, better our relationship, my mental state and legally (amongst other things). Thank you to those who shared their personal experiences, both parents (step-parents) and children of divorce. Hearing experiences made me realise I’m not alone, that people go through this too, that me feeling anything remotely negative is fine, it comes down to acting on it. Like many of you said the best I can do now is make sure he understands I’m there and will always be there for him no matter what, I know it’s going to be a long hard battle, but he is my son and worth every second of it.

1821,Asshole,"TLDR: People microwave fish at work. It smells really bad and I have a reaction to it. I cannot comfortably work in this environment. Talking to the individual hasn't helped, neither has talking to management. I've done some passive aggressive things out of frustration since then. It's a small office and there's nowhere I can move that will avoid the smell.

*********************************

Some clarifications

It's a small office. I can move desks technically, but 10 feet doesn't really avoid the smell. There are no windows.

My regrettable actions involving my passive-aggressive approach was done long after other appropriate actions were taken with no successful change. It absolutely wasn't my first approach.

*********************************

I work in a small office and my work space is right next to the break room. We have a few people who microwave fish regularly, 3-4 times a week.

I have a personal aversion to seafood, but I try to not let that affect what other people eat around me. I’ll go to seafood restaurants with friends and just order something else, for example.

But the stuff they microwave at work is rank. It permeates through the HVAC and sticks in the air for over an hour. It is nauseating and it’s caused me to leave the office or else I’d be throwing up at my desk.

It has been my opinion that microwaving fish is a big social faux pas, and that I would have somewhat stronger support from my co-workers in voicing my complaints on this matter.

I have tried the following:
Politely talking to the offending parties about the problem.
Offering alternatives (fish meals that can be eaten cold).
Asking them to limit it to days I am in the field, which is usually 2-3 days a week. That sort of worked, except he still does it on days that I’m there, and tells me he’s about to make his lunch with the expectation that I leave, or that I deal with it.

In all these cases I was led to believe that I was being unreasonable for my request.

I tried talking to management about it. They pretty much shrugged their shoulders because there is no real rule they can enforce, and the other guy is kind of a personality where they don’t care to interfere with him.

The only thing they have done is to enforce that the break room door stay closed, then washed their hands of it and declared problem solved. Well when it gets sucked up into the HVAC and dumped right over my desk I don’t think it helps. If anything now it keeps the smell bottled up longer instead of at least dissipating out into the hallways quicker.

So I’ve resorted to public shaming by passive aggressive notes in our company chat, but I get reprimanded for doing so. Now I just spray a whole can of febreeze around the office to try to clear the smell, but honestly it’s also to try to smoke out the offenders with an otherwise equally offensive smell.

Am I the asshole? Am I out of touch? Is microwaving fish in the office something that I should just suffer to be OK with? I’d have hoped that this guy would be a bit more sympathetic to my requests as they functionally got peanuts banned from the office due to his own issues.

I’ve now pretty much just taken every excuse to avoid coming into the office and working from my remote client locations longer than I’d necessary.",192,195,0.92

We live in a small town and most parents will actually also convene in the centre where there plenty open air restaurants/ fountains etc so it’s not uncommon to see families drive in and split up with the teen kids hanging out while the rest wine and dine. 

It’s a fairly safe town but as any small town, the creeps are CREEPS and our town has a decent percentage of out of towners come through at any given time due to our proximity to the beach. 

My daughter is incredibly beautiful and it pains me to say she’s been the target for losers harassing her plenty of times over the years. A creep approached my wife when my daughter was 4 and tried to buy her. When she was out with her cousin when she was 12 a man tried to grab her. I’ve been out with her and seen grown ass men approach her bravely like she isn’t a goddamn kid and so naturally I and my wife are very cautious and have spoken to her regarding personal safety. 

Last Friday rolls around and she wanted to go out wearing attire that whilst I wouldn’t describe as scandalous AT ALL, it’s what all goddamn teens wear, made me concerned for her safety. My wife and I had planned to meet her folks for dinner anyway so we took her into town with us and after asking her where she’d be (at the bubble tea place) we sat down to have dinner. 

All of our businesses and stores are basically
clustered together so after dinner was finished but before we moved onto drinks I briefly told my wife I was going to check in on our kid and I walked over to the store, stuck my neck in to see if she was ok. She looked up and saw me, seemed happy to see me and asked if I wanted to try her tea flavor, and all was well so I walked back to my wife and in laws. 

The reason why I didn’t call or text was because my kid always has her phone on silent and more often than not won’t reply til hours later, which I’m assuming is a universal teen thing. 

My MIL was less than impressed and basically told
me I was being an overbearing father and that I need
to give my daughter breathing space. My wife interjected and told her mom that we support and love our kid and would never stop her from living her life, but if we are in the area of course we’ll use it to our advantage to periodically check that she’s safe.

1827,Asshole,"Hello everyone,

&#x200B;

I would like some perspective on something that happened about a week ago.

&#x200B;

First of all, let me start with a little bit of background. I was born in the lates 80s in Russia and was raised in 90s. For those of you from that part of the world, you get it. For everyone else; growing up in 90s in Russia (especially in the small city like mine) meant that if you are not a son of a gangster, or politician (who are essentially the same people), you will be poor. I will never blame my parents for anything because they worked harder than anyone I know/have met and it's not their fault that the country was in a shit hole. When I grew up, I didn't have much. I went to a school that was right next to my home and many privileged kids went to the same school. So, while I was taking a bus, they had drivers; while I was drawing some doodles in my notebook, they played with action figures (Batman, superman etc.). I was never invited to their PlayStation parties and only heard about those during the breaks. Also, I had to work harder than them because teachers would not give me 5s (A in russian system), as that would mean that I might be on the ""Board of Fame"", instead of those kids. All that led me to one problem; I am always hungry. I don't mean hungry for food; I mean hungry for success. I have to be the best in everything. If I am not, I work my ass off till I become the best. And my goals are only the intermediate step. I don't care much about the end goal; I care more about the process. Once I reach my goals, I am looking at the next one. It's never enough for me. Right now I work for an investment banking and also, working to start my company in fin-tech area.

&#x200B;

My girlfriend is a great person. However, she came up from a middle-income family and she is always happy with what she has. When we started dating, I told her that I have this problem with working extra and I had problems with people before because of that. She said that it didn't bother her but eventually, it led to a conflict.

&#x200B;

We planned to hike. We live in Houston, TX and there is a park in Texas, about 5 hours drive away. We booked a hotel and everything was ready. We planned to leave on Friday afternoon and spend the whole weekend there. On Friday, I get a call from a venture capitalist (one of the largest one in the country) and they want to meet on Monday. That means that I have to prepare for the meeting; I need to polish pretty much everything. I called my girl and told her that I cannot go and explained her the reason why. She got extremely angry and called me all sort of names. We haven't talked at all, so far and it might lead to the breakup. While I understand that I am wrong, am I really the asshole here?

I would appreciate the feedback and comments and I am sorry about the grammar.

EDIT: I was asked to provide more info about the pattern. That kind of things happen about 60% of the time. Being in the investment banking means that no one cares if it's 6 pm on Friday. If a client needs something done, you work until it's done. That's one of the main reasons why investment people in Houston make more than anyone else. We pretty much live at work. So because of those odd hours, I might cancel on some sort of house parties that we are invited to, or I show up in the very end.

EDIT 2: I appreciate everyone's comments and feedback. As I have mentioned in the original posting, I know that I was wrong and I just wanted to see how big of an asshole I am. Looks like a huge one lol. Pretty much it boils down to me talking to my girl and seeing if she can still handle the whole situation and it's not like it will get better until I become VP (another 2-3 years) or leave IB (probably won't ever happen). It was also a great opportunity to fully understand the mentality of people who come from similar background as my gf.",61,35,0.89
1828,Not the A-hole,"Sorry the title sucks I couldn’t think how to word it into a good sentence.

My bf is a smoker coming up 7 years now. We haven’t been able to be flexible with money as he started a new job and we went 5 weeks in between his new pay starting and last pay check. I work from home (social media posts for a restaurant I used to serve at) with our almost 1 year old. I make enough to cover our car insurance and hydro but not much more, the rest of the income is my boyfriend.

I always give my boyfriend my income as he deals with bills. It’s usually a set amount because I made a set amount of posts, but I made a little extra 2 weeks ago (40$) and was planning on going shopping and getting some summer clothes. Not mandatory, but my body is different than it was last year when I was pregnant so it would be nice to buy something more flattering. I never got a chance to go so the money has been sat in my wallet for awhile. He knew this and told me he would drop me off sometime so I could get a break from the baby too.

Today, he tells me he is out of cash and needs to take my 40$ for gas. I gave him about 700$ cash the start of the week so I am completely blown away by how there is nothing left, and ask him what he spend it on. 

His breakdown was:

-200$ hydro bill 

-200$ car insurance

-150$ gas (20-25$ a day) 

-120$ on smokes (16$ pack a day)

I told him he should have about 50$ left and why can’t he spend that? He said he needs it to get smokes. I told him he should’ve made sure he had gas before smokes and that it’s not fair for me to have to give up my spending money when he has already blown through so much on smokes. He said smoking is an addiction, therefore, a necessity and I was being selfish putting spending money over gas. We argued for awhile on and off about this before he just took my 40$ and went to work. 

I feel like I am right, but I would like some perspective if I am being a selfish asshole wanting the 40 for myself and smoking really is that necessary for him or if he is being unreasonable.

Also note: Our baby is very spoiled and taken care of, when I say the 40$ was extra it was extra after bills, food, new clothes, diapers and a new toy all for him.",200,435,0.96

1831,UPDATE,"Here is a link to the original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bxpblv/aita\_for\_following\_my\_42m\_wife\_27f\_around\_for\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bxpblv/aita_for_following_my_42m_wife_27f_around_for_an/).

If you don't want to read it, here's the summary...I believed my wife to be having an affair with a coworker who had repeatedly appeared in her pictures and conversations. So, one happy hour, I followed her. Even though I had seen nothing definitive, I confronted her about the issue, and she threatened to end things with me.

Believe it or not, I listened to your advice. I received extensive advice from both sides. Publicly, everyone agreed I was at fault. In my direct messages, many fervently believed me to be in the right. Regardless, I sat down and talked to my wife about my insecurities concerning her coworker, Brandon. I told her I did not feel as attractive as Brandon and worried that as I was getting older, her interest in me was waning. I also asked her if she felt financially stable in the relationship. I apologized for following her and told her I would never do it again.

She told me several things. First, that she was offended I did not trust her. Second, that she did suspect Brandon had feelings for her based on some of his interactions and comments. Third, that she sometimes felt isolated by my work and never felt motivated one way or the other by my income. The thing about programming is it is hard to explain my work to someone who does not program.

She also told me my physical appearance and aging had no impact on her feelings towards me. She reaffirmed that she loved me and would never throw away our marriage for a divorced coworker.

So, what of our future? I asked her if she still wanted to be with me or if she could not see a future with me after I had followed her. She joked that she would forgive me after drinking a few cocktails at a tropical resort. She told me that in addition to the stalking, the cocktails would also help her forget about all of my past rants about various programming languages (Java, specifically). I haven't told her yet, but I plan to surprise her with an all inclusive package to the Maldives, or some other island young women enjoy that I never heard of until researching...

TL;DR - My wife and I are back on track. Thank you, genuinely.

Thank you to the kind user who helped me figure out how to create this update post.",706,16280,0.93
1832,Asshole,"My(25F) fiance(25M) has been out on extended unpaid sick leave for around 6 months. That said, he is better now and will likely be going back to work on the first. In general, he is the kind of guy who would stay up all night and sleep all day (and sleep 14+ hours) if left to his own devices. Meanwhile I can't sleep in past 10am really ever, even if I were to go to sleep at dawn. Also I get up really easily from alarms, meaning sitting up, alarm off, and light on by the second ring while this guy will sleep in past alarm after alarm. 

Before sick leave it was reasonable. He would at least get up for work. Now even though hes set his alarm for the same time he will be getting up for work he doesn't get up. I guess he doesn't see the point and to be fair he IS still on sick leave. But seriously he cant get up until after 1pm. I go in to his room and try to get him up usually 2 or 3 times every morning I'm not at work. It only works if I bring him food or turn on his light, turn off his fan, and turn off his AC. I feel like his mother, its humiliating. This morning I tried nice once and then it was ""Hey fuckhead, get up.""

I don't think this is the type of post where I'm obviously not the asshole because in his defense:

* He technically doesn't have to be anywhere until 7/1

* I'm mean

* I can be clingy and I want to hang out a lot

* up until maybe a week ago he was in almost daily chronic pain for 8+ hours a day

And on my side:

* I'm extremely resentful about the fact that I've been the only one paying for anything for ~7 months and I try really hard to bottle it up because if I mention that he gets really hurt, but fuck when I get home from work and he's sleeping or playing video games and he doesn't have time for me or cleaning I just get MAD

* Its very hard to empathize with someone for something when you have just no point of experience to even begin to help you understand what they're going through. I'm trying.

* He isn't in pain any more

* He will have to wake up at this time for work in a few weeks any ways

**EDIT: By better, I mean basically cured by the way. I should have been more specific. He has woken up in pain once over the last 10 days or so and it went away within an hour of doing his treatment. I apologize for not making this more clear.**

**EDIT 2: ""I'm sorry I called you a fuckhead this morning sweetie."" ""Oh, I didn't hear that part lol.""**

**EDIT 3: I showed him this. I am completely the asshole. He has been playing down how much pain he is still in. Apparently despite how much better it is after an hour into the day he still wakes up in a lot of pain and just didn't really tell me or maybe I just didn't understand or forgot (bad memory). I am the asshole.**

Please feel free to ask for info, but I'm trying to leave out medical and work specifics for anonymity.

So... AITA? Are we both? Are we both just trying our best in a bad situation and burnt out? Who if anyone is TA?",60,140,0.89

1834,Not the A-hole," 

My husband and two friends were out for a nice dinner in a down town area of a major city. So lots of bars, restaurants, and shopping down one major street. The place we chose for dinner was upscale. It was about an average of $25 a plate and it was nice weather outside so we decided to eat on the patio.

The place was really busy and even though we got seated at around 7:30pm our food didn't arrive until after 8:30pm. It was a really nice outdoor patio area with fire pits, a live band, a large bar, and a lot of people. There were families, couples, and old folks jamming to the music.

A group of kids started playing near us on the fire pits when we arrived and continued through out the evening. There was four kids and they looked about 5 to 7 in age. They had toy cards and were throwing them back and forth to each other. Sometimes rolling them, sometimes pitching them. They were plastic and larger than hot wheel sized. The parents supervised when we first arrived but went to their table well in the back of the patio about the time our food arrived. I didn't mind the kids playing as long as they didn't bother us, but we did all remark it was weird for kids to be at a bar area, past 9pm, playing near a fire pit.

Once our food arrived they started getting more rambunctious and hit our legs and backs with the cars when they threw them. My husband turned around once to one of them after they hit us and told the little girl to stop throwing them. Two more hits to our legs later and I said ""That's it - next time they hit us - I'm keeping that car."" Sure enough, they chucked it and it rattle around underneath our table hitting a few of us. I picked up the toy car and put it on our table and went back to eating. The little girl ran up and tried to swipe it off the middle of the table and I just said ""No, you can't have it because you don't know how to not hit people.""

My friend at this point jumped up because he said the parents we're coming up from the back of the restaurant and looked pissed off that we took the kids toys. My friend gave it back to him and said ""I think this is yours."" The parents came over and made a big production of how it looks like the kids have to leave now since they can't play. One of the kids even elbowed me in the arm as his dad dragged him away. Neither of the parents apologized for interrupting our dinner or the way their kids behaved.

I am not a parent, but I was raised to be respectful of others. But, since I don' have kids - WITA? Should I have just given the car back and tolerated it?",98,378,0.95
1835,Not the A-hole,"I work hard as sole provider to my family as a 26F. We're just three, my mum who's over 60yo and my brother who's 22yo. Plus my darling pupper. 

The thing is, he doesn't wor or does anything, for that matter. Plus, he's is unable to even hold a position. He's been fired from at least 5 positions in the past 6 months because he's unable to comply to orders, or complains from having to work hard, for example. 

He's entitled in all senses and tends to steal from me. Takes my card and uses my money or steals my cash. He also eats whatever he can find at home at night and treats my mother poorly. Does not collaborate with keeping our home, and even acts offended when told he has to do something else than watching internet memes and wanking off. 

He's a leech, and I refuse to feed him in any sense. Being part of his manipulative shit or giving him literal nourish.

That means I'm deliberately buying less and less food and making sure my mum and I eat out frequently. That way I'm not obliged to give him food. I don't want to do it but he's not being responsible and I'm working up to 12 hours a day to keep my home going with an ungrateful bastards at home.

I've asked him nicely to help for over a year now. But he's not going to do it, and I'm tired of it. So I'm cutting off what's precious to him, the food. Hiding my money and getting him to see how shitty life would be if he doesn't behave and starts helping. Because I can not keep on doing this alone.

1836,Not the A-hole,"A few weeks ago my (33F) husband (37M) let me know that it was one of his coworkers 60th birthdays coming up, and that he wanted to go out for the night to celebrate.  He and a few of his coworkers (he works in a mainly male department) get together every so often and have some beers and I assume he meant that this was what was happening for the birthday celebrations. 


About 5 days before the date I was asking husband what time he needed to leave by etc, and suddenly it comes out that this is a big shindig- the coworkers wife has booked a Venue and almost 100 people are going.  I was a little confused and hurt that it seemed he’d kept this from me and hadn’t even entertained the idea of bringing me along (this would have been our first chance to get out together as a couple since our second baby arrived 7 weeks ago, and I do know this coworker and have met his wife)
He explains that the wife needed to keep numbers down and so a few of the other guys were not bringing spouses either, the only one of his “group” that was, is legitimately quite close with the birthday boy and wife.  

That all makes sense to me so I shrug it off.  THEN the day before the party, husband says “I want to tell you this so that you don’t see pictures on the internet... but one of my buddies  Jim is now bringing his wife Bonnie.  They live way out in the middle of nowhere and it’s the only way Jim will be able to get a ride home at the end of the night”.   I think “okaaaaaay” sure, I guess that sounds like it makes sense but of course starting to feel more insulted that the numbers could be flexible for her and not me?  And here’s the kicker, Bonnie just so happens to be my husband’s ex.  It’s been a bit awkward navigating social events now that our husbands work together and hang out socially but I think we’ve been mature about it and despite being pretty self conscious (7 weeks post partum and feeling nothing like my former self yet), I feel like again this makes some sense and at least the two of them won’t be drinking together as she is there to be the designated driver.

Fast forward to this morning, I had just brought my husband his Father’s Day breakfast in bed with our toddler, and was asking him how last night went.  He mentions he got a ride home and I ask who gave him the ride.  He says “Oh Jim’s sister was able to pick up a bunch of us and give us rides home”.  I ask if that means Bonnie didn’t end up going, and he says “oh no, she ended up having some drinks so couldn’t drive”.

Now, we were in front of our toddler so I kept my cool, but I am LIVID.  I feel like I was lied to about this party from the beginning, as a way to keep me from coming along.  It’s quite clear that other spouses were fine to be there and that my husband just didn’t seem to want me there.

1837,Not the A-hole,"For starters I'm around 16+ my parents got their friend our neighbor to dog sit for us as we were out of town for vacation. When i got home i first went into my room to put my phone up when i got in there my shoes (pair i did not bring with) were upside down under my bed when before we left i had left that pair of shoes under my desk. Last i checked shoes don't move on their own. Before we left on the trip i made my bed and put the pair of sweat pants and t shirt i had slept in neatly tucked under the bed comforter.

our trip today(gone for almost a week) my bed comforter was completely off the bed and my sweat pants/ tshirt was missing..... i looked around everywhere and as soon as i left my room to check the other rooms i saw my missing pants/shirt on the floor in the washing machine room.

1838,Not the A-hole,"So I had been traveling around Europe for a few weeks with my bf at the time seeing first my friends in England and then his family in France and Belgium. By the end of our time in Belgium I was feeling pretty tired of being away from home and ready to finish the trip.

Well one of the last nights we were at my bfs uncles house in Belgium he made this really beautiful dinner of rabbit stew and invited some of his friends over and planned a lovely evening in honor of us being there. I wasn't really hungry because we had been eating constantly on this trip but of course i was going to eat the stew, no problem. The problem came when the uncle asked what i wanted to drink and i said, ""Just water please."" He started to tell me he had juice, beer, soda, etc, etc, and i thought he was just making sure i wasn't being too polite and not having something i wanted so i said, ""No thank you, water is great"" because i only wanted water. But he listed off the drinks again, more forcibly this time and just stared at me. And then the vibe changed, with everyone waiting for this to be sorted out so they could start eating. 

I started to feel really weird now because i couldn't understand why this guy wouldn't just let me have water. I said no to the drink options again, more firm this time because i just wanted to move on. He again started insisting, now focusing on me having a beer, why i wouldn't want a beer, it's free beer. Since i wasn't that hungry i REALLY didn't want a beer. But now i started getting angry because i felt like my freedom to drink what i liked was being taken from me, that i had no choice in the matter. It must have showed because i could see how my bf was looking at me. Why was this guy insisting so hard that I need a special drink?! 

Eventually i felt i needed to break the tension so i joked sarcastically, ""well if you REALLY want to give me a beer..."" and he immediately put the beer in front of me, sat down and we finally started eating. I had two sips of the beer and left the rest, being too full to drink it, and the uncle gave me a face as he picked up the nearly full beer after dinner was finished. Later that night my bf brought it up and asked why i had been so difficult and didn't just say yes to a drink. I was shocked because I thought the uncle had been the one in the wrong. My argument was he asked the drink question and i gave him my honest answer of what i wanted, not knowing that apparently water wasn't an appropriate answer. But I did know that I was feeling tired of being in other people's homes, thus a tad combatative. 

Was I the asshole here? As a guest are you supposed to be as little of a problem as possible, or should the host be catering to you and accommodating to you? I can see both sides in this situation. 

Additional info: The uncle was over 50 and grew up in Colombia so I understand it could be a cultural thing. Also there was a slight language barrier as he mostly only spoke Spanish and French.",34,90,0.92

When I got here, the toilet didn't work, and it was a quick fix once I got a hold of the property manager. Then, as I'm getting ready to go out for the evening, I find several spiders. After the first I figure they're at least on pest control because this is South East Asia so I'd rather have spiders than most of the critters you can find around here. At this point I also notice that even though the A/C is set to a minimum of 18 celcius it is only just cold enough to keep me from sweating (as i type this under the covers I'm starting to sweat though)

I'm the kind of person who hates complaining to businesses, but after doing so several times for all the other things tonight, the only options as I see them are to let Airbnb transfer me or to write them the shittiest review I've ever written.

In between my own housing situations, I actually lived with the three of them for a few months in the past. I helped pay rent, which I soon found out saved them from a pending eviction.

Liz's parents were recently actually evicted after her father lost his job for medical reasons. Her mother also has had long bouts with a different cancers, so on top of the loss of income, they are both drowning in medical debts because fuck American healthcare. Less relevant, but I think still important, is that during all this, they've adopted numerous animals, bought new cars, and even talked Liz into also buying a new car from their preferred dealership. Generally, I hate when people shame poor people's spending habits, but spending habits are also taught. I grew up poor and it's been a huge struggle learning good habits, and it's been really frustrating trying to get Liz on the same page when her parents talk her into 60 month loans for new cars...

Since their eviction two months ago, Liz's parents have been bouncing between extended stay hotels while they try and save enough money for a down payment on long term housing. Meanwhile, we have an upcoming (free through school) trip to Europe scheduled. Her parents asked her if we'd be okay with them staying in our apartment for the week we'll be gone. She relayed the question to me and I steadfastly said no.

I like her parents. I think they're good people going through an awful situation, almost all of which is beyond their control. If nothing else, I'm not comfortable with anyone being in my house without us there. But there is more. Nothing against her parents, but people that are desperate tend to make bad decisions. What if I come home and find something of ours pawned? I definitely have people in my own family that would do that, and I'm just not willing to risk it. That's actually very close to how I lost my first car. Or, what if after we come back, they refuse to leave? They've already started getting mail sent here without my knowledge or permission, including a civil summons for unpaid debt. What if they try and claim tenancy? Am I going to have to call the cops on them? Start an eviction procedure? Get a lawyer? Her parents had the exact same thing happen to them with Liz's grandmother, and without any prompting, preemptively assured her that that wouldn't happen. Which just tells me it is a thought that they've had?

This apparently came to a head last night at Liz's brother's birthday party, which I couldn't go do because work.

Her parents got bedbugs, kept it secret while they tried to treat it themselves (which is more or less impossible), and they quickly spread into Liz's bedroom, then through us into my apartment before we actually noticed.

My partner and I have been together several years, living together for two. I bought our house before I met him and have always been financially independent. He pays half of the mortgage and half bills. 

We’re currently discussing moving closer to his new job. And here’s the issue: he wants his name on the mortgage of the new place. The sale of the current house will more than cover a deposit for a new one, and he says that since he’s been paying towards this mortgage, he has a right to be on the lease without contributing anything extra. 

By my reckoning, over two years he’s paid approximately 5k to the mortgage. Over five years of me owning the house, plus the deposit, I’ve paid 40k, as well as shelling out for Major house improvements that have increased the value of the property. I feel like it’s my right to ask him to contribute half of what the new deposit will be, or allow me to withdraw the ‘extra’ that I’ve paid for my own use.

Now let me be clear: we have a good relationship. I don’t expect us to break up. But I graduated 10 years ago and he’s only recently done the same (I’m a few years older and took a degree, he’s got a PhD). I work two jobs with the intention of paying off my mortgage young (he asked me why once and seemed genuinely confused by the concept), whereas he’s a lot less life ambitious. I think that if we’re buying a house together, he should contribute as much as I have—whereas he wants to be included without working for it.

Am I being the asshole? Or am I justified in feeling put out by this?",51,145,0.95
1849,Not the A-hole,"So my best friend and I got our cats at the same time (from her MIL) about a year ago. A few months later she decided she was done dealing with the litter box and made him an outdoor cat.

For the most part this was okay, but her and her hisband are both very busy with work and two children so occassionally the cat would get let in but not let out for a while. This lead to the cat pooping in the baby’s crib. 

My friend thinks hes doing this out of jealousy 🤷‍♀️ Either way, she texted me last week saying that she no longer wants the cat and that her SIL told her to leave him on the side of the road somewhere. I don’t know if my friend would ever have left him like that, but I also wasn’t going to find out.

The next day I went to her house to get the kitty.  While I was there she told me that her and her husband have decided to get another kitten because her MIL’s new cat had kittens. 

I haven’t talked to her since and have no plans to talk to her. I mostly feel justified in this decision, but I also feel like throwing away 23 years of friendship over a cat is an over reaction.

Edit: She got this cat as a kitten. Its a year old now so she got it about 3 months before the baby was born.",446,1847,0.97
1850,Not the A-hole,"So I just moved to a small suburb outside of a big city, and it sucks. I woke up super hungry because I skipped dinner last night. The only place that was open that early was this crappy diner I had been to before and had bad experiences at both times. It’s always super busy even though the food is not good, and service is always slow. Anyway, it’s a seat yourself tiny place, and I sat down. Servers walked all around me ignoring me. 20 minutes passed and no service. I started getting very uncomfortable. Finally I managed to get a server’s attention. She asked me what I wanted, but I hadn’t even been given a menu yet. I ordered coffee and water. She gave it to me and dashed off. I had to ask another table for cream. 8 minutes or so passed, and she never came back for my order. I had taken a few sips of my coffee, but I was thinking, “wow, I’ve been here for 30 minutes and haven’t ordered yet.” I felt like she was never coming back, and I’d never get my food. I’d been there so long that the Mexican place down the street was now open. I was so hungry and realized I’d get served more quickly if I just left and went there. So I did. I felt so disrespected and awkward. People who were waiting for a table were right there looking at me, and it just became so awkward. I didn’t pay for the coffee and just walked out the door. Had a wonderful breakfast at the Mexican place. So AITA for not paying for the coffee? In my defense, it would have taken forever to get the check, and I was so done with that place.

1851,Not the A-hole,"This happened in December but I just found out about it.  Today I am taking my kids to see their grandfather and I am planning on confronting my ex MIL.  So, as title states, my daughter (15) attended the party and there is a $15 secret Santa gift exchange.  My daughter and I went to an upscale store and she purchased (with her own money I might add) a beautiful ceramic Christmas tree, some Christmas tree shaped bath bombs (both items cost approximately $17 together and we still have the receipt) and she included a small painting she made to boot.  She’s no artist but, I thought the concept was adorable - it was a mini canvas with a magnet to hang on the fridge, she painted a small Christmas themed painting.  

Anyway, my daughter tells me the other day, after being frustrated with my ex MIL for not inviting her and her brother to a family picnic, that my ex MIL confronted her about the gift she gave at the party and accused my daughter of regifting/recycling the gift.  Mind you, my ex husband (father of kids and son of ex in-laws) is a dead beat, drunk/drug addicted loser who owes me $50K in child support.  

Over the years my ex MIL has said and done some shady shit and I have been suppressing my inner desire to scream at her for the last 10 years.  Example: the last time I saw her I told her we were going to stop and check out the new goodwill near their house and she says to me, “Oh, I love the goodwill but I’d never be able to wear someone else’s clothes - that’s so gross!  Aren’t you afraid of bugs and germs?”.  I wanted to leap across the room and choke her but, I didn’t.  Instead I just sat there calmly and just smiled at her.  I am a struggling, single mom, they know this.  They also know their loser son doesn’t pay any child support nor has he bothered with calling/seeing them for several years now.  

I’m going there today and I’d like to know: WIBTA if I confronted her about this today?",18,47,0.98

1853,Not the A-hole,"I met this girl at work, she seems really cool so we started hanging out some. She said she was new to the area and looking for friends so I brought her around some of my friends and it was fine. Until one day she got angry at a friend of mine for something that was really weird, and then she freaked out on that friend, freaked out on me calling/texting me blowing my phone up. She was texting crazy stuff and left me crazy voicemails, she absolutely *lost her mind.* I just completely ignored it and so did my friend. Planned on never hanging out with her again after that.

The next day she sends me this looooong message about how she as BPD and can’t control her emotions sometimes, how she just moved here because she left a treatment center, and she sends me this link about “how to be a friend to someone with BPD” which included a lot of “tips” that basically outlined how high maintenance it would be to remain “friends” with this person. I didn’t respond.

I saw her at work on Friday and she comes up to me and asks if I got her messages, I was like uhh yeah and sorta just walked away.

This morning I woke up to another loooong message about how much of a bad person I am for “ditching” her because of her mental illness. That it’s not her fault she was born with a disease and she’s doing her best to control her symptoms and I’m so mean for not caring.

I feel like, I’m not responsible for dealing with someone acting bat shit crazy because of a diagnosis. Why would it make me a bad person to not want to continue a relationship that is certain to be very emotionally taxing? We’re adults. I’m in charge of my actions just like she’s in charge of hers.

1854,No A-holes here,"My partner “Timal”  and I both live in Canada and we are in our mid twenties and have been together for four years. 

My partner moved to Canada from an African country in order to live his life as a gay man free from persecution. We have a good life here but unfortunately there are things relating to his culture and family that I obviously cannot help with. 

He misses his family terribly. He hasn’t been back home in seven years and hasn’t seen any of his family since then. 

His brother back home is getting married next fall and has invited Timal to the wedding. He told me that he is planning on going to the wedding. 

I told him that while I understand that he misses his home and family, I’m afraid for his safety if he were to go back home and I really don’t want him to go back home. 

He got kind of upset with me and said that both his brother and mom know he’s gay and will protect him and that he grew up there and knows how to navigate the place and keep a low profile. 

I said that while that may have been true, he hasn’t been home in years and he might slip up and say or do something that might get him in trouble and the rest of his family doesn’t know that he is gay. 

He accused me of not trusting him and wanting to keep him from his family. I tried to explain that I’m only asking him not to go because I love him and I’m worried for his safety.

1855,Not the A-hole,"I’m using an alt for obvious reasons. 

For backstory, I’m female and live in the U.S. I’m on dating apps and I’m finding that a lot of guys are just disrespectful. Some of them are polite and want to start an actual conversation, but a lot, maybe even the majority, are just ridiculous.

A lot of the messages I get are “wanna fuck?” or “what are you looking for?” which is their way of indirectly saying “I want sex with minimal effort”. I even have in my profile that I don’t do random hookups, but I think I overestimated how often people actually read the profiles.

After having this happen a dozen times, I finally snap. A guy on Tinder messages me and the conversation seems to be going okay at first. We message back and forth and then I don’t hear a response. That’s okay, people get busy. 

At around 11:30 pm he hits me with the “Sorry, I got busy. What are you up to? Wanna have some fun?” During our initial conversation I make it crystal clear, I’m not looking for hookups. I don’t to casual sex. So I remind him of this, and he starts negging me. “I knew you’d be a prude”, “not sure why you wasted my time”, “let’s just meet up at my house and talk and see where things go.” 

Finally I was like, “okay, but come to my house.” and then I proceed to give him the address of a McDonald’s. In the next town over. I waited for him to get close to the location, he confirmed that he was about 5 mins away, and I unmatched him.

I just reached my breaking point with shitty men who feel entitled to ENTER MY BODY. I know the right thing to do would be to not engage, but also part of me feels like he deserved it.

1858,Not the A-hole,"I’ll call my friend Beth (fake name). Beth is 21, and we’ve been friends since elementary school. We were always inseparable, and even know, we’re each other’s closest friends. Also for context, I’m a 21 year old bisexual male.

So when Beth was 16, she got into this “relationship” with this 22-year old trash dude, I’ll call Chad (16 is legal in my state, but I know, super creepy). He would encourage/pressure her to skip school, introduced her to smoking (cigarettes and weed), introduced her to alcohol. Don’t get me wrong; we were 16 and she might’ve found all those things anyways. But to say this creep was NOT a good influence on her would be an understatement. They broke up after a year because he cheated on her with his ex. This devastated Beth, but she eventually got over it.

Her next (serious) relationship was when she was 20 and dated this 17-year old high school junior. They moved in because he had a bad home life after like 3 months, but broke up after another 9 months (this was last week), because she was dating a teenager with the mindset of a 13-year old, and he was cheating on her pretty much the entire relationship. 

She was devastated about the break-up. especially after he revealed he was with all of these other girls from his school (presumably to hurt her). Her personality has changed; she’s turning into one of those “men ain’t shit” feminists. My boyfriend just left for a research program, and she’s pretty much non-stop saying things like “he’s going to cheat on you”, “all men do”.

Finally, after her last “you really think a gay man at a new environment will stay faithful? You’re naive” comment, I told her that unlike her, I can actually pick decent guys to be in relationships with. Just because she’s intent on choosing literally the worst, trashiest, deadbeats she becomes attracted to doesn’t mean other relationships can’t work out, and that if she wants a relationship to actually work out, she should start by having standards, first.

She didn’t argue or anything; just broke down in tears and left. I kinda feel bad because I know I was kind of harsh. But I do think there’s actual merit in my words. She needs to pick somebody she’s compatible with, has common interests with, and work well together with; not just some random guy that just expressed an interest in her. I really do feel like she’s putting herself in these situations. AITA for pointing it out?",79,485,0.95
1859,Asshole,"This happened yesterday. I was on my way to the mall with my husband and toddler.  There was this woman standing near us on the train that kept looking at my husband.  It seemed to me like she was checking him out.  Our entire ride lasted about 20-25 minutes and she was looking at him almost the entire time. My husband didn’t seem to notice but he’s oblivious when it comes to things like that. 

The woman got off at the same stop that we did. At this stop you have to walk up to the top platform to exit. And by this time I’m watching the woman as well. And she *still* keeps looking! At this point I’m convinced she’s trying to make eye contact.

When we all got up the stairs I decided to say something.  My husband had my daughter in his arms and I asked him if he could go refill our metro card. While he was occupied, I walked up to the woman and asked why she kept staring at my husband. She goes “Oh I wasn’t. I was just zoned out”.  I can’t remember my exact phrasing but I basically said  “Well you should probably watch how you stare at men when they’re out with their families.” After that I just walked off. 

I have this bad tendency to replay situations over and over so I’ve been thinking about that incident again this morning. Some opinions on whether I was in the wrong would be much appreciated.

*Edit: I was trying to respond to people’s questions in the comments but they’re all getting downvoted/buried, so I guess people can’t see. I explained why I know she wasn’t staring because of my child and why I think it unlikely that she was “zoned out”. I also explained why, from my perspective, it was fairly obvious my husband and I were a couple. I don’t really have anything else to add. Clearly people think I’m the asshole and that’s fine. I guess I overreacted.*

1860,Not the A-hole,"I’m divorced, and I have full custody of three kids; two boys (ages 12.5 & 10.5) and one daughter (age 8). This is the first summer we were divorced and the way the custody is for the summer my ex wife and I alternate every two weeks (the kids are with her two weeks, then me, then her again, etc).

So I have a home phone, but my ex wife does not, just her own cell phone. She leaves my oldest to watch his other two siblings occasionally and I wasn’t comfortable with him not having a way to call the outside world so I bought him a burner phone that I buy phone cards for occasionally.

Well he had several conditions that I told him of he broke he’d lose it. One was that the phone couldn’t be locked and his siblings should be able to use it (to call or text - not play games) whenever they want. Also he has to allow me to access his phone once in a while to check up on him.

So he locked his phone - specifically to keep his siblings from accessing it. I told him to turn the passcode off. A couple weeks ago. This week we went on vacation to Disney World and I noticed his phone still had a lock. I told him remove the password lock while I was watching since he hadn’t. Then while he was I noticed he had the reddit app installed. Reddit is a pretty great site but it’s nooooooot appropriate for a twelve-year-old at all. I told him to delete it and stay off the site for now.

Finally yesterday we were driving home, the first half of our drive was 7 hours and we were going to stop at a hotel for the night. His phone died half way thru the drive and he wanted to plug his phone in either where the iPad was being used (for his two siblings in the back seat) or unplug my phone that I was using for GPS. I told him no and he has never had such a sour attitude as I experienced for 3 hours. I was done with him.

And then later that night at the hotel around midnight I got up to use the restroom and saw he was on his phone hiding it under the covers. I took it from him and saw he was on Reddit (yeah I know, at least it’s not porn). He had never deleted the Reddit app and had basically pretended to delete it from me.

So I grounded him basically saying he only gets his phone while with his mom since he’s continually broken my trust with it and prioritizes over everything else.

Ironically the subreddit he was on was r/entitledparents.

Am I being too harsh? I feel guilty and he was sobbing when I took it away and told him he was grounded (he’s already a moody preteen). I know I’m not wrong but should my punishment be less severe? I mean he just plays games and Pokemon Go. It’s more about him lying and being deceitful at this point to me.

Edit 1: there have been a lot of interesting opinions with advice and perspectives for me to think about for sure. I probably won’t keep him grounded as long but will have some stronger parental controls on his phone until he’s probably 14-ish. Also it’s clear which comments are coming from parents and which are coming from kids, which I like having the perspectives but also find the divide somewhat humorous.

To add to my son’s and my relationship, we have a good one. We’re close, but he’s still clearly on the “child” side of being a preteen/teenager. We’ve been driving back today and he even apologized to me for everything and asked how he could “earn back” his phone early. I’m going to have a conversation with him when we get home and talk about a lot of points people have brought up here. But like I said, we’re close. We fish together, camp, game together, I take him to movies (just him and I even, likewise with his siblings - we have time just for each of us). So we’re at a good place this afternoon.

Edit 2: I’m going to answer a few questions here that were asked of me:

- I didn’t get a flip phone because (1) Walmart was out at the moment and (2) I wanted to see if I could trust him and I ‘want’ to trust him with a smart phone. The burner phone was only $30.

- He didn’t have the phone for the last 3 hours of our drive yesterday which meant he had no entertainment except the music I was playing and having the option of conversing with me which apparently is awful.... /s

- I want to be able to communicate with not only him but his siblings if they need to talk to me or vice verse which is why he is required to keep his phone unlocked. I even instructed him that if they wanted to call and text me he had to allow them to, but that was the only reason they get to use his phone. Not for games and etc. So there’s no real risk of privacy issues considering his siblings don’t get to use his phone as a “smart phone”. And not just in an emergency, I want them all to be able to reach me at anytime.

- I want to reiterate he currently has no social media other than the Reddit on his phone. He talks to his friends thru Fortnite mainly.

Edit 3: Well we just got home finally. I only answered questions/comments on my bathroom break stops. Also Atlanta’s road construction delayed my drive by 2 hours, eff that city.

I want to thank everyone for their opinions, comments and advice. There was some really great stuff there and it gave me a lot of perspectives. I sought out AITA on Father’s Day with this issue because I wanted some perspectives outside of my “bubble”. Everyone had a great opinion to contribute... except for that one guy.

I texted friend A and asked if she would come down there instead. She wasn’t interested but said to have fun.

1862,Asshole,"My son and daughter have both graduated high school, and after taking some time off, they're looking at colleges to attend. I have a good chunk of cash saved up over the past 20+ years for their tuition. For the sake of simplicity, let's call it $100k total, $50k for each. However, I'm not going to just give it to them willy-nilly, this money comes with a few strings attached if they choose to accept it. Currently, my kids do not know of this money or what I've got planned for them.

The plan is this: **I will pay for their tuition and room/board as long as they keep their grades up, stay out of trouble, and follow these rules:**

1. Grades must be consistently high, A's and B's only. An occasional C is fine, but repeat C's from class to class, semester to semester is not.
2. They will be required to *physically* show me their grades twice per semester: Once after midterms, once after finals. No showing me over FaceTime or over a screen-share. They must physically come to me, log into their account and show me in person.
3. If they choose to pursue a liberal arts degree, then I will give them *half* of what I've got saved for each of them. They will have to pay any extra amount themselves.
4. No out-of-state schools (unless it's Ivy League).

I will directly deposit this money into their school accounts each semester as long as they don't deviate from the guidelines. If they do not keep up their grades or fail to show me them, then their funding will be cut off *immediately*. No funny business, no excuses. If there is any amount left over after this money is spent, they will have to pay the rest themselves.

**For rule #3:** The entire point of attending higher education is to obtain a degree/set of skills that they can use to start a lucrative career. Anyone will have a better chance of landing a great job sooner with an education in marketing/technology/economics/trades than with an education in theatre/art/gender studies/etc.

**For rule #4:** Out-of-state is *wildly expensive* compared to in-state. The only reason I could justify paying out-of-state is if they get accepted into Harvard, Stanford, or something else.

My wife thinks I'm being a little too strict with the rules around this money, particularly with rule #3 and #4. She believes we should just give it to them regardless of what they want to do or where they want to go and support them 100%. I refuse to enable my kids in a way that could come back to bite them later on in life.

1864,Not the A-hole,"This is a throwaway because my brother is on reddit, I’m a guy. First, some background:

My older brother has issues gambling. In the past my parents have had to pay his rent, and 2 months ago I had to give him money for a car payment because he’d fallen too far behind. We’ve never had the best relationship, but I’ve got a good job and so does my husband. We’ve just built a 2-bedroom “pool house” (basically a granny flat next to our pool). 

My brother recently lost his job because he kept going to the pub at lunch and playing the poker machines. I think he is an addict but my parents and him refuse to believe it. He didn’t tell anyone he’d lost his job, only when he got notice he was being evicted for not paying rent. My parents can’t afford to bail him out again, and I don’t particularly want to because I know in the long run he’ll do the same thing again. Now to the issue 

My parents suggested he move into the flat out the back of my house, which I do not really want. He has said very homophobic things to me in the past and my husband isn’t keen on him because of it. But, he is my brother, and so I said I would let him move in on the following conditions: 

1) you look for a job every day once you get one, you’ll be paying rent 
3) keep the flat clean 
4) you get my permission before anyone comes over 
5) you do not go to a pub or rsl and use poker machines, and you don’t use betting apps. 
6) you respect my husband and help him around the yard etc if he asks 

I was especially hard on the last 2 points. I said if he  so much as looks at a poker machine, he’s out of the flat. My brother got super annoyed about this, and my parents told me I wasn’t acting like a brother, and I should just let him move in until he “gets back on his feet”. It caused a big argument and now they aren’t speaking to me. 

So AITA? I want to help, but I feel like just bailing him out all the time and giving him shit for free isn’t helping

1865,Asshole,"I’m getting married in a few months and just sent the official invites out. We were trying to keep it to 150 guests attending, but ended up with over 200 on the invite list. That being said, I’m being a bit picky with who gets a plus one. Thus far, people who don’t have a significant other and would know other people at the wedding have not gotten a plus one. Aside from one “friend” who has a long-term BF (and I use the term friend loosely here).

I’ve known this girl my whole life as she is a good friend of my older sister. But I’ve always disliked her. She’s negative, rude, and the type of person who always has to “one up” everything you say. She has been in a long-term relationship with her boyfriend for ~7 years and they live together, but I’ve never even met him. And she cheats on him every chance she gets.

She has openly stated that she would “stop cheating if he finally proposed” and brags about her cheating, which is literally every weekend and with multiple guys. She cheated most often with another friend who is invited to the wedding - although complained that it has stopped since he got a girlfriend (and I gave him a plus one for her lol).

She complained to my sister recently about not receiving a plus one when the guy she cheated with did, and that it’s not fair. Honestly, if it wasn’t for my sister, I wouldn’t have even invited her to begin with. AITA for not giving her a plus one?

This is a hotly departed topic. Usually my answer is that as long as you check for a drink and do it slowly it’s fine, and my response to “it sucks to lose space” is “well, then they can recline theirs,” but the rear row can’t. However, I believe this specific rear row appears to have more room than us - meaning my reclining would put them with the same amount of room, not less than other people have.   

So, Reddit - AITA if I recline my seat? I’ll see you after the flight to find out!

Update: I should’ve said WIBTA...and according to half of you, I am! I reclined because the people behind me had more room (weird, I guess they gave next to bathroom seats a perk to make up for it,) didn’t have drinks, and weren’t tall. I honestly wanted an opinion on if this - with all of those things considered, which I always check for - would’ve been asshole behavior. Many mentioned these in their judgements as to why it’s an asshole move.

1867,Not the A-hole,"Hey /r/amitheasshole, long time first time.

My Mom (65) and I (25M) live in a house in a small quiet town. Last night at about 10:30 pm I was falling asleep when I suddenly hear a woman screaming bloody murder. Or so I thought, it was actually just a bottle rocket. It yanked me right out of that pre-sleep mind drifting kind of shit that happens. I lay there thinking about what to do, watching them walk in their yard using their phones as flashlights. I was hoping the bottle rocket was a one off and it pretty much was. They then began lighting off smaller, and relatively quieter fireworks. It was still loud and I was still angry that I had been woken up, and I was fairly certain my Mom had too.

It was a long week for me and my Mom, she had a lot of events at work and I worked somewhere close to 65 hours this week doing manual labor. Sunday is also my only day off so I was really hoping to get to bed early, sleep in a bit, and still be able to get some stuff done around the house. To top things off, this is the first Fathers Day without a Father for my family, he passed two months ago. I didn't expect people to be cognizant of it but that and it being the tenth anniversary of my friend drowning has made me more emotional than normal.

Anyway I put on some pants and stepped outside. Their plot is large and kind of wide so when I said ""Hey, it's kind of late to be setting off fireworks"" I half yelled it, like a 'come on fellas please' sort of yell. No one responded, I figured they didn't hear me. I walked over towards them and said the same thing in the same way, no response. I repeated the same steps as above and finally someone said ""We won't be setting anymore off"" I said ""Cool, thanks"" or something and began walking back inside. Someone said something about it being someones birthday but I didn't really answer because I was angry and just trying to get them stop lighting fireworks.

Was I being an asshole? Either way I'm dropping off a note today apologizing for being a grumpy old man of a 25 year old. I don't want bad blood between myself and the neighbors.",31,35,0.93
1868,Not the A-hole,"Okay so hear me out. 

Tuesday night my dad disappeared and we couldn’t find him. He turned off his location services and checked into a hotel. My mom and I went searching for him - driving all over the state we live in and we didn’t find him. The next morning we wake up to a text basically saying “I tried. Please cremate me.” At this point he had turned on his location services back and we had the hotel and called them to do a wellness check. When he didn’t respond the hotel manager called the police. They found him unconscious and barely breathing from self inflicted wounds and taking like 3 bottles of pills + a bunch of pills. He was medflighted to a nearby hospital. He’s okay now but he was incubated for like 2 days and we had no idea if he would have brain damage or if he was okay. I came home from college for only a week and took off work. I’ve since had to extend it so I could be with him. It’s been a god awful long experience and I’ve been waking up at 6 am everyday to get to the hospital to see him. 

Anyways, today he is being transferred to the psychiatric unit of the hospital to be treated and such. My mom is the only one who can visit him after he gets moved and when I left last night me and my dad said our goodbyes because we thought he was being moved that night. She’s waking up at the crack of dawn to go see him. We don’t know if he will be moved within 10 minutes of her being at the hospital or if we will have hours. I’m emotionally and physically exhausted and my mom keeps telling me things like “it’s Father’s Day and he’s being committed don’t you think you should go?” I love my dad more than anything and this week has been truly exhausting. After saying goodbye I went home and cried and painted my feelings. I don’t think I’m being completely unreasonable to not go today.",14,27,0.97
1869,Asshole,"So this goes back almost a month now to May 19th but my wife and mom are still so furious with me that my wife may divorce me and my mom may take her side over it. I need some honest feedback to help me go forward. 

I'm a huge WWE fan and I pretty much get all the PPV. Money in the Bank, there was a ton I wanted to see but it also culminates several story lines into a ladder match that I really wanted to see. It was may 19th and I made it very clear I wanted to watch the event. On May 9th my wife announced that shed been invited to a coworkers wedding and I had to go with her (by a crazy coincidence that we didn't know until we got there, the grooms mom is my moms good friend). I assumed the wedding woukd be on Saturday so I agreed. Well Saturday the 18th came and went and it wasn't until the 19th when my wife was pissed I wasn't getting ready that I was like oh shit, I can't go because of rhe PPV. She got so mad at me so I relented and went. 

It was one of those events where there I didn't know a single person besides my wife and my mom and rhe groom was sort of a dick. So after he sort of blew me off when I tried to congratulate him I was like fuck this and I got out my phone, parked myself in the corner and bought the PPV. My wife and now mom kept trying to get me away and be social and finally I got pissed and told them both to leave me the fuck alone. 

Things honest to god haven't been the same since. She says I looked like such and asshole with my phone in my face in a semi-dark room while everyone else was having fun and dancing. My mom says her friends all noticed me and commented that I must have been autistic or retarded so she's massively embarrased. 

To me I had plans, I did my part to attend and when I didn't know anyone I made the best of a bad situation to do what I wanted anyways.

Was I the asshole?


edit: 

to address the common repeats:

1. No I don't do network, my wife would come unglued if I have 24/7 access to something she hates so much. I still do PPV even though its more expensive. 

2. Invitation was only 10 days in advance because the bride claims she just ""forgot"" to send our invitation and only realized at the last minute when ""we"" hadn't RSVP'd. That's the bride and my wife's story, believe it if you do or don't. 

3. Yes it was a crazy coincidence my mom was at the wedding. But since we got a late invite and I don't speak with my mom all that often I would have no way of knowing in advance. The bride is my wife's coworker, the groom's mom is my mom' friend from some charity they work on together. I'd never met any of them.

1870,Not the A-hole,"My dad is throwing a 4th of July party for his company. It's expected to be a large party, around 100+ people. Me and my GF were planning on going, but my GF asked me if she could bring her dog (who can not be left alone or she will destroy things). I told her it wouldn't be a good idea, but she asked me to ask my dad if it would be okay. I flat out refused which upset my GF. But, let me tell you why I refused. 

A little backstory, my dad recently adopted two Saint Bernards (sisters) that are aggressive towards other dogs. They already attacked 4 dogs that I know of that were family friend dogs, and my dad isn't doing anything about training them. He claims that ""they don't do anything if I'm there watching"", but from the stories I've heard that doesn't seem accurate. My dad is the type to expect that everything will work out in the end, no matter what happens. So if I had asked him if we could bring my GF's dog, I know he would have said yes.

So, the reason I told my GF no is because I really don't want to have to spend the entire evening keeping track of where the dogs are. I'd also really rather not deal with breaking up a dog fight between 3 large dogs, because I know the responsibility would fall on me. Plus, if that does happen, I feel it would cast a negative light on my dad since he's planning on having clients there too. My GF is still upset with me and doesn't accept my reasoning.

We enter and inform the receptionist that we have a an appointment on this time and she tells us to wait for a few minutes.

Now I don’t mind waiting if I know the waiting line is long. However we were told to be there on a specific time and we were. To make matters worse, a guy comes in and asks the receptionist to move up some woman’s (A relative I assume) appointment. I go to the receptionist to ask how much longer will we have to wait, as we have been waiting for more than half an hour.
She tells me there is one patient before us which I don’t mind. Then she suddenly changes her statement when the guy (that came in earlier) glares at her and tells me there are two patients before us.

I immediately realize what’s going and I get visibly annoyed. I tell the receptionist that I have so much stuff to do and I can’t afford to wait for hours for appointment that I was already on time for! 

She starts patronizing me and tells me that I don’t know how appointments work.
So I tell her that I’m canceling my appointment. By this point mum intrudes and says she has an appointment too, imploring me to stay. I tell her that she should stay for her appointment while I take care of some errands and that I will pick her up whenever she finishes.

She gets mad and she says she’s canceling too. So we go out and mum’s upset with me and the receptionist is glaring at me like I’m some disrespectful asshole.

So am I an asshole for expecting the bare minimum and the courtesy of having my appointment on time?

Banners, signs, buttons, pins, shirts, hats, etc with slogans or symbols that cleverly convey what they want to say.

Neither of us is more for it or against it, we both are more or less just in the middle at this point. In the past we were more convinced that we needed to have children, I think mostly due to family and societal pressure that was put on us. During the course of our marriage I have had multiple miscarriages. We have spent a whopping $16,000 on fertility treatments and have had no luck in any of this. We talked about adoption, and we made the mistake of sharing this consideration with our families. Since then they basically want to talk nonstop about adoption. They bug me constantly about looking for loans and different agencies and throwing baby showers and everything else they can possibly think of. The thing is is that adoption is CRAZY expensive and we don’t have that kind of money right now, and not only that but this was a consideration for us, not a definitive decision. It’s come to the point that they bring something up everyday now about adoption. They look up tax refunds, contests for loan payments, and basically any sort of thing they can find. I don’t want to sound like an ungrateful turd. I know that they want me to be happy and that this is what they consider helpful.

When we were discussing plans for our bachelor/bachelorette plans the idea of strippers came up multiple times. He wanted to know how I felt about him going to a strip club and to be honest I flip flopped a bunch. Some days I would tell him I didn't mind and other days I would say I wasn't comfortable with it.  Fast forward to a few weeks before we went to our respective parties and I made a final decision that I wasn't comfortable with it and my SO said he'd respect my wishes.

Fast Forward again and we're now at our parties. My party was basically a house party while his was ""out on the town"".

My party eventually started getting lame and turning into us just sitting around a living room chatting when one of my friends started insisting we hire some male strippers. After some back and forth with them I made it clear that I  was ADAMANT that strippers were not okay. I explained to them that my SO and I came to an agreement (which I now realize it wasn't so much an agreement as much as it was him waiting for me to form a concrete feeling/opinion on the subject) that neither of us would have strippers. One of my friends said that I should ""still hire some strippers"" since my SO was ""probably going to go to a strip club anyways.' I explained to her that My SO ""would never do that to me"" and she dropped it. We spent the rest of the night just chatting and hanging out around the living room.

My SO called me the next morning (we were in different towns) and admitted that he ended up going to a strip club at the end of the night. I immediately got very angry and told him that he broke my trust. He said his friends pressured him into it since the night ""started to get boring"" and he was ""only trying to be a good host."" He tells me that he never got a lap dance, ""only his friends did"" and I can ""ask his friends for proof""

1886,Asshole,"  My boyfriend Cam and I have been dating since early this year. It’s been great for the most part, but for the past couple of months we’ve been having arguments about his friend Lauren. 

Lauren and I don’t really get along. She’s like a sister to Cam so I tried to befriend her when we started dating, but she was always aloof to me. She’s very friendly with other people, but whenever I tried to talk to her, she would just answer with a few words then talk to someone else or leave. She would also make me feel out of place whenever we hung out with Cam’s other friends by bringing up things from their college days so everyone would be talking or laughing about something that I don’t know. 

I told Cam how I felt but he said that I must be misreading the situation because Lauren is not that kind of person. He said that I should give it more time, that maybe Lauren doesn’t know me that well yet that’s why she doesn’t talk to me a lot. But I know that she has befriended people who were introduced to her after I was, like Arlo, Cam’s friend from his new job which he started in March. The three of them play online games for hours while she hasn’t spent 3 minutes talking to me. 

More than once I asked Cam to talk to Lauren about why she doesn’t like me, but he refused. He said that unless Lauren was ignoring me or talking shit about me, she technically isn’t doing anything wrong by not being besties with me, and it would just make things awkward between the three of us. One time I told him that would talk to Lauren myself, and he said that I was making a mountain out of a molehill.

Last Friday was Cam’s birthday so I threw a small dinner party at his favorite restaurant for him and invited our friends, excluding Lauren. I figured that I’m the one throwing the party so I should be able to invite who I want to, and I don’t want to invite and pay for someone who has shown time and time again that she doesn’t like my company and is not interested in being friends with me. 

Cam was really happy about the surprise at first, but when he learned that Lauren wasn’t going to be there, he pulled me aside and said I was an asshole for leaving Lauren out. He said I should’ve thought about how Lauren would feel if she learns that I invited everyone except her. I was shocked that he would say that when he knew how Lauren has treated me, so I told him that I just gave Lauren a taste of her own medicine and maybe now she’ll know how I feel when she leaves me out of conversations. 

Cam got really angry and said that he can’t be with someone who would treat Lauren like that. He stormed out of the restaurant and we’ve only talked once after that. I texted him yesterday to apologize and he said we should meet in person today to talk about this. I don’t even know what I should say to him.

1887,Asshole,"As a cadet squad leader at a military high school in VA, my responsibility was to manage 5 other cadets, making sure that all of them mustered on time, kept clean, and maintained a small section of the barracks, just a hallway running the length of the school. The squad consisted of myself (10th grade), some nonessential elements for this post, the former squad leader (11th grade, Carl), and the subject of my post (9th grade, Jayden, who had moderately severe ADHD). 

Apparently, the former squad leader, Carl, had never actually enforced that the squad's cleanup be properly maintained. I fixed this when I was promoted, causing Jayden to incessantly pester me about how Carl was a much better leader, mostly just because they were friends. I spent between thirty minutes and an hour each day cleaning up after Jayden, be it his blatant disregard for protocol in formations and mess hall, his tendencies to run around the school and fight with others, or just his love of pestering high ranked leaders in the school. 

I began to try and use positive reinforcement, making up contests that he was set to win as long as he could just perform at the bare-minimum standard, but to no avail. Positivity reinforcement took more work than negative and yielded no results, so eventually I switched over. By the end of the year, I had tried every punishment I was permitted, things like indefinitely cutting his room's power, confiscating his electronics, making him eat last in mess, and even preventing him from leaving with his parents on weekends, which was by no means a right at school, actually a rare privilege.

Trying to understand the root cause of this led me to talk to both him and his parents, at which point I learned he had stopped taking his ADHD meds just before I became squad leader, instead opting for ""natural management"" as he called it, nope. He just didn't want to take the meds, he thought they restrained his spirit or something of the sort. I stated that this was bunk, that was there exact job, and he needed his spirit to get some goddamn restraint real quick, but he brushed off anything I would say.

I finally gave him an ultimatum: Jayden would get back on his meds (or find some alternative method to get a grip, but meds would have been easiest), or I would stop trying to understand his situation and just rain bullshit down on him directly from my first sergeant (1SG) for the last few weeks of the schoolyear. Long story short, he didn't fix it and I made the last three weeks of school suck for him, of course I let him have finals to do what needed doing, but he had daily PT for a while, ate last at every meal, did extra cleaning, had no devices, and the only power in his room was to his lights.

1889,Asshole,"I left my husband 2 months ago. Per his job, he cannot “have” the kids. The way his profession works, it wouldn’t work out for him to keep the kids for days or even a day by himself. He’d either have to barely see the kids or get a different job. To let him be with the kids often, he comes to my house, and I have to be there too as he can get a call and have to leave immediately. I don’t HAVE to facilitate this, but I do for the sake of my kids and him.

In exchange, I’ve got wishes that WILL be respected or l won’t be so appeasing. I laid all of this out to him when I first left him. My “rules” are pretty understandable

1. He is not to raise his voice at me, ever, under any circumstances.
2. He is not to smoke cigarettes at my house, or smoke right before he comes to my house. I don’t want to smell it at all.
3. His must clean up after himself at my house.

This past week I told him he needed to go to the doctor and get his hearing checked and take care of whatever the problem is, a hearing aid or whatever they suggest. Some background: his hearing is BAD and became one of the many strains on our relationship. He can’t hear for shit and he refuses to acknowledge it. It’s getting worse and it’s so, so annoying. I can be YELLING right behind him and he won’t hear me. I’m not willing to be around it anymore.

He’s saying I’m trying to use the kids to control him and I’m just going to keep finding more things I don’t like and making him change. I was like, yeah, that will probably happen. I’m not willing to deal with all the annoying things you wouldn’t fix in our marriage. Now that I’ve left you, I expect to not deal with them anymore. I explained if that’s not good enough, we can change our arrangement so that I don’t have to be around him as much and it’s not an issue. He reiterated that he needs the set up to stay how it is. So I told him I expect to be able to get a response from him when I need one.

I’m bending over backwards so the kids can see their dad several times a week, and he can stay a very active member of their lives. I expect him to reciprocate. Which means, getting his hearing checked/getting a hearing aid even though he doesn’t want to.

1894,Not the A-hole,"This is a hypothetical at the moment. I’m not married, but I am engaged. The wedding won’t be for another 3 years, for general life reasons. Even if we wanted kids, it’s not in the cards for at least 5 years.

My fiancé and I don’t want kids. There’s no reason, really. We just don’t want to be parents. We usually don’t mind telling people that but here’s the issue. My fiancé is a Southern Baptist pastor at a little church in the Deep South. His whole family is also conservative Christian, with a lot of children in all branches of the extended family. I say all this because, if you didn’t know, babies and reproducing are *huge* in the Christian church, and even just the South. Our church is 95% grandmas and grandpas who had a lot of kids, and now want grandkids and all of my fiancé’s cousins are popping out child after child. 

Even though I literally just graduated college a month ago, and he’s not graduating until the fall, everyone seems to be a little baby crazy already. I hear “when you have kids” or a variation of it pretty much at least once a month or more, and I know for a fact that those comments will ramp up to 1000x as soon as we walk into the wedding reception. We’ll be hounded by the church to have children immediately.

While we love our congregation and where we’re at, there’s no way we can tell the church we don’t want children, because of the culture there. They just... wouldn’t accept it, if not be devastated. There are no children coming to the church regularly, and many of them don’t see their grandchildren often or have any. So I know they’re all hoping that this young pastor and his wife will fill the church with babies. 

His parents don’t seem to want to accept it either, but they leave it alone at the moment. But even my own mom, who isn’t religious, says I have to have kids since it’s “something every woman should experience”. So the plan is, after a year or two, to tell people we have tried but turns out I can’t have children.

But I’m here because I’m not sure if that’s okay. It’s a really easy fix to the issue. People likely won’t bother us about it again, beyond saying we should adopt or try IVF or whatever, to which we’ll answer that we feel like it’s God’s plan for us not to have kids (which is true regardless, actually). I also feel like it’s a lot kinder for the people around us who want to help raise our children one day. Instead of us not wanting them, it’s that we can’t have them. But on the other hand, I feel like I’m exploiting something that is deeply painful for a lot of women, for our convenience. We would never tell anyone the truth, so no one would find out but still. It’s the principle of the matter in my mind.

1896,No A-holes here,"So for background about 5 years ago I met my husband L while he was on a extended business trip through some mutal friends and we really hit it off. We spent a big portion of our relationship in the us and a smaller part long distance while he was back in Russia. Long story short I ended up moving to Russia to live there with him after we got married in the states. We're back in us for a while for his work and probably will be for a few years. We're planning on starting our family and while talking to my mom about plans for baby names and such I mentioned we had picked out a girl name and a boy name, Lyubov and Alyosha. These aren't just randomly picked but after people important to us on his side of the family. My mother was very upset saying that my kids were going to be made fun of and I was setting them up for failure. She was more upset when I told her me and my husband are planning on only speaking Russian in the home if we have children while here (unless of course my family or friends visit). She said its like we're trying to make life as hard as possible on our future kids. Our reasoning was 1. If we moved back to Russia eventually (which we are planning on after a few years) the transition on our kid will be easier if they have ""normal"" names and already speak the language (plus learning Russian was one of the hardest things ive done and I don't want to lose it from misuse). 2. If we stay in the us for a longer time or dont go back they'll have ties to their heritage and be able to put having a second language down on a resume. We figure they'll learn English in school and I've heard kids will reject a language unless they have to use it like the only media in the home/having someone who doesn't speak English.
I get my mom's points about it being hard on the future kids but I thought hopefully they might be greatful when they're old enough
So reddit am I the asshole for wanting to give my kids Russian names and making their first language Russian?
(Also the throw away name is a reference to my grandma saying our kids will sound like commies lol)

EDIT: so just from reading the comments I think its important to note there is a very small chance of us staying in the us past the kid turning 3 and the child most likely won't even end up being born here. My mother just also doesn't like the idea of them having very Russian names even though it's a 99% chance they will be growing up there and having English names would be weirder.",60,31,0.82
1897,Asshole,"My daughter is 16 and ever since she was younger I would always give her responsabilities around the house, one of them being washing her own underwear. About two months ago while going into her room I noticed a pile of underwear near her bed, all of them were dirty. I washed them and when she got home I asked her about it and she told me she was too busy at school and had forgotten but it wouldn't happen again. Then, two weeks later I went to her room again and found yet another pile that was poorly hidden under the desk. This time I didn't wash them and when she got back home I asked her once again the reason and she said she had forgotten. I made her wash them and she seemed like she had learned the lesson. 

After that I keep an eye on her and sure enough, a week later I found another pile. This time I told her that if I found any more of it I would throw them in the trash and she apologized. When I did find yet another pile a few weeks later I threw it in the trash and did the same thing last week to another one. Yesterday, she finally realized that most of her underwear was gone and she threw a fit. I told her that if she wanted she could buy new underwear out of her allowance but I wouldn't spend money on it. She decided to take the issue to my husband who was aware of the problem but not the fact that I was throwing them in the trash. 

He told her that he wouldn't get in the middle of it and said the same thing to me but added that if I wanted his help then I should have kept him in the loop. Now she's fuming and barely leaves her room while my husband is being petty and refusing to give any sort of opinion. Am I the asshole?",307,523,0.9

When I ordered it, my mom insisted that she wanted to pay the remaining balance for it, out of tradition of the bride’s parents paying for the wedding.

So when I agreed to this, I was expecting her to maybe be able to put a max of $100 on my dress and then paying off the remainder myself.

1906,No A-holes here,"Let me start this by saying I’m bisexual and my husband is heterosexual. 

So today me (27F) and my husband (26M) were driving through the city to go to the store. We didn’t realize the gay pride parade was through our neighborhood and a lot of the streets were closed off which made driving very difficult.

Anyway, as me and my husband are driving through this clusterfuck we’re making jokes about all the awful drivers who are driving so erratically because everyone’s pissed off about the detours. There’s also a lot of cars stopping to like perv at scantily clad girls in the street and me and my husband are making fun of these pervs. It’s all good and we’re joking back and forth. I’d like to add we’re the kind of people who make inappropriate and not “PC” jokes from time to time. We’re an interracial couple (I’m white and my whole family is from Poland, he’s Puerto Rican) and we make jokes about race, religion, etc.

At some point as we’re driving through this I sarcastically was like “you know, why does it have to be a gay pride parade? Like why does it have to be something that fucks up traffic? I bet a lot less people would be homophobic if it was changed to like, lets pogo stick in the park for gay rights”. I know, not my finest joke or super clever but I was just making a silly comment. My husband said that’s super offensive and in the political climate that we’re in right now I shouldn’t say things like that. I was like I didn’t say it to a group of randos I said it to you and second of all I’m bisexual, it’d be the same as you making a joke about Puerto Rican people. He said it’s not the same and I shouldn’t make a joke like that ever again.

1911,Asshole,"Our daughter is in grade 10 and is the youngest in her grade by two years. She excels academically to a point that opens many doors for her, like going to highschool early. She's maintaining a 99 mark average and after doing a science fair at a local university, she was offered to begin college courses online part-time and potentially become fulltime if things work out. Her highschool IEP planner said this is not something we should give up, the outcome being potentially graduating highschool at 15 and university/college shortly thereafter at 16 or 17.

My wife and I really want her to take advantage of this opportunity, but our daughter is not 100% on board. She wants to, but doesn't want to do it right now. She wants to finish highschool, take a year off to work, and then go to college. 

This ""deal"" this university made with us is that she can take these classes free of tuition, even get a yearly stipend for textbooks and technology. She would effectively not only skip the $8,000/yr tuition but also receive about $5,000/yr in grants. Imagine being paid to go to school. This is all assuming she goes *now*, and not later. The college gets free publicity for having a (very) minor student, drawing in more potential students. The allure is in her age being so young.

Would we be the assholes for ""forcing"" this upon her? By forcing, we want to push hard for her to make this decision, but we'd never literally force her to go to college by way of consequences. If she doesn't want to, she doesn't have to, but we want to make her aware this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. This is something that gets you in the news, it gets your foot in the door for lucrative jobs, just by the fact you have a degree at 16.

1913,Not the A-hole,"My 19-year old daughter Vanessa called me this morning and told that her girlfriend proposed to her, and wants her to move to her apartment. Now for context, my daughter met this woman online, and they’ve never don’t ever SEE each other besides a few quick weekend visits. Moreover, they’ve only dated for a little more than a year. 

I told her I was happy for her, but then politely expressed my reservations. But I maintained that she was an adult, and that it was ultimately her decision.

The problem lies when Vanessa asked me for money. You see, when her older brother moved out and went to college, I decided to give him a little $500 a month stipend so he doesn’t have to worry about food (he managed to get a scholarship to cover the rest of his educational costs, so it was just the small expected parent contribution and his living expenses). That combined with the money he saved during the summers made it so he didn’t have to work at all during the school year. 

Since I gave him $500 a month every month his university was in session, that amounted to around $16,000. I told Vanessa that I was going to do the same when she moves out and goes to school.

She now says that she’s moving out and that college was on the backburner for her. Her girlfriend will support them (she is 23, already graduated, and works in IT). She said that now she’s not going to school, she’d rather just take a lump sum, or give her $500 a month too, and just not get anything if she goes to school.

I told her I cannot stop her from moving, but that money is for supporting her education only. If/when she realizes that this is a mistake and decides to go to school, or even if she decides to go to school when she’s married, I’ll be happy to contribute the money. But it’s not just a free handout.

She’s got really mad that I rejected her and accused me of favoring her brother. To her credit, her brother and I have a closer relationship (he’s always been the studious rule-follower while Vanessa was more the troublemaker), but I do love my children equally. I told her at the end of the day, that it was an *educational* stipend; if she feels like she has the independence to move out to her fiancé, then she has the independence to get a job and work for her own money. That if she ever wants to go school at any point of her life, I will fully support it financially.

Well we argued back and forth before she angrily hung up on me and told my wife. My wife thinks that we should give her *something*, but I told her that my thinking is that this relationship will fail, and I rather keep the $15,000 as an emergency blanket for if and WHEN she has to move back home. I don’t want her to think I support this decision.

She told me she sorta saw my point, but she’s not going to help me unravel this mess with my Vanessa, she’s staying out of it. I, on the other hand, think she’s acting like a spoiled brat. AITA for sticking to my guns on this?",3522,24519,0.9

My son is an average student, but has always struggled with math. We found out he has to take his written exam in math. The grade you get on your exam is based solely on that one exam, but counts as much as a final grade in any subject.

My 15 year old daughter came out to us last month and wants to go to the Houston Pride Parade with her girlfriend.

I'm still taking all this in but it seem too fast for us. Not only that, I feel it's not the best environment for a 15 year old.

Am I The Asshole For Telling My 15 Year Old Daughter She Cant Go To The Pride Parade ?


Edit:#1 Seems to be conflicting answers. Some say it's for adults only, Some say it's family oriented.
I appreciate everyone's input and apologize if my post came off as homophobic.
I didn't forbid her from going, She asked, and I told her I didn't feel it was the appropriate environment for a 15 year old and told her maybe next year. She respected our(Mom & Dad) decision.

Edit:#2 Survey says... I'm the asshole. But, I can live with that.
I'm only looking out for her safety and best interest at heart. I get I'm the asshole for not letting her go, but I'm still not convinced it's a place for a 15 year old to be. Thanks to all that have responded, it's been a wild topic to discuss.

1930,Not the A-hole,"A little background, I'm a 17 year old (girl) student, who has been babysitting for the last two years. I volunteered in a daycare for two years, so I have basic childcare experience.

In January, a mother got in touch and asked if I'd be interested in babysitting her daughter ""Lucy"". I said yes, and she said she'd be in touch. Last week Tuesday, the mother asks if I can babysit on the Thursday, I say yes and agree to be there for 8pm. She assures me that the Lucy will be asleep by then.

Thursday morning, the mother lets me know that Lucy isn't feeling well, and she gives me the opportunity to back out. I tell her that it's no problem, I've looked after sick children in the past, and she'll hopefully be asleep anyway.

I arrive at 8, and the mother leaves. They live in a flat, neighbours on each side, with Lucy's bedroom wall being the other side of a neighbour's wall. When I check on her, she sits up, sees me, and starts screaming for her mother. I try to calm her, explaining that I'm here to look after her, and that her mother is out.

Around two minutes later, she calms down, and falls asleep again. I don't contact her mother, as the situation has been resolved, and I'll tell her when she returns. However after she's gone back to sleep, there is a knock on the door. I was told that if I feel comfortable answering the door, then I can. So I do. 

At the door is ""Arthur"", who says he is the next door neighbour. He politely asks who I am, and I tell him I'm the babysitter. He voices his concerns about Lucy's screams, and I assure him that everything is fine and that she's just ill. He asks to come in and check on her, and I refuse, telling him that he is a stranger to me and so I wouldn't be comfortable. This is when he begins to get louder and more forceful, saying he thinks I've hurt Lucy. Before I close the door, he says that he is going to call the police, and report me.

I phone Lucy's mother, explaining the situation, and she says not to worry, that Arthur is all bark and no bite. I'm still shaken, but I say okay and leave her to her night. 

A little while later, there is another knock on the door. I look through the peephole, and it's a woman. She must've heard me approach, because she begins talking. She says she's Arthur's wife, and that they're worried about Lucy. She urges me to open the door, and begins banging on it, saying that if I don't let her in she'll call the police, calling me a child abuser. I, obviously, don't let her in, and she leaves after a while.

Lucy's mother gets home, and apologises for everything. I'm still shaken, but I accept the apology. She pays me £5 extra, and says that she didn't tell Lucy I'd be babysitting, which is probably why she was so distressed.

Skip to today, Lucy's mother contacts me asking if I can babysit in a few weeks. I haven't responded yet. So WIBTA if I refused because of what happened? I know it wasn't her fault, but I can't help feeling uncomfortable over what happened.

Edit: I've decided not to babysit Lucy again. Her mother was a little annoyed, (""How am I going to find another babysitter before then?"") but she did seem to understand why I didn't feel comfortable. She said that she would talk with the neighbours to ensure nothing like that would happen again.

I've officially learned my lesson, don't open the door when you're babysitting. Thanks everyone for their help. Good to know I'm officially NTA!",126,839,0.97

I'm pregnant now and it's made me hate chocolate even more, I really can't bring myself to eat it.


For some reason they decided to get a chocolate cake with chocolate fudge frosting. When they tried to give me a piece I told them I don't eat chocolate. They said since it was my birthday and they got it for me that I had to have a piece, and I refused and reminded them I've always hated chocolate. It turned into an argument with us going back and forth with them telling me I had to have some and that just one piece won't kill me, and me refusing and saying I hate chocolate and can't bring myself to eat anything chocolate that even the thought of it makes me sick. Finally I just said if they're going to make this much of a fuss over it I'm just going to leave, and went home. Now they said I ruined the party and i was ungrateful and rude for not eating just a piece of it and for leaving like that. My whole family is pissed off at me now.

1932,Not the A-hole,"I work at a day care and am responsible for pickups. One girl's father usually picks her up, but last week her mother came. I hadn't met her personally, but I checked her ID and her daughter recognized her and called her ""mommy"" so I let her go with her, which is our normal procedure. I have a list of kids who are on the ""only one specific parent can pick this kid up"" list and she wasn't on it.

A little while later, the father shows up to pick up his daughter. I was doing another pickup so he dealt with my boss, but as I understand it, my boss freaked out and said that the girl's mother had picked her up and offered to call the cops, but the father laughed it off as a miscommunication between the two of them and left. Nothing else came of it and the girl was back this week with no parent complaints or anything.

My boss is furious with me however and told me that I should have called the father when the mother came to pick the daughter up because that was different from what normally happens. I think he is overreacting because the girl was not on the list of kids to double check, and there weren't any custody issues and it was just a miscommunication. He thinks I was wrong because the daughter could have potentially been kidnapped, but I don't think I did anything wrong.

They got engaged in December and are planning to marry in August. He is wealthy for his age, but despite that he's a very sweet and grounded guy with a promising career in front of him. They are truly in love. I am going to be one of her bridesmaids.

Yesterday, I asked about where she planned to work. She said she's ""not sure"" and said that she wants to wait until after she gets married to see. With her fiance's job, there's a lot of moving around every few years. She says she really wants to start a family with him and focus on that, maybe get a part-time job or work from home (e.g. telehealth). He is also fine with this, and in fact encourages it.

I told her that it's her life and her choices, but that it would be wise if she established a proper career as well. She still hasn't gotten her license yet. I asked her if her parents were okay with her wanting to be a trophy wife, and she got offended. She said that they want her to be happy above anything, and she's not even sure if she wants to be a nurse. I said that she should at least try, given all the hard work and effort she put into getting this degree. 

She was cold with me after our conversation. I definitely angered her, but I think someone needs to say this to her. Maybe I'm just an idealist, but I find it sad that she wants to be a trophy wife instead of using her skills to care for sick people. Plus, I came from a place of genuine love and concern.

So, I have a 5 year old. Blonde hair, blue eyes, freaking adorable little guy. He asked me about a week ago if he could make his hair blue. I said, ""yeah we can do that when you get out of school for summer break."" 

Yesterday, I bought some manic panic for my own hair, and he asked me if I got blue for his hair. I reminded him that school wasn't out yet, and we weren't doing his hair until then. My husband was standing there and asked me what I was talking about. I explained, and he got pissed. He said I was NOT dying our sons hair blue and he wasn't going to have his kid walking around looking like a punk and some other not nice things. He said as his dad, he should have a say in things like that.

 I got mad too, because I have facial piercings and used to always have crazy colors in my hair, because I thought it was fun, and he shamed me into taking all my stuff out and keeping my hair natural. He says adults don't have those things and I need to grow up. He would also say how ugly it looked and stuff. I'm pretty sure he just hates that stuff in general, which is fine, but I don't. 

And I am the only one who takes care of our kids. I'm talking 100% of the time. He works a lot. I'm not saying anything bad about him, but if I'm the one who is with the kids, I feel like this IS my choice.

Unfortunately mother nature has a sense of humor because as my roommates often say: ""That's such a waste."" So you can guess the issues this causes.

I'm not the type to surround myself with friends when I leave my dorms so at least once in my daily rounds I'm stopped by a guy. The lines very from ""Can I get your number?"" to ""Hey girl, you looking fine as hell.""

I used to be nice to these random strangers after all they don't know my preferences and can't be expected to. After all they just saw me and had to talk to me. I used to let them down easy and just say I'm ace but this caused more issues. They'd ask why don't I give them a chance or i should give dick a try or even say I'm making it up.

Something had to change so, I made my disinterest obvious and my rejections short and loud. No more arguing and meekly trying to tell people that I have to go only to be ranted at about being ugly anyways.
I honestly don't feel good about it most of the time but I want to believe that it's better then wasting both of our time.

Recently my roommates have told me that I'm so mean to these guys but they just don't see it from my perspective. I understand this it's hard for guys to get the confidence to talk to girl they think is pretty but I didn't ask them to hit on me and I have the right to my own day and I don't enjoy them approaching me at random when all I want is a box of fruit snacks at the grocery store when I'm alone. 

But tell me if I'm wrong or being to hard on them. I'm not exactly satisfied with the way I'm handling this but I haven't found a better solution and if you have any tips for this I'd love to hear it.

1940,Not the A-hole,"A person who was deaf was collecting donations came up to me while I was eating dinner at a restaurant asking for donations. This charity organisation had a weird system where if you donated $10, you would be able to write your name on a card, which I assume will recognise you for your act. Although I am still studying at a considerably young age, I tried to give her the most I could possibly spare.  I decided to hand her a $5 bill, and as I handed her the bill, she had this look of unsatisfaction on her face. 

Due to me not reading the instructions Clearly, as I proceeded to write my name, the lady quickly pulls back and shows me the amount that must be donated so I could write my name. As I sat there just realising to the mistake I made, the women just walks off. No sign of appreciation or sign of gratitude she just walks away with my money. Now, I understand that $5 is not a lot of money but I am a student and to me and where I come from, $5 does many things.

At that moment, I had the suspicion that this might be a scam.  It was a conflicting thought, I believed that whatever you give should not have a limit and should be always appreciated as long as you don't give something insulting like a 25 cent coin. But on the other hand, I believed that some people who donates hundreds or thousands of dollars to charity SHOULD be recognised and appreciated. 

But whatever the thought was, I decided to take my money back. I kindly tried to call her back, and as she reached my table, I had to kindly ask for my money back. At first she didn't get what I was talking about, but when I kindly pointed to my $5, she knew what i was talking about. She pulled this really unhappy face and sort of had refusingly returned back my $5.

My brother’s gf is on this app where she posts sexual videos and people pay small monthly fee to view her content. She’s not a professional porn star or anything like that. It’s mostly just amateur solo stuff. 

For context, my brother, his current gf and I all went to high school together. But they weren’t dating then or even good friends, and I only knew her casually from my classes. Fast forward and I hear from some mutual acquaintances that this app is how she’s making her money now. I managed to find her page pretty easily and subscribed out of curiosity. I stuck around because it’s pretty good content for the price. I should note that she has like 3k subscribers and I don’t use my real name on there, obviously, so I don’t think she knows I was one of her subs. 

Okay so fast forward some more.  Somehow she and my brother reconnected on instagram or something and eventually they started dating. It’s been a few months now since they’ve been seeing each other but I didn’t realize it was serious at all. 

Anyway last night I stupidly got a little drunk and decided to call my brother and come clean to my brother about the fact that I subscribe to the girl. He already knew what she does and doesn’t care. So my drunken self kind of thought he would laugh the whole thing off...but that did not happen. Apparently he is really committed to her and they’ve even talked about moving in together at some point. 

He asked me to unsubscribe to her page. I was like “yeah ok”. But he didn’t believe I really would so he said he wanted to come to my apartment and literally watch me unsubscribe. That’s when I told him no and he flipped out. 

I said he should just tell his girl to block me if it’s that serious. But he says he’s too embarrassed to even tell her that I’ve watched and asked me not to say anything either. Needless to say, we didn’t end the convo on a great note. 

Knowing my brother he will get over this. But is it that wrong to subscribe to content that’s available to the public anyway? I wouldn’t have subscribed if they had been a couple at the time, but I was already a member *before* they even reconnected. I also already paid for this month so...pretty sure I will have access until at least July even if I unsub.

1955,Not the A-hole,"So first of all I'm Latina and I hate this term. It's something that was created by white ""woke"" people, not us, it completely goes against the grammatical rules of Spanish, no real Spanish word ends in two consonants, it's barely pronounceable and by extension can create words that aren't at all (for example if ""amigos"" became ""amigxs"") and it's becoming used in contexts where a gender neutral term doesn't even make sense. Just Google ""latinx female"" and see how many hits there are. ""Latina"" could just be used there. I remember my mom asking me about the term when she saw it once and when I told her she said that was one of the stupidest things she's ever heard of in her life.

A friend of mine recently wrote an article for some very indie local publication and asked me what I thought of the first draft. In it she made a reference to a ""predominantly Latinx neighborhood"" in the city and I rolled my eyes. When she asked for feedback i told her ""please don't use this stupid fuckig made up word"", I explained to that it's basically English colonization of the Spanish language and that she could just say ""Hispanic"" in this context (on a side note these terms are not synonyms but a Venn diagram of people in the US would show the vast majority of any who fall in one falling into the other, Latino means ancestry from Latin America. Hispanic means ancestry from a mostly Spanish speaking country. Brazilians are not Hispanic, people from Spain are not Latino, but people with ancestry from Mexico, Central America, South America and Spanish speaking Caribbean islands are both.)

She seemed to be pretty annoyed and then asked why I was so hung up on that and what I thought of the rest of the article. I gave her some other constructive feedback and she thanked me but she still came across a bit cold.

Him I’m not into spending all day texting and that I’m not looking for anything romantic. 

I didn’t hang out with him for almost two months due to schedules. Then today we had plans to go out on his boat today. I went to the grocery store to get beer and subs, and I ask him what he wants. He sends me like 81739 different text messages (all 1 word) about types of beers, ingredients on his sub. How he’s doing low carb again and wouldn’t mind a light beer, maybe even a WhiteClaw.  

Anyway, he forgot to list which cheese he wanted on his sub. I sent him a text asking him, and he takes forever to respond. So I assume he doesn’t want cheese. I mean I don’t fucking know him, I’m not going to pick a cheese he doesn’t fucking like. So I get the sub without cheese. 

I then get another 40 text messages (1-2 words) about which types of cheese he likes. He literally listed every fucking cheese: cheddar, Swiss, Gouda, provolone (best bang for your buck since it’s the most expensive cheese). So I tell him, I’m sorry I didn’t get it with cheese because you didn’t respond. 

As I’m going through the beer aisle, grabbing his freaking low-carb drinks... I realized that I was in an awful mood and that I could not hang out with this dude for 10 hours on a freaking boat.

My bff and her boyfriend are really upset because of the circumstances which he killed people under, because it isn't the same as being a murderer or having a DUI or something, but I'm not comfortable with it in any case, and I don't think I could be good emotional and mental support to someone who has been through this.

This guy is a nice enough guy and is attractive, but I politely declined and said I wasn't looking right now, and my friend's boyfriend told him my reasoning and now he's depressed and upset and they say that's my fault too.

I don't think this is a crazy boundary for me to have. I am not judging him for what he did or why he did it, I just am not the best person to date someone with that experience.

EDIT: No, I am not just assuming he killed people because he was in a combat role. He killed people. His best friend, MY best friend's boyfriend, told me he has, as part of a conversation about wanting to get him to go to a support group that bff's bf goes to for exactly this thing (PTSD from killing in combat). I don't assume that everyone in the military has killed people. My dad was in the Navy and he sat at a desk doing paperwork for his entire career.",591,1800,0.91

1962,,"My (straight) bf lives in a university dorm with 4 other male roomates. I regularly visit him in the dorm about once a week. A while ago a new roomate (I'll call him mike) arrived, my first impression of him is that he seems gay (I kept these thoughts to myself).
One day I was with bf and mike came in, they talked about something and mike said ""oh I didn't give you a hug"" and hugged bf. It seemed kinda strange but I didn't think much of it.
Then on an other day, we came back to the dorm after celebrating bf's birthday and mike hugged bf again, this time a long hug. I did not say anything either.
But then on another occasion bf and I were cooking dinner when mike approached bf and hugged him *from behind* while he was cooking, like those romantic hugs I give him. He then proceeds to say to me ""I am stealing him"" and I awkwardly say ""I do not approve"" and mike says ""I'm not asking you."" I felt upset but I didn't know what to say so I didn't comment.
The next morning I told bf I do not feel comfortable with mike hugging him like that, and he said he'll talk to him. It felt wrong to ask this because bf is straight, I am a female, and we don't know if mike is gay. AITA?

Edit: My specific words were ""I don't feel comfortable with mike hugging you ~from behind~ ""

Edit 2: The title is confusing but I did not talk to mike, I only told bf I'm uncomfortable with this.

Edit 3: They stopped hugging and we didn't discuss it any further

TL;DR: bf's male roomate hugged him from behind and told me ""I'm stealing him"", I said I don't approve and roomate said ""I'm not asking you"". I asked to stop the hugging even though we don't know if he's gay.",71,47,0.84

1966,Not the A-hole,"WIBTA Backstory- 8 yrs ago I took my son on a cruise after receiving a large amount of back child support from his dad and realizing that he had never been out of our home state. My daughter was still young so she stayed with my family in my home town with a promise that when she turned 14 I'd take her on a trip. 

Well 8 yrs goes fast and I am now remarried with a step son that my husband has custody of. We recently relocated for my new job and have mostly depleted the savings. My daughter is now asking about her trip. I asked what she wanted and her only request is to fly on a plane. Unfortunately we now have 5 people in our family and my husband is concerned that it's not fair to exclude my step son (and him). If all four of us go my oldest son is the only one left out. Flights for 5 of us leaves no $ for actually doing much of anything wherever we go. 

My step son (SS) is going to spend some of the summer with him mom and I mentioned that we could take a quick weekend trip just the 3 of us (DH, DD, & I). He is concerned that is still unfair. My thought is that every summer SS takes large vacations with his other family so it's not that big of a deal.   

WIBTA if I just took myself and daughter on a weekend trip (we could go see my dad in TX on the cheap)? Should I just wait another year until I can take the whole family? Any other ideas for how to get this girl in the air?",124,605,0.96
1967,Not the A-hole,"Just as a little background, I grew up in a very strict Christian family where I wasn’t allowed to cut my hair, ever, because “hair is a woman’s crown”. It was down to my knees by the time I escaped at 18. Ever since then I’ve either had a pixie, a buzz cut or have been totally bald, because I cannot stand the heavy feeling of long hair or all the brushing/washing/detangling after dealing with it for so many years. So that’s a big reason I’m so stubborn about this issue. Also, all of my friends involved in this story have always known me as the girl with no hair. Right now I’m bald because I always shave my head completely for the summer. 

One of my good friends is getting married in August and she chose me to be one of her bridesmaids. Everything had been cool, she’s always been the sweetest person and she showed no signs of going Bridezilla before this, until she called me up about three weeks ago and asked me if I could do her a favor and wear a wig to her wedding. She explained that she wanted all of her bridesmaids to match and that she wanted us all to look good in the pictures. I told her I really didn’t want to get a wig, and we’ve been on bad terms ever since.

All of our friends are on her side because “it’s just a wig” and “it’s not like she’s asking you to grow out your hair for the wedding, so she’s not the one being unreasonable.” And I know I can be very stubborn sometimes, which I guess is the reason I’m posting here. 

The thing is, I don’t know how many of you will be aware of this but a wig that will actually look good/realistic is expensive. I’ve already paid for a bridesmaid’s dress, new shoes, and plane tickets, as well as a small deposit for the person who’s going to do our makeup. This wedding has already cost me a fortune. I could afford a wig if I wanted to, but do I really want to spend the money on something I’ll never wear again when I’ve already spent a ton? Not really.

Also, this is going to be on a plantation in Louisiana. In August. I’m already going to be hot and uncomfortable, and a wig will make things a thousand times worse. 

My biggest reason-and this is why my friends are saying I’m the asshole-is the principle of the thing. I feel like it implies I look bad because I don’t have hair, which I personally don’t think is true. Is being bald so hideous I’ll ruin her pictures? Is she going to make her balding father wear a toupee? And I think the “I want us to match” thing is stupid. We’re already wearing matching dresses, why isn’t that enough? I know it’s “her day” and we’re supposed to make her happy, but isn’t there a line? 

I’ve offered to wear a cute headscarf as a compromise if my bald head is that offensive, but she’s not having it. I’m still in the bridal party and invited but I don’t know for how much longer, honestly. AITA for not wanting to wear a wig?

EDIT: Just to add two things: 1. She’s not willing to pay or reimburse me for the wig, in part or in full 2. Along with the headscarf I’d also be willing to grow my hair out into a pixie cut, the wedding is at the beginning of August so it’d still be really short though.",2259,14968,0.93
1968,No A-holes here,"I'm not all that religious though I'm not an atheist or anything, I was brought up Catholic but don't identify with that church anymore. One of my friends was essentially the same but she started going to a non-denominational church and started getting really into it. Recently 
she mentioned to me that she was being baptized and asked if I wanted to come. I thought that was weird because she was already baptized as a baby, but figured I could see what it was about and support her. I also checked out the church's website, they seemed pretty inoffensive, and according to my friend were pretty awesome and progressive, had open LGBT members, weren't judgmental, didn't care about how you dressed there, etc. so I figured it couldn't be bad.

So I went, and they started off with songs, I actually liked the first one. But then I saw people lifting their hands up in the air and swaying around and thought ""uh this is weird"". Then one of the pastors came up, a young woman wearing a tank top and ripped jeans and was pretty charismatic and likeable, but eventually she also started to make me uncomfortable because she was talking about things like ""Jesus rules all"" and talked about stories of Muslims and other religions becoming Christians and ""choosing Jesus over the world"". Then she introduced the people being baptized today and they all gave a short speech before and most of them just said things about how ""I'm a new person and Jesus saved me!"" I thought even my friend sounded like some brainwashed cult member.

Let me emphasize that I have been to church with my parents many times recently and also went to some weddings, I never got the same type of creepy cult vibes as here. And of course everyone cheered once the people were dunked under water, I thought this would be a solemn and respectful event. There were then some more songs and the same thing of people raising  and stretching out their hands, more cult-like behavior. I actually liked some of the songs, but wow I was uncomfortable.

Once it was all done my friend was excited and thanked me for coming. I was just happy for it to be over. She then went to lunch with me and asked me what I thought. I was trying to keep the topic away but I couldn't so I just said ""OK honestly I thought it was creepy"" and listed the things I thought were odd. My friend seemed pretty annoyed at this and told me how it's so much more progressive than the Catholic church we were raised in, there's married women pastors, and how they support LGBT people and are non-judgemental on sexuality in general. I explained I still couldn't not be uncomfortable at the stuff I saw. I stopped short of telling her I thought it was like a cult though because I knew that would actually offend her. She just went back to talking about how happy she was. I felt a little bad later, this was kind of a special day for her. Should I have just held it in what I thought about it?",50,119,0.92
1969,Not the A-hole,"Background: my stepmom is the woman my father cheated on my mother with. She was a family friend, and pretty much watched me and my brothers grow up. When we were late teens/early 20s, my parents split up because of his affair. Obviously this had a lot of nasty and long-lasting repercussions for my family.

That being said, they got married when I was 24.

Further complicating things is the fact that my dad has a degenerative disease, and will probably pass well before she does. She is his caretaker, and I am very grateful for that. For the past 10 years, the length of their marriage, I have always been polite and pleasant, participating in family activities with them, all that good stuff. Never have I been disrespectful. Things are pleasant.

In fact, her mother recently passed, and she referred to me as her daughter multiple times, told me she loved me, and spoke about how she and my father have been working for “10 years to make this a family.“

This caused me to reflect. I don’t want to be her friend. In fact, once my dad passes, I don’t want to have any relationship with her. I’m simply not interested. Too much hurt and pain and history. If I didn’t know her through my dad, she’s not the type of person I would be friends with anyway. 

So what are your thoughts? WIBTA if I had no relationship with her after he goes?  (And to be clear, this wouldn’t be some big dramatic “I’ve hated you all along, you evil witch!” More of a slow drift away...)",23,34,0.91

1971,No A-holes here,"I understand that my family is my family and sometimes you gotta bite the bullet and spend time with them... At least thats what I've been told since I was a kid.

I am living on my own and have a full time job and a life outside my family. As I get older I find that there are certain events I just don't enjoy and wish I had never shown up to.

For instance, last Christmas I went to my uncle's house to celebrate. For starters I am not Christian in any way and do not identify with the Christian religion, but they insist we pray every time even though they are really secular. It seems really fake.

They also had no control over their tiny dog who bit me twice while I was trying to get food. Once in the leg and once in the hand, the hand drew blood. Nobody seemed to do anything about the dog the whole time even though others had noticed and commented on it.

Nobody had control of their kids. It was so loud and chaotic with little kids running everywhere and banging toys up and down the stairs. They were always screaming and nobody had them sit down while we were eating.

It was really an unpleasant Christmas. I told my mom that I refuse to go to any holidays at their house and she acted like that wasn't an option.

1972,Not the A-hole,"My parents live 6 hours away and were in town for a few days this week. Since I work 9-5, and they're staying in an apartment hotel three minutes from my job by car, we talked about meeting up for lunch. I don't have a car.

One thing about my mom is she never wants to come over to my apartment. She always says ""sure we'd love to see your apartment!"" but then she always makes excuses and at the end of the trip she's like, ""well we'll do it next time, sucks that we missed it!!"". She almost never comes over, I'm always inviting them. She always acts like she's in a hurry to leave when she comes over.

Anyway we all met up occasionally but not that often for the first two days. At the end of the second day we were driving with my grandma, and she hadn't seen my new apartment. So I asked if, after the drive, we could see it. Mom says it's too late, that grandma was tired, they'd be in touch tomorrow. I said it'd just be 5 minutes. My grandma stays up super late all the time. I know they wouldn't have minded a drive that long, I know it's just because it's my apartment. She says they'll see tomorrow. I said ""do you promise to come tomorrow then?"" she said they'd ""consider it"" which I know means it won't happen, so I said ""can I please just show you for 5 minutes then now if we don't know if we'll be able to tomorrow?"".

Eventually she caved on going up for a few minutes because she didn't want to promise to come over tomorrow, and my grandma was happy to see it. They were kind of rushed, and my mom said they'd be in touch the next day around lunch.

The next say I text and ask if we could have lunch. I also say I have my grandma's birthday present at home for them to take. My mom says they just ate a ""late breakfast"" at lunch (last time I was invited, this time not). I say ""ok, tell me when you're free, I'd love to see you guys"". Then she says they're free but comes up an excuse why they can't see me. I try to accommodate, so I say I can go whenever, I'll just make up the work that evening, and that I could just follow along. Eventually she says the car is too full, I can't see them, and sends a blurry picture of the extra car seat. She says there's no way I'd fit. It was too blurry and close up to make any judgment but I didn't feel like it was full.

So I just say ok, have a safe trip, etc. but I feel kind of rejected.

Later that night she sends a picture of them in the car driving home and there's an extra person there ??? Like that I know for a fact wasn't with them when I talked to her at noon. I saw the extra person around that time, they were working until 4PM. I think she thinks I was an asshole the day I wanted them to see my apartment, and didn't want to see me and was just making up excuses. So I text her, ""enough space in the car?"". My brother called to tell me I was an asshole, I guess they talked about it. AITA?

He refused to go to the drive thru and got mad at me because I wouldn’t walk in and get his food.

1974,Not the A-hole,"My father has been sick with chronic lymes disease for over a decade. He hasn't been able to work for the last 8 or so. He has SSDI disability which gives him $700/m. He also gets foodstamps which is I think 200/m.

I have helped support him and have paid for things like cellphones, phone plan, medications and other misc expenses over the years. For the last few months I have also been paying his gf 300/m for rent.

He is also an alcoholic and spends most of his money on drinking from what I can tell.

He has been living with his longtime girlfriend for this entire time. About a year and a half ago she asked him to move out as she couldn't deal with him anymore. He did look for other places but not very seriously. I tried to help him look and we set up a few viewings but he wasn't able to make it. He said he felt sick or not able to make it. I believe it, as he does semi-regularly have seizures that I've previously witnessed (horrifying).

A few months ago we got in a fight as I again mentioned he should considering stopping or slowing drinking. He then asked me for the 300/m to pay his gf for rent that month and I angrily told him no. I have not talked with him since.

His gf texted me about two months ago saying she couldn't take dealing with him anymore and was going to kick him out. It hurt me a lot but I told her I support her decision and that she should do what is right for her. She then gave him notice to vacate and got a court order to have him leave within 60 days.

He did not find a place until the day before the sheriffs were scheduled to come and remove him. He also lost his phone again during this time and I did talk to his gf about it and shipped him a new one from amazon so he could keep looking. I am also still paying for his phone bill at this point but nothing else.

As he was leaving his gf called me and begged me to give him $500/m so he could pay for a room in a house in town. I said no I can no longer enable him and he needs to figure this out himself. If he is drinking and spending his money on that I cannot help. It was very hard to do.

Now he will likely end up on the street and I do not know how he will survive. I feel that if he ends up dead or hurt I will feel extreme guilt for the rest of my life that I did not do anything to help him. With his seizures I do not think he will do well on the streets.

AITA for not helping support my father with $500/m so he can rent a room somewhere? I am very conflicted but don't want to support him while he is drinking all the time. It is hard because his lymes disease is very severe. He was unable to work due to it even before he became alcoholic. I can understand how someone would turn to drugs if they were left physically disabled and unhappy about their life. He was also a wonderful father and even as an adult he would give me great life advice and was always very supportive of me with my own struggles.

1975,,"My wife is a self proclaimed bad gift giver. She often tells me that I'm a very difficult person to buy things for because I have very specific tastes. I do a lot of research into what I would like for a gift, and for what I give as gifts. She's always amazed at the wonderful ideas I have for gifts, and the gifts I give both her and the kids. When she asks what I want for Christmas or a birthday, I give her very specific examples of what would make a good gift for me. More often than not, however, the things she buys are not the suggestion I've given her. It's usually something similar, but not exactly what I was looking for. She does this so there is some element of surprise, so I don't know exactly what I'll be getting.

1980,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because friends know my reddit and this is the kind of family drama they don't really need to know. ANYWAYS, years ago my grandmother passed away. In her will she left the house to my dad, however she had talked to him about this and it was simply so someone had complete control over the property and she didn't trust my uncle with it. My dad agreed that any money made from the sale of the house would be split between my dad and his brother.

&#x200B;

Instead of selling it immediately, they agreed to let my cousin and his new wife move in while they got on their feet. No one really needed the money and this would help them out. My cousin and his wife did sign a contract to live in the house rent free but they had to pay utilities and property tax while there. They lived in the house longer than anticipated, so now the house is the ""cousins"" issue. There are 5 of us, myself and my brother and my uncle's 3 kids. I am technically the one that owns the house.

&#x200B;

We (all 5 of us) have finally agreed its time to sell the house. We got an offer on the house and so I called everyone up so we could have a meeting about it because I want to make sure we all agree with it since it is our house. While talking about this offer it comes out that they think it should be split 20% for everyone. Whereas my brother and I think it should be 50% for my dad's kids and 50% for my uncles kids. And the cousin that lived in the house is saying he should get more because he paid for the utilities and property tax and did upgrades on it so he wants that money back, which I also think is insane because they did all that knowing they were just ""renting"" the house so thats not on us to pay them back for it.

&#x200B;

So anyways they are calling me the asshole and threatening all sorts of things. I've talked to an attorney who looked over everything and he says I am all good and don't have to give them anything (not doing that). But I'm just wondering what you guys think? Am I the asshole for giving my brother and I more instead of everyone getting 20%?",200,610,0.96
1981,,"So a little backstory/context to start things off. I have my own place and things got a little tight and I needed a roommate a year ago. I had a friend I knew was unhappy with his living situation because he was far away from his kids (5 and 9) so didn’t get to see them often (among other things). I thought it would be a win-win, I get help on rent and he’s closer to his kids and in a nice house to bring them to that he wouldn’t have access to otherwise. He now gets to see his kids more often. Which I generally think is good for all parties involved. 

Without getting into too much irrelevant details, I only really have one problem. He goes to the bar every night. That’s fine, I don’t care that he’s there until close or later every night.  I’m a drinker too, just more from home. So you do you,  until it effects me. My problem is when he has his kids, after he puts them to sleep in his room, it’s still off to the bar. He just leaves his kids here, doesn’t ask me to keep an eye out or anything. It makes me uncomfortable knowing I have HIS kids in my house unsupervised. Often time I’m home but asleep when he leaves his kids alone here (I know because I wake up to pee around 2-3 am regularly and he’s not home).  Other times like tonight I was out all night too, and came home to him gone with the kids home asleep. Alone. Now admittedly, his kids generally sleep through the night at 5 and 9 with no problems. It’s never been a thing where they’ve woke up freaked out and been like “where’s my dad”.  But that’s not hat point. I just don’t want to have to deal with the responsibility of his kids left in my house, especially because he never asked to keep an eye on them (can’t do that when I’m asleep even if I was willing.) 

We did have a conversation about this a couple months ago, and he thought I was an asshole for even being uncomfortable with him leaving his kids here to go drink. He says it’s his kids so I have no say, and that I’m overreacting. He was drunk at the very least during the conversation. We didn’t come to any agreement. Shit gets  glossed over and we move on. Its recently been apparent that he is still doing this, and I’m still not cool with it. He thought I was overreacting and says it’s not my problem basically. Well it’s my house and I disagree with that strongly. His kids in my house is my problem whether I like it or not. 

Would I be TAH if I told him this needs to stop? Again, nothing bad has happened, I just don’t like him leaving his young kids alone in my house to go drink. I’m really just looking for a way of approaching this conversation in a way that he won’t try to be super defensive again. Of course I’ll catch him sober next time.

1983,Not the A-hole,"This happened about 4 years ago. I was there in my capacity as a mystery shopper: think of me like an undercover hotel critic that produces an internal review for the hotel owners: I wasn't leaving a nasty yelp review.

I was reviewing an upscale ""boutique"" hotel in the Hamptons, where the rooms were costing me $500 a night (not that I was paying out of pocket, but that shows you the clientele whose mindset I was trying to put myself into). The hotel was in a converted summer camp with bungalows and a ""rustic"" theme. One thing that was advertised on their website was that every room came with a grill for barbecuing. So when I came to check in, I brought some meat with me to BBQ since I hadn't done so in a while.

To my surprise, while the grills were advertised online, there was no charcoal or fuel. When I went to the front desk to ask for some, the woman running the front desk seemed surprised, and then recommended me a store nearby where I could buy some. I mentioned that it was a long walk away, and she offered to let me rent a bike free of charge to go there.

I've reviewed plenty of luxury hotels in this job, and for $500 a night I would expect them to stock charcoal so I could grill if it's advertised on the website. And if they *didn't*, they should have sent someone to a store or supplier to go get me some, without my asking. I did notice that there only seemed to be one bellman or porter for the entire hotel, and very little staff overall. To be clear: I am perfectly capable of riding a bike to the store and buying charcoal, but while I was *mildly* miffed that it wasn't available or provided to me for free (or as part of a resort fee) I would imagine the target clientele might be *more* pissed.

In my internal review, I was asked if the staff fulfilled my needs and I said no. I later polled a few other people in my industry, and people seemed split down the middle about whether it was reasonable to expect charcoal be provided, that if it wasn't provided someone should've gone to the store *for* me, and if whether or not suggesting a store and offering a bicycle for me to buy my own charcoal ""fulfilled my needs.""

I argued that if I were paying Ritz prices in the Hamptons I should've been given free charcoal or, at the very least, offered something like a free meal in the hotel restaurant because I couldn't cook my own food.",290,1733,0.93

long story short one of my wife's friends tried to have sex with me I refused as I was not going to cheat on my wife, and when I said no she tried having sex with me and I had to physically get up and leave for her to understand it was a no. 

I've asked my wife multiple times that I hate that she is friends with that woman and she seems to not care. she is telling me i can not control who her friends are and that they are her friends not mine. 

she is still hanging out with this woman and every time I ask her not to she tells me I'm an asshole, am I?

1985,Everyone Sucks,"We just married 2 months ago, but we have had sex for over a year. Before moving in together, we met twice a week and had sex once every time we met, rarely twice as he felt very tired, easy to cum and I can only cum once. However, it's hard for me to satisfy... Now, when we married, we still have sex only twice a week. This makes me really uncomfortable because I need more, but he doesn't... Or I can say he... can't afford. It's like we have sex 8-10 times a month and I can only cum 1 or 2. Already talk to him about the problem and ask if we can discuss a solution. He took the responsibility and admitted that he was... ""weak""! He said he would try but nothing has changed. He also blamed that I was also kinda hard to satisfy (my two ex told me the same). It feels like he always try to avoid talking about the problem. And one day, I accidentally asked him if I have to masturbate in the rest of my life. He wasn't angry but I felt guilty myself. He is a great man to me, and I love him very much... Only this problem needs to be concerned...

TLDR: Accidentally asked my husband if I have to masturbate in the rest of my life as he rarely satisfies me.",99,161,0.85
1986,Not the A-hole,"I worked with this guy Andy for five years. He’s arrogant, thinks he’s always right and treats lower-ranked co-workers horribly. He was ‘nice’ to me and our other co-managers, but we all knew how he’d power trip our staff ranked friends. His former co-workers from his previous jobs don’t have a lot of good things to say about him either.

&#x200B;

Suffice to say we were… *not saddened* by his sudden resignation last month over sexual harassment allegations. A newly-hired staff member, Jenny, went straight to head office HR to complain that he told her to meet him at a cafe for a ‘mentoring session’ where he asked questions about her sex life and ‘joked’ that she owes him a kiss if he can get her promoted to a higher position. HR was pissed, called Andy in for a meeting, and the next day he said his goodbyes.

&#x200B;

Andy decided to put up his own business instead of looking for another job. He has been calling some of my co-workers to help him get in touch with our clients who can become his buyers or suppliers, and one of my co-managers mentioned that Andy wants to talk to me and ask if I can introduce him to my client Frank. Frank owns a manufacturing company and Andy is hoping that I can help him negotiate a discount for products he wants to purchase.

&#x200B;

I do not want to do this at all. I have been handling Frank’s account since he became a client of our company eight years ago and I have built a great relationship with him - I don’t want to tarnish my credibility by being associated with Andy. The way I know him, something will piss him off at one point and he will act all high and mighty on Frank’s employees, or God forbid he might even harass them.

&#x200B;

Yesterday Andy called me but I didn’t answer because I was expecting that he would ask me to introduce him to Frank. When I told my co-workers about this, they told me that I maybe should consider helping Andy, and that two of our other co-workers have already introduced him to their clients.

&#x200B;

They said that while Andy was an asshole when we worked with him, he is now a man who is trying to build a livelihood to support his young children, and the kids should not be punished for their father’s wrongdoings. They also said that we should give Andy a chance, maybe he has learned his lesson and is trying to become a better person. Another friend was concerned about the fact that I still had a lot of hate for Andy even though he’s no longer my co-worker and is basically out of my life.

&#x200B;

Am I the asshole or are my co-workers just too kind?

&#x200B;

Edit: Holy shit, I was gone for 6 hours and now this is on the front page. I'm grateful to everyone who took the time to weigh in and it's a relief to me that majority think I'm NTA.

&#x200B;

I just want to clear a few things.

&#x200B;

First, I am sure that things happened exactly as Jenny said. Andy did not deny it to HR. He reasoned that he asked questions about sex because the mentoring portion of the 'meeting' was done and they were just chatting as acquaintances. Thankfully HR did not let it slide.

&#x200B;

Second, I'm glad a lot of you pointed out privacy concerns related to banking regulations. I'm sure there are official rules about this, though in my company we often forget these rules because in practice we become quite close to our clients and basically become their friends so it's so easy to call them and say ""Hey, someone is asking if he can buy five tons of pork"" or something like that.

&#x200B;

Lastly, of course I don't know if Andy can or has changed, but before he resigned he was adamant that he did nothing wrong to Jenny and that he's just a victim of #MeToo gone too far. And that's not very encouraging.",723,7969,0.92

me my siblings some cousins and friends. 


so last week my cousin died, he was a beer drinking surfing beach man who hated normal things. he always made it clear that he hated funerals and never wanted one for himself. 

after he died my family started planning his funeral much to the dismay of me and the others. we made it clear how much he would hate this and that going to a beach and spreading his ashes would be a better send off. the family refused and so me, my 2 younger siblings, all of my cousins friends and 5 of my cousins all went to the beach instead of the funeral, we drank beer and surfed in his honor. 

the family are pissed and have been telling us how shit we are and that we ruined his special day.

1988,Not the A-hole,"Some context, I just got engaged to my boyfriend. My biological father died when I was 12 and my mother remarried when I was 13. He and I have conflicting views on a lot of things, but the worst so far has been that I want to walk independently down the aisle for my wedding. 
This has been a discussion point in my family for a while. My parents continually repeat that it hurts my SF’s feelings that I don’t want this and my mom says it’s because I don’t like him. Despite not liking him, the real point of the matter is I hate the whole idea of “giving the bride away” and I’ve always gone against tradition, 
Even if my blood father were alive I still wouldn’t have him walk me down the aisle. 
His blood daughter got married in another state (in the south where he’s from) and he couldn’t attend so he uses this as an excuse to badger me and my mother about me being his last chance to walk someone down the aisle. 

Upon telling my mom about our engagement, she firstly responded with being upset that I, the woman, proposed to him, and then proceeded to text me after the phone call about reconsidering my previous stance because my SF was upset about it and that my decision breaks his heart. I stood by my initial decision saying I would not be changing my mind, this is something I’ve made my mind up on, I love them, but there’s no way I’m doing something I don’t want to do on a day about my relationship not my SF, and if he really wants to give someone away he can walk my brother down the aisle. She then responded and said “that’s fine then. I’ll try to convince him it isn’t because you hate him.” Very clearly trying to further manipulate me. 

TLDR; told my mom I proposed to my boyfriend, she not only responded upset that I broke tradition by asking him, but tried to manipulate me into changing my mind on being walked down the aisle.

I live in a non-air conditioned low rise above a bar, and next to a brewery/bar; I need to sleep with my windows open because of the lack of AC.

1995,Not the A-hole,"My wife has always been insecure about her body image. It never made sense to me since she’s incredibly attractive, but the human mind is weird I guess, and all I can do is try to be supportive and encourage her to attend therapy.

Recently her therapist brought up the topic of cosmetic surgery. Obviously I was not there to know exactly how they suggested this, but the end result is that my wife wants to get breast implants, lip augmentation, and is also considering a bunch of other procedures.

As I say I’ve tried to be supportive, but the idea of this honestly upsets me. I’m not attracted, at all, to women who get cosmetic surgery. It’s fake, it doesn’t feel real, and the whole thing is so vain. 

So I told my wife how I felt, and that if she goes ahead with this I’m worried it would end our relationship because it would kill our sex life since it would be a serious “turn off” for me.

She blew up at me for not being supportive, and trying to use emotional blackmail to “violate her bodily autonomy.”

I’m just being honest. I can’t support something that seriously disgusts me. I’m not religious or anything, I just can’t support cosmetic surgery and I’m not attracted to women that get it.

1996,No A-holes here,"My (now ex) wife divorced me about a year ago. We had been married for over 20 years. She had no interest in marriage counselling and it was out of the blue.

Since then I've started dating a 27 year old coworker. It's gotten very serious very quickly. Both of my daughters think I'm an asshole and I'm being extremely insensitive to my ex-wife for not only jumping head first into a serious relationship so soon after our divorce, but also dating someone so much younger. They've both cut contact and made no secret that they think I'm a creep for dating someone almost as young as them. Only my son is being supportive of me trying to move on.

Personally I don't think I've done anything wrong. My wife is the one that wanted the divorce, and while the age gap is big, she's also a consenting adult... If she was 20 I'd understand and think it was inappropriate. But 27? Come on.

I live in Mexico (by the south) with my roomie (25F) and my boyfriend. The three of us share the apartment expenses, such as rent and bills, me and my boyfriend smoke weed every night before we go to sleep, now we don’t do it in the living room because of my carpet and my couch so we always smoke inside my room, last week my roomie’s mom came to visit her and she’s staying with us, before she came my roomie told us not to smoke at all not even in our room since the smell bothers her mom and she does not want her mom to be nagging about it. 

After 8 days of having her mom at our apartment. We’ve decided to smoke today in my room in a small pipe, we covered the door and I put some aromatic candles and we smoked facing my balcony (that has no connection to her room at all) and she just sent me a message calling me an asshole since her mom somehow “smelled” and thinks it’s very inappropriate that I couldn’t respect what she asked me for. 
If it’s about respect her mom has been leaving a mess everywhere she goes my kitchen, my living room, my bathroom she’s super messy and dirty and she has been eating my food.

But honestly AITA here?

Edit: Good Morning everyone!!! Thanks for everyone response, the mom is not allergic to the smoke, but yes, here in Mexico is very much stigmatized for a lot of families. I do understand that the one that has to deal with her is my roomie. But she did told me this morning after I apologize that the smell wasn’t even that strong she could even tell until her mom mention it. The thing is that before I get home from work she saw one of my small pipes (hidden I don’t know how she saw it) and she was just on the lookout for the smell so she can start nagging my roommate. Bad luck for me that was the day I decided to smoke a little because I had cramps that were actually very painful lol. I still apologized and I guess we’re now “ok”",32,68,0.93

The law in our country is that the father is not required to pay child support after their wife has been re-married. I am financially well off enough to pay for my step children's school and home and food, and provide a comfortable livelihood. I asked my wife to stop taking money from her ex-husband, because I feel like she is using another person's money to take care of our family and that bothers me. She said I was being unreasonable and that her ex Husband should continue to pay support until the children turn 18 because it is his obligation, even if we don't need any of his money. my wife is now very mad at me for insisting she stop taking another man's money and using it to finance our family. AITA for asking my wife to stop taking these payments voluntarily.

Edit- Probably relevant, my wife never informed her ex-husband that she is remarried. Also, not in the USA or EU.

Edit2 - Okay based on the replies it seems I am probably the asshole here. I have apologized to my wife now and things are back to normal. how she deals with this financial situation is her business ad not my place to choose. Thanks for the advice everyone it has been very helpful.",72,71,0.94
